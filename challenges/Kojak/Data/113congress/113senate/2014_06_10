Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 409, S. \n2432, the Warren college affordability legislation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 2432, a bill \n     to amend the Higher Education Act to provide for the \n     refinancing of certain Federal student loans, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, if any, there will be a rollcall vote on the \nconfirmation of Hannah Lauck, who will serve in the State of Virginia. \nFollowing that vote the time until noon will be equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees.\n  At noon there will be two rollcall votes on confirmations that come \nfrom the Judiciary Committee. One is a judge who will preside in \nMassachusetts by the name of Sorokin, and one will preside in the State \nof Nevada by the name of Boulware.\n  Following the vote on the Boulware nomination, the Senate will recess \nuntil 2:15 p.m. for our weekly caucus meetings. At 2:30 p.m. there will \nbe three cloture votes on Federal Reserve nominations: first, cloture \non the nomination of Lael Brainard to be a member of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, then cloture on the nomination \nof Jerome H.

Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is landmark legislation. I so \ncompliment Senators Sanders and McCain for coming to this agreement. I \nhope we can move this bill expeditiously.\n\n\n                          Boulware Nomination\n\n  Later today the Senate will vote to confirm a man by the name of \nRichard Boulware to be a district court trial judge for the State of \nNevada. A remarkable man he is, extremely smart, and he is a very \ntalented lawyer from Las Vegas. His father was the first neurologist to \ncome to Las Vegas--a fine man--and his mom was very politically active \nin a lot of matters for so many years.\n  Richard F. Boulware has impeccable credentials. He grew up in Las \nVegas and attended Harvard University. He went out on his own after \ngraduating from Harvard. He had a consultancy, and he was watching the \nimpeachment proceeding that took place of President Clinton and he said \nto himself: I should be involved in understanding this stuff more. So \nhe applied to Columbia. It wasn't a walk in the park for him to go. It \nwas extremely expensive. But he is so smart. He got scholarships almost \nall the way. He graduated very high in his class at Columbia.\n  Upon graduation, he worked at Covington & Burling in New York, one of \nthe premier law firms in the country. He also became a Federal public \ndefender in New York. Since 2007 he has been a Federal public defender \nin Nevada. If confirmed, Richard Boulware will become the first African \nAmerican man to serve on the U.S. district court in Nevada.\n  I had the pleasure and good fortune to put the first woman on the \nFederal bench in Nevada. She was a black woman. She was so good. Her \nname is Johnnie Rawlinson. She was so good that in a very short period \nof time she was elevated to become a member of\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nthe Ninth Circuit. During Obama's presidency, she has always been on \nthe short list.\n  Richard Boulware will be just as good as any member of that bench we \nhave in Nevada. I am impressed with his dedication to the State of \nNevada. He has already distinguished himself as a public servant. So I \nlook forward to his confirmation today.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. President, we have all seen the old cowboy western movies that \nsaw some unfortunate character getting into quicksand--either pushed or \nfallen--and they try everything they can to get him out. It is always \nthe same scene in the movies. An unsuspecting person winds up in \nquicksand, panics, flails around, and each time he does that he gets \ndeeper and deeper into this earthy liquid.\n  Fortunately, a hero always comes to the rescue. Sometimes it is with \na rope or branch or something to pull him out of the quicksand to \nsafety. That happens once in a while but not very often in real life.\n  In America today millions of Americans are caught in financial \nquicksand and looking for a helping hand to pull them to safety. About \n45 million Americans have student loans. As their debt mounts, they \nsink deeper and deeper into financial hardship. There is more student \ndebt today than there is credit card debt.\n  These Americans who have these loans are trying their best to make \ngood on their student loans. They are working multiple jobs, pinching \npennies. But even the slightest hiccup can plunge them into financial \nruin.\n  The Bank on Student Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, introduced by \nSenators Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken, is a lifeline. Just like \npeople being stuck in the quicksand in those movies, people are stuck \nin the quicksand in real life with student debt. The bill would provide \ngraduates who are now beholden to higher interest rates with a 2-year \nperiod to refinance current student loans at 3.86 percent.\n  This legislation would allow more than 25 million Americans to \nrefinance expensive student loans. In Nevada, more than 250,000 student \nloan borrowers would save thousands and thousands of dollars in \ninterest rate fees by refinancing at current rates.\n  But the problem of mounting student loans is not limited to \nindividual borrowers. It is a problem that threatens our entire \neconomy. I had a call yesterday with a bunch of college students in \nNevada. They can't get married, they are living with their parents, and \nthey are struggling. Is it worth it for me to go to college? I spent \ntime trying to convince them that it was and it is.\n  Student loan debt now exceeds far more than $1 trillion--approaching \n$1.3 trillion. That is more than credit card or auto loan debt. As of \nlast September, 40 percent of student loan borrowers were in default, \nforbearance or deferment. Yet even as many Americans make loan payments \non time, the staggering amount of those installments precludes young \nAmericans from buying houses, beginning families or going into \nbusiness. The legislation before the Senate will give borrowers a fair \nshot in investing in their families and their financial well-being. As \nyoung Americans are able to purchase new homes and invest in their \nfutures, it will inject much-needed capital into our economy.\n  Unfortunately, not all Senators agree that allowing borrowers to \nrefinance their student loans is a good idea. I was disappointed to \nlearn my colleague the Republican leader doesn't support this \nlegislation. It wasn't long ago that he referred to this proposal we \nare taking up here today dealing with student loan debt--$1.2 trillion \nor $1.3 trillion debt and 45 million people it affects--he called it a \nfake fight.\n  For 25 million Americans, or even more, who stand to benefit from \nthis bill, I assure my friend there is nothing fake about helping \nworking families pay off debt and save money.\n  I so admire what the President did yesterday. He said that if you are \ncontinuing to refuse to legislate--and we know there has been \nobstruction after filibuster after obstruction after filibuster. The \nPresident said before the American people he was going to do everything \nhe could administratively. Yesterday he did. What he did isn't as good \nas what we are doing, but he did what he could to help 5 million \nstudents with their debt. So to a single mother working two jobs just \nto take care of her family, make a student loan payment on time, this \nlegislation is real. But instead, the Republican leader has reaffirmed \nhis commitment to the status quo. Why reform today when he and his tea \nparty-driven members said they will reform next year or maybe the next \nyear?\n  We Democrats aren't standing around waiting for a new year or a new \nCongress to tackle the problem of student loan debt. It is real. We are \nanxious to extend a helping hand to the more than 40 million Americans \nwho are fighting to keep their heads above water, trying to get out of \nthe quicksand.\n  So let's come to the aid of those individuals struggling with student \nloan debt and keep them from sinking deeper and deeper into financial \nquicksand.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. President, would the Chair note the business of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3512-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3512-S3519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF M.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will now report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of M. Hannah Lauck, of Virginia, \nto be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of \nVirginia, Leo T. Sorokin, of Massachusetts, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Massachusetts, and Richard Franklin \nBoulware II, of Nevada, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Nevada.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we vote to confirm nominees to \nDistrict Courts in Virginia, Massachusetts, and Nevada.\n  Although I will be supporting the nominees from Virginia and \nMassachusetts, unfortunately I will be unable to support the nomination \nof Richard Boulware II when the Senate considers his nomination and \nwanted to explain the reasons for my vote. As an initial matter, Mr. \nBoulware received a partially ``not qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association. Some of us on this side of the aisle have \nraised concerns over the years with what we view as an inconsistent \napplication of the ABA's rating system. I have viewed the ABA's ratings \nwith suspicion for many years. They always seemed to be harder on \nRepublican Presidents than Democrats. Because of that, I tend to \nconsider their ratings with a grain of salt. On the other hand, given \ntheir history, in my view, of treating Republican nominees more \nharshly, it gives me pause when I see a partial ``not qualified'' \nrating from the ABA for a nominee from an administration the ABA has \nbeen so aligned with on many issues.\n  Of course, ABA ratings are only one factor in my assessments of \nnominees. Unfortunately, there are other aspects of Mr. Boulware's \nrecord that concern me.\n  He has limited legal experience, especially in comparison to other \nnominees. He has only been practicing law since 2002, and that includes \na clerkship. Additionally, his entire career has been in criminal law. \nHe has no experience in any of the complex civil matters that would \ncome before him if he is confirmed.\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\n  I am also concerned that over the course of his career he has taken \nvery aggressive policy positions on a number of different issues in \ntestimony before the Nevada Legislature. For example, he has spoken \nagainst updating the antiquated paper-based pool book system to a more \nefficient system of processing voters because he believes voter \nidentification laws unfairly impact poor and minority communities. He \nhas testified that solitary confinement is a reduction of due process \nrights for prisoners. He has opposed taking DNA samples from arrested \npersons. And he has joined the American Civil Liberties Union in \nwriting letters to the legislature on several issues relating to police \nconduct.\n  If Mr. Boulware had more experience, it would be easier to give him \nthe benefit of the doubt. But when I consider the entirety of his \nrecord, his lack of experience as an attorney and his zealous advocacy \nfor many controversial policy positions, it is with reluctance that I \nwill vote no on his nomination. I anticipate Mr. Boulware will be \nconfirmed, and it is my sincere hope that he proves me wrong.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on three \nnominees to serve on the U.S. district courts. This includes Judge \nHannah Lauck, to serve in the Eastern District of Virginia; Judge Leo \nSorokin, to serve in the District of Massachusetts; and Richard \nBoulware, to fill an emergency vacancy in the District of Nevada. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee favorably reported two of these nominees \nunanimously to the full Senate and the third nominee with bipartisan \nsupport. All of these nominees are qualified to serve on the Federal \nbench, and the nominations of both Judge Lauck and Judge Sorokin \nunanimously received the American Bar Association's highest rating of \n``well qualified.''\n  Yesterday, the Senate was once again forced to invoke cloture on \nthese qualified judicial nominees, all of whom have demonstrated legal \nexcellence during their already impressive careers. With yesterday's \nvotes, the Senate will have voted for cloture on 47 judicial nominees \nso far this year. During all 8 years of the Clinton administration, the \nSenate voted four times for cloture on circuit and district court \nnominees. During all 8 years of the Bush administration, the Senate \nvoted 29 times for cloture on circuit and district court nominees. \nAfter today, we will have already voted 47 times for cloture in just \nthe last 6 months. These votes do nothing to further what should be our \ncollective goal of an efficient and fair justice system, accessible to \nall. I can only hope that Senate Republicans soon put an end to this \nobstruction. Today, we will vote on the confirmation of the following \njudicial nominees.\n  Judge Hannah Lauck has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has \nserved since 2005 as a U.S. magistrate judge for the Eastern District \nof Virginia. During her judicial service, she has handled hundreds of \ncriminal and civil cases and has presided over 150 bench trials. She \nhas served as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Richmond \nfrom 1996 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2013. She worked in private practice \nas a supervising attorney at Gentworth Financial from 2004 to 2005 and \npreviously served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District \nof Virginia from 1994 to 2004, where she worked in both the Criminal \nand Civil Divisions. She worked as an associate at Anderson, Kill, \nOlick & Oshinsky from 1992 to 1994. After graduating from law school, \nshe served as a law clerk to Judge James Spencer of the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia. Her nomination unanimously \nreceived the American Bar Association's highest rating of ``well \nqualified.'' She has the support of her home State Senators, Senator \nWarner and Senator Kaine. The Judiciary Committee reported her \nnomination favorably by voice vote to the full Senate on March 27, \n2014.\n  Judge Leo Sorokin has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He has \nserved since 2005 as a U.S. magistrate judge in the District of \nMassachusetts and as the chief magistrate judge since 2012. During his \njudicial service, he has presided over 60 criminal and civil cases that \nhave gone to verdict or judgment and 15 cases that have gone to trial. \nHe has served since 2013 as an adjunct professor at Boston University \nLaw School and previously served as an assistant Federal public \ndefender in Boston from 1997 to 2005 and as an assistant attorney \ngeneral in the Office of the Attorney General of Massachusetts from \n1994 to 1997. He worked in private practice as an associate at Mintz \nLevin from 1992 to 1994. After graduating from law school, he served as \na law clerk to Judge Rya Zobel of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Massachusetts. Judge Sorokin's nomination unanimously \nreceived the American Bar Association's highest rating of ``well \nqualified.'' He has the support of his home State Senators, Senator \nWarren and Senator Markey. The Judiciary Committee reported his \nnomination favorably by voice vote to the full Senate on March 27, \n2014.\n  Richard Boulware has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Nevada that has been designated as a \njudicial emergency vacancy by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of \nthe U.S. Courts. Since 2003, Mr. Boulware has served as a Federal \npublic defender for the District of Nevada. Following law school, he \nserved as a law clerk to Judge Denise Cote of the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York and as a litigation associate at \nCovington & Burling in New York City.\n  Mr. Boulware's nomination has the strong bipartisan support of both \nhis home State Senators, the majority leader, and Senator Heller. There \nis no question that the Senate should confirm Mr. Boulware. However, \nsome in committee raised concerns about his qualifications, citing his \nminority ``not qualified'' rating by the ABA's Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary. I note he received a rating by a substantial \nmajority of the ABA Committee of ``qualified.'' I also note that Mr. \nBoulware's ABA rating is higher than or on par with 33 of President \nBush's nominees who were confirmed despite partial ``not qualified'' \nratings, including two nominees to the Eastern District of Kentucky who \nreceived majority ``not qualified'' ratings by the ABA's Standing \nCommittee but were nevertheless confirmed by the Senate by voice vote.\n  I support Mr. Boulware's nomination without reservation and hope that \nSenators from both sides of the aisle will join me in voting to confirm \nthis worthy nominee. If confirmed, he will be the first African-\nAmerican man to serve as a Federal judge in the District of Nevada. I \nam proud to be a part of this important historic milestone and am glad \nthat the majority leader continues to make judicial nominations a \npriority.\n  There are seven additional judicial nominees reported by the \nJudiciary Committee currently pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. \nFive of these nominees are nominated to fill judicial emergency \nvacancies, and I hope the Senate will act quickly to confirm these \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of M. Hannah \nLauck, of Virginia, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The fact \nthat 18 veterans died in Phoenix alone while waiting for care is, as we \nall know, a national tragedy. This should be reason enough for \nWashington to take decisive action to reform a system that has allowed \nthis tragedy to occur and action to hold those responsible accountable.\n  Yet, as we know, the scandal extends well beyond Phoenix. In the \nwords of the government's own inspector general report, the kind of \nproblems we saw there are systemic and extend throughout the \nadministration's facilities.\n  A new internal audit released just yesterday found that the scandal \nhas spread to 76 percent of the VA facilities that were surveyed. It \nalso found that about 100,000 veterans continue to wait for VA \nappointments and that many veterans have already had to wait 3 months \nor more. This is a national disgrace.\n  I recently received a message from a disabled veteran who lives in \nWest Liberty, KY. He said he has experienced delay after delay in the \nVA system, and he is understandably fed up. He said every time he \nthinks he is getting somewhere, he finds that some VA employee has \nchanged a date in his file or posted a ``no show'' for appointments he \nwas not aware of.\n  ``I suppose I will become a casualty of the war with the VA,'' he \nwrote, ``before I ever receive a decision on my appeal or ever receive \nproper treatment.''\n  We know this is not right. That is not the promise this country made \nto our veterans, and there is no good reason to make veterans wait \nanother day longer. There is no reason for the majority leader to \nprioritize partisan bills aimed at boosting Democratic turnout in \nNovember over bipartisan legislation that is aimed at fixing the \nproblems at the VA.\n  We will have a vote tomorrow on one of these partisan bills that is \ngoing nowhere, when we know the Sanders-McCain bill is ready. It has \nbeen filed and that is what we ought to be moving to. Veterans have \nbeen made to wait long enough at these hospitals. Congress should not \nkeep them in the waiting room by putting partisan games ahead of \nsolutions. Fixing this problem is where the Senate's focus should be \nright now.\n  As the Acting VA Secretary recently said, the extent of the problems \nat the VA ``demand immediate actions.'' He is certainly right about \nthat.\n  I know the majority leader is going to have us turn to another one of \nthese political show votes tomorrow, written by people over at the \ncampaign committee, but we will have plenty of time to consider bills \ndesigned to fail later. Instead, now is the time for the Senate to act \nlike the Senate again--to be serious and more than just a campaign \nstudio for one political party.\n  Senators Burr, Coburn, and McCain have been working extremely hard on \nthe issue, along with the chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We \nall know there is no one in this Chamber better suited to tackle this \ncrisis than John McCain. He understands the experience and needs of our \nveterans.\n  We should give Senator McCain and the rest of this group the space \nand support they need to get effective and bipartisan reform through \nthe Senate. Given that their legislation contains provisions similar to \na bill that has already passed the House overwhelmingly, I think we \nwill get there as well, but we need to give the effort the attention it \ndeserves first, and that means putting the designed-to-fail bills off \nto the side for a minute because, look, this is what the American \npeople actually sent us to do--to legislate.\n  I am calling on the majority leader and the President to hit the \npause button on the never-ending campaign. Veterans have been denied \ncare. Veterans have actually died. This is an issue that deserves the \nSenate's immediate attention.\n  If our colleagues are serious about getting to the bottom of the \nscandal, holding the perpetrators accountable, and enacting reform to \nfix it, then they will actually focus on helping our veterans instead \nof worrying about saving their own seats this November.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader for his \ncomments on the veterans situation. I believe everybody in this body \nagrees, on a bipartisan basis, that we should move this bill forward as \nquickly as possible and address the real crisis. This is an issue I \nhave been talking about for a long time. No one who serves our country \nshould wait in line to get the health care they need when they come \nhome.\n  I am delighted both sides are working very expeditiously to move this \nlegislation forward, and I hope we can take that up as soon as possible \nand move it without it becoming political on either side.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Having said that, I come to the floor to talk about a different \ntopic; that is, about the highway trust fund. As we know, right now \nStates across the country are working on transportation projects to \nrepair bridges and relieve traffic on our Nation's roads and highways.\n  Kentucky, for example, has started to widen Interstate 65 between \nBowling Green and Elizabethtown. Local officials tell us it is an \nimportant project to ease their traffic and help ambulances and \nfiretrucks get to the scene of emergencies quickly, but earlier this \nyear Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear said that project might be at risk \nbecause of a shortfall in our highway trust fund.\n  A crisis in the highway trust fund could jeopardize thousands of \nimportant transportation projects--such as the example I gave in \nKentucky--around the country if Congress doesn't act. So I am on the \nfloor again to call on our colleagues to work together to avert a \ncrisis in the highway trust fund.\n  I wish to call attention to specific wasteful tax loopholes that \nCongress could eliminate to actually shore up the trust fund--loopholes \nthat actually both Democrats and Republicans have in the past said we \nshould close.\n  There can be no question that the highway trust fund is facing a \nrevenue problem. The Department of Transportation has been warning us \nfor months that it expects the trust fund to reach critically low \nlevels as early as this summer. If that happens, the Department might \nhave to delay reimbursements to our States.\n  This crisis is no longer a hypothetical. It has already caused States \nto plan for a construction shutdown if Congress does not act. In \nGeorgia, more than 70 transportation projects could be delayed \nindefinitely, according to their State officials. In North Carolina, an \nengineer from the State's department of transportation says, if the \ntrust fund runs dry, ``that essentially stops our construction \nprogram.''\n  This crisis is having a serious impact on construction jobs. If \nStates are not\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nable to enter into new construction contracts, as many as 700,000 jobs \ncould be at risk, according to the Department of Transportation.\n  The construction industry was particularly hard hit during the \neconomic downturn. Allowing the highway trust fund to reach critically \nlow levels would be another blow to an industry that has already seen \nmore than its fair share of job loss and uncertainty.\n  For all of these reasons, Congress must act to avoid a potential \nconstruction shutdown this summer.\n  In the past few weeks I have been very encouraged that Members on \nboth sides of the aisle agree we do need to replenish the highway trust \nfund with revenue. Allowing the trust fund to run dry is not an option. \nPutting construction jobs at risk is not an option. Failing to make \nmuch needed investments in our roads and bridges is not an option.\n  House Republicans have offered a proposal to cut mail delivery down \nto a modified 5-day delivery system to temporarily fund the highway \ntrust fund, but I believe that is the wrong way to go. There are better \nways to address both Postal Service reform and the highway trust fund \nshortfall.\n  But I do think there is now an opportunity to solve this looming \ncrisis in a way that actually should have bipartisan support. We all \nknow our Tax Code is riddled with wasteful tax loopholes that benefit \nthe wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations, and many of those \nloopholes that both Democrats and Republicans have proposed closing are \navailable for this fund.\n  For example, Republican Congressman Dave Camp, who chairs the House \nWays and Means Committee, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and Senator \nLevin of Michigan have all proposed eliminating the so-called stock \noption loophole. Right now corporations claim the largest tax breaks by \ncompensating their executives with stock options instead of a regular \npaycheck. That is so the corporation can skirt a tax rule that limits \ndeductible cash compensation to $1 million per year for each of a \nhandful of corporate officers. Closing that loophole alone would save \nus as much as $50 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Another loophole allows some wealthy business owners to \nmischaracterize their income as business profits instead of salary to \navoid paying their fair share of payroll taxes. Putting a stop to that \nunfair practice, as both Republican Chairman Camp and Democrats have \nproposed, could save us more than $15 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Those are just two wasteful and unfair tax loopholes that both \nDemocrats and Republicans have proposed closing. The list of loopholes \ngoes on and on. We can use that kind of revenue generated by closing \njust a few of them to avoid an unnecessary crisis, shore up our highway \ntrust fund, and make the critical investments we need in our roads and \nbridges across the country.\n  I know that for many people around the country this looming highway \ntrust fund crisis is all too familiar. For them it is just another \nexample of Congress lurching from crisis to crisis. Just last week the \ndirector of the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department said he \nreminds people that just last year Congress shut down the entire \nFederal Government. That is how he knows there is a real threat that \nCongress will shut down investments in our roads and bridges. So States \nsuch as Arkansas aren't taking any chances. State officials there \nrecently delayed 10 highway projects, and they said they might have to \ndelay even more if we--Congress--don't act.\n  So I believe our States need certainty in the highway trust fund. \nCommuters are counting on transportation projects to ease congestion. \nConstruction workers are counting on jobs to repair roads and bridges. \nI believe we should build some common ground that Democrats and \nRepublicans share to replenish the highway trust fund. Let's work \ntogether to show commuters and businesses and workers and States that \nCongress can come together to solve this crisis. I hope we will work \ntogether to prevent a construction shutdown this summer.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring any quorum calls prior to noon be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, life is about choices. We make them all \nthe time, the choice about where you are going to school, what you are \ngoing to study, what you are going to do with the rest of your life, \nwhat kind of job you want, your car, a lot of other choices we make.\n  Tomorrow the Senate gets to make a choice. It is going to affect some \npeople. Here is the choice: We have in this country a serious problem \nwith college loan debt. It has grown dramatically over the last several \ndecades. Now we estimate the total amount of college loan debt in \nAmerica is over $1.2 trillion. What does that mean? How big is that?\n  More college loan debt than the sum total of all credit card debt in \nAmerica. More college debt than the sum total of all automobile debt in \nAmerica. The only other debt larger--mortgage debt.\n  This is growing, the college student loan debt. Forty million \nfamilies are affected by student loan debt out of a nation of 300 \nmillion. So we are dealing with somewhere in the range of 14, 15 \npercent of America making payments on college student loans.\n  The amount of debt has grown dramatically. I will not come to the \nfloor and tell you what I borrowed to go to school because it makes me \nsound ancient. But I will tell you this: When I graduated from law \nschool, my student debt equaled one-half of my gross income the first \nyear, just to put it in perspective. Not so anymore.\n  What we are finding is that most students are so deeply in debt \ncoming out of college that they are making life decisions based on \ntheir debt. I get emails in my office from young men and women who \nalways wanted to be teachers. They love teachers. They want to be a \nteacher. They tell me they cannot be a teacher, because the cost of \ngetting an education to become a teacher is so high, that the starting \npay of a teacher is so low, and so they are going to do something else. \nWhat a loss for this country, when someone who desperately wants to \nteach does not get that chance.\n  Now 25 million of the 40 million Americans with student loan debt can \nget a break tomorrow morning, because we have a bill coming to the \nfloor which will allow 25 million of these student loanholders to \nrefinance their debt. Ever own a home with a mortgage? I have. You \nheard there was a lower interest rate available. You called the bank \nand said: Hey, can I knock that interest rate down from 8 percent to 6 \npercent? Yes, let's do it, because a lower interest rate means a lower \nmonthly payment, or the same monthly payment is going to pay off more \nprincipal on your debt.\n  So we are going to give college students tomorrow an opportunity, 25 \nmillion of them, to refinance their college student loans to lower \ninterest rates at 3.8 percent for undergraduate education. Currently \nmany of these students are paying 6 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent, 10 \npercent, and higher. Is this a good thing? You bet it is. For many of \nthese students, this is the lifeline they have been looking for.\n  That is one possibility. That is one of the choices: Help 25 million \nin debt. But to pay for this, if we are responsible, we had to come up \nwith a source of revenue to make up for the lost interest payments to \nthe Federal Government when the debts are refinanced. We came up with \nit. It is called the Buffett rule. It is named after Warren Buffett, \nthis seer of Berkshire Hathaway, a fellow I have come to know a little \nbit through his family. He came to us a few years ago and he said, \nsomething is wrong with the Tax Code. Here I am, Warren Buffett said, \none of the wealthiest men in America, and my income tax rate is lower \nthan my secretary's income tax rate. How can that be? Why would my \nsecretary pay a\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nhigher income tax rate than me, a billionaire? So we created what we \ncalled the Buffett rule. It said: If you are one of the fortunate few \nin America who makes over $1 million a year, you are going to have a \nminimum income tax rate of 30 percent, which at least puts you on par \nwith the people who work for you. You are going to pay an income tax \nrate at least as high as they do, 30 percent.\n  How many Americans are like Warren Buffett, making over $1 million a \nyear? How many would have to pay this new income tax rate? Twenty-two \nthousand Americans make over $1 million a year in 2009 and paid less \nthan a 15 percent effective tax rate. Okay, Senate, here is your \nchoice: Do you help 25 million students refinance their college debt \nand reduce their loan payments by an average of $2,000, or do you \nprotect 22,000 millionaires from paying more in income tax? That is our \nchoice tomorrow. I think it is a pretty easy choice.\n  I do not have anything against wealthy people. If they made their \nmoney honestly, God bless them. But I do not think it is unreasonable \nto say to the wealthiest people in America: Count your blessings, \nbuddy. You are living in the greatest Nation in the world that gave you \na chance to get rich. Now give something back to that country. Give \nsomething back to that next generation that wants to build this country \neven to a higher standard and more success for more people. That is \nwhat we face tomorrow.\n  I go around my State. I have had hearings at college campuses. Some \nof these are worth repeating. Casey Graham Barrette at North Central \nCollege up near Chicago graduated in 2010, got married, has an infant \nboy she is very proud of. She and her husband both have jobs. His \npaycheck pays living expenses, her paycheck pays student loans. She is \nworking to pay the student loans in her household. She worries about \nthe future of her family until she gets these loans paid off.\n  Joshua Schipp. I recently met him. He told me he graduated with a \nstudent loan debt of $80,000--from a good school, do not get me wrong. \nBut $80,000. His interest rates on his debt range from 4\\1/4\\ percent \nto 9\\1/4\\ percent. They could come down to as low as 3.8 percent under \nour bill coming up tomorrow. That is the range of his current interest \nrates on a variety of loans he has.\n  Joshua, at one point, said his student loan payment was $700 a month. \nNow stick with me for basic math and forgive me if I miss this a little \nbit but I think I have got it. Joshua has got a job making $11 an \nhour--$11 an hour, 40 hours a week, $440 a week, 50 weeks a year. I \nknow there are 52, but let's assume 50 weeks a year. He is making \nsomewhere in the range of $22,000 a year.\n  His gross pay of $440 times four makes that right at $1,800--I am \nrounding it off, $1,800. Let's assume after you take the taxes and all \nof that out, he has about $1,200 net that he makes each month. Do you \nremember what I said he paid in student loans? Seven hundred dollars a \nmonth. Twelve hundred dollars net, seven hundred dollars on your \nstudent loan. How could you possibly make it? That is Joshua, who stuck \nit out, finished with his college diploma, did what he was told to do. \nNow there he sits with that debt hanging over his shoulder.\n  Here is a story I know well because I met this young lady several \ntimes, Hannah Moore from the city of Chicago. Hannah got off to a great \nstart. She was not sure what she wanted to do, so she went to a \ncommunity college. Affordable community colleges, I recommend them to \neverybody. The hours can be transferred to universities. You have a lot \nof different courses you can take, and it is affordable. That is where \nHannah started.\n  Everything was going well. Then she stumbled and made a bad decision \nand did not even know it. She transferred from community college to a \nfor-profit college. For-profit colleges are different than public \nuniversities. They are different than private schools. They are \ndifferent than not-for-profit schools. They are out to make money. \nHannah did not know it. She thought she was signing up for a real \ncollege and a real education.\n  She went to something called the Harrington College of Design in \nChicago. Their parent company, Career Education Corporation, is under \ninvestigation by 17 different State attorneys general. They have got \nbig problems. They create big problems for people such as Hannah.\n  So Hannah went to this Harrington College of Design and got her \n``degree.'' Do you know, when it was all over, how much student debt \nshe had for her time at Harrington College of Design, the for-profit \nschool? It was $124,570. She cannot keep up with the payments. She has \nfallen behind. And the debt from the interest keeps adding up. She is \nnow up to $150,000, lives in her parents' basement. Her dad came out of \nretirement to try to help her pay off her college loans.\n  This for-profit college and university issue is a separate one I will \nsave for another day. But this outrageous sector of our higher \neducation economy accounts for 46 percent of all student loan default. \nThey overcharge their students and provide them with diplomas and \ndegrees which, in many cases, are worthless. But having said that, \nthere sits Hannah. Did I mention she is 32 years old and $150,000 in \ndebt, with a worthless diploma from a for-profit college run by the \nCareer Education Corporation? That is what she is up against.\n  This bill will help her some. It is not going to eliminate her \nproblem, because there is one point you cannot overlook when it comes \nto college student loans. This is not like the mortgage on your home. \nThis is not like the money you borrow to buy a car. It is not like a \nline of credit you might take out to start a business. A college \nstudent loan is in a rare category of debt and loans in America, a rare \ncategory of debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, no matter \nhow bad things get for you, no matter how terrible your circumstances, \nyour economic circumstances. You go into court and say: I have got to \ndeclare bankruptcy. They will help you with everything, but they cannot \ndo anything about your college student loan. It is with you for a \nlifetime.\n  We are hearing the horror stories. Grandma decides her granddaughter \nneeds to go to college, cannot get the money to go through. Grandma \nsays: Let me cosign the note with you, honey. I want you to finish \ncollege. The granddaughter finishes school, defaults on the loan. They \nlevy grandmother's Social Security check. That is the reality.\n  I just left a press conference where a young woman who was trying to \npay off her college student loan fell behind. Then she said: Well, at \nleast I have got my income tax refund coming back. It was claimed. She \ndid not get any of it. That is what these loans do to you. That is what \nthe collection agencies do to you.\n  So the question tomorrow morning for the Senate is: Whose side are \nyou on? Take your pick here. Are you on the side of 22,000 or so \nmillionaires in America? Do you want to protect them from paying a \npenny more in taxes, or are you on the side of 25 million college \nstudents and their families who are struggling, just like the ones I \nhave told you about? The choice is pretty clear to me. A college \ndiploma ought to open the door of opportunity.\n  It shouldn't open the door to debtors' prison, and that is what is \nhappening to thousands of students across America right now.\n  The first step here is to pass this bill. There is more to do, but \nthe first step is to pass this bill.\n  The President helped us yesterday. The President said he was going to \ngive 5 million of those paying off college student loans a chance to \nreally organize their debts and to limit the amount of money they had \nto pay out to 10 percent of their income. That gives some relief to 5 \nmillion, but we can do more. We can help 25 million, and that is what \nwe ought to do tomorrow.\n  When you go back home and talk to people around the Senate, a lot of \nthem start gazing at the ceiling and saying: I don't know about you \npoliticians in the Senate. All you do is give speeches, put out press \nreleases, and take up valuable time on television. What do you do to \nhelp us? What are you doing for working families?\n  Well, I have a speech--and it is pretty good--about what we try to do \nwith minimum wage and making sure people--women and men--are paid \nfairly in the workplace, but this college student\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nloan thing haunts me. It haunts me to think that these young people, \nwho are convinced they are doing the right thing, who are borrowing \nmoney for the right reason--higher education--are getting so trapped in \ndebt that their lives are compromised. People make speeches about, \nwell, it affects the economy. If you have a lot of student debt, you \nmay not buy a new car, a new home, get married, or have children once \nmarried because of your debt. That is all true. That looks at the big \npicture. But I can't get away from those smaller photographs in my mind \nof the people I have met in Chicago and all over my State who are \ntrying to pay off these debts.\n  It comes down to this: We have 55 Democrats and there are 45 \nRepublicans in the Senate. My job is to count votes. I think we are \ngoing to get all of the Democrats. I think every one of them will vote \nfor it. But that is not enough. Fifty-five out of one hundred is not \nenough. Tomorrow we need at least five Republicans to join us--five. \nNone of them have cosponsored the bill yet to refinance college student \nloans, but they can get into this conversation and join us tomorrow in \nan effort to help. If five will cross the aisle to make this a \nbipartisan effort, we can get this moving.\n  I know the House of Representatives has been a dead end. So many \nthings have gone over there to die--immigration reform and a long \nlist--but I sense this is different. I sense that Members of the House \nof Representatives in both political parties, if they go home, wherever \nthey live, if they have a real town meeting, if they invite real \npeople, real families, they are going to hear about this issue. Forty \nmillion Americans are living with this issue.\n  Let's do our job in the Senate. Let's pass this college refinance \nbill. Let's give these students a break, a chance. Let's do the right \nthing for them. They did the right thing and went to school. Their debt \nshould not compromise their future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I rise this morning to discuss the very pressing \nchallenge that too many of our young people are facing; that is, the \nissue of college affordability.\n  As I travel throughout New Hampshire, I continue to hear young people \nand their families express their deep concerns about the high cost of \ncollege and about their student loans.\n  In New Hampshire this problem is especially significant because New \nHampshire ranks second highest in the Nation for the proportion of \nstudents who are graduating from college with debt and also for the \naverage amount of debt per graduate. Seventy-four percent of students \nin New Hampshire graduate with debt, and that debt is an average of \n$33,000 per student. I have talked to some young people who worry that \nthey are never going to be able to get out from under that student debt \nburden.\n  We all know that obtaining a college education has been viewed as a \nstep that can propel Americans into the middle class, allowing them to \npursue goals such as starting a family, opening a business, or \npurchasing a home.\n  Unfortunately, education costs have increased at four times the rate \nof inflation from 1985 to 2011. This is a problem that has both short-\nterm and long-term implications for our citizens who want to continue \ntheir education after high school. It is also a problem that has \nserious implications for the Nation's economy. According to the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, approximately 40 million \nAmericans hold more than $1.2 trillion in student loan debt. The agency \nalso indicates that student loan debt has exceeded credit card debt in \nthe country and is exceeded only by home mortgages in terms of total \namount of debt. So we have more student loan debt than credit card \ndebt, and only home mortgages exceed the student loan debt.\n  While Americans are struggling to pay back this staggering debt, it \nis projected that the Federal Government will earn $66 billion in \nprofits from its role in student lending between 2007 and 2012. That is \njust not right.\n  Clearly it is time for Congress to take action to help individuals \nwith student debt. It is time to help them reclaim their American \ndream, to help them have a chance at pursuing the goals that drove them \nto college in the first place.\n  To this end I am very pleased to join with so many of my colleagues \nin supporting the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. This \nlegislation would allow eligible borrowers who took out student loans \nbefore July 1, 2013, to refinance those loans at rates currently being \noffered to new borrowers.\n  It is clear that Congress needs to come together to work to reduce \nthe cost of college for aspiring students throughout the country, but \nwe also need to provide relief to those who have already borrowed to \npursue their education, many of whom have interest rates for their \nstudent loans that are much higher than they would be if they were \npurchasing a home or a car.\n  This action is also way overdue. The extent to which young people are \nfeeling this pressure really came home to me when I visited a veteran \nfrom New Hampshire named Calvin, who served in Afghanistan. I first met \nCalvin at Walter Reed Medical Center, where he was recovering after \nlosing his leg from stepping on an IED. He was married, had a young \nchild, and he was talking about the challenges he faced after he \nrecovered from his injuries. But what impressed me the most was his No. \n1 concern was how he and his wife were going to repay their student \nloans. That is why I think we have to do something about this problem. \nWe have to make sure young people such as Calvin don't spend their \nprofessional lives worrying about how to pay back student loans.\n  I plan to file an amendment today as we take up the Bank on Students \nEmergency Loan Refinancing Act that will address the challenge young \npeople have as they look at how to keep track of their student loans. I \nthink they need to have a portal that gives them a one-stop shop so \nthey can view all of their student loan information, public and \nprivate, in one central online location.\n  I have heard stories from young people in New Hampshire about this \nconcern, from people like Kim, who is from Nashua. She is a 30-year-old \nwoman, and she has student debt from obtaining her bachelor's and two \nmaster's degrees. Her student loan payments cost her more per month \nthan a home mortgage. She recently found a job that is helping her make \nher loan payments, but before she got that offer she felt overwhelmed \nby her debt and she found it difficult to communicate and work with her \nlenders.\n  By providing a one-stop online shop for debt management, the \namendment I will be offering will give people like Kim an easier way to \ntrack and understand their loans and their repayment options.\n  I am pleased that just yesterday the President announced a number of \ninitiatives to help borrowers, including plans similar to the \nprovisions in my Simplifying Access to Student Loan Information Act, so \nwe can encourage the use of innovative methods to communicate with \nborrowers, but as we all know, we need to do more in this Congress to \nensure that we can help borrowers who are struggling to repay their \nstudent loans.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Warren, for her work \non this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with her and my \nother colleagues to ensure that student loan borrowers finally see some \nrelief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as every Member of Congress knows, \nAmericans are hurting, and after 5\\1/2\\ years of the Obama economy, \nthey are getting pretty discouraged, as a recent CNN poll reported.\n  That ``pessimism,'' Erin Currier, director of the Economic Mobility \nProject at the Pew Charitable Trusts, stated in a recent CNNMoney \narticle, ``is reflective of the financial realities a lot of families \nare facing. They are treading water, but their income is not \ntranslating into solid financial security.''\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have responded to the economic \ninstability facing so many Americans by essentially doing nothing. \nInstead of legislation to create jobs and expand opportunity, Democrats \nhave tied up the Senate this year with politically motivated show votes \ndesigned to go nowhere.\n  Back in March the New York Times reported that Democrats planned to \nspend the spring and summer on messaging votes ``timed to coincide with \ncampaign-style trips by President Obama.''\n  The Times reported:\n\n       . . . Democrats concede that making new laws is not really \n     the point. Rather, they are trying to force Republicans to \n     vote against them.\n\n  Democrats have certainly been following that playbook. This week, in \ntheir latest election-year political stunt, they will take up a \ndesigned-to-fail student loan bill. According to plan, it will be \naccompanied by some ``campaign-style'' stops by President Obama.\n  The Democrats' bill would do nothing to make college more affordable \nor reduce the amount of money students have to borrow, and it would do \nnothing to address the real problem facing recent college graduates; \nthat is, the lack of jobs.\n  The Democrats' student loan bill would provide some former students \nwith old loans a taxpayer subsidy which, based on Congressional \nResearch data, would be worth about $1 a day. To provide this, their \nbill would raise income taxes by $72 billion.\n  Meanwhile, Democrats have conveniently ignored the fact that student \nloan repayment plans that could lower monthly payments by more than \ntheir proposal are already available to all students with Federal \nloans.\n  Republicans have student debt solutions, such as simplifying the \nstudent loan process so more students can take advantage of the \naffordable repayment options that already exist in current law, but \nyoung Americans need a lot more than student debt solutions. The best \nthing we can do for graduates is to help create jobs.\n  Young people in particular are suffering in the Obama economy. The \ncurrent unemployment rate for those 16 to 24 years old is 13.2 \npercent--more than twice the national average. Unemployment among those \n16 to 34 years old is 9.2 percent--significantly higher than the \noverall unemployment rate of 6.3 percent. Nationally, 6.1 million 18- \nto 24-year-olds are living below the poverty line, and 36 percent of \nyoung adults are living at home with their parents.\n  It is no wonder that CNNMoney reports that ``young adults, age 18 to \n34, are most likely to feel the [American] dream is unattainable.''\n  What young people need is not a government subsidy but access to \njobs, good-paying, full-time jobs with the opportunity for advancement, \nbut those jobs are few and far between in the Obama economy.\n  While young people may be having the hardest time finding jobs, no \none in the Obama economy is doing well. Nationwide, nearly 10 million \nAmericans are unemployed, almost one-third of them for 6 months or \nlonger.\n  The unemployment rate has hovered at recession-level highs for the \nentire Obama Presidency. Since the President took office, the average \nlength of unemployment has increased from 19.8 weeks to 34.5 weeks. \nApproximately 14 million Americans have been forced to join the Food \nStamp Program since President Obama took office, bringing the total \nnumber of Americans receiving food stamps to more than 46 million.\n  Meanwhile, everywhere families look prices are going up. Gas prices \nhave almost doubled during the Obama Presidency. Food prices have \nincreased, and the President's policies are just making things worse. \nChief among the President's policy disasters, of course, is ObamaCare, \nwhich has driven up the price of everything from premiums to \npacemakers.\n  The President told the American people his health care law would \ndrive down health care premiums by $2,500. Instead, prices have risen \nby almost $3,700, and they are still going up.\n  ObamaCare has meant new burdens for just about everyone: higher \npremiums and deductibles, more expensive medications, fewer doctors and \nhospitals from which to choose, lost jobs, and increased taxes on \nbusinesses both large and small. Millions of Americans were forced off \ntheir health plans--the plans they were promised they could keep--and \ninto the health exchanges, where they were frequently forced to pay \nmore for plans they liked less.\n  Not content with the high health care bills, now the President is \nadding insult to injury by putting in place EPA regulations that will \ndrive up electricity bills for all American families. The President's \nde facto energy tax will hit low-income families and seniors on fixed \nincomes the hardest. It will also slash tens of thousands, if not \nhundreds of thousands, of jobs. Coal plants will close, leaving their \nworkers unemployed, and manufacturers will send jobs in America \noverseas to countries with more affordable energy.\n  The worst part is that President Obama's EPA regulations will \ndevastate family budgets and the economy for nothing because the \nPresident's proposals will do almost nothing to reduce the \nconcentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. As long as our \ncountry is acting unilaterally, there will be no meaningful effect on \nglobal emissions, but the President is pressing on anyway and \napparently Americans will have to get used to their massive new energy \nbills.\n  The President's policies are having a devastating effect on American \nstudents, families, and the middle class, but instead of trying to make \nthings better, the Democratic leadership in the Senate has chosen to \ntake up gimmicky legislation, not to help Americans but to get \nDemocrats reelected.\n  Yesterday a bipartisan veterans bill, which would address the \nsystemwide VA crisis, was introduced in the Senate. The failures at the \nVA are a national embarrassment and a betrayal of our compact with our \nveterans. Congress has an obligation to make sure nothing like this \never happens again.\n  Today we could be discussing the best ways to fix our VA system. \nInstead, we are going to be discussing a bill designed not to improve \nthings for Americans but to win the Democrats a few votes. Instead of \nproceeding to a student loan bill that was designed to fail, we should \nproceed directly to the VA reform bill.\n  The House of Representatives acted decisively to bring greater \naccountability to the VA 3 weeks ago. Today they are moving forward on \na VA reform bill that includes many of the provisions of the bill that \nwas introduced in the Senate last night. Now that we have a bipartisan \nVA reform bill in the Senate, we should be acting with the same sense \nof urgency.\n  If Democratic leaders in the Senate truly wanted to make things \nbetter for American families, they wouldn't be focused on gimmicky show \nvotes. Instead, they would be working with Republicans to fix the VA \ncrisis. They would back a repeal of the ObamaCare medical device tax, \nwhich has already cost tens of thousands of jobs and will cost many \nmore if it isn't repealed. They would support Republican efforts to \nrepeal the ObamaCare 30-hour workweek rule, which has resulted in lost \nhours and decreased wages for way too many workers in this country, and \nthey would embrace legislation to halt the devastating EPA rules the \nPresident has proposed and protect millions of American families from \ncrippling energy bills.\n  They would push--they would push for job-creating measures such as \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline and the 42,000 jobs it would support or trade \npromotion authority for the President to open new markets to American \nfarmers, workers, and businesses, and create those good-paying jobs.\n  We throw around a lot of statistics in the Congress--1 million people \nthis, 10 million people that. It is important for us to remember the \nfaces behind the numbers: the parents trying to figure out how they \nwill afford to pay both their daughters' tuition and their new \nObamaCare premiums, the college graduate who can't find a job and is \ncurrently living in his parents' basement, the single mother whose \nworking hours have suddenly been cut because her employer can't afford \nto pay the ObamaCare mandate, a father who has been out of a job for \nmonths and can't get an interview anywhere.\n  These Americans need help, and the President's policies are not \nhelping. The good thing is it doesn't have to\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\nstay that way. We can get America working again, but it is going to \ntake something different than the policies of the last 5\\1/2\\ years.\n  I challenge my Democratic colleagues to join us in passing real jobs \nlegislation, the kind of legislation that will open a future of \nopportunity and economic security for all American families.\n  What college graduates don't need are political gimmicks. What \ncollege graduates need more than anything else are good-paying jobs \nwith opportunities for advancement. That is what we should be focused \non, not political show votes, not election-year sloganeering but real \nmeaningful policies that will grow and expand our economy in this \ncountry and create the good-paying jobs our young college graduates \nneed and that will lift more lower income families into the middle \nclass.\n  That is what this Senate ought to be focused on. We can change to \nthat focus, and we can start doing some things that will make this \ncountry stronger and provide a better and more prosperous and a more \nsecure future for middle-income families.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \nshall be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n             Bank on Student Emergency Loan Refinancing Act\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Bank on \nStudent Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. I urge my colleagues to work \nwith us to brighten our Nation's future by turning the tide against the \nstudent loan debt burden that threatens to hold back this generation of \nAmericans.\n  Since 2003, student loan debt has quadrupled. It has surpassed credit \ncard debt, and it is only second to mortgage debt for American \nhouseholds. We know that borrowers are struggling with this debt. \nDelinquency rates are substantially higher for student loans than for \nother types of debt. Default rate have risen. The Federal Reserve Bank, \nthe National Association of Realtors, the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, the Pew Research Center, and others have begun to sound the \nalarm about the broader impacts of student loan debt on our economy.\n  Home ownership among young people has fallen. Young households with \nstudent loan debt have accumulated seven\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\ntimes less wealth than their debt-free peers. The interest rate on \nundergraduate student loans was 3.86 percent this year, yet many \nborrowers are locked into loans at 6.8 percent with no way to \nrefinance. The Government Accountability Office estimated the Federal \nGovernment would earn an estimated $66 billion from student loans \noriginated between 2007 and 2012.\n  Surely we can afford to give these borrowers a break and reduce their \ninterest rates to at least that which was agreed to in the Bipartisan \nStudent Loan Certainty Act that was signed into law last year, which \nstill sets rates too high in light of the fact that the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates show that student loans will still generate \nrevenue for the government even at these lower rates.\n  That is the simple premise behind the Bank on Student Emergency Loan \nRefinancing Act. I am a proud cosponsor with Senator Warren. I salute \nher for her leadership, for her insight, and for her advocacy for \nstudents and families across this country.\n  The other side may deny that student loan debt is an urgent problem \nthat requires Senate action. But for the estimated 25 million Americans \nwho could benefit from refinancing, including 88,000 in my home State \nof Rhode Island, that is cold comfort indeed. We can provide real \nrelief for student loan borrowers, and let them put their hard-earned \nmoney to work for building a better life for their families and a \nstronger economy for our Nation.\n  Looking forward, we need to work together to tackle the drivers in \nstudent loan debt--rapidly rising college costs and the rollback of \nState investment in higher education in public colleges throughout this \ncountry. We need to renew our commitment to the core principle of the \nHigher Education Act, that no American should be denied the ability to \ngo to college because their family lacks the means to pay.\n  We need to get back to the idea that educating Americans is \nfundamentally in our national interest and that we have a shared \nresponsibility at the Federal, State, local, institutional, and \nindividual levels for investing in our people. My generation benefited \nfrom this kind of investment. This and future generations should have \nsimilar opportunities to develop their talents and pursue their dreams \nin order to secure a brighter future for them and for our country.\n  Tomorrow, we begin voting to move forward on legislation that could \nprovide relief to as many as 25 million Americans struggling under the \nweight of student loan debt. For those people, this is not a political \nstunt. The legislation would enable student loan borrowers to lower \ntheir interest rates, reducing their payments and ultimately reducing \nthe amount they will have to repay overall. When rates go down, we can \nrefinance other types of debt. Student loans should not be an \nexception.\n  This student debt relief is fully paid for by addressing an inequity \nin our Tax Code that allows millionaires and billionaires to pay lower \nrates than regular middle-class Americans. Student loans are supposed \nto help people finance their education so they can get ahead, not serve \nas a ball and chain that weighs them down for years and years and \nyears.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Bank on Student Emergency \nLoan Refinancing Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in recent weeks it has become impossible \nto deny the fact that we have a full-blown humanitarian crisis along \nthe U.S.-Mexican border. Sadly, this crisis is directly the result of \nPresident Obama's own policies, and it involves tens of thousands of \nyoung children, some reportedly as young as 3 years old, risking their \nlives.\n  Indeed, young children are traveling through extremely dangerous \nterritory run by brutal drug cartels that prey on the weak in the form \nof human trafficking, rape, and even murder. This year alone tens of \nthousands of unaccompanied minor children have been detained while \ncrossing illegally into the United States. A large percentage has been \nfound in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.\n  To give the Senate an idea of what has happened and the timeline \nhere, as recently as 2011 there were 6,560 unaccompanied minors \ndetained at the border between the United States and Mexico. Then in \n2012 the President announced he was taking administrative action to \ndefer deportation of a certain class of minors, most of whom had come \nhere as young children but had since grown up, sometimes called the \nDreamers. But this action in 2012 sent a message, apparently, to other \npeople who were anxious to come to the United States. So you see in \n2013, there were 24,000 unaccompanied minors. It is projected, although \nthe number is not known, that it will rise to 60,000, or the Senator \nfrom Arizona has said he has heard as high as 90,000 potentially of \nthese unaccompanied minors.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I apologize if I am being redundant here, but how does \nthe Senator from Texas explain to the American people how we have gone \nfrom, in 2011, when we start this chart, from 6,000, to now the \nprojection, 3 years later, of over 60,000 and some say as many as \n90,000? But let's say it is 60,000. Does this not have to be some kind \nof orchestrated, organized effort\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nto account for this dramatic increase? If it is, who is doing it?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to the Senator from Arizona, he knows a lot \nabout this topic, living in Arizona. But I think it is a combination of \nfactors. It is, 1, the message that was sent by the unilateral deferred \naction the President ordered in 2012 saying that even children who come \nhere meeting certain criteria would be low priorities for deportation. \nSo the message was: If you can come to America, and you get here, then \nyou are basically not going to be sent back home.\n  I think it is also a combination, as the Senator knows, of the \nviolence in the failed state status, nearly, of some of the Central \nAmerican countries where most of these kids come from. But it is \ncreating, as the Senator knows, a humanitarian crisis because we do not \nhave the facilities to take care of this many minor children.\n  Here again, these are just the ones who made it. The Senator knows \nhow dangerous the trek is from Central America up through Mexico \nthrough areas controlled by the drug cartels. Many of these children, \nsome reportedly as young as 5 or 3 years old, are obviously very \nvulnerable to being preyed upon by unscrupulous characters.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Additionally, though, these children--when you are saying \nespecially the very young ones, there has to be some kind of organized \neffort that is bringing them. The average 5-year-old or 6-year-old does \nnot decide to leave home one day and come across the U.S.-Mexican \nborder.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator is exactly right. I did not answer his \nquestion. Let me try to do a better job. As the Senator knows, in years \npast, the migrants who came across the border typically were people \nlooking for work. But now with the dominance of large swaths of Mexico \nand Central America by drug cartels, they basically are trafficking in \npeople, in drugs, in guns, and anything that will make them a buck. \nUnfortunately, they have no scruples whatsoever and no concern for \nthese young, vulnerable children. They recognize their parents are \nwilling to pay money to them to transport them from Central America to \nthe United States. But the problem is they have no control over what \nhappens to those children when they are in the hands of the drug \ncartels and these transnational gangs as they bring them all the way \nfrom Guatemala, for example, which is 1,200 miles away from McAllen, \nTX. Many of these children suffer from exposure, in addition to being \npreyed upon by a variety of unscrupulous characters.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask again? So these children now, ones because of \nthe numbers in overwhelming our facilities, are in terrible conditions \nfor someone, a human being in the United States of America: no \nfacilities, no bathing, diet, overcrowding, being put on transportation \nand taken to Arizona and dropped off at bus stops, and yet not only is \nthat a terrific problem, at least once they are there, they are not \nprey to some of the things they are prey to on the 1,200-mile trip \nwhich are horrible in many circumstances given the nature of these \npeople who are the drug smugglers and human smugglers at the same time. \nSo is it true that the dimensions of this humanitarian tragedy/crisis \nare something that deserve the attention of all of us? I am surprised \nit has not gotten a lot more attention than it has up to now.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to the Senator from Arizona that I am a \nlittle surprised it has not gotten more attention either. That is one \nreason that motivated me to come to the floor today to highlight this. \nTomorrow, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Secretary Jeh Johnson \nof the Department of Homeland Security will be testifying. I hope he \ncan provide us some answers, because what we need is a comprehensive \nlook at what are the incentives that would convince parents to send \ntheir unaccompanied children up through this horrific trip through \nMexico, some 1,200 miles from Central America, to such an uncertain \nfate here in the United States, much less along the way. We need to \nknow what the President's plan is to deal with this.\n  I know the Senator has spent a lot of time in places such as Jordan \nand Turkey that I have had the occasion to visit. One of our colleagues \npointed out, this is like having refugee camps here in the United \nStates, something nobody ever thought we would have.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask one more question. Does the Senator know of \nany plan or any idea of what our Department of Homeland Security and \nour Border Patrol and people have to deal with this? Do you have any \nidea what they have to address this issue besides transporting children \nfrom Texas to Tucson, AZ, and dropping them off at a bus stop?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to the Senator, I know some of it entails \nwarehousing children at places such as Lackland Air Force Base, and the \nlast report I saw, about 1,000 of them are located there. I am not sure \nwhat the plan is going forward. I assume some of it will be to try to \nreunite them with family members here in the United States. But if they \ndo not have family members, then they are going to basically become \nwards of the State. I am not aware of any plan.\n  The reason why I came to the floor today is to express the very \nconcerns the Senator from Arizona has expressed about the causes and \nthe effects of such a poorly thought out policy, which basically sends \nthe message that anybody who can make it here, particularly minors, can \ncome into the United States and we are totally unprepared, in my view, \nto deal with this humanitarian crisis. We need to be prepared.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In other words, by making the decision the President of \nthe United States made on deferred action, if you believe those numbers \nand they are accurate, that triggered a mass movement into the United \nStates of America. So it is not an accident that these numbers have \ngone from 13,000 up to 60,000 or 90,000, depending on who you talk to. \nIt is not an accident. So if it is a matter of policy, then that policy \nneeds to be reviewed. Rather than cure the symptom, which we have to do \nbecause it is a humanitarian crisis, the humanitarian crisis is not \ngoing to be over until we address the root of the problem. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree with the Senator from Arizona. I think this is \nnot a coincidence. There is, in my view, very much of a cause-and-\neffect relationship between this poorly thought out unilateral action \nby the President, without much knowledge of or thought given to the \nconsequences.\n  As the Senator from Arizona knows, because he has certainly fought \nthe fight to fix our broken immigration laws, and I have been involved \nin many of those myself, this is a direct result of the President \nbasically trying to go it alone and basically trying to send a message, \na political message, but one that gives very little thought to the very \nreal-world human consequences of his political actions.\n  The Senator from Arizona was talking a little bit about this trip \nfrom Central America. I would show my colleagues, as we know, Mexico \nhas had a lot of security issues that have been dealt with by the last \nadministration, President Calderon's administration, and now are \ncontinuing to be dealt with by the current administration in Mexico. \nBut the Zetas, some of the hardest core of the drug cartels, \nessentially control large portions of this region of eastern Mexico. If \nyou look from Guatemala, from Central America right at the bottom of \nMexico here, the pathway these children would have to make all of the \nway up through Mexico into South Texas, into the Rio Grande Valley, \nessentially is through territory controlled by the Zetas, the drug \ncartel.\n  One question that is horrible to contemplate is how many of the \nchildren who started this long 1,200 mile or so trek actually made it \nto the end of their journey, and how many fell out along the way as a \nresult of illness, as a result of criminal activity, such as \nkidnapping, how many were assaulted along the way. This is a crisis \nthat needs to be addressed.\n  I would point out to my colleagues, I have in my hand--and I ask \nunanimous consent that this document be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks. I would read from it. This is a release from the U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection dated May 12, 2014. As of May 12, 2014, \nnearly 180 sex offenders were arrested in the Rio Grande Valley sector \nalone. That is so far in 2014. Can you imagine that amidst the 47,000 \nchildren who have been detained since October of last year coming \nacross the\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nborder, that mixed into this pot of people were we know at least 180 \nconvicted sex offenders.\n  This article continues to point out that:\n  Additionally, agents have arrested more than 50 members of the Mara \nSalvatrucha gang, or MS-13, a notorious transnational criminal gang \nthat started in Los Angeles, and about 14 members of the 18th Street \ngang.\n  For my colleagues' information, many of them have heard about a train \nthat goes up through Mexico that many of the migrants from Central \nAmerica take in order to help them make their journey. This train is \ncalled the Beast, sometimes called the Beast of Death.\n  The stories, and indeed the books, that have been written about this \nchronicle how horrendous this trip is. We can see in this picture there \nare young people and older people sitting on top of this train, riding \nit as far as they can, helping them make their journey up that eastern \ncoast of Mexico from Central America, the 1,200 miles they would take \nto get from Guatemala City to South Texas. Many of them travel on this \ntrain known as the Beast.\n  The stories of what has happened here, of people who have lost their \nlives, people who have been decapitated when the train has gone through \ntunnels, people who tried to jump on a moving train only to lose limbs \nafter a fall under the train, will chill your blood.\n  But the fact is the administration, and indeed the entire Federal \nGovernment, needs to deal with this crisis and needs to deal not only \nwith the causes of it but what the effects are and particularly the \nhumanitarian crisis involving this growing number of unaccompanied \nchildren.\n  Federal, State, and local authorities along the border have \ncompletely been overwhelmed by the influx. You can imagine that the \nBorder Patrol, which is in the business of processing these children as \nthey are detained and handing them off to Health and Human Services and \nother agencies, their attention has been diverted from their primary \nmission of border security because they have had to lend a hand to deal \nwith the humanitarian crisis.\n  With so many children arriving day after day and with so many of them \nlacking any identification documents, it has been tremendously \ndifficult to figure out exactly who they are, why they left home, where \nthey have family, and where they should be sent while their case is \nbeing processed.\n  We don't know how many of them have been victims of human \ntrafficking, for example, how many of them might qualify as refugees \nunder U.S. law, how many of them are actually over the age of 18, and \nhow many of them might have a criminal record.\n  Can anyone at the White House or in the administration say with \ncertainty the children being released from U.S. custody are leaving \nwith an actual family member?\n  The Senator from Arizona alluded to children being shipped from Texas \nto Arizona where they were left at bus stops and elsewhere, basically \nwith a request that they reappear at a given time. But, of course, 90 \npercent, I am told, never show up back at their court appointment.\n  For that matter, can the administration say with certainty that none \nof these children have been handed over to an adult with a criminal \nrecord? The answer to both of these questions is no.\n  In short, this is a complete mess, and the use of resources available \nto Texas and U.S. officials are under enormous strain. The \nadministration estimates that roughly 60,000 of these unaccompanied \nchildren will be apprehended this fiscal year. Perhaps twice that many \nmay be apprehended next year.\n  We can see the trend here and, of course, all we know from this chart \nis what it was before the President's deferred action announcement, and \nwe know what it is now. But the trendline is undeniable and appears to \nbe growing at an exponential rate. The crisis we are facing now \nrepresents a tragic and painful example of the law of unintended \nconsequences.\n  Two years ago when the President stood in the Rose Garden and \nannounced a unilateral administrative change in U.S. immigration \npolicy, he probably thought he was doing a good thing. But between that \npolicy change and his broader failure to uphold our immigration laws--\nindeed his statement that he essentially will not enforce broad swaths \nof those laws--the President has created an extremely dangerous \nincentive for children and their parents to cross into the United \nStates under these sorts of treacherous and horrific circumstances.\n  In other words, the policies that were supposed to be adopted for \nhumanitarian purposes to help these children have created a genuine \nhumanitarian disaster for these same supposed beneficiaries of this \nunilateral policy. While there is widespread violence and poverty in \nCentral America, sadly, that is not something entirely new, and it is \nnot the cause of our current crisis.\n  President Obama's immigration policies, primarily his policy of \nnonenforcement, have encouraged untold numbers of parents and children \nto make a shockingly dangerous journey through the interior of Mexico \nriding the Beast, some of whom have been subjected to unknown horrors \nand treatment at the hands of the very same people who were paid to \ntransport them.\n  The stories I have read indicate that at stops along the way people \nare held up at gunpoint. If they don't turn over money to their would-\nbe assailant, then they are threatened with being shot and even killed.\n  While we may have a rough idea of how many children are actually \ncrossing into America, we will never know with certainty how many \nactually start that journey and never make it, how many die along the \nway, are kidnapped or perhaps sexually abused or otherwise mistreated \nbecause of the lawless conditions under which this takes place. But we \ndo know the massive surge in unaccompanied minors is directly \nattributable to actions taken or not taken by the administration.\n  Therefore, I would implore President Obama to immediately do five \nthings:\n  No. 1, he should immediately declare that the so-called deferred \naction program--which I referred to earlier that he unilaterally \nordered in 2012--does not apply to the children currently arriving at \nthe border. One aspect of enforcement is deterrence, and so deterring \nthe children from ever starting that long, dangerous trek has to be \npart of the solution.\n  No. 2, the President should immediately discourage people in Central \nAmerica and elsewhere from sending their children on such a dangerous \njourney.\n  No. 3, the President should immediately begin to enforce all U.S. \nimmigration laws and engage with the Congress in any changes he thinks \nare warranted and not simply ignore the ones he finds convenient or \npolitically expedient.\n  No. 4, he should immediately take steps to ensure that Texas and \nother U.S. border States have the resources they need to address this \nongoing humanitarian crisis.\n  No. 5, he should immediately start working with the Mexican \nGovernment to improve security at Mexico's southern border. This is a \n500-mile border between Mexico and Guatemala that, if it were better \nsecured, would deter many of these children and other migrants from \ncoming through Mexico and subjecting themselves to these dangerous \nconditions in the first place.\n  If the President did all five of those, not only would it help us \nresolve the current crisis, but it would also help us prevent similar \ncrises from erupting in the future.\n  These children are being preyed on by drug cartels and human \ntraffickers, and they are at high risk of being kidnapped, raped or \neven killed while traveling this long dangerous journey to the United \nStates. But sadly, when they arrive here, we still have no way of \nguaranteeing their safety because of the lack of an adequate plan to \ndeal with this humanitarian crisis.\n  President Obama effectively created this problem and now he has an \nopportunity to work with us to fix it. I can only hope he does the \nright thing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection document I referred to earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\n      [From the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, May 12, 2014]\n\n Nearly 180 Sex Offenders Arrested by RGV Sector Agents so far in FY14\n\n       Edinburg, TX.--U.S. Border Patrol agents from the Rio \n     Grande Valley Sector have arrested nearly 180 illegal \n     immigrants with prior convictions for sex offenses so far for \n     fiscal year 2014, which began Oct. 1, 2013, and goes through \n     Sept. 31, 2014.\n       The majority of the sex offenders have convictions for \n     sexual assault crimes involving children. Some of the more \n     heinous offenses include: sexual assault of a child; sodomy, \n     lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14; aggravated \n     sexual assault of a child; and aggravated indecent assault \n     and corruption of a minor. The sex offenders have convictions \n     for crimes that occurred in states from coast to coast as \n     well as in the Rio Grande Valley.\n       In addition to the arrests of convicted sex offenders, \n     agents apprehended three illegal immigrants over the weekend \n     who have arrest warrants for sex-related crimes. They include \n     a Mexican national wanted in FortWorth on a continuous child \n     sex abuse charge; a Salvadoran wanted by the Loudan County \n     Sheriff's Office in Virginia on a charge of adultery/\n     fornication: incest with a child between 13-17 years of age; \n     and another Mexican national wanted by the Travis County \n     Sheriff's Office on a charge of indecency with a child/sexual \n     contact The three men were turned over to the Hidalgo County \n     Sheriff's Office pending extradition.\n       Additionally, agents have arrested more than 50 members of \n     the Mara Salvatrucha gang, or MS-13, a notorious \n     transnational criminal gang that started in Los Angeles, and \n     about 14 members of the 18th Street gang.\n       The Rio Grande Valley Sector is part of the South Texas \n     Campaign, which leverages federal, state and local resources \n     to combat transnational criminal organizations.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As a Senator from a Western State, as is my friend from \nTexas, I hope the American people understand the only thing the \nRepublicans can do for whatever happens is blame President Obama: Oh, \nit rained today--it is President Obama.\n  How about the most obvious point--that the Republican House has \nfailed to take up an immigration bill. The Senate did it in a \nbipartisan way. I applaud that bipartisanship. We did it a long time \nago. The fact that the Republican House refuses to do it never passes \nthe lips of my Republican friends in the Senate.\n  If we want to correct our immigration system, we have to sit down and \ndo the hard work, as we did in the Senate. There is no question that we \nare facing a crisis with children from Central America running away \nfrom gangs, violence, rape, and deprivation. There is no doubt about \nit. The fact is we can deal with that, but we have to look at the laws, \nand that is why we want to set the rules in a bill.\n  There is lawlessness because we haven't updated our laws. For \nexample, we have to make sure these short-term holding facilities have \nhumane conditions. We can do that by law.\n  I want to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, because \nit is cloudy one day, don't blame the President. Because it rains the \nnext day, don't blame the President. If you wake up with a sore throat, \ndon't blame the President. When you have trouble at the border, look at \nyour own party, which has held up immigration reform. If we can do it \nover here, they can do it over there. The whole world is watching.\n  It is the same way with the veterans. I am hoping and praying that \nthis new effort by Senator Sanders and Senator McCain will bear fruit \nin the Senate on a VA bill. But remember that the Republicans \nfilibustered the last Bernie Sanders bill, which would have added \nclinics, which would have addressed the problems. They filibustered it.\n  Keep your ear open here. We have a chance to address so many issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3524-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3524-S3525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              STUDENT DEBT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I talked about immigration. I talked about veterans. We \nhave a chance now to deal with the student loan crisis, and it is a \ncrisis.\n  The student loan debt is $1.2 trillion. That is more than credit card \ndebt.\n  In my home State, the average amount owed by a borrower in 2012 was \nmore than $25,000--a 65-percent increase from 2004. In the same time \nperiod, the number of Californians with outstanding student loan debt \nincreased by 60 percent.\n  In addition, in 2012 there were 641,000 Californians over the age of \n50 who were still paying down their student loans and more than 6.8 \nmillion people over 50 nationwide still paying off their student loans.\n  This is a crisis that must be addressed. It is important to our \nNation's economy. It is important to the future of our families, to our \nchildren, and our grandchildren. It is time to act.\n  I have to say, Senator Warren has been a tremendous leader. We can \ntake an important step toward addressing this dire situation by passing \nSenator Warren's Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. It \nwould help millions of Americans refinance their loans at lower \ninterest rates, put more money in their pockets. I have to say, it is \nkind of a no-brainer. When you have more money in your pocket than you \nhad before, you are going to spend it in your communities.\n  I am so proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Sadly, even though the Federal Government is the biggest student loan \nlender, and it is making billions of dollars in profits each year, it \ndoesn't allow its borrowers to refinance their existing student loans \nwhen rates are low. That is wrong. Our middle class is hurting.\n\n  The New York Federal Reserve Bank and the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau have been warning us that student loans are acting \nlike an anchor on our economy.\n  When our President took office, there was a crisis. We were losing \n700,000 jobs a month. He has turned it around, and now month after \nmonth we are creating over 200,000 jobs, and we have restored all those \njobs we lost. But why would we keep this anchor of student loan debt on \nour economy?\n  For example, students can't buy cars because they have so much in \nstudent loan debt. They can't buy houses.\n  Andrea from San Francisco writes:\n\n       My boyfriend and I both have student debt. He started with \n     $90,000 and has finally gotten it down to $50,000 after 10 \n     years of paying. I recently finished my MFA and now have \n     $56,000 in debt. This has kept us from saving for a house, \n     purchasing a car, and doing things day to day that would \n     boost the economy, like shopping and going out to eat.\n\n  Patrick from Thousand Oaks wrote to me and said:\n\n       I pay half of my monthly wages to cover the interest alone \n     on my loan.\n\n  Worse still, many young Americans wrestling with student debt cannot \nsave enough to start a family.\n  Stefanie from Pacific Grove wrote:\n\n       We are finally starting a family in our late 30s. My \n     husband has been paying off his student loans for ten years. \n     This loan will cost him twice as much as he borrowed--\n     doubling the cost of his college education. That is simply \n     not fair. If the Fed sets interest rates low for everyone \n     else, why not for students?\n\n  As Stefanie's story illustrates, student debt is not only a drag on \nthe American economy, it is tearing at the fabric of our American \ndream.\n  I read last week that for the first time a majority of people don't \nreally believe the dream will be there for them as it was for us. When \n40 million people in America are struggling with a combined $1.2 \ntrillion in student debt, it is no wonder the American dream is \nelusive.\n  I have 3.7 million Californians dealing with $97 billion in student \nloans, and many of these loans are stuck at outrageously high interest \nrates--7, 8, 9 percent. With interest rates this high, it is hard for \nanyone to pay off their debt, and it is really hard for recent \ngraduates who are just launching their careers.\n  In order to help the nearly 40 million Americans with student debt, \nSenate Democrats have introduced this plan, with the leadership of \nSenator Warren. It is a simple plan. The idea is to let borrowers \nrefinance their outstanding student loan debt.\n  We are at a time of record-low interest. I am asking rhetorically \nwhether it is fair to charge 7, 8, 9 percent interest when the Federal \nGovernment lends money to banks at less than 1 percent. The people who \nhave borrowed money to pay for college or send their children to \ncollege are trapped with these exorbitant interest rates. And the \nprivate student loans can be even worse. I have seen 10 percent and 11 \npercent.\n  The Senate Democratic proposal would allow borrowers of both Federal \nand private student loans to refinance from their high rates into much \nlower rates. The rates would be 3.86 percent for undergraduates, 5.41 \npercent for graduates, and 6.41 for the parents who\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nhave helped their kids. Those are the rates Democrats and Republicans \nagreed on last year, and those are the rates new borrowers received \nthis past school year. But the older borrowers are stuck with these \nexorbitant rates, and they can't refinance. If those lower rates are \ngood for new borrowers, why wouldn't we allow them for those who have \nbeen stuck in this vicious cycle of these high rates?\n  These young people are not saddled with this debt because they went \nto the mall and bought a lot of clothes. They worked hard to learn new \nskills that will benefit our Nation and help keep us strong. They \ndeserve a fair shot at saving and building a career and having a \nfamily.\n  Matthew from Antelope, CA, wrote to me and said:\n\n       I have never worked harder on one single goal than to be \n     the first in my family to gain a degree in higher education. \n     I've been on the Dean's List every semester in college. [But] \n     the ever-present fear of paying off the thousands of dollars \n     of interest I have gained is overwhelming and I am struggling \n     to see past it.\n       If big banks, which collapsed our financial system, are \n     able to borrow at a rate of nearly zero percent, I don't see \n     why students who will ultimately grow our economy and grow \n     our nation cannot borrow at the same rates.\n\n  Matt from Newport Beach, CA, said:\n\n       I am grateful for my college education. As a son of middle-\n     class parents, I knew [college] was an investment in my \n     future, despite the need to take out loans. I even graduated \n     in three years and served as a Resident Adviser to keep costs \n     down. However, my student loan debt is now a major expense \n     that hangs over me as a working adult. It affects my ability \n     to achieve certain life milestones--buy a house, finance a \n     wedding, and save for retirement.\n       I support efforts to refinance loans at low interest \n     rates--rates comparable to those in the real estate market. \n     Please take action! With more affordable student loans, my \n     generation can grow this economy.\n\n  Matt, Matthew, and their classmates who worked so hard to achieve \ntheir dreams deserve a fair shot. Tomorrow morning we will have a \nchance to make achieving the American dream a little easier for Matt, \nMatthew, and all our struggling college students. So I stand with Matt, \nMatthew, Patrick, Stefanie, Andrea, and the 40 other million Americans \nwith student loans.\n  What we are saying is very simple: We want to give students who are \ntrapped in those high interest rates a chance to refinance. We pay for \nit by saying that those billionaires who aren't paying at least as much \nas their secretaries pay at least as much as that. It is called the \nBuffett rule. I can't imagine a better way to pay for this than that.\n  I urge my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to stand with my \nconstituents and their own constituents by voting to let us move \nforward to consider the bank on students act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak today on behalf of our \nveterans. I am here to speak about both challenge and opportunity. The \nchallenge is the problems we face with our Veterans' Administration, \nwhich is that we are not getting the care for our veterans that they \nneed and that we all want them to have and that they so very much \ndeserve.\n  We also have a real opportunity because we have been working on \nlegislation. We have legislation on the Republican side in the Senate \nand on the Democratic side, and now we are working to bring those two \npieces of legislation together. So I think this creates a real \nopportunity, and it is a vitally important opportunity--one that we \ngrab and that we address on behalf of our veterans. We need to make \nsure we come together on bipartisan legislation that fixes the \nVeterans' Administration health care system, and it takes care of our \nveterans.\n  I believe the solution, the real key to solving the problem, is \nchoice--or another way to put it might be access to health care. I \nthink that not only solves the problems we have seen with the wait \nlists but also the problem of distance, which is also an issue, and it \nis a challenge we see in States such as my own. For example, in our \nState the issue truly is distance. In other places it is access to \nhealth care. We know, for example, in places such as Phoenix, veterans \nwere put on wait lists and in that way denied access to care. That is \nabsolutely unacceptable--absolutely unacceptable.\n  I think the Veterans Choice Act, which I am pleased to cosponsor with \na number of my fellow colleagues, solves that problem, and it solves \nnot only the access and the wait list problem but also, as I have said, \nthe distance problem essentially by providing choice, meaning that if a \nvet can't get access to a veterans health care facility, then the \nveteran can go to another health care provider. I believe that works \nfor the vet and it works for the health care provider. The veteran can \ngo to a hospital or a clinic that has the service he or she needs if he \ncan't get into the VA facility in a timely way, and then that hospital \nor clinic is reimbursed just as if it were for a Medicare patient. \nClearly, our health care system has the facilities in place, the \nresources to handle that type of reimbursement just as they do for \nMedicare patients.\n  Now I wish to speak about the distance issue for just a minute \nbecause in North Dakota the distance issue is the one we face. For \nexample, in North Dakota it is about 800 miles round trip from \nWilliston to the VA health care system in Fargo. Some services, as we \nall know, are provided by CBOCs--community-based operating clinics--and \nwe have those around the State. But where we don't have CBOCs or where \nthey are not able to get the service they need from that CBOC or walk-\nin clinic, then it can be an 800-mile trip to get services.\n  Not too long ago I held an open forum in Williston, ND, which, as \nmany people know, is the site of an incredible energy boon, the \nWilliston Basin. Now in North Dakota we produce about 1 million barrels \nof oil a day--second only to the State of Texas. So we have a \ntremendous number of people moving into this region. We are the fastest \ngrowing State in the Nation. We have veterans there who are driving \nlong distances to get medical services. So this is a different \nchallenge than we faced in some of the centers such as Phoenix where \nthey were waiting to get patient care. In our case they are having to \ndrive long distances--as I said, 800 miles round trip to Williston; 400 \nmiles to Fargo and then 400 miles back.\n  I recently held a forum up in Williston to discuss this issue and \nlook for solutions on behalf of our veterans. I met with our veterans, \nI met with veterans service officers, as well as health care providers \nfrom the region. I talked to two vets who told me their story about \ntrying to get health care. We have a walk-in clinic, a CBOC--community-\nbased operating clinic--in Williston. There were two cases where \nveterans needed some health care services. In one case, because they \ncouldn't--the first veteran couldn't get it at the local CBOC, that \nindividual took a day to drive to Fargo, which is 400 miles, stayed in \na hotel, the next day went in and got those services, stayed in a hotel \nthat night, and then drove back the third day. So he had to take 3 days \noff of work to get services. He had to drive 800 miles round trip. He \nhad to be put up in a hotel for 2 nights. Now, all of that is \nreimbursed, as far as the travel in the State, by the VA. So for a \nrelatively straightforward procedure, the VA paid a lot more and \ninconvenienced that veteran terribly and cost him money because that \nindividual had to take 3 days off from work. That doesn't make any \nsense.\n  In the second case, a veteran in a similar situation wanted to get \nthe service at the local CBOC, wasn't able to do that, but instead of \ndriving all the way to Fargo and doing what the first veteran did, the \nsecond individual just went into the local clinic or hospital in \nWilliston and got the service that afternoon. Unfortunately, the second \nveteran is still trying to get reimbursement out of the VA for that \nprocedure.\n  The individual in the second case did not have to take 3 days off \nfrom work, which is smart and, frankly, saved the VA a lot of money \nbecause it was not a case where you had to drive down, get reimbursed \nfor that stay with over two\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nnights in a hotel, and then drive back. So it actually saved the VA \nmoney. But still they have not gotten a reimbursement for the cost of \nthat medical treatment because the VA does provide that service in \nFargo. But again, in that situation, unless that veteran is reimbursed, \nyou are not truly serving the veteran and, frankly, not doing the \nsensible thing to save the taxpayer money.\n  That is why the Veterans Choice Act that I am cosponsoring with \nothers, again, is the solution because we provide choice, we provide \naccess. If the veteran cannot get that service in a timely way in the \nlocal community, then the veteran can access another health care \nfacility. That is why the legislation works.\n  So what I have offered--and, of course, now we are working on \nbringing two bills together: the Veterans Choice Act, but then also \nlegislation offered by Senator Bernie Sanders; and that legislation is \nthe Ensuring Veterans Access to Care Act.\n  I think we can bring them together, and I think we can get a good \nsolution that serves everybody, most importantly that serves our \nveterans. But we need to serve all of our veterans--all of our \nveterans--regardless of where they live. That is why I have offered \nsimple, clarifying language--this is a technical fix--that would \nclarify and ensure that if a veteran cannot get service in a CBOC, then \nthat veteran can go to a local health care provider on the same basis \nas an individual who lives more than 40 miles away from the walk-in \nclinic.\n  This legislation, this clarification is important to ensure that a \nveteran is not in any way actually disadvantaged by having a walk-in \nclinic in the local community, and that all vets can access services on \nthe same basis. Again, it is because of the way this legislation is \ncoming together that requires that if you are within 40 miles of a \nwalk-in clinic or you have to wait more than 14 days, then you can go \nto another health care provider. But if either one of those criteria \napply--you are within the 40-mile radius and you can get an appointment \nwithin 14 days to see a doctor--then you have to go to the VA. That \nworks, and that is consistent only if you applied both criteria to the \nsame clinic, to the same health care center.\n  What I mean is this. Remember the example I gave just a minute ago: \nWilliston, ND, and Fargo, ND. In Williston you have a walk-in clinic. \nIn Fargo you have a full hospital--a full VA medical center. Take the \ntest we are applying in this legislation: If you are within 40 miles, \nyou have to go to the VA facility, as long as you can get in within 14 \ndays. But that 14 days has to also apply to the facility that is within \nthat 40-mile radius; otherwise, you get an inconsistent, unfair result \nand actually disadvantage somebody who is within 40 miles of a walk-in \nclinic versus somebody who is outside that radius.\n  Let me give two examples to illuminate what I am saying.\n  You have a vet. He lives in Williston, ND. He is within 40 miles of \nthat facility. He goes in, and he gets his shots or whatever it is in \nthat facility--no problem. But what happens if he cannot, if that walk-\nin clinic does not supply the service? What does he do? Well, if the \n14-day rule applies to the Fargo VA hospital, even though he is within \n40 miles of the CBOC, if the CBOC--the walk-in clinic--does not provide \nthat service, he still has to drive 800 miles roundtrip for that shot I \njust talked about a minute ago or that service--the two veterans I \ndescribed a minute ago. So he still has to travel 800 miles to get \nservice.\n  Take another individual. He lives 41 miles from that walk-in clinic. \nEven if the Fargo VA can take him within 14 days, he can still go get \nlocal service in Williston, can't he? Why? Because he is 41 miles away. \nSo ask yourself, the veteran who lives within 39 miles of that walk-in \nclinic, he might have to drive 800 miles roundtrip to get a service \nthat the individual who is 41 miles from that facility can go get in \nthe local community.\n  Does that make sense? That is the kind of thing we have to make sure \nwe get right so that all veterans, regardless of where they live, get \nthe same fair and consistent treatment. That is why I am saying, as we \nput this legislation together, we have to be careful to make sure we \nget that kind of fair and consistent result so this legislation serves \nall of our veterans and takes care of all of our veterans, and they \ntruly all have that access. Whether the problem is a wait list or long \ndistances, let's make sure this works for all of them.\n  Believe me, they are out there. Every one of them has put their life \non the line and stepped up. All of them have done that for us. Let's \nmake sure, as we work through and file this legislation--something I \nknow we can do; on a bipartisan basis we can get this done--let's make \nsure it works for all of our veterans and it works well and it works \nconsistently and it truly solves the problem; that is, we make sure \nthey get the health care they deserve.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

Madam President, on the evening of June 8, this past \nSunday, in Gainesville, GA, CAPT William Hall Davison, U.S. Navy \nretired, passed away.\n  It was a significant day in our family for many reasons. He is my \nwife's father. He is my children's grandfather. He is my \ngrandchildren's great-grandfather. His wife Gay, 97 years old, survives \nhim.\n  Bill Davison was 99 years old. He was a pilot in World War II in the \nSouth Pacific, tracking submarines of the Japanese Navy and cargo ships \nof the Japanese Navy to make sure our intelligence was the best it \ncould be.\n  Like so many of America's greatest generation, he sacrificed 4\\1/2\\ \nyears of his life in defense of our country. He made a career of the \nU.S. Navy. He never talked about it, and only rarely did he say \nanything about it. But when he did, he talked about how proud he was to \nbe able to wear the uniform of the United States of America.\n  So while it was a tragic night for my wife, a tragic loss for our \nfamily, it is a reminder to all of us as Americans that our greatest \ngeneration is passing at a very rapid rate. Soon none will be here with \nus who stormed the beaches at Normandy, flew the skies of the Pacific \nor fought on the ground at the Battle of the Bulge.\n  But we are all here today--you and I, Madam President--because of the \nsacrifice of those people--the greatest sacrifice in the history of \nmankind. In fact, the most unselfish act of humanity I have ever read \nabout or heard about or was ever taught about was by that generation \nthat landed on Normandy Beach on June 6, 1944, and freed America and \nfreed the rest of the world from the totalitarian government of Adolph \nHitler.\n  So as my family pauses to mourn the loss of a father-in-law for me, a \ngrandfather for my children, a great-grandfather for my grandchildren, \nand a father for my wife, we take joy in knowing that one member of our \nfamily was a part of a generation that saved all of humanity for \ndemocracy and for freedom and for liberty.\n  To his wife Gay, who is in morning today, at age 97, we wish her a \ncontinued, prosperous life, and we thank her for her sacrifice, because \nlike so many women--the wives of the soldiers during World War II--she \nkept the home fires burning. They worked in the factories. They made \nsure that America worked while their husbands were off to defend us.\n  So while we had a tragic loss of life in our family on Sunday night, \nJune 8, we had a positive remembrance of all that has been done for our \nfamily by the brave men and women who fought for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  May God bless William Hall Davison for his life and may God bless the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield back.\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3527-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3527-S3530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BANK ON STUDENTS EMERGENCY LOAN REFINANCING ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I want to speak for just a few minutes \nin favor of the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which \nis the measure before the Senate now, also referred to as the Fair Shot \nfor College Affordability.\n  We have been calling this agenda a fair shot, but let's be honest \nabout it. It is just plain common sense. I do not want to go any \nfurther without thanking the present occupant of the chair, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, for her dynamic and great \nleadership on this issue and on these kinds of issues that affect \ncollege affordability, and especially this overburdensome student debt \nthat is hanging not only over students but over our entire country.\n  There are some things, as I said, that are just plain common sense. \nRaising the minimum wage is good for American workers. It increases \naggregate demand, and it will increase GDP. It is common sense. Equal \npay for equal work is the right thing to do for women. It is common \nsense. And this bill that lets struggling student loan borrowers \nrefinance their loans is not only good for them but also good for our \ncountry and good for our economy.\n  Families across the country are struggling with student loan debt. It \nis not only holding them back personally, it is holding us back as a \nnation. It is holding them back from buying homes and starting \nfamilies. It is holding back doctors from practicing primary care. It \nis hurting people trying to save for retirement. It is hurting rural \ncommunities that are working to attract doctors or lawyers or \nveterinarians or whatever.\n  But you need not take my word for it. Some of the Nation's most \nprominent economic officials have raised concerns over this student \ndebt issue. Members of the Federal Reserve Board's Federal Open Market \nCommittee, in March 2013--over a year ago--expressed concern that ``the \nhigh level of student debt'' is a risk to aggregate household spending \nover the next 3 years. The Treasury Department's Office of Financial \nResearch has stated that student debt ``could significantly depress \ndemand for mortgage credit and dampen consumption''--again, a drag on \nour economy. New York Fed president William Dudley told reporters in \nNovember of last year: ``People can have trouble with the student loan \ndebt burden--unable to buy cars, unable to buy homes. . . .''\n  So I am pleased to see that President Obama has taken action to ease \nthe burden of Federal student loan debt for some struggling borrowers. \nI am also pleased to see the administration is taking critical steps to \nensure that servicemembers are getting the benefits they have earned \nthrough their service to our country. But it is very clear that much \nmore needs to be done. That is why this bill before us is so important. \nIt will provide relief to student borrowers who took out loans several \nyears ago only to see the rates for student loans have since gone down.\n  Some Senators may remember this issue presented itself last year. So \nas the chair of the authorizing committee, I worked with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle and with the administration--we had meetings in \nthe White House--to pass the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act, \nwhich lowered interest rates and also authorized the interest rates at \n3.86 percent last year for undergraduates, 5.41 percent for Stafford \nloans for graduate students, and 6.41 percent for parent and graduate \nPLUS loan borrowers. We want borrowers who may have taken out loans in \nthe past with higher rates to take advantage of these lower rates.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 25 million borrowers would \nlikely refinance their existing student loans under this legislation. \nIt will save them money. It will give them money in their pockets where \nthey can now go out and start buying things and increase what we need \nto have done in our country, which is aggregate demand.\n  The legislation also allows student loan borrowers to refinance their \nprivate loans into the Federal program--very important.\n  The bill provides those who meet certain eligibility requirements and \nwho are in good standing have the option of refinancing their high-\ninterest private loans down to rates offered to new Federal student \nloan borrowers this year. Those who refinance will also have access to \nthe benefits and protections of the Federal student loan program.\n  As I said, this bill is just common sense. American consumers have \nbeen able to take advantage of historically low interest rates on their \nhomes, their cars. I have heard a number of speakers who have come out \nhere and said: If you had a high-interest loan on your 25-year or 30-\nyear house mortgage, and you could come in and refinance down to 5 \npercent, sometimes even less than that, you would be foolish not to do \nit. You can do it. We should not let students do the same thing? It is \ngood for them and good for the economy.\n  Again, I want to say that while this issue of student debt is \ncritically important, by no means is it the only issue that deserves \nour attention in higher education policy. Right now I think maybe the \nmost critical, simply because of the huge debt burden overhanging our \nstudents--I should say our former students and their families, but \nthere are some other things we have to pay attention to.\n  In the coming days I plan to release from our committee, release from \nthe chairman's mark, the issue we should be attacking in a \ncomprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Our \ncommittee over the last several months has held more than 10 hearings \non issues ranging from teacher preparation to accreditation. These \nhearings have been bipartisan. I want to thank Senator Alexander for \nhis partnership in making sure we had good hearings.\n  As we move forward, our committee is committed to remaining on a \nbipartisan path for us taking up a Higher Education Act \nreauthorization. What I plan to put forward is consistent with that \nbipartisan approach. It simply provides clear guidelines based on the \nwork we have done already. The Higher Education Act we will be coming \nforward with in the next few weeks will cover basically four topics: 1, \naffordability; 2, student debt; 3, accountability; and, 4, \ntransparency. As it relates to affordability, we hope to increase \naffordability and reduce college costs on the front end by entering \ninto a partnership with States, incentivizing States that make strong \ninvestments in their systems of higher education.\n  The one thing that came through in our hearings on why tuition has \ngone up so much and college costs have gone up so much for students and \ntheir families over the last 20 to 30 years--well, there are a lot of \nindices of why that has happened, but the single largest factor has \nbeen over the last 20 to 30 years the decrease in States investing in \nhigher education.\n  What has happened is State legislatures figured it out. They quit \nputting more money into higher education. The schools raised their \ntuition, and the students come to the Federal Government or the private \nsector and borrow the money to go to school. States have abdicated \ntheir responsibility in higher education. We plan to offer incentives \nfor States that step up to the bar and then provide more vigorous \nfunding for higher education, that they will get better support from \nthe Federal Government.\n  With student debt, we plan to help student borrowers better manage \ntheir loan debt through measures such as better upfront and exit \ncounseling on their loans. Again, I hope that tomorrow we would pass \nour bill, the bill Senator Warren has worked so hard on and championed. \nI hope we would pass it and get it behind us. But I fully intend to \ntake the measures in that bill and incorporate them into our broader \nbill on student debt.\n  On accountability, we plan to hold schools more accountable to both \nstudents and taxpayers by ensuring that no Federal money that goes to \nstudents who then go to the schools is used for things such as \nmarketing, advertising. They use it to drive up enrollments. No. If \nschools want to do that, under our proposal they would not do that with \ntaxpayers' money.\n  On transparency, we hope to empower students and families by giving \nthem better information from the beginning of the college process in \nhow\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nthey select the school all the way through making sure they know all of \ntheir repayment options when they graduate and can make the right \nchoice for their particular circumstances.\n  What we need is a good comparison. If a student wants to go to \ncollege A, they can go online, they can find out what the costs are for \na credit hour, what the tuition is, other forms of information on what \nthey can expect from that school--graduation rates, time to graduate, \nall kinds of things such as that.\n  They can hit the compare button, then go to college B. They can ask \nthe same questions of college B, hit the compare button, go to college \nC. Then you can bring up and compare all of these schools. I think \nstudents and their families would make wiser decisions if they could \ncompare one school to another. That is hard to do today, almost \nimpossible to do today. But that is the kind of transparency parents \nand children and families need to have.\n  I look forward to sharing that proposal, as I said, in the next few \nweeks. I state publicly: Anyone who has ideas on this and would like to \nhave them incorporated in our bill, please come to our staff or see me. \nWe will try to work it through. As I said, I do want to approach this \non a bipartisan basis and work this out. Higher education is too \nimportant to our society, to our future as a country, to be a partisan \ntype of approach. It has to be bipartisan.\n  College affordability, skyrocketing student debt, accountability, \ntransparency, all are very high-stakes issues for our students and \ntheir families and for our future as a country. Certainly in today's \ndifficult economy, with young Americans in particular struggling to \nfind good employment and a foothold in life, it is unacceptable to ask \nstudents, graduates, and their families to shoulder unnecessarily high \nstudent loan interest payments.\n  That is why this bill is so important for us to pass tomorrow, I \nguess, when it comes up for a vote. I hope we can pass this, and then I \nhope we can move on with the rest of what we need to do in higher \neducation, as I said, on accountability, on transparency, and \naffordability. If we can get a good vote and pass this student debt \nbill so we can start lowering interest rates, that would be the first \nstep toward addressing the issues confronting us in higher education. I \nhope we can get bipartisan support for this measure tomorrow and then \nmove on to the other issues we have to address in higher education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, before I address the issue of college \naffordability, I want to send my condolences to the families in Oregon, \nanother community ravaged by a school shooting, the 37th of 2014, the \n74th school shooting since Sandy Hook. Those are pretty stunning \nnumbers: 37 school shootings this year alone, more than 1 a week; 74 \nschool shootings since Sandy Hook.\n  I will make the comment one more time, that we are becoming \naccomplices in these mass murders. We are becoming complicit in this \nmurder of children all across our country. When we do nothing, when we \nsit on our hands idly as children are gunned down all across our \ncountry, we send a message of acceptance that we can do practical \nthings that will lessen the chance that people will be killed in our \nschools and in our homes and in our neighborhoods.\n  I will not go through the list right now, but we also can send a \nmessage that enough is enough. That message, frankly at this point, is \nprobably just as important as the practical effects of the laws we \nwould change.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her great work on bringing the \nissue of college affordability to the point where we have reached a \nnational debate around what we can do to try to relieve families of the \ncrippling debt sitting on top of them today. As the youngest Member of \nthis body, I perhaps know in as personal terms as anyone else about \nwhat this burden means for my wife and myself who continue to owe money \non our student loans, and for our neighbors and friends who are in \nsimilar positions.\n  I want to tell you a story today of one such family, a namesake of \nmine, the Murphys from Killingworth--no relation. Dennis Murphy \nrecently wrote me about his family's story. Dennis is 52 years old and \nhas five kids. His parents emigrated here from County Kerry, Ireland, \nand he was born in New York. His family lived in a small apartment in \nthe Bronx. While Dennis was still a boy, his family moved to a house in \nEast Haven, CT, which his father called the promised land.\n  His father died at the age of 50, when Dennis was 14 years old. Since \nthe family was poor and the father did not have life insurance, Dennis \ncould not afford to go to college himself, so he went straight to work. \nHe was lucky enough to find a job working for the railroad, working as \na locomotive engineer for Metro North. He still works at that job, \nDennis does, making a good living and earning a solid upper middle-\nclass salary.\n  Dennis wanted to provide a better life for his own family. So he \nworked as much as he could, took as many hours as he could, he took as \nmany extra shifts as possible, he worked on holidays, and he was \neventually able to make his life better, make his family's life a \nlittle bit better. They bought a house in Killingworth. He hoped his \nkids would get to go to college. One of his daughters has a learning \ndisability and needs extra support, so that took up a decent amount of \nthe family's income, but his oldest son Dennis Murphy, Jr., was a good \nstudent in high school, made the honor roll.\n  When Dennis junior was accepted to the University of Albany, Dennis \nwas so proud that his son would receive the college degree that he \nnever did. Dennis junior worked since the age of 16 to do his part to \nbe able to afford college. He continued working all throughout college. \nDennis junior seldom asked his dad for any money. Unlike many of his \nfriends, Dennis junior actually graduated within 4 years.\n  But the family still had to contribute to Dennis junior's education. \nSo without any money saved away, with money going to pay for the house \nand for raising five kids and for their daughter's learning \ndisabilities, Dennis had to take out PLUS loans that ultimately totaled \nover $100,000. Because the interest rate on the loans is fixed at 8.5 \npercent, the minimum monthly payments were around $700 to $800 a month. \nWith their mortgage payments and the rest of their living expenses, \nDennis cannot afford to pay this amount, even with his good salary. \nFrankly, like a lot of Americans, he did not realize when he first took \nthe loans how the interest would add up over 4 years, nor did he \nunderstand how much the monthly payments would be.\n  The stress of wondering how they are ever going to pay back this huge \ndebt has caused a lot of tension in the family, a lot of arguments \nwithin his formerly close family. Sometimes Dennis says he wonders \nwhether he should have let his son go to college at all. Even though \nDennis junior has a new good job earning $20 an hour because of his \ndegree, it is not enough for him to be able to contribute significantly \nto paying off these loans either.\n  Dennis's family came to America, got that little apartment in the \nBronx for reasons that are familiar to nearly every one of us in this \nChamber, this idea that if you came to the United States, you had a \nshot to move and move quickly, a fair shot at economic mobility. My \nfamily came from Ireland about two generations before Dennis's, but it \nwas the same reason that brought them here to the United States. It was \neducation that was the vehicle for advancement.\n  You know, it was not a myth. It was not a story that they told in \nplaces such as Ireland and Italy and Poland. It was true that if you \ncame here and did your work and played by the rules and saved a little \nbit of money you could go to college and you could do significantly \nbetter than your parents did. But the reality is that idea, that truism \nof America being the home of the greatest level of economic mobility in \nthe world is becoming a myth. The odds today that a young person will \ngo to college if their parents did not is 29 percent.\n  That is one of the lowest rates in the industrialized world. Think of \nit the other way. Seventy percent of kids whose parents didn't go to \ncollege will never go to college. Seventy percent of kids who didn't go \nto college will essentially be destined to live the same\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nlife and take in the same income level their parents did. That is a \nstunning lack of economic mobility.\n  The truth is that it is getting worse specifically for a particular \ngroup of Americans. For African Americans, the gap between those with a \ncollege degree in the African-American community and in the White \ncommunity has gone from 13 points 20 years ago to 20 points today. The \ngap for Latinos was 18 points 20 years ago, and it is 25 points today. \nSo for African Americans and Latinos, that dream of economic mobility \nis getting even further away than for other folks.\n  America used to be No. 1 in the world with respect to the amount of \nyoung adults with college degrees. We are 12th in the world today. In a \nvery short period of time we have gone from leading the world in \ncollege graduates to becoming rather middling.\n  You don't, frankly, need a college degree for one thing: You don't \nneed a college degree to figure out why fewer people have college \ndegrees. Here it is: Since 1989 the cost of college has gone up by 307 \npercent and income for the average family has gone up by 72 percent. \nYou don't need a degree in mathematics or a graduate degree in rocket \nscience to understand that when you have this disparity between the \ngrowth in income and the growth in the cost of college, you are going \nto leave millions of families on the outside when it comes to accessing \nthe apparatus of opportunity that has historically made this country \nthe place where economic mobility was more real than anywhere else.\n  That is why this piece of legislation this week matters so much--\nbecause to Dennis the numbers are not going to lie. Dennis is going to \ngo from paying 8.5 percent to about 6.4 percent. You think that is only \nabout 2 percentage points. That is thousands of dollars in savings for \nthe Murphys--thousands of dollars that today they don't have. That \nstory can be multiplied hundreds of thousands of times. We think there \nare about 300,000 families just in the State of Connecticut who are \ngoing to be able to access a lower rate of interest based on the \nlegislation we are going to pass this week. These numbers are pretty \nstunning, but the fact is that there are stories like Dennis's all \nacross my State and all across this country, and we can do something \nabout it this week.\n  As Senator Harkin said--and let me finish with the thought that this \nis the beginning of the work we have to do--the reality is that it is \nvery important to give students access to lower cost loans, as we will \nhopefully do this week. It is very important to lower the borrowing \nburden for families who have already taken out loans, but we actually \nhave to get serious about this number. We actually have to get serious \nabout bending this curve so that college isn't 307 percent more \nexpensive another 20 years from today.\n  So I hope that in the reauthorization bill our committee, the HELP \nCommittee, is going to undertake, an idea that has been put forward by \nmyself, Senator Schatz, Senator Sanders, and Senator Murray will get a \nfair airing; that is, the idea that we should start expecting some \naccountability when it comes to these schools that are getting billions \nof dollars in Federal aid. We send out $140 billion in Federal aid \nevery year, and we really have very loose standards when it comes to \naffordability and outcome.\n  A group of schools is under the for-profit umbrella of a company \ncalled Corinthian in California. It has 50 percent of its students \ndropping out after 1 year and 36 percent of its students defaulting on \ntheir student loans. They charge $41,000 for a paralegal degree, and \nthe local community college charges $2,500. That is a miserable set of \noutcomes. That is a total lack of affordability. Yet they collect $1.6 \nbillion every year in Federal aid--$1.6 billion in Federal aid every \nyear. Federal aid means you and me. Our taxpayer dollars are going to a \nschool that is doing nothing about affordability and is delivering very \nbad outcomes.\n  So this bill is very important for the Murphys and hundreds of \nthousands of families like them. But our work is not done. It is time \nfor us to agree that in addition to making it easier for students and \nfamilies to afford college, it is finally time for Congress to put some \nreal pressure on these schools to do something about the cost of \ntuition and the quality of degrees they provide. I am going to be very \nexcited to cast my vote for this week's legislation, for the Murphys--\nno relation--and thousands of families like them in Connecticut.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I rise today because we need a fair shot for the middle \nclass. To join and stay in the middle class today, a college degree is \nmore important than ever. In Hawaii, by 2018 about two of every three \njobs will need some training or a degree past high school. But students \nare struggling to get ahead. We all know college costs have gone up way \nbeyond inflation and students are borrowing more and more to pay for \ncollege.\n  Last week I joined several of the women in the Senate. We pointed out \nthat student loan debt affects women more. Why? Because it takes longer \nto repay a student loan if, as a woman, you are making only 77 cents \nfor every $1 a man makes.\n  I have heard from both men and women in Hawaii who are struggling \nunder the burden of student loan debt, people such as Dawn from \nHonolulu, who told me, ``I've been teaching for over 3 years and can \nbarely survive on my paycheck after paying student loans and rent,'' \nand Karen from Hilo, who said, ``Two of my three kids have loans that \nare almost non-repayable, given their size. They have a master's and \nalmost-completed a PhD and one is home already using her expertise on \nour community. The other is coming this fall. Our prices are \nprohibitive enough without excessively high loans hanging over their \nheads.''\n  Their stories are not unique. Last year over 20,000 Hawaii \nundergraduates used Federal loans to pay for school. In Hawaii the \naverage graduate with a bachelor's degree has over $23,000 in student \nloan debt.\n  Nationwide, overall student loan debt has skyrocketed to over $1.2 \ntrillion. I know previous speakers have talked about that, but it bears \nrepeating--$1.2 trillion nationwide in student loan debt. That is more \nthan credit card debt or auto debt. The burden of student loan debt \nmakes it very difficult to buy a home or start a family. Older Federal \nstudent loans are stuck at high rates of interest, and there is no \noption to refinance. Private loans often have even fewer consumer \nprotections and higher rates.\n  In 2007 I was on the House-Senate conference committee for the bill \nthat created the income-based loan repayment program signed into law by \nPresident Bush.\n  This week President Obama took Executive action to help more \nborrowers cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their \nincome. The administration will also extend partnerships with private \ncompanies, departments, and nonprofits to increase consumer protections \nand get the word out on existing programs. These are positive steps and \nones that I have urged the President to take. But the President can \nonly do so much on his own to help with student loan debt. Congress \nneeds to do its part.\n  The bill we are discussing on the floor today would allow student \nloans to be refinanced down to today's low rate for new borrowers. \nThink about it. Just as homeowners can refinance a mortgage, we should \nallow student loans to be refinanced. Last year there was overwhelming \nbipartisan support for a bill keeping the student loan rates low for \nnew loans.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues to join Democrats once again in voting \nfor today's refinancing bill.\n  In addition to today's bill, I wish to point out another way we can \ncombat student loan debt. A big reason students are taking on so much \ndebt to go to college is the decline in State and Federal grants. Fewer \ncollege grants means more reliance on loans, resulting in more student \ndebt.\n  In recent years State support for higher education has dropped. From \n2008 to 2012 State higher education spending per student plummeted by \n28 percent. That is a cut of over $2,000 per student on average.\n  At the Federal level, the Pell grant was once our main commitment to \nour students. Pell grants were the primary form of student aid to help \nlow- and moderate-income students join and stay in the middle class.\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\n  Like the GI bill after World War II, which invested in our veterans, \ninvesting in low-income and moderate-income students pays off. From a \nstrictly economic standpoint, we know these students get degrees, get \nbetter jobs, and pay taxes.\n  In the 1970s the Federal Pell grant covered nearly 80 percent of the \ncost of attendance at a 4-year instate public university. Today the \nPell grant covers less than one-third.\n  To make matters worse, Congress chipped away at Pell grant \neligibility and completely cut off the year-round Pell grant. In 2011, \nbefore this year-round program was eliminated, over 1,600 highly \nmotivated Hawaii college students used year-round Pell grants to get a \ndegree sooner. They are among 1.2 million students nationwide who used \nyear-round Pell grants in that year alone.\n  One of those Hawaii students works in my office now--my University of \nHawaii law school fellow, Janna Wehilani Ahu, who is on the floor with \nme. Her family is from a small fishing village in rural Hawaii Island. \nShe graduated from Kamehameha Schools, the University of Hawaii at \nManoa, and now attends the university's William S. Richardson School of \nLaw. She used a summer Pell grant in 2010, and without it she says she \nwouldn't have been able to attend summer school and move more quickly \ntoward a degree.\n  Wehi is one of many Hawaii students who have told me how Pell grants \nhelped them. Another student, Lehua from Waianae, wrote:\n\n       I would like to thank you for supporting the Pell Grant \n     program. Pell Grants have allowed me to increase my education \n     and [have] provided me with a higher paying job. Who would \n     ever think that a country girl from Wai'anae--who grew up \n     with society telling me that we had the lowest reading and \n     math scores in the state of Hawaii, the highest of everything \n     such as welfare, crime, teen pregnancy and substance abuse in \n     the state--can get a college degree.\n       Today, I . . . want to help people from Wai'anae to achieve \n     their dreams.\n\n  Pell grants have made it possible for this Native Hawaiian, single \nmother, and country girl--as she calls herself--to be graduating with \nan associate's degree in early childhood education and transferring to \nthe University of Hawaii West Oahu.\n  With ever-increasing college costs, we should be strengthening Pell \ngrants, not cutting back on them. That is why I introduced the Pell \nGrant Protection Act with several my colleagues. Recognizing the \nimportance of Pell grants, Congress has been providing discretionary \nfunds for this program for over 40 years. It is time to put this \nprogram on the strong footing our students deserve by making this a \nmandatory funded program with a cost-of-living adjustment. The bill \nwould also include an updated, clearer version of the year-round Pell \ngrant.\n  The bill has the support of 25 national organizations representing \nstudents, professors, financial aid administrators, college presidents, \nand advocates for the middle class. The Associated Students of the \nUniversity of Hawaii passed a resolution of support, and several \nUniversity of Hawaii campus chancellors have also come out in support.\n  I also worked with my colleague, Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, \non a related Pell grant bill--her Middle Class CHANCE Act. Senator \nLandrieu's bill would restore year-round Pell grants, increase the Pell \naward to keep up with college costs, and let students use Pell grants \nfor more semesters.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Harkin on these and other \nbills to make college more affordable. These efforts are investments in \nour young people and in our collective future. Today is a start, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote for Senator Warren's refinancing bill.\n  Mahalo.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Hawaii stories \nof student loan debt.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Hawaii Stories of Student Loan Debt\n\n       Dawn from Honolulu wrote me to say:\n       ``I've been teaching for over 3 years and can barely \n     survive on my paycheck, after paying student loans and \n     rent.''\n       Karen from Hilo wrote me to say:\n       ``Two of my three kids have loans that are almost non-\n     repayable, given their size. They have a masters and almost-\n     completed PhD and one is home already using her expertise on \n     our community. The other is coming this fall. Our prices are \n     prohibitive enough without excessively high loans hanging \n     over their heads.''\n       Jennifer from Kailua wrote:\n       ``My mortgage is 3.25% but my $133,000 federal student loan \n     . . . is stuck at 7.25%. Please . . . allow me to consolidate \n     [or] refinance my loan.\n       ``It is totally unfair that the federal government made \n     more profit in 2013 off student loans than Apple made off its \n     2013 sales.''\n       Janna Wehilani Ahu's family is from a small fishing village \n     in rural Hawaii Island, and she made it to Kamehameha \n     Schools, UH Manoa, and UN Richardson School of Law. She used \n     a summer Pell Grant in 2010, and without it, she says she \n     wouldn't have been able to take summer school and move \n     quicker toward a degree. This outstanding student works in my \n     office right now--she's our UN Law School Patsy Mink fellow.\n       Ariana Ursua, who just finished her sophomore year at UH \n     Manoa wrote me to say:\n       ``As a 19-year-old paying for her own education, it's been \n     stressful having to take out loans to receive a higher \n     education. Thankfully, the Pell Grant decreases the amount of \n     money I have to borrow. I am so grateful every time I \n     complete my FAFSA and see that my Estimated Family \n     Contribution is zero because I know that I'm granted the full \n     Pell Grant amount. I have received about $10,000 from the \n     Pell Grant for the past two years, which means less money I \n     have to worry about paying back. If I didn't receive \n     financial aid, such as the Pell Grant, I would be a lot more \n     discouraged to further my education due to finances. \n     Fortunately, the Pell Grant helps me sleep a little easier \n     and study a little harder, and I am forever thankful.''\n       Lehua from Waianae wrote me to say:\n       ``I would like to thank you for supporting the Pell Grant \n     program.

He wrote me:\n       ``If it wasn't for the Pell Grant, I wouldn't have gone to \n     college. In fact, when I graduated from high school, I went \n     to a bartending school because I didn't think my family could \n     afford to send me to college. Now I am going for my PhD, so \n     the Pell Grant was pretty important for my path in life.\n       ``Between the federal Pell Grant and the state grant, my \n     tuition, books, and transportation costs were covered so I \n     didn't have to take out any loans at that time.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3530-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3530-S3531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ARMY-McCARTHY HEARINGS ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I had the pleasure of speaking \nyesterday while the Presiding Officer was in the chair on the 242nd \nanniversary of the burning and sinking of the Gaspee by Rhode Island \npatriots. I am here today to mark the 60th anniversary of a different \nevent which also occurred on the same day--June 9--60 years ago. It was \na pivotal moment in the history of the Senate and, indeed, of the \ncountry. It was the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings and the exchange\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nbetween Joseph Welch and Joseph McCarthy that changed this city and the \nworld.\n  Six decades ago, America's national mood was marked by anxiety over \nthe looming threat of communism. The victory of World War II had given \nway to the gripping tension of the Cold War. Communist power was on the \nrise in Eastern Europe and in China. American forces were at war in \nKorea.\n  Here in Congress the House Committee on Un-American Activities worked \nto sniff out Communist subversion within our borders, including the \ninfamous Hollywood black list. One man in the Senate set out to exploit \nthe fears of that time, and he came to symbolize the fearmongering of \nthat fretful era.\n  Joseph McCarthy was a relatively unknown junior Senator from \nWisconsin when, in February of 1950, he delivered a speech accusing \nSecretary of State Dean Acheson of harboring 205 known members of the \nAmerican Communist Party within the State Department.\n  The charge was questionable and ill-supported. But the brazen \naccusation struck a nerve with an anxious American public, and Senator \nMcCarthy rocketed to fame. Thus began a chilling crusade to flush out \nCommunist subversion--real or contrived--from every corner of American \nsociety.\n  McCarthy's anticommunist witch hunt seemingly knew no bounds, as he \nlaunched investigations or often just allegations of disloyalty on the \npart of private citizens, public employees, entire government agencies, \nas well as the broadcasting and defense industries, universities--even \nthe United Nations.\n  In 1953, the Republican Party gained a majority in the Senate, and \nMcCarthy ascended to the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on \nGovernment Operations and its Subcommittee on Investigations. From \nthose chairmanships, he dragged hundreds of witnesses before scores of \nhearings, publicly shaming and berating his targets. His fiery rhetoric \nand his remorseless mendacity intimidated critics and challengers. His \naccusations carried the power to destroy reputations, careers, and \nlives.\n  The effect of McCarthyism on 20th century American society was toxic. \nPrudent citizens shied from civic engagement. Meaningful political \ndissent withered. Criticism of American foreign policy evaporated. Even \ncollege campuses, our cradles of intellectual curiosity, were cowed by \nMcCarthyism.\n  Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas called it ``the black \nsilence of fear.'' Intimidated colleagues in this Chamber gave Joe \nMcCarthy broad leeway to abuse Congress's constitutional powers of \ninvestigation and oversight. Harvard Law Dean Erwin Griswold described \nChairman McCarthy's role as ``judge, jury, prosecutor, castigator, and \npress agent, all in one.''\n  This was the regime 60 years ago, in 1954, when U.S. Army officials \naccused McCarthy of exerting improper pressure to win preferential \ntreatment for a subcommittee aide serving as an Army private. McCarthy \ncountered that the Army accusation was retaliation for his \ninvestigations of them. The stage was set. The countercharges would be \nadjudicated, of course, in McCarthy's Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  The so-called Army-McCarthy hearings, held in a packed, smoke-filled \nRussell caucus room, would last 36 days and be aired on live broadcast \ntelevision. Twenty million Americans tuned in during gavel-to-gavel \ncoverage of our Nation's first great TV political spectacle--the \nprecursor to the Watergate hearings, the Iran-Contra hearings, and the \nThomas-Hill hearings.\n  Special counsel to the Army in those hearings was an avuncular Boston \nlawyer named Joseph Welch of the law firm then called Hale & Dorr. \nHere, in Washington, Joseph Welch was a nobody. He had no office, he \nhad no position, he had no clout. But he was a good lawyer with a dry \nwit and unflappable demeanor. He also had a sense of fairness--a sense \nof fairness that was soon to become famously provoked by McCarthy's \nbullying. And he had that greatest virtue--courage--the virtue that \nmakes all other virtues possible.\n  On June 9, 1954, Joseph Welch challenged Senator McCarthy's aide, Roy \nCohn, to actually produce McCarthy's supposed secret list of \nsubversives working at defense facilities. Since there likely was no \nsuch list, McCarthy needed a distraction. So he lit into an accusatory \nattack in a traditional McCarthyite way on a lawyer in Welch's firm, a \nyoung lawyer--indeed, an associate within the firm, Fred Fisher, a \nyoung man who was not even in the hearing room to defend himself--\naccusing him of various Communist associations and inclinations.\n  Welch responded:\n\n       Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged \n     your cruelty or your recklessness.\n\n  Had Senator McCarthy been a smarter man, he would have sensed the \nwarning in those words. But he didn't. He pressed his attack and \nrefused to let up on young Fred Fisher. Welch angrily cut Senator \nMcCarthy short.\n\n       Let us not assassinate the lad any further, Senator. You \n     have done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long \n     last? Have you left no sense of decency?\n\n  Thirty words. If you count them, it is just 30 words. But with those \n30 words, suddenly something happened, something changed. The emperor \nsuddenly had no clothes.\n  There had been such an avalanche of words from McCarthy over the \nyears--of lies, of accusations, of hyperbole. And these 30 words--these \nfew short sentences--stopped all of that roughshod hypocrisy in its \ntracks.\n  Welch declared an end to McCarthy's questioning, and the gallery of \nonlookers, on behalf of a nation, burst into applause. The black-and-\nwhite footage shows McCarthy asking Roy Cohn, ``What happened?'' What \nhappened was that a spell was broken. The web of fear woven by McCarthy \nover Washington, DC, began unraveling.\n  Near the end of the hearing, Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri \nfaced McCarthy down. After an angry exchange, he rose and walked out to \ncome here to vote. As Chairman Karl Mundt of South Dakota gaveled the \nhearing into recess, Joe McCarthy kept on railing about Communist \nconspiracies. As he railed on, Senators, reporters, and members of the \ngathered audience steadily filed out of the room, leaving him shouting. \nThe spell was broken.\n  Six months later the Senate voted 67 to 22 to censure Senator Joseph \nMcCarthy. Four years later, he was dead at the age of 48. Historians \nagree he drank himself to death. His fall from grace and demise were \nnearly as rapid as his rise was meteoric, consistent with the ancient \nprinciple: Climb ugly; fall hard.\n  Very often--indeed, too often--political outcomes in Washington are \ndetermined by the political weight and the wealth of contesting forces \nvying for power. It is brute force against brute force. It makes us \nwonder, is that all there is to this? Is this just an arena of combat, \nwhere huge special interests lean against each other trying to shove \neach other around, each for their own greed and benefit?\n  This incident 60 years ago is an eternal lesson of what a difference \none person can make. A regular American, a nobody in Washington, good \nat his craft, good in his character, and in the right place at the \nright time, a man who knew what was right, broke the fever of virulent \npolitical frenzy that had captured Washington; one private lawyer's \nsincere, direct outrage at a cruel attack on his young associate, a few \nwords from a Boston lawyer who had just had enough turned the tide of \nhistory. May we never forget in this world of vast and often corrupt \npolitical forces the power of one person to make a difference.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3531-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3531-S3535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I was the first in my family to go to \ncollege. I drove an ice cream truck to work my way through Boston \nCollege as a commuter. I did the same thing to go to law school. I \nlived at home all the\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\nway through college and law school in order to be able to afford to go \nto college. As a result, I had to take out Federal loans like so many \nmillions of American students have to do today. But here is the thing. \nIf the owner of the ice cream truck company I worked for wanted to \nrefinance the loan he had for the trucking fleet, he could do that. If \nmy parents wanted to refinance the mortgage on their house, they could \ndo that. But if I wanted to refinance my student loans as would every \nsingle student today, I was out of luck, and that is not right, that is \nnot fair, and that needs to change.\n  In Massachusetts, as the Presiding Officer knows better than anyone, \nwe recognize that education is a ladder of opportunity that allows \nevery child to maximize their God-given abilities. It is the best path \nto middle class success and economic opportunity. The big dreams of \ncollege should never be thwarted by the small print of student loan \nagreements. The economic opportunities that students have because they \ngraduate should not be accompanied by the hopelessness from \noverwhelming debt--almost like the mythical Sisyphus with a boulder on \nhis shoulders, trying to go up the side of a mountain. That is how \nstudents feel with their student debt as they graduate from colleges \nand universities across this country. So in the same way that mortgage \nrefinancing helps mortgage holders who are underwater, students \ndrowning in debt should benefit from refinancing their student loans at \na lower rate.\n  Today more than 70 percent of America's students borrow money to \nattend college. The average student graduates from college owing nearly \n$30,000. Americans today owe almost $1.2 trillion in student loans, \nmore than is owed on credit cards. Almost 1 million people in \nMassachusetts currently owe more than $24 billion in student debt. \nThirty percent of young borrowers nationwide are unable to keep up with \ntheir payments and are in default, forbearance or deferment. That kind \nof debt makes it difficult to start a family, buy a home or save for \nretirement. Reports show that high student loan debt deters our \npromising minds from enrolling in graduate programs. That means fewer \nhighly skilled workers, which harms our economy now and makes us less \ncompetitive in the world economy in the future.\n  There is a way to make it easier for those of us who have student \nloan debts and to put more money in their pockets every single month. \nThat is to listen to the wisdom of our Presiding Officer, to make sure \nthat people here in this Chamber and across our country listen to this \nguiding light that you are creating for our country to be able to move \nfrom this present world where debt so saddles young people that they \nreally cannot ever plan to realize all of their dreams, to a new vision \nof what might be possible in lowering this burden on young people \nacross our country.\n  Last year the Congress passed legislation that lowered Federal \nstudent loan interest rates for new borrowers but did nothing for \nexisting borrowers. So today interest rates for new borrowers are just \nunder 4 percent while rates for older borrowers are around 7 percent \nfor recent undergraduates and even higher for some older borrowers. The \nbill which you have introduced as the senior Senator from Massachusetts \nsimply allows 25 million eligible student loan borrowers the option of \nrefinancing down to the rates offered to new Federal student loan \nborrowers this year.\n  The bill allows eligible student loan borrowers to refinance their \nprivate loans into the Federal program. Many parents cosigned the \nprivate loans for their children and are on the hook if their children \ndefault on these loans. Your legislation will save existing student \nloan borrowers thousands of dollars to help them get ahead, not fall \nbehind. This money can be used to help pay for the downpayment on a new \nhome, to start a new business or to start a family. This is one more \nway to give Americans a fair shot at the American dream. So we thank \nyou for your leadership on this issue. We thank you for laying out a \npathway to make it a slightly easier place for young people to be as \nthey leave college, as they have this debt on their shoulders.\n  When I was in school the interest rate was 3 percent. Those loans \nwere called national defense student loans. Emblazoned over the Boston \nPublic Library it reads: ``The education of its people is the best \ndefense of a nation.'' That is what it says across the Boston Public \nLibrary. That is what we have to once again understand, that the first \ngeneration that was the beneficiary had 3 percent loans. This \ngeneration--in a much more wealthy country--has loans at 6, 7, 8, 9 \npercent and more, and that just makes it very difficult for them to \nmaximize their God-given abilities in the same way that the Members of \nthe Senate were able to maximize theirs.\n  We have a responsibility to this generation to go back to that \noriginal message, to go back to that incredible plan that was put \ntogether after World War II to finally democratize access to education \nfor every family, for every child who wanted to work towards improving \nthemselves. Those national defense student loans understood that the \nbest defense of a Nation is the education of its people. That is how we \npreserve order and liberty within our society, and that is what your \nproposal does.\n  By using the Buffett rule, by using the offset which says to \nbillionaires and millionaires in our country that you are just going to \npay the same taxes as the middle class, well, then we finance something \nthat is really critical. We finance the dreams and the hopes of young \npeople in our country, so that the debt they have to shoulder after \nthey leave college is not so burdensome that they never really can \nfully realize their dreams.\n  So I ask all my colleagues to support Senator Warren's legislation. I \nthink it is going to be without question at the top of the list of the \nmost important work we do in this Chamber this year, and I call upon my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to respond in the kind of \nbipartisan way that the American people want, those 40 million families \nthat need relief from this oppressive burden of student loan debt.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer for her leadership.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, tomorrow the Senate has a historic \nand magnificent opportunity to increase everybody's fair shot at the \nAmerican dream--everyone's fair shot at a college education that \nenables and opens the American dream to people who come from families \nwhere college was an unachievable aspiration. I know about those \nfamilies because I come from one of them. I am the first man in my \nfamily to have a college education, not to mention the opportunity to \ngo to law school.\n  There are a couple of hard, practical facts, apart from all the \nrhetoric about the American dream. The fact is today college education \nis a major--maybe the most important determinant--of income. It is one \nof the major determinants of employment. The employment rate for \ncollege graduates is much higher than for those who lack it. In fact, \nthe unemployment rates for college graduates are half or less than what \nthey are for those who lack that education.\n  College education--in fact, education in general--is the single most \nimportant instrument of social mobility in this country. It is a way \nfor people to reach the middle class or for families to stay in the \nmiddle class. Right now, the middle class is squeezed in every \ndirection by so many different economic factors and pressures, and the \ncost of a college education is one of the most pressing of them.\n  So we have the opportunity tomorrow to enable countless people to \ntake advantage of the American dream in a very hardheaded, practical \nway by enabling all college graduates or others who have student loans \nto reduce the charges--the interest rates--on those loans to a lower \nrate that is the lowest rate acceptable.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her leadership in championing this \ncause before it reached the Senate floor--way before it became the \nfashionable and\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\npopular issue it has become. I thank also the President of the United \nStates who, by Executive action, has helped to ease the burden of those \ncollege loans to thousands of current student debtholders. He has \nrecognized the importance of reducing that burden by expanding a \nprogram that was passed by Congress in 2010, tying monthly student debt \npayments to a portion of the debtholder's discretionary income. He has \nexpanded that program to include many of those debtholders before the \ndate that it is currently operative, and I thank him for that step, but \nit is a minor step compared to what we have the opportunity to do \ntomorrow in realizing an opening to the American dream for many \nstudents who have already been through education and now carry interest \nrates on their debt of 8, 10, 11 percent. It is an opportunity not only \nfor them to reduce that interest rate but also for the economy to take \nadvantage of their purchasing power that will be unleashed--consumer \ndemands that will be enlarged--because people are more likely to buy \nhomes, start families, begin businesses, become entrepreneurs, be \ninnovators and inventors, who right now are making career choices \nbecause they are saddled with debt that forces them to pay interest \nrates much higher than current students do.\n  It is not a forgiveness program. They will continue to pay the \nprincipal on that debt. It is not a free ride or a handout. They simply \nget the benefit of the interest rates that our friends across the aisle \nthought was absolutely right, just months ago, when applied to the \nexisting program.\n  So this opportunity is a commonsense, simple measure to provide some \nrelief to people struggling under a debt load that is suffocating to \nthem, their futures, their families, and our economy's future.\n  I believe sincerely there are equally important measures that \neventually we need to take in this body, in this Congress, in this \nNation, to make college more affordable. The costs of tuition and \ncollege expenses need to be brought down. The grants we provide--so-\ncalled Pell grants--and scholarships that come from other sources need \nto be expanded and increased. The opportunities for people who incur \ndebt to work down or work off that debt through public service can be \ndramatically and drastically enhanced for their benefit and for the \nbenefit of our communities and country that will stand to be \nforthcoming by their policing, their teaching, their firefighting, \ntheir public service that can be, in effect, rewarded and incentivized \nby enabling them to work down or work off those debts.\n  These programs are a moral imperative, as is affording the \nopportunity of students to discharge in bankruptcy those debts when \nthey simply cannot fulfill them, but this idea of giving everybody the \nbenefit of the lowest possible interest rates that will be part of the \nbill we vote on tomorrow is a solid and sound and vitally important \nbeginning.\n  We enable homeowners to refinance and car buyers to refinance and \nmany other kinds of debtholders to refinance but not student loans. \nThat is a discrimination, maybe not unlawful but still a distinction \nthat makes no sense either from the standpoint of our economy or the \ninterests of the debtors. So I hope we will give them a fair shot but \nalso impose a basic and fundamental tenet, an ethos of fairness: If it \nis good enough for home loans and car loans, why not for student loans?\n  We should not be adopting policies that encourage people to give up \non their dreams. In fact, we ought to be doing just the opposite, \nmaking young people feel their dreams are within reach.\n  I will close by saying to my colleagues that in the last months I \nhave been listening around the State of Connecticut--at roundtables and \nmeetings--to both high school students and college students about this \nissue of college affordability. What is so inspiring to me, in the \nmeetings I have had--in places such as Ansonia, Windham, and \nBridgeport--is the drive and determination of our students to embark on \na college education. They know its value, its realistic value, its \ncost, and they want to do it because they know it is a way up. They are \ngaining and they are giving back.\n  But many of them have to make compromises. They have been admitted to \nschools. Their first choice is a first-rate school, but they cannot put \ntogether the package financially that will enable them to go. It is \nbeyond reach financially, even as it is within their grasp \nintellectually. So they may compromise--maybe the first of other \ncompromises that they will make throughout their lives, as they pursue \ncareers, as they have to make hard choices. But at that age, those \ncompromises should not be driven simply by financial imperatives. They \nshould have the best education that is possible for them, and this \ncountry should make it available, not just for their sake but for all \nof ours.\n  I have been listening to college students who are leaving--at the \ncommencement addresses I have given at law schools, as well as \ncolleges--listening to students talk about their futures as well, \nfutures that will be compromised because of the debt they have, an \naverage of $27,000 to $30,000 in the State of Connecticut alone, and it \nis similar in many States around the country and the reason we have \n$1.2 trillion in debt overall today.\n  They will compromise in doing a job that may be more lucrative but \nless rewarding, less so to them and less so to our economy, less so to \nour society--a lesser way of earning a living in terms of its impact in \ncontributing to our social fabric, qualify of life. They may not be \nteaching, they may not be policing, they may not be doing things that \ngive back to our society because they need the income, the higher \nincome to pay back that debt.\n  So those compromises affect all of us as well. They are done because \nthey simply cannot afford either to go to the school of their first \nchoice or the career of their first choice, but the government can \nafford to give them a lower interest rate. We know the government can \ndo so because right now it is profiting off the backs of students in \nbillions and billions of dollars. The estimates range, over a 5-year \nperiod, from $66 billion to other amounts. We know the government will \ncontinue to profit even at lower interest rates from the Student Loan \nProgram.\n  So let's have less profit to the government, better well-being in our \ncommunities, and fairer treatment for our students--a fair shot for \nthem and their families and for all who have as their objective simply \nto better their lives and gain a fair shot at the American dream.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about a challenge that is \nconfronting our middle-class families all across my home State of \nPennsylvania and across the country. The Presiding Officer knows this \nissue well and has worked tirelessly to enact measures of public policy \nto confront this problem. We have an opportunity now with her \nleadership, as well as other leaders in the Senate, to work together on \nwhat I think is the kind of legislation that will help those middle-\nincome families.\n  The Bank on Students Emergency Refinancing Act, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor, is an opportunity for the Senate, folks in both parties who \nhear from middle-class families all the time about a range of issues. I \ndoubt there is any issue we hear about more often than the cost of \nhigher education. So I wish--as I am sure many other Members of this \nbody do--to ensure that every student in our States, and for me every \nstudent in Pennsylvania, gets something very fundamental, a fair shot \nto attend college and reach their full potential.\n  The bill we are considering would help students who have private and \npublic loans in good standing from before July 1 of 2013. It allows \nthem the chance to refinance those loans at a 3.6 percent interest \nlevel, the level that was agreed to in last summer's bipartisan student \nloan compromise. This compromise, as we might remember, passed the \nSenate overwhelmingly, 81 to 18.\n  With interest rates near record lows, homeowners, businesses, and \neven local\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\ngovernments with good credit regularly can refinance their debts, but \nfew if any students have that same option. Why should more Americans \nnot be helped by the opportunity to pay a lower interest rate?\n  That is a question I think we all ask tonight and in the days we are \ndebating this issue. More than 40 million Americans owe almost $1.2 \ntrillion in student loan debt, much more than is owed, for example, on \ncredit cards. According to the Institute for College Access & Success, \nas of the year 2012 Pennsylvania ranked third in the Nation in the \nhighest average student debt indicated--nearly $32,000 per student is \nthe number in Pennsylvania--and 70 percent of graduates in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania leave college with debt, the fourth \nhighest of any State in the Union. Too many young Americans cannot get \nahead because they cannot get out from under the burden of student \ndebt.\n  Because of their debt, many Americans are unable to buy a home, save \nfor retirement, start a business or even start a family. This hurts the \neconomy terribly and it makes the American dream so much harder for \nyoung Americans to reach. At an 18-year low, the rate of home ownership \namong young people has been cut in half since 2001. A recordbreaking \nnumber of young adults are still living in their parents' homes.\n  This high level of student debt makes it harder for entrepreneurs to \nstart new businesses and create jobs. Entrepreneurial activity among \n20- to 34-year-olds is at the lowest level in 20 years. We know this \nbill can help at least 1.2 million Pennsylvanians and more than 25 \nmillion across the Nation, according to the Department of Education.\n  Based on calculations from the Congressional Research Service, a \ntypical Pennsylvanian who owed the State average, nearly $32,000 in \nstudent debt, would be able to save more than $4,000 over the life of \ntheir loan. This bill would not only save millions for Americans, but \nthe bill itself would save the Federal Government more than $14 billion \nover 10 years, based on figures from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  A college education, we all know, is the surest path to middle-class \nsuccess and is still the best investment a student can make. Getting a \ncollege degree opens the door to job opportunities for the average \nworker. That means $1 million more in earnings over a lifetime compared \nto those who only go as high as a high school diploma.\n  So college education is indeed tied directly to the economic success \nof young people across the country. This bill is a step in the right \ndirection and would do much to tackle the problem of student loan debt. \nHowever, Congress and the Nation still have a lot of work to do to make \ncollege affordable for all of our children. What we are talking about \nis something very fundamental. All we are asking is that the House and \nthe Senate, both parties, come together to give students and their \nfamilies just a fair shot.\n  That is all they are asking for. They are basically saying to us, \nespecially middle-class families are saying to us: You folks in \nWashington talk all the time about the middle class, but you need to \nact on our behalf. Unfortunately, they do not see enough action coming \nout of Washington that directly impacts their lives, that directly has \nan impact on their economic fortune, their economic future.\n  This is one of those rare opportunities with one vote, with one bill \nwe can have a substantial positive impact on the lives of literally \nmillions of Americans as soon as the bill is enacted into law.\n  I would venture to say that when you talk to any middle-class family, \nif student loans and the cost of college is not the No. 1 issue they \nmention, it is certainly in the top two or three. For most middle-class \nfamilies it is No. 1. Yet they have not seen much in the way of direct \naction that we can take in Washington to provide a measure of relief--\nnot a magic wand, not eliminating all the pressure and all the worries \nthat people have when it comes to affording college.\n  This is one bill that can provide some relief, some needed relief, \nespecially when young people are trying to buy a home, invest in their \nfamilies, start a business, and begin their life after higher \neducation. I ask that we all come together on this legislation and \nprovide a measure of relief to middle-class families and, by virtue of \ndoing that, a badly needed injection into our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, tomorrow, the Senate will vote to proceed \nto a bill that I am proud to cosponsor, to allow students to refinance \ntheir student loans at lower interest rates. We must take this \ncommonsense approach to allow those with student loans to take \nadvantage of historically low interest rates.\n  It should go without saying that student loan costs should not rise \nso high that students cannot repay. Yet in recent years, average \ncollege tuition rates have climbed faster than inflation, far outpacing \nstudent financial aid. Since 1985, the cost of attending college has \nrisen by 559 percent, and last school year alone, instate tuition and \nfees at public 4-year institutions were on average 8.3 percent higher \nthan in the previous year.\n  Debt caused by student loans has surpassed the level of credit card \ndebt in the United States. In Vermont, there are 99,000 people with \nFederal student loans representing more than $2 billion in debt. This \nnot only affects those borrowers and their families, but it has a \ndevastating effect on the economy as a whole--particularly in the \nhousing market. Student loan debt is preventing many would-be first-\ntime home buyers from saving enough to afford a down payment. High \nstudent loan debt, combined with the housing lending climate, has left \nmany unable to secure a mortgage. Experts are worried that the high \nlevel of student loan debt is one of the reasons the housing market has \nbeen slow to recover.\n  This bill would help those suffering with the burden of student loan \ndebt by offering them the opportunity to refinance at lower interest \nrates. We offer refinancing options to businesses, homeowners, and even \nlocal governments. These options should be available to students, too. \nThe legislation would help roughly 25 million borrowers keep up with \ntheir student loan payments by allowing them to refinance at the same \nrates that new borrowers receive. Combined with the Executive action \nannounced this week by President Obama to give more students the \nability to cap monthly payments, this bill is an important step toward \nrelieving the student debt burden so many Americans face.\n  I regularly hear from Vermonters about their struggles to afford a \ncollege education, and their concerns about student loan debt after \nthey graduate. Many students are forced to take on significant debt, \nand too often are not able to complete college because of soaring \ncosts. For those students who do go on to graduate, record student loan \ndebt has made getting ahead in today's job market an insurmountable \nchallenge for some students. Students who might otherwise choose to \nwork in the public sector or other historically lower paying jobs like \nprimary health care or teaching professions must make professional \nchoices based solely on their level of debt. Unfortunately, along with \nthe pressure from student loan debt has come an increase in default \nrates among borrowers, which will affect a student's financial \nstability for decades.\n  I have always firmly believed in the importance of a college \neducation. I was the first Leahy in my family to graduate from college. \nEvery young person should have the chance to pursue higher education. \nEducation is a path out of poverty, a road to personal growth, and an \naccess ramp to professional accomplishment and economic security. \nEveryone wins when access to education expands.\n  Each opportunity for a young American to earn a college education is \nalso an opportunity for the Nation's future. Our country's ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace in the future depends on our \nchildren's ability to finance their education. This does not need to be \na partisan issue and should be one where we can find widespread \nagreement.\n  I urge every Senator to help us move ahead to support our students, \ntheir futures, and our country's future. This issue deserves to be \ndebated in the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, when Vermonters contemplate the history of \nour great State, many think fondly of our former State archivist, \nGregory Sanford. With his flowing gray beard and quick wit, Gregory is \na noted scholar on all things relating to Vermont's history and \nculture. Gregory retired from his post as the Vermont State archivist \nin 2012. The appreciation of the extent of Gregory's intellect and \ninfluence is not limited to Vermonters. His impressive career was \nrecently chronicled in Archival Outlook, a publication of the Society \nof American Archivists.\n  Throughout his career, Gregory Sanford served as a critical resource \nfor journalists, legislators, town moderators, and anyone else \nsearching to put today's events into historical context. He brought \nexcitement to the daunting but essential task of preserving State \nrecords. It was his vision, passion, and ability to anticipate the \nmyriad of ways that technology would alter the job of State archivist \nthat set Gregory Sanford apart. As the Archival Outlook piece notes, \nGregory spent his career imagining innovative solutions to difficult \nproblems with limited resources.\n  During his years as State archivist, Gregory was also an ambitious \nauthor who worked to explain how our laws affect the lives of everyday \nVermonters, often invoking colorful analogies to do so. His regular \ncolumn, ``Voices from the Vault,'' never lacked for detail or \nreadership. In short, Gregory brought history to life, and worked \ntirelessly to preserve it, which is precisely why this profile of \nGregory Sanford is entitled, ``The Sense of Wonder.'' My State of \nVermont is so fortunate for his many contributions, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Archival Outlook article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From Archival Outlook]\n\n                          The Sense of Wonder\n\n\n Vermont State Archives and records administration building named for \n                            gregory sanford\n\n                   (By Terry Cook and Helen Samuels)\n\n       Most archivists work in buildings devoted, in whole or \n     part, to preserving historical archives or managing dormant \n     institutional records. Over the course of their careers, some \n     get the opportunity to participate in the design of new \n     buildings for these purposes. A mere handful are privileged \n     to lead teams to conceptualize, design, build, and occupy a \n     combined historical archives and records center. But only \n     rare--and very special--archivists do all that and then have \n     such multipurpose buildings named in their honor--in fact, \n     only one to our knowledge in the United States. Our colleague \n     and friend, Gregory Sanford, is that rarest of archivists. \n     This is his story, or at least the story of why he achieved \n     this signal and singular honor.\\1\\\n       Professional innovator and leader on many fronts, our \n     Gregory is modest to a fault. Part of this is his genuine \n     belief that he is just working away, trying the best he could \n     to make a difference, in a small state in a far corner of the \n     country, neither looking for nor expecting recognition from \n     practicing a profession that he loves so well. Many people in \n     life who are modest have much to be modest about, but not \n     Gregory, for he has envisioned, thought, and accomplished \n     much, and in so doing set some valuable models for our \n     profession.\n       One marvels over the scope of his publications, both formal \n     and scholarly, and much more pervasively and influential, his \n     hundreds of newspaper columns and lively speeches given all \n     across his state, in schools, before local societies, in the \n     broader New England region, and beyond, as well as before \n     hundreds of meetings of legislative committees, all extolling \n     the merits of archives and good records management, \n     demonstrating through story and character, wild analogies and \n     moving metaphors (more on that later!) The power of archives \n     to inform, educate, transform, and amuse--and (as the \n     official building plaque notes) create a ``sense of wonder'' \n     about the past and its impact on all Vermont citizens.\n       He transformed a state papers office of one person located \n     in a tiny office, with shared records storage in the basement \n     of the executive office building, into a dynamic institution, \n     the Vermont State Archives and Records Administration \n     (VSARA), currently with fourteen staff members, an updated \n     archives and records law (that he authored), and a newly \n     renovated and expanded archival and records center building. \n     In accomplishing this, Gregory has worked tirelessly with \n     legislators, bureaucrats, educators, media, and anyone who \n     would listen, to give records management, and especially for \n     digital records, both visibility and strategic direction for \n     his state in the information world. The result is a \n     resuscitated records management service now exists under the \n     control of the state archivist, rather than languishing in \n     the state's general services department.\n       His highly innovative use of the archives and its \n     collections to frame and give context to current issues of \n     debate in the state, so citizens and legislators do not \n     ignore the wisdom of past, is especially admirable. This \n     ``continuing issues'' approach to archival public programming \n     makes the relevance of archives very apparent to citizens and \n     sponsors, legislators and media personnel, beyond the well-\n     known uses of archives for history, genealogy, and general \n     support to government. In effect, and not without some \n     political risk to himself, Gregory has championed the \n     fundamental principle of archives being arsenals for \n     democracy through an informed citizenry. For controversial \n     issues facing the state and its legislators, he repeatedly \n     uncovered past precedents where denials flourished that such \n     existed; outlined forgotten past examples of workable \n     government processes where chaos now reigned until his \n     intervention; showed that sacred cows of state policy assumed \n     to be sacrosanct since time immemorial had in fact changed \n     many times, and could thus be readily changed again. In his \n     column, Voices from the Vault, appearing in the Secretary of \n     State's monthly publication, as well as on the VSARA web \n     site, Gregory applied his vast knowledge of state records and \n     Vermont history, its constitution and laws, and his own wide \n     reading and sense of wonder. Gregory thus for many years kept \n     ``continuing issues'' burning, showing the relevance of \n     archives and records to living life now. So much so that \n     legislators and media turned to him for ``backgrounders'' on \n     many public issues, and those he gave them in his interviews \n     and in his Voices from the Vault columns--always with flare, \n     good humor, and self-deprecation, but also with dedication, \n     passion, and keen intelligence.\n       Despite his tiny resource base in the state archives and \n     many pressing home and family responsibilities, Gregory has, \n     as a committed professional, applied for and received several \n     NHPRC grants. He wanted to push the frontiers of archival and \n     records management research, strategy, and best practice, to \n     try to understand, codify, and share more widely the lessons \n     he was learning in Vermont with his wider profession. The \n     most noted of these, in our opinion, was the Vermont State \n     Information Strategy Plan (VISP), in which we both had \n     marginal roles as consultants, but enough to observe the \n     project first hand.\n       VISP was a gubernatorial initiative embracing executive \n     agencies. Though the archives was not originally envisioned \n     as a VISP participant, Gregory succeeded in getting it a \n     place at the table. He had been impressed by some of the \n     appraisal thinking occurring in the archival profession in \n     the late 1980s centered around functional analysis and \n     macroappraisal. Instead of appraising records by their \n     subject and informational-value content, which is impossible \n     for modern records given their huge extent in paper, their \n     interconnectedness across many creating institutions in our \n     complex world, and their transient digital formats, archival \n     theorists like Hans Booms in Germany, Helen Samuels in the \n     United States, and Terry Cook in Canada shifted the focus for \n     appraisal to the functional context of creation: which \n     functions, programs, and activities within which structural \n     entities would be most likely to produce the best records, \n     including evidence of citizen's interaction with the state, \n     rather than which of the billions of modern records \n     themselves might have potential research value.\n       Gregory was impressed by these ideas, but he took \n     functional analysis a step further, and built it back into \n     the information system planning of the state. Based on \n     research into the mandates, structures, and especially \n     functions, programs, and activities of every state agency, he \n     automated the results to produce a grid that matched \n     functional activity with the several (sometimes many) offices \n     performing aspects of that activity. He demonstrated that \n     promotion and control of tourism, for example, was spread \n     around nine separate agencies that did not talk to each \n     other, or that a single mother with dependent children at \n     school, when seeking benefits, would have to contact and then \n     fill in similar information on application forms for each of \n     the twelve agencies. By revealing this overlap and \n     duplication, VISP permitted consolidation, in a virtual \n     sense, of these programs through information systems that \n     talked to each other for greater effectiveness, reduced \n     duplication and inefficiency, made things easier for clients \n     of the government to get service (applying once, not twelve \n     times), helped the state promote itself (tourists now got one \n     effective consolidated message when they wrote, rather than\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n     perhaps a few of nine partial ones). And of course archival \n     appraisal could now be focussed functionally on the location \n     of the best records in the VISP matrix to document the \n     state's activities with its citizens, because the state's \n     functions had finally been mapped and understood.\n       Though support for VISP waned with changing gubernatorial \n     administrations, the Vermont State Archives and Records \n     Administration, through the collaborative work of Gregory and \n     his deputy (and now successor) Tanya Marshall, used VISP \n     insights to model and then encourage state agencies to move \n     to a functions-based, multiple-access-point, facet-designed \n     file-classification system for its records management \n     programs.\n       Our Gregory achieved innovative results with minimal \n     resources and much imagination. He is one of those effective \n     facilitators working with ``power'' behind the scenes, as \n     well as frequently and openly in the public and media, to \n     make things happen. He is not just a dreamer and thinker, \n     orator and writer, thorough researcher and master \n     storyteller, though he does all that with considerable \n     aplomb. He is also a roll-up-the-sleeves practical archival \n     administrator who builds buildings, writes laws, plans and \n     carries out ambitious programs, and lobbies effectively for \n     his profession with panache and passion.\n       But what of ``the sense of wonder''? While the dedication \n     plaque on Gregory's building recognizes his ``devoted \n     service'' to archives and public records, which we trust the \n     foregoing account justifies, what state formally memorializes \n     ``the sense of wonder'' of any of its public servants? \n     Indeed, what government anywhere celebrates ``the sense of \n     wonder'' through a building dedication? To understand that, \n     we need to turn from what he did for historical archives and \n     managing public records to how he did it, to that sense of \n     panache and passion just mentioned, to ``the sense of \n     wonder'' he so often felt himself and shared so effectively \n     with others.\n       While the sense of wonder most especially describes \n     Gregory's endless curiosity and voracious reading, to say \n     nothing of his being a mountain of a man with a huge \n     improbable beard, what made that sense of wonder as state \n     archivist so special was his endless commitment to inform \n     Vermont citizens about the value and relevance of public \n     records, but always in the most engaging fashion. In this way \n     he passed on to those readers his own sense of wonder.\n       During Vermont's bicentennial celebration in 1991, for \n     example, Gregory organized a series of debates to engage \n     Vermont citizens around issues of current importance, such as \n     the death penalty and term limits. These debates were held in \n     each of the several cities that served over time as the \n     state's capital. While Gregory explored current issues, he \n     was always able to provide historical context, through \n     stories and examples drawn from his deep historical \n     understanding of the records. Citizens were empowered to feel \n     at the center of their government, working through \n     contemporary issues themselves with rich historical context \n     to temper and inform debate.\n       Gregory used his many speaking engagements to offer wry \n     perspectives on record and information management. Regularly \n     invited to address freshmen legislators as part of their \n     orientation, Gregory once introduced the importance of the \n     ``big picture'' of records management through an analysis of \n     the impact of dog urine on trees in New York City! Two dogs \n     at one fire hydrant that you see at brief glance, is one \n     thing; almost seven million gallons of urine squirted \n     annually on expensive (and now dying) city trees is quite \n     another picture. Similarly, one shelving bay of records in \n     the corner office is one thing; millions of documents across \n     scores of agencies, if not well managed in a statewide \n     integrated recordskeeping system, is quite another. We \n     suspect those legislators went home and never quite forgot \n     that image, records management, or Gregory. Nor would they \n     have forgotten the man who appeared before them, based on a \n     daughter's dare, with his huge beard newly dyed a bright \n     fuchsia color!\n       But Voices from the Vault was his regular forum to \n     demonstrate the relevance of records to current debates, but \n     always incorporating that special touch of Gregory's humor \n     and his own sense of wonder. Here is a fine example from his \n     January 2011 Voices from the Vault column that, additionally, \n     provides insight into his goal for his columns:\n       ``Most people, alas, don't find records/archival management \n     a particularly titillating topic. Therefore I usually start \n     my column with some misdirection, attempting to ensnare \n     readers before they realize they are reading about records. \n     This month I appeal to the reader's prurient interests and \n     offer a sex column. Female dragonflies, according to those \n     who study such things, possess `sperm storage organs.' These \n     are special sites which incubate sperm, keeping it alive for \n     months until the female is ready for fertilization. Male \n     dragonflies, however, are only concerned with passing along \n     their own genes. To them, the thought of the females \n     cheerfully flying about, slowly incubating the genes of \n     rivals is not a happy one. So, over time, the sexual organ of \n     the male dragonfly evolved to include a little scoop. This \n     allows the male to empty out the female's storage organ \n     before filling it with his own seed.\n       ``Government is like that. New administrations, \n     secretaries, and commissioners arrive in Montpelier and \n     immediately clear out the records of the previous occupants. \n     They then refill the various storage organs of government \n     with records of their own programs and initiatives. I confess \n     that the analogy is not exact since in many cases those \n     leaving government clean out their own record storage units \n     before departing.\n       ``The news media comment on these transitions often \n     speculating on the legacy of the departing administration. \n     This impulse to quickly define a particular administration's \n     legacy raises numerous interesting issues, notably the \n     tension between continuity and change inherent to our \n     democratic system of government. In other words, to what \n     degree are we documenting the continuities of government and \n     to what degree are we documenting the initiatives and actions \n     of specific administrations or state officers? Obviously \n     these are not mutually exclusive efforts, but they require \n     decisions over what files should be left in situ for \n     continuity of operations; what records should be sent to the \n     state archives to ensure long term access; and what records \n     can be disposed of without violence to statute or \n     administrative need?''\n       In 2009 Gregory introduced a column dealing with the \n     history of Vermont Special Session in the following way: \n     ``Traditional marriage is at risk in Vermont. No, no not that \n     one; it appears to be doing fine. I am talking about the long \n     standing union between car fenders and duct tape. Duct tape \n     is no longer good enough to get your car inspected. I am \n     currently organizing a Tape Back Vermont campaign. I thought \n     of imploring the governor to convene a special session of the \n     general assembly to address this unprecedented attack upon \n     the customs and usage of home auto body repair. This required \n     some preliminary investigation on the history of special \n     sessions,'' which Gregory then traces from 1777 forward.\n       One of Gregory's 2012 columns was entitled ``Sexing Chicks \n     and the Appraisal of Public Records.'' The column begins with \n     a brief introduction about how in the 1920s the Japanese \n     discovered ``that by squeezing a day-old chick's intestines \n     it was possible to see slight anatomical differences . . . \n     and thus males could quickly be culled and feed expenses \n     reduced.'' After this anatomical lesson, Gregory admits that \n     though the analogy is not precise, ``Sexing chicks is not \n     unlike appraising public records. [Archivists] don't want to \n     pay upkeep for records that don't have value. We need ways to \n     recognize the variations in public records so we can \n     correctly determine their ``gender'' with high accuracy. Good \n     records analysts, like good chick sexers, handle large \n     volumes, quickly, and have sufficient training and experience \n     to develop contexts for accurately interpreting what they \n     see.''\n       His gift to inform, amuse, and educate while promoting the \n     archives was truly amazing. To further appreciate his \n     delightful skill in writing about archives and documents, \n     readers are encouraged to discover more of these wonderful \n     columns at http://vermont-archives.org/publications/\n voice/.\\2\\\n       That we all who feel the wonder of archives could so \n     imaginatively translate that into workplace reality as did \n     Gregory, and could have such enlightened employers as the \n     State of Vermont to recognize the merit of ``wonder'' so \n     publicly!\n\n\n                                 Notes\n\n       \\1\\ One of the buildings of the Illinois State Archives, \n     but not its records center, is named for long-time State \n     Archivist and pioneering records theorist, Margaret Cross \n     Norton.

I would like to recognize the remarkable service of the \n65th Infantry Regiment, also known as the Borinqueneers, a unit \ncomposed primarily of soldiers from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico \nand recruits from other Latino backgrounds.\n  Today, President Obama has signed into law a bill honoring the \nBorinqueneers with a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian \nhonor our Nation can bestow. The Gold Medal is awarded as a national \nexpression of gratitude to men and women who perform outstanding acts \nof service that advance the security, prosperity, and national interest \nof the United States of America.\n  American minorities have a proud history of serving their country \nwith honor and distinction even in the face\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\nof racism and exclusion. As the largest and longest standing segregated \nunit in our military's history, the 65th Infantry Regiment is no \ndifferent. In the face of segregation and discrimination, the \nBorinqueneers demonstrated valiant service to our Nation. From World \nWar I to Korea, the Borinqueneers represented the United States and \nPuerto Rico proudly. They were often among the first into battle and \nhave been the recipients of numerous awards and commendations.\n  The 65th Infantry Regiment was originally formed as a battalion of \nvolunteer infantry in Puerto Rico in 1899 and first saw combat in World \nWar I. The unit fired the first shot of the war by U.S. regular Armed \nForces while defending the harbor of San Juan against a ship flying the \ncolors of the Central Powers. Members of the Regiment also served in \nWorld War II and, with particular distinction, in the Korean war, where \nthey earned 10 Distinguished Service Crosses, 256 Silver Stars, 606 \nBronze Stars, and 2,771 Purple Hearts by war's end.\n  The Borinqueneers now join the ranks of the Tuskegee Airmen, the \nNavajo Code Talkers and other distinguished minority units who have \nreceived the prestigious Gold Medal. This day is long overdue but well \ndeserved.\n  I congratulate the Borinqueneers on their honor. These brave men \ndeserve recognition befitting their contributions to our Armed Forces. \nThe unit's story is one of service and honor beyond even the usual \nhighest standards to which we hold our men and women in uniform.\n  Of the surviving Borinqueneers I would like to recognize and give \nspecial thanks to those who have made their home in Illinois: Diego A. \nFigueroa Reyes, Santiago Perez, David Ramirez-Granado, Ramon Rodriguez, \nJuan Vasquez, and Onil G. Velez. I commend you and all of the \nBorinqueneers for your steadfast service to our country and wish you \nand your families all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3537-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENIOR SAFETY INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the need to \nprotect the safety and health of older Americans from hazards posed by \nconsumer products. Since its inception in 1972, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission CPSC has been tasked with protecting the public from \nunreasonable hazards posed by consumer products. Historically, the CPSC \nhas not focused explicitly on seniors despite the aging population's \nvulnerability to these hazards. For example, a 2012 CPSC report found \nthat Americans age 65 and older are nearly three times more likely to \nsuffer a product-related injury that results in a visit to the \nemergency room than Americans between the ages of 25 and 64.\n  On May 19, 2014, the CPSC introduced the Senior Safety Initiative. I \ncommend the CPSC for taking on this important and timely project. The \nSenior Safety Initiative aims to reduce both the incidences of product-\nrelated deaths, nearly 65 percent of which are suffered by seniors and \nthe estimated 5 million injuries suffered by older adults. This \ninitiative includes the creation of a mechanical and senior hazards \nteam to monitor hazards associated with products intended for seniors, \npublication of a hazard screening report focused exclusively on \nseniors, and continues the CPSC's partnership with other agencies to \nreduce the death and injury associated with consumer products. In \naddition, the CPSC will join the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-\nRelated Statistics to work with other Federal agencies to improve the \navailability of aging-related data.\n  In particular, the initiative aims to reduce hazards associated with \nadult portable bed rails. Between 2003 and 2012, the CPSC received \nreports of 174 deaths, 80 percent of which involved seniors over age \n60, and nearly 110,000 medically attended injuries involving adult \nportable bed rails. The collective costs associated with these injuries \ntotaled around $250 million annually. The CPSC recently partnered with \nmanufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration, and the voluntary \nstandards community to develop the first-ever standard for adult \nportable bed rails. As the senior Senator of the State with the largest \nproportion of people above the age of 65, I welcome the CPSC's efforts \nto reduce injuries and deaths involving consumer products, particularly \nadult portable bed rails.\n  Last month, in conjunction with the publication of the Senior Safety \nInitiative, the CPSC participated in Older Americans Month by \npartnering with the Administration for Community Living and other \nparticipating organizations to promote educational resources for \nseniors and their families about preventing hazards associated with \nhousehold products often used by seniors and their caregivers.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I know how \nimportant it is to protect the well-being of older Americans from \nunreasonable risks in their retirement years. As our aging population \ngrows exponentially over the coming decades, it is imperative that we \nsupport initiatives like the CPSC's to enhance the safety, \nindependence, and well-being of our older Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3537-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. KAINE.

I am proud to welcome them here, and I join with all \nColoradans in thanking them for all they have done for us.\n  I also want to thank the volunteers from Honor Flight of Southern \nColorado who made this trip possible. These volunteers are great \nColoradans in their own right, and their mission to bring our veterans \nto Washington, DC, is truly commendable.\n  I wish to publicly recognize the veterans who visited our Nation's \ncapital, many seeing for the first time the memorials built as a \ntribute to their selfless service. Today, I honor these Colorado \nveterans on their visit to Washington, DC, and I join them in paying \ntribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of liberty.\n  These veterans from World War II include Charles Barnett, James \nHubbard, John Lee, Donald Joiner, John Cotton, Anthon Aragon, Sedley \nHall, Fred Radestock, Carl Davidson, Clarence Norris, Gordon Ashwood, \nGerald McCann, Charles Tomsick, Timothy Churchill, John Ross, Richard \nGottlieb, Gene Noel, Clifford Hibpshman, Eldon Price, Lester \nMcLaughlin, Samuel Stephens, Albert Cordova, and Barlow Westcott.\n  Our Nation asked a great deal of these individuals--to leave their \nfamilies to fight in unknown lands and put their lives on the line. \nEach one of these brave Coloradans bravely answered the call.

Mr. President, I wish to offer my thoughts and \nprayers to the victims of the April 27, 2014, tornadoes that devastated \na number of communities in central Arkansas.\n  The tornadoes that spawned from the storm system that left a trail of \ndestruction across the south took the lives of 16 Arkansans in Pulaski, \nWhite and Faulkner Counties.\n  The Arkansas victims include an Iraq veteran who died while \nprotecting his 5-year-old daughter, two children who had just started \nschool in Vilonia, and an unborn child who died as a result of the \ninjuries to the baby's mother.\n  While others escaped the tornadoes with their lives, many lost \neverything else they had. From homes to businesses, entire communities \nwere wiped out leaving many residents homeless and without livelihood.\n  However, our actions in a time of crisis are a reflection of us as a \nsociety and despite the tragic stories we saw many uplifting acts \nbefore, during, and after the tornadoes hit. As the storm approached, \nChristian Gunther acted to save ten disabled veterans from a long-term \ncare facility by making sure they reached safety before the tornado \nhit. During the storm, MSG Daniel Wassom, gave his life using his body \nto shield his daughter from a falling beam. And, in the immediate \naftermath of the storm, Arkansas's first responders rushed to the \nhardest hit communities, saving lives in the aftermath of the \ntornadoes.\n  During this time where many have to sift through the rubble and \nrebuild their lives, we are grateful for those who have reached out to \ntheir neighbors and provided assistance. Volunteers from all across the \nState have come to ravaged areas to help. This disaster serves as a \ntestament to the compassionate character of the people of Arkansas. \nRebuilding is never easy, but I know that Arkansans do not give up.\n  I am pleased the President quickly responded to the situation by \ndesignating four Arkansas counties as major disaster areas, making \nFederal funding available to people in these counties impacted by the \nstorm. However, more work remains to be done. I am committed to \nensuring that relief comes to the families and communities affected by \nthis disaster.\n  Again, our thoughts and prayers go out to those who endured the \nstorms, who need to rebuild, and especially to those who have lost \nrelatives and loved ones. I ask that my colleagues continue to keep \nthem in their thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3538-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING THOMAS HOLLAND\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the life and \ncareer of Dr. Thomas Holland who has spent the past 22 years finding \nand identifying the remains of American servicemen. His efforts have \nhelped bring peace and closure to the families of our fallen soldiers.\n  With over 83,000 American servicemen who have been listed as missing \nin action, Dr. Holland's vision and insights have helped find and \nidentify the remains of soldiers who would otherwise be unaccounted for \nand unknown. He has led recovery missions to numerous countries such as \nNorth and South Korea, China, Iraq, and Cambodia. Most notably in 1995, \nDr. Holland led the classified mission in Iraq to recover the only \nserviceman missing from the First Gulf War.\n  Originally from Fort Smith, AR, Dr. Holland received his bachelor's \ndegree in fine art from the University of Missouri-Columbia where he \ncontinued his post graduate studies and earned his master's degree and \nhis doctorate degree in anthropology. Currently, Dr. Holland serves on \nthe graduate faculty at the University of Hawaii. As a world renowned \nexpert, he has been published in many journals and has presented papers \nat numerous national and international meetings. During his tenure at \nthe Central Identification Laboratory and Joint POW/MIA Accounting \nCommand, he held positions as an anthropologist, senior anthropologist, \nand scientific director.\n  While his academic and professional achievements are outstanding, his \nmost admirable accomplishment has been his great service that honors \nAmerican prisoners of war and those missing in action. Since 1992, Dr. \nHolland has diligently performed the solemn task of finding and \nidentifying lost soldiers, sailors, and airmen using the science of \nhuman identification.\n  Dr. Holland has displayed dedication, perseverance, and commitment to \nexcellence.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a friend to \nall Arkansans, Frank Broyles, an icon in Arkansas athletics, the former \nhead coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks football team and former Athletic \nDirector who is retiring from the University of Arkansas at the end of \nJune.\n  This legendary football coach spent his life serving Arkansas and \nlaying the foundation and building the dynamic athletic department at \nthe University of Arkansas. His hard work, dedication and commitment to \nArkansas and its athletes is clear. As an offensive tackle for the \nRazorbacks in the late 1960s, I played under Coach Broyles. He had a \ngreat influence on my life and I know that to be true for many other \nArkansas athletes.\n  Coach Broyles' influence extends well beyond Arkansas into college \nathletics. The Broyles Award was established in 1996 to honor the work \nof assistant football coaches. Honoring Coach Broyles, the award \nrecognizes his history of producing some of the most successful \nassistant coaches in college football.\n  He has been successful on and off the field. After his wife Barbara \nlost her battle with Alzheimer's, Coach Broyles made it his life's \nmission to advocate for a cure and educate Americans on caring for \nloved ones suffering with Alzheimer's. He wrote the Alzheimer's \nPlaybook based on his family's experience caring for Barbara which is a \ngreat resource for all caregivers.\n  Despite retiring as the Arkansas Athletic Director in 2007 he \ncontinued his service to Arkansas on the Razorback Foundation. This \nwill truly be the end of an era when he leaves at the end of the month.\n  The Arkansas Razorbacks are blessed to have the leadership of Coach \nBroyles in the many roles he assumed for the university. His vision for \nthe Razorbacks is what we recognize today and support today. I am \nhonored to have had the opportunity to play for Coach Broyles and call \nhim a friend and wish him the best of luck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3538-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3538-S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM ANDERSON\n\n Mr. BLUNT.

Jim has played a role in nearly every major \ndevelopment that has shaped Springfield over the last 25-plus years. \nOver that time he has been a great friend and an important advisor on \nall things Springfield--my hometown and Missouri's third largest city.\n  Jim Anderson was lured back to Springfield from Jefferson City, MO, \nto run Springfield's Chamber of Commerce, a role he had already played \nin Jefferson City for nearly a decade. With his background as teacher \nand administrator, his quick smile and sharp mind for details, and a \nwealth of contacts and government know-how, Anderson has been a \nspirited leader at the Springfield Chamber. His knowledge and \nexperience have helped as he has devoted his efforts to economic \ndevelopment, job creation, civic involvement, and advocacy efforts at \nboth the local and state levels.\n  Jim Anderson is a leader who knows what it takes to make his \ncommunity an attractive place for businesses and consumers. From 2001 \nuntil 2009 Anderson served on the Missouri Highway and Transportation \nCommission and rose to the chairmanship in 2007 and was vice chairman \nthe following year. During that period Jim became a supporter of \ninfrastructure programs to fix bridges, expand capacities, and grow a \nsafer transportation network to promote economic development. Jim's\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nkeen intellect on economic development issues earned him an appointment \nin 1993 by Gov. Mel Carnahan to the Missouri Business Council and to \nthe Total Transportation Commission in 1996.\n  In 2005 Jim's peers honored him with the Springfieldian Award, a \nrecognition given to the person whose contributions leave a lasting \nmark on Springfield. Jim has certainly left his mark. That same year \nAnderson was a recipient of the Missourian Award. In 2007 he was the \nrecipient of the Lifetime Achievement in Business Award from the \nSpringfield Business Journal. And last year Anderson received the \nCareer Service in Economic Development Award at the Governor's \nConference on Economic Development. These awards only scratch the \nsurface of Jim's impact on the region.\n  Jim has amassed many awards and accolades from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. But Jim is also grounded in his local community--Springfield. \nHe served as chairman of United Way of the Ozarks and president of \nUrban Districts Alliance. He is a member of the Springfield Rotary Club \nand has been recognized for his work with the Boy Scouts. Jim is a past \nchairman of the board of directors of Springfield Innovation, Inc., at \nthe Roy Blunt Jordan Valley Innovation Center. Anderson is an active \nmember of First & Calvary Presbyterian Church.\n  Jim's contributions to the Springfield area have strengthened the \nfabric of the community. I know he will be glad to have more time with \nhis wife Janet and their daughters Rachel and Rebecca. I wish him well \nin his next opportunity and thank him for his years of service in \nSpringfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3539-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3539-S3540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BENTON COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Benton County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$56 million to the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together has been \nworking to designate Vinton as the site for the Americorps National \nCivilian Community Corps, NCCC, facility, and securing $2.5 million to \ncreate the residential campus. I have also appreciated working with \nIowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired on one of \nmy biggest priorities--eliminating barriers in our society for people \nwith disabilities. Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf, but I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly one-quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed captioned television but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Benton County, both those \nwith and without disabilities, and they make us proud to be a part of a \ncommunity and country that respects the worth and civil rights of all \nof our citizens.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Benton County has received $600,000 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Benton County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $142,900.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency \nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nBenton County has received over $14.2 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a Member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Benton County has received more than $25 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Benton County's \nfire departments have received over $1.9 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Benton County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Benton \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives, and, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3540-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3540-S3541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            LEE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents.

I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Lee County to build a legacy of a stronger local economy, \nbetter schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, safer \ncommunity.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Lee County worth over $28.8 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $35.3 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together include \nthe terrific work that Keokuk and Fort Madison have done to improve \ntheir downtowns through Main Street Iowa, my long standing support work \nto make sure the Avenue of the Saints construction benefits the area \nand is funded, and working to improve river navigation on the \nMississippi River, in part through funding reconstruction of Lock and \nDam 19 at Keokuk.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Southeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nLee County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Lee \nCounty, I have fought for more than $23 million for the restoration of \nLock and Dam 19 as well as overall navigation and environmental \nimprovements on the Mississippi River, as well as more than $118 \nmillion for work on the Avenue of the Saints, helping to create jobs \nand expand economic opportunities in the region.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like Fort \nMadison and Keokuk to use that money to leverage other investments to \njump-start change and renewal. I am so pleased that Lee County has \nearned $78,500 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Lee County has received more than $4.1 million in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Lee County have received funds that I designated \nfor Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $288,457.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency \nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities.

The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nLee County has received over $5.1 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Lee County's \nfire departments have received over $1.4 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment, and more than $564,187 in Byrne justice \nassistance grants.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Lee County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing $389,563 for community \nwellness activities.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf but I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities.

Mr. President, I speak in memory of the life of \nRobert Jackson Miller III, an accomplished architect and a man who, \nabove all else, was a devoted husband and a loving, generous father. \nBob passed away on March 10, 2014, at the age of 48, leaving behind a \nwife and four daughters who loved him dearly.\n  Bob held within him a brilliant capacity to design buildings that \ndrew out the full potential and imagination of those who entered their \ndoors. Throughout his career--from his early years at Robert A.M. Stern \nArchitects and his role as partner-in-charge at Michael Graves and \nAssociates in New York, to his co-founding of Miller & Wright \nArchitects in New York City--he was a diligent designer who cherished \nthe ability he had to provide unique shared space for individuals \nacross the United States. He often spoke of his proudest work, the St. \nColetta School in Washington, DC, a place where children and adults \nwith intellectual disabilities were afforded the opportunity to learn \nand grow as a community.\n  Yet all of Bob's architectural accomplishments pale in comparison to \nthe passion that defined his life: the love he felt for his wife Grace \nand his daughters Eve, Margot, Lily B. and Poppy. To say that Bob was \nan utterly devoted family man would merely scratch the surface of his \ncomplete dedication to the lives of his wife and daughters. If you were \nto ask Bob, he would prefer nothing in the world more than simply \nsharing a Friday night at home with his family, watching movies or \nrelaxing on the beach in their company. He was content to spend as much \ntime as he possibly could with them; nothing brought him more joy. If \nyou were ever to go to the Miller household, you would invariably find \nBob hard at work teaching the girls new lacrosse techniques, helping \nthem practice for their plays, or helping construct an elaborate \nHalloween costume. His faithfulness as a father and a husband were \ncharacteristic of the kind soul Bob possessed. When he was diagnosed \nwith melanoma, Bob placed even more emphasis on profoundly treasuring \neach moment he was allowed with Grace, Eve, Margot, Lily B. and Poppy. \nHe never lost sight of the gift he had been given to spend his life \nwith them.\n  This will be the first Father's Day the girls spend without their \nfather. To lose a valuable, vibrant, compassionate spirit like their \nfather's at such a tender age is an incomprehensible tragedy. There are \nmoments of pain in this life when we can see the sadness of others and \ndesire only to lessen their hurt, knowing full well that our words and \nour sympathies are insufficient. This is such a moment.\n  I hope that Grace and the girls understand the bright loveliness \ntheir father brought into the world, and will continue to carry that \nlight forward in his absence. The world is a better place for Bob \nhaving traveled through it. He is continuing his journey now, but we \nwill remember him here, and his family will remember him for the rest \nof their lives. His memory will serve as an example of how to love \ncompletely, how to dedicate yourself to your family entirely, and how \nto treasure the moments you are given in the brief time we \nhave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3541-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SIDNEY, MONTANA\n\n Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a town in \neastern Montana with a story that reflects the American dream. In the \n19th century, pioneers settled in Sidney, MT, chasing prosperity along \nthe banks of the Yellowstone River.\n  Throughout the years Sidney has seen booms in agriculture and energy \ndevelopment, but through it all one thing has remained constant; the \npeople who call Sidney home share the core values of service, honesty, \nand the willingness to help a neighbor in need.\n  Today, Sidney, Montana celebrates its 100th anniversary--100 years of \ningenuity, 100 years of prosperity, and 100 years of history.\n  When pioneers first settled in eastern Montana they were not \nguaranteed prosperity, but they brought with them a strong work ethic. \nBefore Sidney was even incorporated, the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation \nProject canal was dug and with their new access to water, the dry land \nfarmers were given a lifeline to irrigate crops and develop the plains. \nThe pioneer farmers were taming an area of the country many thought \ncouldn't be tamed.\n  Today, agriculture producers from Richland County continue to grow \nthe crops and raise the cattle that feed the world--working the land \nthe same way those before them did.\n  In the 1970s Sidney went through period of change. The world was now \nhungry for oil and Sidney, MT, was there to answer that call. Through \nthe decade to follow Sidney boomed with energy through a period of \nprosperity.\n  With the recent increase in hydraulic fracturing, Sidney once again \nis at the center of an unmatched energy boom. With the development of \nthe Bakken Formation, Sidney enters the newest chapter of its story.\n  Agriculture and energy has affected many families in Sidney, but one \nthing has remained the same. The people of Sidney remain good neighbors \nand they continue to stabilize a region that has grown accustomed to \nchange.\n  I congratulate Sidney for its contributions to our State, our Nation, \nand the world. We look forward to the next century being as exciting as \nthe last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/10/senate-section/article/S3541-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MANAGEMENT EDUCATION ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I want to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of management education at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology.\n  Management education began at MIT in 1914 with the introduction of \nCourse XV, then known as ``Engineering Administration.'' Over the past \ncentury, MIT's business program has grown from a single course to a \nworld-class school that provides our Nation's leaders and entrepreneurs \nwith the skills and knowledge they need for success, while also \nproducing cutting-edge research.\n  Today, the MIT Sloan School of Management stands as one of the world \nleaders in management education. MIT Sloan has jump started the careers \nof some of our foremost innovators, thinkers and business leaders. From \nlaunching successful Massachusetts-based companies like Zipcar and \nHubSpot to making revolutionary intellectual contributions to the \nfields of organizational behavior and system dynamics, Sloan alumni \nhave made a huge positive difference in the world. According to a Sloan \nstudy, in 2006, there were 25,800 active companies founded by MIT \nalumni, which combined to employ 3.3 million workers.\n  MIT's motto is ``mens et manus,'' which translates to ``mind and \nhand,'' and its school seal displays two men--one with a book, and \nanother with an anvil. This connection between thought and action, \nbetween intellectual pursuits and practical applications, has helped \ndefine MIT's mission and has made the school the unique institution \nthat it is today.

A bill to support the local decisionmaking functions of \nlocal educational agencies by limiting the authority of the Secretary \nof Education to issue regulations, rules, grant conditions, and \nguidance materials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with 20 kids and grandkids, I understand \nthe importance and value of quality education. For many years my wife \ndedicated her life to teaching and mentoring young students, never \nknowing that in the years to come, two of our children would follow in \ntheir mother's footsteps, building classrooms of their own and \nimpacting the lives of so many young people.\n  Through my family's unique educational experiences, and my time in \nState and local government, I have learned that with teaching comes the \ngreat responsibility of not only working with students, but also \nparents, employers and many in the local community to ensure our \nchildren are well equipped for the road ahead.\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\n  Nationwide, 96 percent of local school board members are elected, \nmaking those members accountable to the many students, parents and \ntaxpayers they represent. But in recent years, the voice of this local \nauthority is being eroded through inhibitive policies and requirements \nestablished by Federal agencies, like the Department of Education.\n  Education has historically been a State and local issue. By \nstrengthening the process for meaningful input by impacted \nstakeholders, our local communities can remain active in the education \npolicy decision-making process.\n  This is why I have introduced the Local School Board Governance and \nFlexibility Act. With this legislation, the goal is to bring control of \nour education policy back to where it belongs--with our local \ncommunities--giving State and local school boards the necessary \nflexibility to achieve their educational goals. S. 2451 would wrestle \naway control from the Department of Education by prohibiting the agency \nfrom issuing any regulations, rules, guidance materials, or grant \nconditions that would result in a conflict of authority with any State \nor local educational agencies.\n  This bill would also streamline reporting requirements and would \nrequire the Department to provide Congress with an annual report on how \nthe agency's policies impact local school districts. As we have seen, \nmany of the overreaching education policy changes declared by \nWashington bureaucrats have resulted in negative effects on local \nschools, not only in terms of policy, but also financially. This bill \nrequires the Department of Education to seek input on costs and \nassistance needs from State and local school agencies before issuing or \nimplementing regulations, rules, guidance materials, or grant \nconditions.\n  The Local School Board Governance and Flexibility Act will give State \nand local school boards a voice in how the Federal Government issues \nregulations and guidelines for education. It is time for the Department \nof Education to be accountable to the parents, teachers, and local \nelected officials who work first-hand with our Nation's children. \nEducation needs are unique to each community, and in order to give the \nnext generation of Americans a better future and wealth of \nopportunities, my legislation will give State and local school boards \nthe authority they need to carry out the education goals that are best \nsuited for their children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2454. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to extend \nexpiring provisions of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism \nAct of 2010; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join today with Senator Grassley to \nintroduce legislation to reauthorize for another 5 years expiring \nprovisions of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act, \nSTELA. This law provides satellite television carriers with the \nnecessary rights to retransmit distant broadcast television programming \nto households that are otherwise unable to receive local signal over-\nthe-air. If Congress does not act by the end of the year to reauthorize \nthe distant signal license, approximately 1.5 million consumers will \nlose access to the broadcast television programming that they are \ncurrently receiving.\n  The compulsory copyright license system for satellite television has \nbeen successful in promoting competition in the video marketplace. \nConsumers across the country benefit from having nationwide competitors \nto cable. Rural consumers, including many in Vermont, rely on a healthy \nsatellite industry that is able to provide service to customers where \ncable is unable to reach. Congress has helped to facilitate the growth \nof the satellite industry by providing it with a mechanism to clear the \nrights to broadcast television content, which remains among the most \npopular.\n  Senator Grassley and I are continuing what has always been a \nbipartisan partnership on satellite television legislation. I worked \nwith Senator Hatch in 1999 to establish a permanent license allowing \nsatellite carriers to retransmit local television content to consumers. \nThat license has had an important impact on competition in the video \nmarket. In 2010, I worked with Senator Sessions on STELA. Satellite \ntelevision legislation should never be partisan--it should be an \nopportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together and \ndemonstrate to the American people that we can act responsibly and \nprevent serious disruption to consumers.\n  The bill we are introducing today is a narrow approach. We are \nextending the current system for another 5 years, while also making \nsome minor technical corrections to the existing statutes. This bill \nmay not please all stakeholders. Some would like Congress to use this \nlegislation as a vehicle to enact significant changes to the current \nsystem that governs the relationship between broadcast television \nstations and distributors. Others would prefer that Congress not act at \nall and simply allow this license to expire. My focus is on the \nconsumers who stand to lose access to broadcast television content in \nthe event that Congress is unable to pass a bill by the end of the \nyear. This bill will ensure that they are not left in the dark come \nDecember 31.\n  Our legislation is one half of what the Senate will have to do in \norder to ensure that 1.5 million consumers are able to maintain the \nbroadcast television signals that they are currently receiving. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Rockefeller as we work to fit the \nnecessary Copyright and Communications Act provisions of this bill \ntogether. I also look forward to working with our counterparts in the \nHouse in order to protect the consumers relying on this license.\n  I urge the Senate to support extending STELA for another 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2454\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance Social Security benefits for children, \ndivorced spouses, and widows and widowers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Murray, to talk about Social Security. I \nam going to spend a few moments discussing a bill we are introducing \ntoday and then turn it over to Senator Murray.\n  As you know, Social Security is one of the most important programs \never established in this country. After 75 years, Social Security \ncontinues to deliver as intended. It is a promise to Americans. The \npromise is simple. If you work hard all your life and contribute to the \nsystem, then Social Security will be there to help make ends meet when \nyou retire or help out the family if a worker dies or is disabled.\n  Let me be clear. Despite the naysayers, Social Security is not a \nhandout. Social Security benefits are linked directly to the amount \nthat retirees pay into the system through a lifetime of hard work. But \ntimes have\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\nchanged and we need to make sure the promise of Social Security \ncontinues in a meaningful way. That is why Senator Murray and I \nintroduced the Retirement and Income Security Act yesterday, which we \nlike to call the RAISE Act. It is a commonsense bill to update, \nenhance, and protect Social Security in a fiscally responsible way.\n  When it comes to fairness, this bill is a small but important step \nfor seniors, for older women, and for the families of deceased or \ndisabled workers. It makes sure that the modest benefits of Social \nSecurity will go to everyone who deserves them.\n  The RAISE Act has three major components.\n  It will, first, improve Social Security benefits for divorced \nspouses. Under current law, the divorced spouse only gets benefits from \na former spouse's earnings if they were married for at least 10 years. \nUnder our bill, eligibility rules would be phased in beginning at 5 \nyears of marriage. The spouse would be entitled to 60 percent of the \nbenefits after 6 years of marriage, 70 percent after 7 years, and so \non.\n  Second, our bill will enhance benefits for widows and widowers. It \nestablishes a new enhanced benefit for widows and widowers where both \nspouses have retired. An alternative calculation in the bill will use \nboth spouses' benefits--deceased and surviving--rather than just the \nsurvivor's benefit. The surviving spouse will receive either their \ncurrent benefit or the new alternative, whichever is greater.\n  The third component of the RAISE Act extends eligibility for children \nof retired, disabled or deceased workers. This provision would apply if \nthe child is still in high school, college or vocational or career \nschool. Under current law, minors and high school students under the \nage of 19 can get Social Security benefits if their parent is a \nretired, disabled or deceased worker. Beginning in 2016, this provision \nextends benefits for full-time students up to the age of 23.\n  Even though Social Security continues to fully pay for itself and has \nnever added a dime to the deficit, I know some of our colleagues will \ncomplain that we cannot afford these small enhancements. That is why \nour bill asks those Americans who can most afford it to pay their fair \nshare towards the strengthening of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Beginning in 2015, the RAISE Act would apply a 2-percent payroll tax \non annual earnings over $400,000. This means that, for future \ngenerations, Social Security will continue to be fully funded. In \nfuture years, that threshold will increase under an indexing formula \nbuilt into the bill.\n  I am a proud sponsor of this bill with Senator Murray. It was an easy \ndecision for me, since my commitment to bolstering Social Security \nstarted from day one in the Senate. I have already introduced two other \nbills on Social Security, and I want to just mention them briefly \nbefore I turn it over to Senator Murray.\n  The first bill is my Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act. \nIt would extend the solvency of Social Security by lifting the cap on \nhigh-income contributions, which this year is $117,000. Not everyone \nknows this, but once your annual income hits that threshold, you no \nlonger have to contribute to Social Security for the rest of the \ncalendar year. This seems unfair to me. My bill would lift the cap and \nphase out what effectively has become a tax loophole. Higher income \nAmericans would pay into Social Security all year long--just like \neveryone else. This provision would add generations of financial \ncertainty to Social Security.\n  The bill would also improve benefits for seniors and others by \nestablishing new cost-of-living adjustments based on reality. The \nformula would better reflect seniors' financial needs by basing the \nadjustments on items such as prescription drugs and housing, which \nseniors pay for, instead of electronics and new cars.\n  My second bill is the Social Security Fairness Act. It would repeal \nunfair reductions to Social Security benefits for people who have \nworked part of their career in noncovered jobs--often State or local \ngovernment or other civil service jobs.\n  Congress passed the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government \nPension Offset in the 1980s because of fears workers who retire under \nother pensions would be double covered and Social Security could not \nafford it. But in effect those old laws are punishing people by \nreducing benefits they rightfully have earned.\n  Today, these provisions affect more than 2 million people nationwide, \nand the number is growing. It is not just about getting back what you \npaid into the system. Removing these penalties would also encourage \npeople willing to work in public service as a second career--such as \npolice officers or teachers. If you are considering such a move today \nbut know your Social Security benefit would be reduced or penalized \nbecause you had stepped forward and worked in public service, why would \nyou do it?\n  Let's remember one thing about all of these bills--the two I \nintroduced earlier and the RAISE Act we are discussing today. Social \nSecurity benefits are vitally important but also are very modest. \nNationally, they average $13,500 a year for recipients. It is very \nimportant to my State. More than 71,000 people in my State of Alaska \nrely on Social Security. That is roughly 1 out of 10 Alaskans. Social \nSecurity lifts tens of thousands of Alaskans out of poverty--the \nelderly and especially elderly women--and it pumps more than $1 billion \ninto our economy every single year.\n  No one is getting rich off of Social Security, but it does provide an \nimportant foundation, and it does so in a truly American way: You work, \nyou contribute, and you get something back. As long as I am in \nCongress, I will fight to make sure Social Security is solvent and \nthere for not only this generation but for generations to come.\n  Senator Murray has been a longtime champion for Social Security, and \nI am proud to stand with her on the floor today. Our RAISE Act is \nanother modest improvement. I hope our colleagues will join us in \nstanding up for this critically important program.\n  Our Social Security system reflects the best of America: hard work, \npersonal responsibility, human dignity, and caring for our parents, our \nchildren, our spouses, and our neighbors and ourselves.\n  Let's come together in this Chamber and do all we can to make sure \nSocial Security is working for all Americans.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my colleague, Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, Mr. \nBegich, for coming and joining me today because I know he is deeply \ncommitted to strengthening and protecting Social Security for current \nand future seniors. So I was very pleased to join him today in \nintroducing the RAISE Act, which will be a very critical step forward \nin this effort.\n  Over the last several decades, middle class families have been \nincreasingly squeezed by rising prices for everything from college \ntuition to health care. Wages have stayed flat--or even declined for \nsome people--and fewer companies today are offering the kinds of \ngenerous pension plans that used to help so many workers stay \nfinancially secure.\n  With all that in mind, it is not surprising that, as families have \nstruggled to stretch their dollars further and further in order to get \nthe bills paid and raise their children, it has become harder and \nharder to save for retirement.\n  In fact, a recent study showed that more than a third of today's \nworkers have been unable to save even a dollar for retirement, and even \nthose who do have savings do not have very much. The same study found \nthat 60 percent of respondents had less than $25,000 in total assets \nand investments, excluding their home.\n  The numbers are even more pronounced when you look at women in the \nworkforce. Because women, on average, earn less than men, they \naccumulate less in savings, they receive smaller pensions, and nearly 3 \nin 10 women over 65 depend only on Social Security for income in their \nlater years.\n  It is clear that now more than ever Social Security is a lifeline for \nmillions of seniors. So it is especially important for us to make sure \nthis critical system is meeting the needs of today's beneficiaries.\n  For 75 years our Social Security system has offered millions of \nseniors and\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\ntheir families a foundation of financial security. But a lot has \nchanged in those 75 years. Today, most families have two earners. \nBecause Social Security was actually designed for single-earner \nfamilies, surviving spouses in families where both adults worked may \nreceive less in benefits than they deserve.\n  Social Security also supports children whose parents retired, became \ndisabled or passed away--but those benefits end at the age 18 or 19. \nThat is right. When young adults should be thinking about continuing \ntheir education--a necessity in today's economy--they are worried about \nhaving nowhere to go.\n  At a time when Social Security is an increasingly critical source of \nsupport for so many, the RAISE Act would make some commonsense updates \nto ensure our Social Security system is doing everything possible to \nhelp today's seniors and their families.\n  As the Senator from Alaska described, the RAISE Act would establish a \nnew alternative benefit to make sure widows and widowers from two-\nearner families do not receive less in survivor benefits than those \nfrom single-earner families.\n  The RAISE Act would enable spouses who were married for less than 10 \nyears to receive spousal and survivor benefits. It would extend \nbenefits for young adults under 23 who are enrolled in school full \ntime.\n  Crucially, to help ensure Social Security is there for future \ngenerations, the RAISE Act would shore up the Social Security trust \nfund in a fiscally responsible way that protects middle-class families. \nI believe strengthening and protecting Social Security benefits through \nthe RAISE Act would do an enormous amount of help to our workers and \nfamilies and their ability to stay financially secure.\n  But I also want to note there is a much broader challenge. There is \nnot just one solution. We should absolutely make these critical changes \nto help make sure our Social Security system is meeting the needs of \ntoday's workers and families, but we also have to look at ways for \nworkers to save for retirement and encourage companies to offer higher \nretirement plans.\n  That is not all. We need to make sure women get equal pay for equal \nwork so they will have the same shot at a secure retirement as their \nmale coworkers.\n  We do need to invest in education and training and get college costs \ndown so our workers are prepared to compete for high-wage, high-skilled \njobs.\n  We need to continue to fight to strengthen and protect programs such \nas Medicare which senior women and men rely on.\n  Democrats care deeply about taking these steps and many others to \nmake sure our workers have the secure, dignified retirement they \ndeserve. There is absolutely no reason why, after working hard all of \nher life, a retiree should have to worry about how she and her family \nwill make ends meet.\n  I believe we can do better. I know Senator Begich does as well. I \nurge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a close look at \nour RAISE Act. I hope we can pass it to offer seniors and their \nfamilies some additional relief. Then I hope we can build on this with \nother policies to create more opportunity and more financial security \nfor our workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 2457. A bill to require States to establish highway stormwater \nmanagement programs; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to discuss the \nintroduction of my latest legislative proposal to better control the \nharmful and volumes of polluted stormwater that is generated from our \nNation's Federal aid highways. Highway stormwater is a growing threat \nto water quality, aquatic ecosystems and the fish and wildlife that \ndepend on the health of these ecosystems. Moreover, the high volumes \nand rapid flow of stormwater runoff from highways and roads poses a \nvery serious threat to the condition of our Nation's water and \ntransportation infrastructure as well as personal property particularly \nin urban and suburban communities.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has recognized that pollution \nfrom point-sources have been steadily declining since the enactment of \nthe Clean Water Act. Likewise, we have seen reductions in pollution \nfrom certain non-point sources like agriculture which are attributable \nin part to the success of a wide variety of USDA Natural Resource \nConservation Service Programs and farming innovations in soil \nconservation and nutrient pollution management.\n  One non-point source sector where we are unfortunately seeing an \nincreasing impact on water quality is from impervious surface that \ncreate rapidly moving high volumes of untreated polluted stormwater \nthat rush off of road surfaces, erode unnatural channels next to and \nultimately underneath roadways comprising the integrity of roadway \ninfrastructure, and increases the stress on storm sewer systems \nshortening the useful life of this infrastructure and ultimately lead \nto the discharge of untreated pollution that is carried off roadways \nand into our lakes, rivers, streams, and coastal waters.\n  Impervious surfaces include most buildings and structures, parking \nlots and of course the nearly 9 million lane miles of roads across our \ncountry. The total coverage of impervious surfaces in an area is \nusually expressed as a percentage of the total land area.\n  The coverage increases with rising urbanization. In rural areas, \nimpervious cover may only be 1 percent or 2 percent, however road \nsurfaces comprise 80 percent to 90 percent of a rural area's total \nimpervious surfaces. In residential areas, impervious surface coverage \nranges between 10 percent in low-density subdivisions to over 50 \npercent in more densely developed communities, where the composition of \nthe impervious surface area coverage works out to be 50 percent roads. \nIn dense urban areas, the impervious surface area is often over 90 \npercent of the total land area, with roads comprising 60 percent to 70 \npercent of that coverage.\n  According to EPA, urban impervious cover, not just roads, in the \nlower 48 adds up to 43,000 square miles--an area roughly the size of \nOhio. Continuing development adds another quarter of a million acres \neach year. Typically two-thirds of the cover is pavement, roads and \nparking lots, and 1/3 is buildings.\n  According to the Chesapeake Bay Program, impervious surfaces compose \nroughly 17 percent of all urban and suburban lands in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed. The greatest concentration of impervious surfaces in the \nBay watershed is in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Areas of DC, \nMaryland and Virginia. The Virginia Tidewater area, Philadelphia's \nwestern suburbs, and Lancaster, PA, are also regions in the watershed \nwhere impervious surfaces are greater than 10 percent of the total land \narea.\n  Rainfall on hard surfaces like roads and highways has a very \ndestructive and turbulent affect on nearby waterways and \ninfrastructure. For example, the rain events that occur over a week \nlong period at the end of April brought nearly 8 eight inches of rain \nto the Baltimore-Washington region. The urban runoff from roads in \nBaltimore caused an embankment above the CSX railroad track along East \n26th Street, between St. Paul and Charles Street, to collapse. \nFortunately no one was injured though homes had to be evacuated for \nmore than a month, nearly a dozen parked cars were destroyed and \nmoreover movement of freight along CSX railroad was disrupted for more \nthan a week. This event shows just how destructive and disruptive \npoorly managed stormwater from transportation infrastructure can be.\n  Some may chalk this up to a freak storm of unusually large \nproportion. It's true this storm was unusual, but so were the polar \nvortexes and all of the snow we had in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast, \nand last year's 3-mile wide tornado in Alabama, and the California \ndrought and wildfires, and baseball sized hail in Nebraska just last \nweek. ``Unusual'' weather seems to becoming a lot more usual. As \nextreme weather events triggered by our changing climate become more \nfrequent it is imperative that we incorporate better designs into our \ninfrastructure to be better handle these types of events.\n  Under the Clean Water Act, stormwater is considered a non-point \nsource and there are no requirements that stormwater be collected or \ntreated. The exception being for localities where in order to meet the \nstandards\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\nset in an MS4, Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System, permit a region \nmay include its transportation infrastructure in its MS4 permit.\n  However, in most cases stormwater that falls on roadways washes oil, \ngrease, asbestos brake-dust, nitrogen deposits from tailpipe emissions, \ntrash, road salt and de-icing agents, and sediment into nearby \nwaterways. Highway stormwater runoff is most often not treated or \nadequately managed.\n  While these organic and inorganic contaminants are legitimate threats \nto water quality, the greater concern with roadway runoff is the sheer \nvolume and rapid flow rate in which stormwater leaves these hard \nsurfaces and enters our waterways. Flows and volumes that cause roads \nto collapse in Baltimore.\n  Roads are designed for stormwater to flow off of the driving surface \nquickly, for safety reasons. When stormwater rushes off of road \nsurfaces into storm drains it is usually piped straight into the \nnearest river or stream without removing contaminants, detaining any of \nthe volume, or slowing down the flow. This creates an enormously \ndestructive set of circumstances for our waterways.\n  Another example of the destructive force that persistent unmitigated \nand poorly managed highway runoff can have on the condition and safety \nof highway infrastructure is in Mobile Alabama along Highway 131 in the \nJoe's Branch Watershed. The Mobile Bay Estuary Program, part of the \nNational Estuaries Program, in coordination with Alabama Department of \nTransportation is having to spent millions of dollars to reinforce a \nhighway embankment to keep the highway from slipping down a hill and \ninto the Joe's Branch Creek, restore the hydrology of the river, and \nhelp protect private property from the dangerous erosion that's been \ncaused by poorly managed stormwater from Highway 131.\n  The Mobile Bay Estuary Program described the problem this way: ``In \nthe Joe's Branch watershed, on the property of Westminster Village \nadjacent and parallel to Highway 131, a head cut stream is eroding at \nan accelerating rate, an ominous condition as ALDOT prepares to \nundertake improvements to the highway. Identified as a high priority \nstabilization area in the D'Olive Creek, Tiawasee Creek and Joe's \nBranch Watershed Management Plan, MBNEP has submitted a funding request \nto the Alabama Department of Environmental Management on behalf of its \npartners in Spanish Fort, Daphne, ALDOT and Westminster Village to \nundertake restoration of the stream using a cutting-edge technology \ncalled Regenerative Step Pool Storm Conveyance.''\n  The four entities involved are spending large amount money to repair \na problem caused by stormwater damage that could have been prevented at \na lower cost by incorporating better stormwater mitigation facilities \ninto the design of the highway.\n  These high-volume/high-speed flows also hasten the deterioration of \nwater infrastructure. A 2001 study on the erosive power of urban \nstormwater flows examined how excessive stormwater volumes and flow \nrates off of urban surface infrastructure caused more than $1 million \nin roadway and water infrastructure damage in the Cincinnati \nmetropolitan areas in Ohio and Kentucky in a single year.\n  While there are serious water quality concerns with not adequately \ncontrolling roadway infrastructure runoff, there are serious \ninfrastructure costs, that are ultimately passed on to taxpayers and \nratepayers, that can be avoided if transportation authorities do more \nto control and manage stormwater runoff with the infrastructure assets \nthey manage and build.\n  The increased incidence of flash flooding events that occur even \nduring seemingly mild and routine storm events is a direct result of \nthe growing percentage of impervious land cover in urban and suburban \ncommunities. Replacement of the ``greenscapes'' that are lost to \npavement is essential to restoring hydrological balance to our urban \nand suburban communities and impaired watersheds.\n  According to USGS: an inch of rain on one square foot of pavement \nproduces 1.87 gallons of stormwater, Scaled up, 1 inch of rain on one \nacre would produce 27,150 gallons of stormwater. Using FHWA design \nstandards for interstate highway lane and shoulder widths, 12 feet per \nlane, 10 foot right shoulder, 4 foot left shoulder, 10 miles of a four \nlane interstate highway generates nearly 2.5 million gallons of \npolluted stormwater for every inch of rain. To put that into \nperspective for the Potomac and Anacostia River Watersheds: The Capital \nBeltway, not including its 48 interchanges, generates nearly 30 million \ngallons of polluted stormwater for every inch of rain that falls on the \n64 mile 8 to 12 lane interstate highway loop. It is volumes of \nstormwater like that which cause dangerous streambank erosion.\n  Gillies Creek is an urban waterway located East of Downtown Richmond. \nIt is a tributary of the James River which flows into the Chesapeake \nBay. Gillies Creek is surrounded by industrial and residential \ndevelopment and also receives stormwater from State highway 33, \nInterstate 64, US 60, and hundreds of city streets including Stony Run \nParkway which directly adjacent to the creek for several miles. The \nbanks and bed of this creek have eroded so badly as urban development \naround the creek has added more impervious surfaces to the watershed \nthat streambed sheering has created cliffs more than ten feet tall at \nspots along the creek. Trees supporting the bank continually fall into \nthe creek and nearby roadways and other infrastructure as well as homes \nand business are at risk. Reducing the impacts of the storms by \nmitigating the flow and volume of stormwater in this watershed will \nprotect against further erosion and save the cost of repair and \neventual replacement of the assets located along this endangered creek.\n  The aim of this legislation is to improve highway designs to better \nmanage stormwater to avoid the costly damage that poorly managed \nstormwater causes to infrastructure and nearby streams, rivers and \ncoastal waters.\n  I held a hearing on this issue in the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee \non May 13. I heard many ideas from both the minority and majority \nwitnesses that were invited to present testimony at this hearing. I \nlistened to the concerns of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle and I have incorporated provisions into this bill that should \nalleviate concerns they may have had with previous attempts to better \ncontrol highway stormwater.\n  My bill's approach to highway runoff management is one that I hope my \ncolleagues of both parties can support. First of all it puts states in \nthe driver's seat for developing hydrological analysis and \nimplementation of best management practices to control highway runoff. \nThe objective of the legislation is to control and manage flow and \nvolume of stormwater from highways not to treat runoff in order to meet \nwater quality standards. By taking this sort of approach we avoid EPA's \ninvolvement in the process. Lastly, States would only need to apply \nthese procedures to new construction on major reconfiguration projects \nthat significantly increases the amount of impervious surface in the \nproject area.\n  Title 23 of the U.S. Code states: ``transportation should play a \nsignificant role in promoting economic growth, improving the \nenvironment, and sustaining the quality of life'' through the use of \n``context sensitive solutions.'' In 2008, the Government Accountability \nOffice issued a report examining key issues and challenges that needed \nto be addressed in the next reauthorization of the transportation bill. \nThat report highlighted the clear link between transportation policy \nand the environment. With 985,139 miles of Federal aid highways \nstretching from every corner of the US, polluted highway runoff is no \nsmall problem facing our Nation's waters. I would urge my colleagues to \njoin me trying to address this problem facing America's waterways and \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2457\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Highway Runoff Management \n     Act''.\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAY RUNOFF MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 3 of title 23, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 330. Federal-aid highway runoff management program\n\n       ``(a) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions apply:\n       ``(1) Covered project.--The term `covered project' means a \n     reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, renovation, \n     major resurfacing, or new construction project on a Federal-\n     aid highway carried out under this title that results in--\n       ``(A) a 10-percent or greater increase in impervious \n     surface of the aerial extent within the right-of-way of the \n     project limit on a Federal-aid highway or associated \n     facility; or\n       ``(B) an increase of 1 acre or more in impervious surface \n     coverage.\n       ``(2) Erosive force.--The term `erosive force' means the \n     flowrate within a stream or channel in which channel bed or \n     bank material becomes detached, which in most cases is less \n     than or equal to the flowrate produced by the 2-year storm \n     event.\n       ``(3) Highway runoff.--The term `highway runoff ', with \n     respect to a Federal-aid highway, associated facility, or \n     management measure retrofit project, means a discharge of \n     peak flow rate or volume of runoff that exceeds flows \n     generated under preproject conditions.\n       ``(4) Impacted hydrology.--The term `impacted hydrology' \n     means stormwater runoff generated from all areas within the \n     site limits of a covered project.\n       ``(5) Management measure.--The term `management measure' \n     means a program, structural or nonstructural management \n     practice, operational procedure, or policy on or off the \n     project site that is intended to prevent, reduce, or control \n     highway runoff.\n       ``(b) State Highway Stormwater Management Programs.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this section, each State shall--\n       ``(A) develop a process for analyzing the erosive force of \n     highway runoff generated from covered projects; and\n       ``(B) apply management measures to maintain or restore \n     impacted hydrology associated with highway runoff from \n     covered projects.\n       ``(2) Inclusions.--The management measures established \n     under paragraph (1) may include, as the State determines to \n     be appropriate, management measures that--\n       ``(A) minimize the erosive force of highway runoff from a \n     covered project on a channel bed or bank of receiving water \n     by managing highway runoff within the area of the covered \n     project;\n       ``(B) manage impacted hydrology in such a manner that the \n     highway runoff generated by a covered project is below the \n     erosive force flow and volume;\n       ``(C) to the maximum extent practicable, seek to address \n     the impact of the erosive force of hydrologic events that \n     have the potential to create or exacerbate downstream channel \n     erosion, including excess pier and abutment scour at bridges \n     and channel downcutting and bank failure of streams adjacent \n     to highway embankments;\n       ``(D) ensure that the highway runoff from the post-\n     construction condition does not increase the risk of channel \n     erosion relative to the preproject condition; and\n       ``(E) employ simplified approaches to determining the \n     erosive force of highway runoff generated from covered \n     projects, such as a regionalized analysis of streams within a \n     State.\n       ``(c) Guidance.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of enactment of this section, the Secretary, in consultation \n     with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall \n     publish guidance to assist States in carrying out this \n     section.\n       ``(2) Contents of guidance.--The guidance shall include \n     guidelines and technical assistance for the establishment of \n     State management measures that will be used to assist in \n     avoiding, minimizing, and managing highway runoff from \n     covered projects, including guidelines to help States \n     integrate the planning, selection, design, and long-term \n     operation and maintenance of management measures consistent \n     with the design standards in the overall project planning \n     process.\n       ``(3) Approval.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \n     heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall--\n       ``(A) review the management measures program of each State;
