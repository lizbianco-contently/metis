Mr. President, it was about five decades ago that Vice \nPresident Humphrey predicted it was possible to eradicate poverty in \nAmerica. In fact, this is what he said: ``We can banish hunger from the \nface of the Earth.'' That was in 1965.\n  Today, in 2013, there are more than 50 million people living in the \nUnited States--including 150,000 families in Nevada--who don't know \nwhere their next meal will come from. In the richest country in the \nworld, one in six is in danger of going to bed hungry tonight, and half \nof those people are children.\n  But despite these sobering numbers--and despite these difficult \neconomic times--House Republicans have turned their backs on American \nfamilies struggling to put food on the table. It is true the bill being \nconsidered in the House of Representatives today would save $40 \nbillion. How would it save that $40 billion? By snatching food out of \nthe hands of millions of the neediest children and their families.\n  Why are there people on food stamps? We have tried to create a safety \nnet so\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\nthese people have at least the basics of being able to have a meal \nduring the day.\n  House Republicans are determined to gut the nutrition assistance \nprogram in the name of austerity, even though 9 out of 10 recipients \nare families with children, senior citizens, or people with \ndisabilities. These needy Americans aren't exactly living a life of \nexcess on the government's dime. They get about $4 in food assistance \neach day.\n  One of my favorite things I like to do in Nevada and here in \nWashington is to go grocery shopping. It is such a diversion for me. I \nlove going grocery shopping to look around, buy things. Landra and I \nare without our children and our grandchildren--we live alone--but we \nstill buy food and I enjoy that so very much. So I have a good idea how \nmuch $4 will buy, or $4.50 to be specific. That is enough money to buy, \nif one is lucky, a pound of hamburger. They have different grades of \nhamburger. They have the expensive kind, the not so expensive, and then \nthe cheaper kind. Even for the cheaper kind, $4 couldn't buy a pound of \nthat most of the time. A gallon of milk costs about four bucks. So a \nperson couldn't buy them both on the same day; a person certainly \ncouldn't buy hamburger and milk on the same day.\n  It is possible to make important reforms to both farm and food stamp \nprograms without balancing the budget on the backs of people who are \nhungry. But instead of cutting waste and eliminating fraud, the House \nRepublicans would cut lunches for 210,000 children and eliminate food \nassistance for 170,000 veterans.\n  There is another way. It was done here in the Senate under the \ndirection of Chairwoman Stabenow: the bipartisan Senate agricultural \nbill, passed under her direction and that of the ranking member. It \nsaves $23 billion without forcing needy children to skip meals. It does \nit fairly. If the Senate farm bill came to the House of Representatives \nfloor, it would pass overwhelmingly, but the Republican leadership \nwon't let Democrats vote. That is why they will probably pass this very \nmean-spirited piece of legislation today, because only Republicans will \nbe allowed to vote on it.\n  The House Republican leadership refuses to consider any bill that \nwould garner votes from both parties. Leave it to the House of \nRepresentatives to take the hard way whenever possible.\n  These same reckless Republicans are also determined to take the \nuphill route to passing a CR--a continuing resolution. What does that \ndo? It funds the government. Instead of doing what is necessary to keep \nthe economy on a firm footing, Republicans are obsessed with denying \nand undermining the law of the land--ObamaCare. Remember, the law \npassed about 4 years ago and the Supreme Court declared it \nconstitutional. Many good things are already working to keep people who \nare sick from declaring bankruptcy. It is a good piece of legislation \nthat will make America like all modern nations and have health care for \neverybody, with rare exception.\n  Watching the Republican Party self-destruct--and that is not coming \nfrom me; that is what pundits are saying all over the country--would be \ngood political theater, to watch them self-destruct--and that is what \nthey are doing--if there were not so much at stake.\n  The economic consequences of a government shutdown are deadly \nserious. Even today, when I had my news briefing--the Republicans are \nopenly fighting against each other now. Senate Republicans are saying, \nWell, we know we don't have enough votes to get rid of ObamaCare, but \nlet's send it back to the House and let them hang tough. The House \nRepublicans are saying, Why aren't the Senate Republicans doing it \nthemselves?\n  The consequences of a government shutdown are deadly serious. The \neconomic consequences of a first-ever default on the full faith and \ncredit of the United States are deadly serious. Look what happened last \ntime they threatened this: The stock market dropped 2,000 points. We \nlost our credit rating. It dropped.\n  Anyone listening to this doesn't have to take my word for it. The \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, not noted for being this base of liberality \nin the country, wrote to Members of the House yesterday, saying: \nPrevent a shutdown. Ease the fears of default. Specifically, here is \nwhat they said:\n\n       It is not in the best interests of the United States or its \n     business community or the American people to risk even a \n     brief government shutdown that might trigger disruptive \n     consequences or raise new policy uncertainties washing over \n     the U.S. economy.\n\n  The quote continues:\n\n       Likewise, the U.S. Chamber respectfully urges the House of \n     Representatives to raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner \n     and thus eliminate any question of threat to the full faith \n     and credit of the United States.\n\n  But in spite of these warnings from the largest business organization \nin the country, Republicans either don't realize the stakes or simply \ndon't care. They are willing to put the Nation's economic recovery at \nrisk to make an ideological point.\n  What remains to be seen is how many innocent Americans will be hurt \nby their reckless political games. How many children will go to school \nwithout breakfast? How many workers will lose their jobs? How many \nseniors will lose their retirement? How many businesses will lose their \nhard-earned investments if Republicans tank the economy?\n  I only hope the anarchists in the House of Representatives come to \ntheir senses before it is too late.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I might say we have a genuine emergency \nin Kentucky--a depression in eastern Kentucky--as a result of what this \nadministration has done and is about to further do this very week, \ndirected at the jobs and livelihood of my constituents. So it is for us \na genuine emergency.\n  The EPA is due this week to announce regulations capping carbon \nemissions on new coal-fired powerplants. It is just the latest \nadministration salvo in its never-ending war on coal, a war against the \nvery people who provide power and energy for our country. The EPA has \nalready stifled the permitting process for new coal mines. The Agency \nhas done this so dramatically that they have effectively shut down many \ncoal mines through illegitimate, dilatory tactics.\n  The EPA's actions ignore the thousands of people in my home State of \nKentucky who depend on the coal industry for their livelihoods. \nKentucky's own Jimmy Rose, a veteran and former coal miner, said it \nbest in\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\nthe title to his song: ``Coal Keeps the Lights On.'' Coal keeps the \nlights on.\n  In the year President Obama took office, there were over 18,600 \nemployed in the coal industry in my State. Over 18,600 Kentuckians were \nemployed in the coal industry in my State the year President Obama took \noffice. But as of September 2013--this month--the number of persons \nemployed in Kentucky coal mines is down to 13,000. That is 18,600 when \nthe President took office; 13,000 today employed in coal mines in my \nState.\n\n  The picture is actually getting worse instead of better. This week a \nmajor employer announced 525 layoffs in eastern Kentucky mines. This \nnews ironically came out on the same day the President announced that \nhis proposals, according to him anyway, are helping to strengthen the \neconomy. Try and tell that--try and tell that--to the hard-working coal \nminers in eastern Kentucky that this is a way to strengthen the \neconomy. These people are now trying to figure out how to feed their \nfamilies and pay their bills.\n  Kentucky coal miners have suffered far too much already. Congress \ncannot idly sit by and let the EPA unilaterally destroy a vital source \nof energy and a vital source of employment. That is the reason I sought \na few moments ago to bring up and pass the Saving Coal Jobs Act. Saving \ncoal jobs is the single most important accomplishment in the near term \nfor the people of Kentucky. It is a combination of two bills, both of \nwhich have languished in committee for literally months.\n  The bill would essentially repeal the administration's declaration of \nwar against coal. The first part of the bill would prevent the EPA from \nregulating carbon on new and existing coal plants; the second would \nforce the EPA to stop stalling on mining permits.\n  It is time to act on the Saving Coal Jobs Act. The time to act is \nnow. This is a genuine emergency in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6613-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the farm bill. Ten \ndays, that is all the time we have to work out some agreement on our \nfarm legislation before we revert to the 1949 farm policy in this \ncountry.\n  Let me make this very clear to the American people and to my \ncolleagues. This has nothing to do with the traditional battle lines in \nagriculture. This is not one of those Midwest farming versus Southern \nfarming type scenarios. This is not a specialty crop versus a row crop \ntype issue. This has nothing to do with that at all. It is an \nideological fight, where we see hyperpartisanship and gridlock politics \ntaking over the Congress.\n  Today, the House of Representatives has a vote. It is a very \nimportant vote. What they are proposing is that they cut $40 billion \nfrom the nutrition title over 10 years. That is $40 billion.\n  Here again, this is not about a traditional fight that you see and \nyou have seen for decades in agriculture. This is about hunger in \nAmerica. It is a sad fact. It is something that maybe people in this \nbuilding do not like to acknowledge. But we have people who are hungry \nin this country. They may be people with whom we go to church. They may \nbe our neighbors. They may be friends, coworkers, folks with whom we \ngraduated from high school. They could be seniors or children or the \nworking poor. But we have people in this country who are hungry today.\n  Can you imagine America being the land of plenty and having hungry \npeople and having folks in this building--in the Chamber of the House \nof Representatives--voting to not lend a helping hand when people need \nit the most?\n  I am reminded of that great song, ``America the Beautiful,'' where it \nstarts out:\n\n     O beautiful for spacious skies,\n     For amber waves of grain,\n     For purple mountain majesties\n     Above the fruited plain!\n\n  It goes on and on and on to talk about the riches of this great \ncountry. But, unfortunately, as I said, today we have way too much \nhunger in our Nation.\n  The Congress can do something about that. The Congress can do \nsomething about it. In fact, the Senate already has done something \nabout it. Thanks to Senator Stabenow and Senator Cochran and the \nbipartisan efforts on the Senate Agriculture Committee, they made \nresponsible reforms in SNAP, in other nutrition programs to streamline \nand fix and correct and improve the nutrition title. They went after \nwhat we are concerned about, such as waste and abuse of the system, and \nfraud. We all know you have some of that in these programs. But we have \na saying in our State. It is kind of a country saying. I know people \nhave heard it before. But we say: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Our \nagriculture law in this country ain't broke.\n  It can be improved, and I think that is what the Senate has done. The \nSenate has been responsible. The Senate has worked in a bipartisan way. \nAgain, that bill passed through this Chamber a few months ago with 66 \nvotes, a very bipartisan vote. That is the solution. That is the \nsolution of us working together.\n  Unfortunately, again we have people down the hall in the House of \nRepresentatives who are going to put that in jeopardy with a ``my way \nor the highway'' political solution. This is not good for the country.\n  I think the reason some of these folks are doing this is because they \ndo not understand the impact their decision could have on this country. \nBut let me put it in perspective. When we look at America, there are \nlots of different ways to look at agriculture and look at our economy \nand look at the global economy, but one way is this: We have several \ncore strengths in the U.S. economy. We do some things better than \nanybody else in the world, and one of those is agriculture.\n  If we look at investment, if we look at innovation, if we look at new \nfarming practices and ways to conserve water--how to get more per \nacre--all these things that improve and increase production and \nnutrition, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, they come from America. It \nis one of the core strengths of the U.S. economy. Everybody in the \nworld wants to be like America when it comes to agriculture. Everybody \nwants what we have. They copy us. They model what they do after this \ncountry. It is something we should be proud of. I know inside the \nbeltway it is not very exciting, it is not very flashy, but we have the \nsafest and highest quality and, in relative terms, the cheapest food \nsupply in the entire world. It is one of the true reasons for America's \nstrength.\n  But, unfortunately, if we do not pass a new farm bill by September \n30, we run the risk of putting all that in jeopardy, and there could be \ndire consequences. There is no question about it. If we talk to all the \nexperts, talk to all the economists, talk to the people who understand \nthis, what we can see very clearly is that crop prices will \ndestabilize, and that means some prices will go up, some will go down.\n\n  For example, soybean farmers all over this country are going to lose \ntheir crop support. They are going to lose that protection that has \nbeen there since the 1960s. Because it was not there in 1949, it will \nbe gone, and that will be devastating to the soybean industry. That is \njust one little piece of the puzzle.\n  I could go on and on. We have a huge trade deficit in this country. \nWe know that. But our saving grace, when it comes to trade, is \nagriculture. Those export programs to sell our ag products overseas \nwill be lost if this agreement is not reached.\n  Again, food prices will rise dramatically. We have heard others talk \nabout that even this morning. The Democratic leader mentioned it. But \nit is going to hurt not only farmers, it is going to hurt families all \nover this country.\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\n  This is personal to me. I know in the Acting President pro tempore's \nhome State of Hawaii they have a huge agricultural sector. I know it is \nvery important to his State. Everybody thinks of how beautiful Hawaii \nis and tourism and all that, but agriculture is critically important to \nhis State's economy, just like it is for the other 49 States. In almost \nevery State--maybe with one or two exceptions--agriculture is very \ncritical to that State's economy. That is true for Arkansas.\n  Again, this is very personal for me. One in six jobs in our State is \nrelated directly or indirectly to agriculture. Agriculture--we love our \nFortune 500 companies. We love having them. We have several that are \nbased in Arkansas. We are proud of them. But 25 percent of our State's \neconomy is tied to agriculture--25 percent.\n  So the question is, How do we fix this? It is something we will never \nhear on the talk shows. We will not hear the talking heads chatter on \nabout this. But the way we fix it is to work in a bipartisan way, to \ncome together, to be very responsible--as the Senate has been on this \nissue--to put something together, and to get it done.\n  This is why groups in my State, such as the Arkansas Farm Bureau, \nAgricultural Council of Arkansas, Riceland Foods, Arkansas Rice Growers \nAssociation, Tyson Foods, the Arkansas Cattlemen's Association, et \ncetera, et cetera, et cetera--the list goes on--all supported what we \ndid in the Senate, and they do not support what is going on in the \nHouse right now.\n  But even more important than the groups, I have been around my State, \nof course, all year--and over the last 10 years. But during the August \nrecess, I went around the State, and every time I saw a farmer--and I \nliterally talked to hundreds of them--they said: Please, please, don't \nlet this happen. Don't let this happen. Why do we want to put all this \nat risk? What we have now is working. Sure, we can make improvements. \nYes, we support the Senate bill. Even though the Senate bill is not \nperfect, we support that because we know the importance of agriculture.\n  I would ask my House colleagues to please get themselves out of this \nmanufactured crisis they have created for us all. Let's turn off the \npolitics. Let's work together. The American people are counting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the news out of Washington is not \nencouraging. It looks as though we are facing a government shutdown and \nthe possibility of even a default on the debt. These are totally \nunnecessary. There is nothing that is forcing this, other than the \npolitical will of some people, and both are disastrous.\n  Shutting down the government, of course, runs the risk of disrupting \nSocial Security payments, veterans' checks. It, of course, is damaging \nto our economy. At a time when we are recovering, but slowly, and we \nneed to create jobs, it does not make any sense.\n  We are facing a deadline, obviously, of October 1 for a new fiscal \nyear. We passed a budget in the Senate back at the end of March, if I \nremember correctly. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, worked through a budget that passed. We \nthen asked for the obvious: Let's have a meeting with the House. It is \ncontrolled by Republicans. We have a Democratic majority here. Why \ndon't we sit down now and work out our differences? The difference \nbetween the two budgets, about $92 billion--substantial for sure but \nsomething that is at least worth sitting down and discussing.\n  We came to the floor of the Senate repeatedly asking for a chance to \nsit down and work it out. Sadly, three or four Senators on the other \nside of the aisle continued to object. They would not let us sit down \nand talk. They would not let us try to find a bipartisan solution to \nthis challenge, and it brings us to this moment.\n  Not having agreed on a budget resolution, we have been unable to pass \nappropriations bills--though they are ready in the Senate. I know a \nlittle bit about this because my new responsibility in the \nAppropriations Committee is the largest single bill. The bill I have \nworked on, with Senator Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, is a bill \nthat covers all of the Defense Department and all of the intelligence \nagencies. I will tell you, it is the largest and a huge portion of our \nnational discretionary budget--almost 60 percent.\n  We are ready. We prepared the bill. We want to bring this bill before \nthe committee on the floor and have the debate that it deserves so our \nmen and women in uniform are well served, our intelligence operations \ncontinue, and we acquire the necessities for the protection of America. \nUnfortunately, the same group that opposed sitting down with the House \nRepublicans and finding a compromise has objected to taking up any \nspending bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  Where does that leave us? We have no budget, and we cannot take up a \nsingle spending bill because of the objections from the other side of \nthe aisle. They are being guided by a few Members over there who are of \na certain political faith that I cannot even describe who believe that \nchaos is the best. I do not.\n  I have been here for a little while. I have found good-faith efforts \nby Members on both sides of the aisle. Many Republican Senators--\nconservative, yes, but sensible--are willing to sit down and try to \nfind answers to these issues.\n  That is the right thing. Sadly, what has happened over in the House \nis hard to explain. I read press reports. There are about 40 of the \nHouse Republicans who are so-called tea party Republicans who insist on \nshutting down the government and insist as well on defaulting on our \nnational debt. They happen to believe that is a good way to push their \nposition opposing health care reform, ObamaCare. They happen to believe \nthat is the way to convince the American people they are right.\n  I think they are completely wrong. I never thought I would ever come \nto the floor of the Senate to quote Karl Rove. But in this morning's \nWall Street Journal, for goodness' sake, he wrote a long article to his \nfellow Republicans saying: Wake up to reality. Independent voters, \nthose who do not declare for either political party across America, \nthink the tea party Republican strategy is disastrous.\n  He warned the Republican Party: If you are not careful, you are going \nto push those Independents over onto the Democratic side.\n  Far be it for me to not want to see that happen politically, but I \ncertainly have to tell you that if it takes shutting down the \ngovernment and shutting down the economy, I do not want it to happen. \nWhat Karl Rove has said to his follow Republicans is: Look at the \nreality of what you are doing to this party. You are destroying this \nparty for the next election--this morning's Wall Street Journal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Most people do not even understand what a debt ceiling is. It is kind \nof hard for the average American to understand. Let me try to put it in \nsimple terms. We spend more money than we raise in taxes. When we do \nthat, we have to borrow money. The good news is that the amount each \nyear is coming down dramatically, so our annual deficits are reducing, \nare coming down.\n  But when there is a difference, when we spend more than we have, we \nhave to borrow it. In order to borrow it, there needs to be an overall \nauthorization of the government. It is called the debt ceiling. So as \nwe, for example, fund our military and borrow, say, 40 percent or 30 \npercent of what it takes to fund our military, as we borrow that, we \nneed an authorization to do it.\n  There comes a point where we have used all our authority to borrow \nand\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\nwe have to increase our authority to borrow, lift the debt ceiling to \ncover our new debt for money already spent, money spent by Congress. \nNow we have a position being taken by some tea party Republicans, who \nmay have voted for the spending but now do not want to vote for the \nborrowing. They cannot have it both ways.\n  What happens if we do not increase the debt ceiling? What it means is \nthat for the first time in the history of the United States of America, \nwe will default on our national debt--the first time. What does a \ndefault mean? Families understand this and businesses understand this. \nIf you do not pay your debts as you are supposed to, bad things can \nhappen: foreclosure, legal proceedings, but at a minimum it destroys \nyour credibility as a borrower.\n  When your credibility as a borrower goes down, what happens? Interest \nrates go up for you. Translate that to America. If we default on our \ndebt, if we fail to raise the debt ceiling for the first time in the \nhistory of the United States, interest rates go up. The dollars paid by \nAmerican taxpayers to build roads, educate children, defend the United \nStates are diminished because we have to pay more and more for interest \non the money we borrow.\n  Can we avoid this? Of course, we can. This is a self-imposed problem, \na problem that has been imposed by the tea party Republicans on the \nCongress and on the Nation that is totally unnecessary.\n  Let me say a word or two about the underlying issue of ObamaCare. It \nhas been a little over 3 years now since we passed ObamaCare. The \nSupreme Court took up the bill, found it constitutional. It is \nunderway. Certain provisions of this bill are already underway. The \ngoal of it, of course, is to deal with the cost of health care and the \navailability of health insurance in America. This is important to \nindividuals and families and businesses. It is also important to our \ngovernment. Sixty percent of our national deficit, 60 percent of our \nnational debt projected for the next 5 or 10 years is associated with \nthe cost of health care.\n  We buy a lot of health care as a Federal Government: Medicare, for \nthe elderly and disabled; Medicaid for those who are low income; \nveterans, to make certain we keep our promise to them for good medical \ncare; Indian health care; a variety of others. So as health care costs \ngo up, the costs to the government go up, and they squeeze out all \nother spending, spending on medical research, education, helping \nstudents have the money they need to go to college.\n  When we talk about the Affordable Care Act and ObamaCare, we are \ntalking about dealing with a health care issue that directly impacts \nthe debt of the United States of America. We passed this bill to try to \nstart to reduce the cost of health insurance and to make health \ninsurance more available.\n  We changed some critical aspects of health insurance. Does anyone \nfollowing this debate know of a person with a preexisting condition--\nsomebody in your family who maybe has high blood pressure, high \ncholesterol, asthma, diabetes, a history of cancer? All of those things \ncan disqualify you--or could before this bill passed--from even having \nhealth insurance.\n  We said: That is the end of it. Health insurance companies have to \ntake everybody--everybody. They cannot exclude a person for a \npreexisting condition. Take them all. Do not cherry-pick the healthy \npeople. Take them all.\n  The second thing we said was: Do not put a limit on the amount of \nmoney a health insurance policy will pay--for obvious reasons. You go \nto the doctor tomorrow, some member of your family gets a terrible \ndiagnosis, a need for cancer treatment, and the bills start stacking \nup. If your health insurance policy has a cap or limit of, say, $50,000 \nor $100,0000, when you reach that limit, there goes all of your \nsavings. You are finished.\n  So we eliminate the limits on coverage in health insurance policies. \nThat is ObamaCare. When the Republicans come to the floor and say: We \nwant to abolish ObamaCare, they are abolishing these protections in \nhealth insurance. They are abolishing the provision which says you \ncannot discriminate because of preexisting conditions. They are \nabolishing the provision that says there cannot be limits on your \ncoverage. They are abolishing the provision which says 80 percent of \nthe premiums you pay have to be used by the health insurance company to \npay for medical care, not for profit-taking, not for advertising but \nfor actual medical care.\n  There is more. Parents who are raising children going to college--I \nwent through that, my wife and I did with our kids. How many times are \nyou going to ask that young person just graduating from college: \nJennifer, do you have your health insurance, have you bought any health \ninsurance, and then have them tell you: Dad, I feel fine.\n  Let me tell you, as a parent, that is not a good answer. But many \nstudents graduating from college who cannot find a full-time job do not \nhave health insurance. The Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, says \nfamilies can keep those young people on their own health insurance plan \nuntil they reach the age of 26. Across America, over 1 million young \npeople now have protection because of this.\n  Also, in the Affordable Care Act, we start reducing the out-of-pocket \ncosts of prescription drugs for seniors under Medicare. Medicare \nprescription Part D is the right thing to do. But there was a so-called \ndoughnut hole, this period where seniors had to pay out of their \npockets. We started closing that doughnut hole to make sure seniors did \nnot lose their precious savings to buy the medicine they needed to stay \nhealthy and independent and strong.\n  So when the Republicans say: We want to abolish ObamaCare and health \ncare reform, they want to abolish this provision that will allow \nfamilies to continue to cover their young people, their kids until the \nage of 26, and they want to abolish the provisions which say, \nbasically, that those who are receiving Medicare prescription Part D \nwill pay less out of pocket.\n  Those are just four or five parts of ObamaCare. The central part of \nit, which starts October 1--I think this is what makes some politicians \non the Hill especially nervous. October 1 they will advertise across \nAmerica the insurance exchanges. What is an insurance exchange? It is \nan opportunity for people to buy health insurance.\n  Many of them have never, ever in their lives been able to shop for \nhealth insurance. Now they can. If they are low-income families, they \nmay not have to pay a premium or a reduced premium under these \ninsurance exchanges. Are these insurance exchanges reliable, \ntrustworthy? Can we count on them? We better because we put in the law \nthat Members of Congress now have to buy their insurance on these very \nsame health insurance exchanges. What is good for America should be \ngood for Members of Congress.\n  In my State, there will be at least a half dozen plans to choose \nfrom. In a State such as California, when they announced their \nexchanges, they announced a reduction in premiums that people had to \npay under those exchanges. That is what we are looking for: \ncompetition, opportunity. People can make their choice if they wish to \ngo into the exchanges. Members of Congress and our staff people do not \nhave that choice. We are in them. That is fine. I think it is going to \nbe good health insurance. I have no question it will be in my State of \nIllinois.\n  But to eliminate ObamaCare is to eliminate these health insurance \nexchanges, which means a lot of people, desperate for health insurance \nfor the first time in their lives, health insurance they can afford, \nwill not be able to do so.\n  I do not think the bill we passed, ObamaCare, health care reform, is \na perfect bill. There is hardly anything we do that is perfect or even \nclose. I think it could be changed for the better. I am open to that. I \nhope Members on both sides are. But that is not the way it works here. \nIn the House of Representatives, they voted 41 times--41 times--to \ndestroy and eliminate ObamaCare--41 times.\n  The Republican leader, Mr. Cantor of Virginia, offered one change in \nObamaCare that he thought made it better. His own party turned on him \nand said: No, we do not want to improve this bill. We want it to go \ndown in flames. We do not want this law to go forward. It is not a \npositive view.\n  A positive view is to take this measure, improve it where we can, and \nwork to make it part of America's future,\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\nsuch as Social Security, such as Medicare, such as Medicaid. These are \nprograms which are critically important to millions of Americans.\n  I am sorry we are facing this showdown. But I hope what will happen \nin the Senate is this: I hope the Senate does not go under cruise \ncontrol following what we have seen from the House Republican caucus, \nthis notion of doomsday scenarios and high noon scenarios and shutting \ndown the government, shutting down the economy. I hope there will be \nreasonable, conservative Republicans who will stand and say that is \nunacceptable. We are going to sit down in good faith, bargain with the \nDemocrats in the Senate, to resolve whatever differences we can but not \nto damage our government or our economy at this important moment in our \nhistory. That kind of courage will be rewarded. It may not be popular \nwith some of the talking heads or screaming heads in these shows on \ntelevision, but the American people are looking for that kind of \nleadership on both sides of the aisle.\n  They do not accept the notion that shutting down the government and \nshutting down the economy is the best way to solve our political \nproblems. The approval rating of Congress now is about 11 percent. I am \nsurprised many days that it is even that high. I did not know we had so \nmany relatives and people on the payroll--11 percent. We can do better \nif we face our problems and challenges honestly and deal with them in a \nway that does not hurt innocent people and families across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the mterial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Wall Street Journal, \n                            Sept. 19, 2013]\n\n        Karl Rove: The GOP's Self-Defeating `Defunding' Strategy\n\n       In 2010, Republicans took the House of Representatives by \n     gaining 63 seats. They also picked up six U.S. senators and \n     675 state legislators, giving them control of more \n     legislative chambers than any time since 1928. The GOP also \n     won 25 of 40 gubernatorial races in 2009 and 2010.\n       These epic gains happened primarily because independents \n     voted Republican. In 2010, 56% of independents voted for GOP \n     congressional candidates, up from 43% in 2008 and 39% in \n     2006.\n       Today, independents look more like Republicans than \n     Democrats, especially when it comes to health care. In a new \n     Crossroads GPS health-care policy survey conducted in 10 \n     states likely to have competitive Senate races and in House \n     districts that lean Republican or are swing seats, 60% of \n     independents oppose President Obama's Affordable Care Act. If \n     this holds through 2014, then Republicans should receive \n     another big boost in the midterms.\n       There is, however, one issue on which independents disagree \n     with Republicans: using the threat of a government shutdown \n     to defund ObamaCare. By 58% to 30% in the GPS poll, they \n     oppose defunding ObamaCare if that risks even a temporary \n     shutdown.\n       This may be because it is (understandably) hard to see the \n     endgame of the defund strategy. House Republicans could pass \n     a bill that funds the government while killing all ObamaCare \n     spending. But the Democratic Senate could just amend the \n     measure to restore funding and send it back to the House. \n     What then? Even the defund strategy's authors say they don't \n     want a government shutdown. But their approach means we'll \n     get one.\n       After all, avoiding a shutdown would require, first, at \n     least five Senate Democrats voting to defund ObamaCare. But \n     not a single Senate Democrat says he'll do that, and there is \n     no prospect of winning one over.\n       Second, assuming enough Senate Democrats materialize to \n     defund ObamaCare, the measure faces a presidential veto. \n     Republicans would need 54 House Democrats and 21 Senate \n     Democrats to vote to override the president's veto. No \n     sentient being believes that will happen.\n       So what would the public reaction be to a shutdown? Some \n     observers point to the 1995 shutdown, saying the GOP didn't \n     suffer much in the 1996 election. They are partially correct: \n     Republicans did pick up two Senate seats in 1996. But the GOP \n     also lost three House seats, seven of the 11 gubernatorial \n     races that year, a net of 53 state legislative seats and the \n     White House.\n       A shutdown now would have much worse fallout than the one \n     in 1995. Back then, seven of the government's 13 \n     appropriations bills had been signed into law, including the \n     two that funded the military. So most of the government was \n     untouched by the shutdown. Many of the unfunded agencies kept \n     operating at a reduced level for the shutdown's three weeks \n     by using funds from past fiscal years.\n       But this time, no appropriations bills have been signed \n     into law, so no discretionary spending is in place for any \n     part of the federal government. Washington won't be able to \n     pay military families or any other federal employee. While \n     conscientious FBI and Border Patrol agents, prison guards, \n     air-traffic controllers and other federal employees may keep \n     showing up for work, they won't get paychecks, just IOUs.\n       The only agencies allowed to operate with unsalaried \n     employees will be those that meet one or more of the \n     following legal tests: They must be responding to \n     ``imminent'' emergencies involving the safety of human life \n     or the protection of property, be funded by mandatory \n     spending (such as Social Security), have funds from prior \n     fiscal years that have already been obligated, or rely on the \n     constitutional power of the president. Figuring out which \n     agencies meet these tests will be tough, but much of the \n     federal government will lack legal authority to function.\n       But won't voters be swayed by the arguments for defunding? \n     The GPS poll tested the key arguments put forward by \n     advocates of defunding and Mr. Obama's response. Independents \n     went with Mr. Obama's counterpunch 57% to 35%. Voters in \n     Senate battleground states sided with him 59% to 33%. In \n     lean-Republican congressional districts and in swing \n     congressional districts, Mr. Obama won by 56% to 39% and 58% \n     to 33%, respectively. On the other hand, independents support \n     by 51% to 42% delaying ObamaCare's mandate that individuals \n     buy coverage or pay a fine.\n       The desire to strike at ObamaCare is praiseworthy. But any \n     strategy to repeal, delay or replace the law must have a \n     credible chance of succeeding or affecting broad public \n     opinion positively.\n       The defunding strategy doesn't. Going down that road would \n     strengthen the president while alienating independents. It is \n     an ill-conceived tactic, and Republicans should reject it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, September is National Suicide Prevention \nMonth. I think as a member of the Veterans' Committee, as an American, \nas a Member of the Senate, it is important for us to pause for a minute \nand recognize some alarming facts about suicide in America among our \nveterans.\n  On average, every day, 365 days a year, 22 veterans who have served \nAmerica take their own life in suicide. That is 8,000 veterans a year, \nan alarming number that is growing. It is important for us to recognize \nthe need to see to it our veterans have access to those things that can \nhelp to prevent suicide and make sure it is minimized and happens as \nlittle as possible.\n  Recent surveys by VSOs--the veterans service organizations--have \ndemonstrated that an alarming number of veterans in America out of our \n22 million have actually considered suicide. An even more alarming \nnumber actually knows someone who attempted to take their life or, in \nfact, was successful.\n  We know there are reasons that reach out and help us, and we know \nthere are reasons that are hurting us. One that is hurting us right now \nis long lines for veterans in need of mental health. Mental health \nneeds are an emergency. They are time-sensitive. We need to improve our \nwait times so they are not as long at our VA hospitals.\n  There is a nationwide shortage, both public and private, of mental \nhealth providers. We need to work to improve the number of providers \nfor our entire country. Scarce appointment times for veterans because \nof their work or family obligations and scarce appointment times \nbecause of overworked VA hospitals make it sometimes difficult and \nprotracted for a veteran to receive services.\n  Most important to me are the gaps in the continuum of service and \ntreatment for a veteran under mental stress and depression. I wish to \nfocus on that for a moment.\n  Recently I held a VA field hearing in Atlanta, GA, because of the \ntragedy that took place at the Atlanta VA. We had two suicides of \nveterans under the care of the hospital and one overdose of drugs while \nsomeone was in the hospital and under the care of the hospital.\n  Those brought about an inspector general's report that made a \nplethora of recommendations to the Veterans' Administration in Atlanta \nbut also nationwide on things the VA needed to do to address those \nproblems. To the credit of Director Petzel, who is head of all VA \nmedical care, and Eric Shinseki, the Secretary of the Veterans' \nAdministration, the VA has begun taking initiatives to do so. We have \nto make sure\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nthey accelerate those initiatives and provide the care that is \nnecessary so that wherever possible we eliminate the wait times and the \nlack of continuum of care.\n  In a recent survey by the inspector general, they found that 20 \npercent of veterans--one in five--who were referred to a private mental \nhealth provider never received an appointment. That is one in every \nfive veterans who have come in and admitted they have a problem. They \nmay be at risk for taking their own life. They may be depressed. That \nis unsatisfactory.\n  One of the focuses we made in our hearing was bringing about better \ncoordination by the VA in terms of accessing community resources in \nmental health to see to it that we raised the number of providers \noffering mental health services to our veterans. As I said earlier in \nmy remarks, suicide is preventable. It is not preventable, however, if \nthere is no access to therapy, no access to consultation, and no access \nfor our veterans when they need it the most.\n  Let me brag a little bit about the VA and some of what they have done \nin recent years that was helped and give you some amazing statistics.\n  In 2007 the Veterans Crisis Line was conceived where veterans in \ntrouble could call in and receive counseling. More than 814,000 calls \nhave been received by the Veterans Crisis Line since it opened, and \n28,000 interventions have saved the lives of veterans. There are 28,000 \nveterans who are alive today because of the crisis line.\n  In 2009 the VA added an anonymous online chat service where a veteran \ncould have a nonthreatening way of communicating and seeking therapy \nanonymously. There have been 94,000 calls since its inception.\n  Most impressive to me is that in 2011 the Veterans Crisis Line added \ntexting as a way to expand its accessibility to veterans.\n  If you are a veteran in crisis, we need to make sure, as Senators and \nmembers of the Veterans' Committee, that you have the access you need \nto therapy and counseling when you need it. We all know that the \ntragedy of suicide is terrible for a family and a horrible loss of a \nlife that was sacrificed on behalf of the United States of America. We \nowe it to ourselves to see that the Veterans' Administration continues \nto improve access to mental health services, continues to reduce their \nwait times and long lines, and continues to cooperate and reach out to \nthe community to bring in private providers on a referral basis so that \nveterans in need of care receive a referral and an appointment quickly.\n  My last point is that it is important that the VA follow that veteran \nto see to it they keep that appointment. In the cases of the suicides \nin the Atlanta VA, the failure to keep an appointment or the failure to \nhave a continuum of care in the following of that veteran substantially \ncreated and contributed to the loss of life.\n  While we have had tragedies at the Atlanta VA, things are improving. \nWhile we have had tragedies and suicides across the country, we are \nfinally focusing on veteran suicide.\n  Lastly, we need to focus on the fact that there are many contributing \nfactors to suicide. Many people will think it is someone returning from \nOperation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. In some cases, \nthat is true, but more often than not veterans over 50 are the victims \nof suicide. In fact, of the ones in Atlanta, they were Vietnam-era \nveterans.\n  It is important we understand that it is every veteran who is at \nrisk, that it is every veteran who needs access to treatment. We need \nto understand that we owe our veterans a big debt. It is most important \nto see to it that they don't lose their lives out of despair and \ndepression, that their lives are saved because our VA cares enough to \nsee to it that they have the continuum of care and the access to help \nthey so vitally need.\n  To the VA Administration, thanks for the improvements you are making. \nTo every Member of the Senate, let's continue to support the Veterans' \nAdministration with the funding necessary to deal with the more than 1 \nmillion new veterans returning home from the wars in the Middle East \nover the last decade.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, earlier this week the Congressional Budget \nOffice released its latest long-term outlook. Of course, the CBO, as it \nis known around here, is the authoritative guide to all things \ninvolving the finances and the fiscal picture for the Federal \nGovernment. That long-term outlook offered us a sobering reminder the \nFederal Government cannot defy the laws of fiscal gravity forever. In \nother words, as every American knows--every working family knows--your \noutput can't exceed your input forever. In other words, you can't spend \nmore money than you have coming in. Unless you are the Federal \nGovernment, of course. But sooner or later we will have to reverse the \ntrend of debt accumulation before it destroys our economy, because our \ncurrent path is simply unsustainable.\n  The crazy thing about it is that everybody in Washington, \nparticularly the Congress, knows that. Yet it seems as though they are \nin a state of denial about what could very well happen to our country \nand to our future if we don't act. As I said, it is a very sobering \nmessage, and it is also very different from the message President Obama \nhas been delivering lately. He likes to talk about America's short-term \nbudget deficit falling. To remind everybody, there is the debt and \nthere is the deficit. The deficit we measure on an annual basis. Debt \nis the cumulative shortfall between what comes in the front door and \nwhat goes out the back door. That debt is now about $17 trillion.\n  For these young people down here, that means they each owe about \n$52,000 because my generation and other adults have not been \nresponsible, and we have shoved off onto the next generation the \nresponsibilities we ought to be meeting ourselves. So here is the \nreality. Any short-term deficit reduction will be meaningless unless we \nadopt longer term reforms. That means where the Federal Government \nspends most of its money, which is in mandatory spending--the spending \nthat keeps Social Security and Medicare, among other programs, going. \nWe need to also bend the spending curve down so that we are spending \nless money as well.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates, when we factor in the \nlikely impact of rising debt levels, the publicly held debt is on \ncourse to reach 108 percent of our gross domestic product in 2038. The \ngross domestic product is basically another way of saying the size of \nour entire economy. So 108 percent of the size of our entire economy is \ntheir projection, and that is before we include money the Federal \nGovernment effectively owes itself.\n  I realize 2038 sounds like a long time from now. I remember as a kid \nI thought the year 2000 was going to be a long way away, but we now see \nthat only in our rearview mirror. But by 2038, under current law, our \nnet interest payments, as a share of our economy, will be 2\\1/2\\ times \ngreater than the 40-year average.\n  Let me boil that down a little bit. When we borrow money--because we \nare spending money we don't actually have--that adds to our annual \ndeficit. But it also, over time, adds to our national debt. We have to \nget somebody to buy that debt so we can continue to spend money we \ndon't have, so that we can continue to spend borrowed money. We have to \npay interest to our creditors. In other words, they are going to expect \na rate of return, as anybody would, when they loan somebody money. When \nChina loans us money, it is not cost free. When they buy a huge portion \nof our national debt, it is not cost free.\n  Over time we will see interest rates--which are really at historic \nlows now because of the aggressive action of the Federal Reserve \nkeeping those interest rates low--go back up to historic norms, and \nthen we are going to see that a larger and larger share of what the \nFederal Government spends is merely to pay China and our other \ncreditors who buy our debt, unless we\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\ntake aggressive measures to begin to bring our debt load down.\n  The President and the Democrats frequently demand more spending on \nthings such as research and development--that is a good thing--or \ninfrastructure--that is a good thing--yet they refuse to embrace the \nserious reforms necessary that enable us to do so. Here again, when the \ninterest payments on the debt invariably go up, they will crowd out \nspending on other priorities, such as research and development, such as \ninfrastructure, such as education, and others that should be among our \nnational priorities.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that by 2038 total spending \non everything other than major health care programs, Social Security, \nand net interest payments would decline to 7 percent of gross domestic \nproduct, and that is down from 11 percent, which is the average over \nthe last 40 years. That is the crowding-out effect I was mentioning a \nmoment ago. When we spend more and more money on these other programs, \nit crowds out spending on other things necessary to keep our economy \ngrowing and to keep people employed.\n  If we don't start reforming our biggest mandatory spending programs--\nagain, that is Social Security and Medicare--in a responsible way, it \nwill become much harder for the Federal Government to perform its most \nbasic obligations and it will leave these young people and others--such \nas my daughters, who are in their early thirties--holding the bag, not \nonly with the debt I mentioned a moment ago, but also with broken \nprograms that are unsustainable, that will not be there for them when \nthey turn 65 or when they get older.\n  It is a law of nature that you cannot keep spending money you don't \nhave, and you can't keep racking up debt forever without any \nconsequences. The only question is whether the reforms I am talking \nabout will be gradual--will be phased in over time--or whether they \nwill be sudden and abrupt and disruptive. If we start now in a \nresponsible way, these reforms can be gradual.\n  Thank goodness, when Social Security was passed people didn't live to \nbe 80 years old, on average, and they weren't as productive as they are \ntoday. That is a good thing. Modern medicine and nutrition have made it \npossible for us to live longer, on average, and to be much more \nproductive. But we need to make sure we take into account, through \nMedicare and Social Security, the fact that people are living longer \nand are more productive. We need to make certain our programs are \nmodernized to keep up with those facts and make sure they are available \nin the future, particularly among our most vulnerable citizens. If we \nwait until America is on the verge of a debt crisis, the reforms will \nhave to be abrupt. In other words, when the bottom drops out, a lot of \npeople are going to be hurt, and it will be far more difficult to \nprotect the most vulnerable among us from the harshest sort of cuts.\n  What I am suggesting makes sense. Wouldn't we prefer to be in control \nof a gradual reform of our mandatory spending programs that are phased \nin over years, in ways most Americans will not actually feel because it \ncan be done gradually? To me, it makes sense to do that as opposed to \nwatching the bottom drop out or just simply kicking the can down the \nroad. You know, they say: If you kick the can down the road long \nenough, pretty soon you are going to run out of road.\n  Let me again quote from the Congressional Budget Office. They said:\n\n       At some point, investors will begin to doubt the \n     government's willingness or ability to pay U.S. debt \n     obligations, making it more difficult or more expensive for \n     the government to borrow money. Moreover, even before that \n     point is reached, the high and rising amount of debt that CBO \n     projects under the extended baseline would have significant \n     negative consequences for both the economy and the Federal \n     budget.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Those negative consequences would include less private \ninvestment; more Federal spending on interest, which I have talked \nabout briefly; less flexibility to address unexpected events, which you \nknow always seems to occur--such as 9/11 or a natural disaster--and \nmore risk of a full-blown debt crisis.\n  To the extent President Obama and our friends across the aisle \nacknowledge our long-term debt problem, their main solution seems to be \nalways the same: Let's raise taxes some more. In fact, they are now \ntrying to use tax reform, which we thought should be revenue neutral, \nas a vehicle for another $1 trillion tax increase. We are told that is \na condition of even talking about reforming our Tax Code, to make it \nflatter, simpler, and more growth oriented. That is after the President \nand his allies have already raised taxes by $1.7 trillion. So there is \nnever enough to feed the beast of the Federal Government here in \nWashington. It is insatiable.\n  Meanwhile, to the extent the President acknowledges the need for \nMedicare reform, his proposals always involve more price controls, \nprimarily on the providers. Yet price controls have not solved \nMedicare's fundamental cost problems, and they won't solve it in the \nfuture. They say: We can save money on Medicare. We will just whack the \npayments we make to doctors and hospitals. I can tell you from talking \nto the hospitals and doctors in Texas--who would like to see Medicare \npatients but they can no longer afford to do so--that it is limiting \naccess to health care by just dealing with Medicare on this basis of \nprice controls and whacking payments to providers.\n  Amid the weakest economic recovery and the longest periods of high \nunemployment since the Great Depression, the last thing we need is \nanother massive tax increase that would discourage work, savings, and \ninvestment. We all know we cannot simply tax our way back into fiscal \nstability, and we cannot spend our way back into economic prosperity. \nIf the President would merely accept those two realities, we might \nfinally get the kind of long-term reforms and the real long-term \nspending cuts that might finally produce the economic recovery America \nis desperately waiting for and desperately needs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to address the energy \nefficiency bill we have been attempting to take up in this Chamber, and \nin particular an amendment I would like to offer to this bill.\n  I want to strongly urge my colleagues to please get on this bill. I \nreally wish we would do some business here in the Senate. I think we \nare on our way to our second consecutive week where we have not had a \nsingle vote on a single legislative matter--at least not that I can \nremember--and we have important legislative issues to deal with. I \nhappen to think this is one of them. There are many others. This is \njust not acceptable, that we go on and on without addressing the \nchallenges we need to address for the sake of the people we represent--\nthe American people.\n  I want to talk about one small particular but important aspect. I \nhave an amendment I have filed--and I thank my cosponsors, Senators \nCoburn, Flake, Risch, and Ayotte for joining me in this effort--which \nis an effort to repeal the renewable fuel standard. I want to talk \nabout why it is so important we do this.\n  First of all, the renewable fuel standard is an old law that is on \nthe books. It is a Federal Government mandate that we burn a certain \namount, a certain volume of ethanol in our gasoline.\n  We have gotten to the point where this year this mandate will require \nthat over 40 percent of all the corn we grow in America be turned into \nethanol and burned in the gasoline tanks of our automobiles. We are \nliterally burning our food. That is what we are doing on a very large \nscale.\n  The way this law works is it requires increases every year in the \namount of ethanol we are forced to burn through our gasoline tanks. \nThis policy is harmful to our environment, it is unambiguously raising \nfood prices, it makes it more expensive to fill up at the gas pump, and \nit is threatening good-paying jobs in Pennsylvania and other States. It \nis time for this to go.\n  What my amendment would do is completely repeal this renewable fuel \nstandard, which is overdue. I know\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\nthere is broad support for peeling this back, and I hope there is a \nmajority in this body who would support this amendment if we could only \nget onto it. So I do very much hope we will.\n  Let me explain how problematic this is. First of all, let's remember \nthe history. The whole idea behind creating this renewable fuel \nstandard--behind forcing people to take corn, convert it to ethanol, \nand burn it in their car engine--was that this was somehow going to be \ngood for the environment. That was the idea at the time it passed. In \nfact, it is clear that this is bad for the environment. This is \ncounterproductive from purely an environmental point of view.\n  The Environmental Working Group put out this statement:\n\n       The rapid expansion of corn ethanol production has \n     increased greenhouse gas emissions, worsened air and water \n     pollution, and driven up the price of food and feed.\n\n  This is the Environmental Working Group that came to that conclusion.\n  It is widely acknowledged that using corn ethanol instead of gasoline \nactually creates more carbon dioxide emissions--the greenhouse gas \nemissions about which many people are concerned. You have more of that \nwhen you burn ethanol than when you burn gasoline. In fact, the Clean \nAir Task Force estimates that carbon emissions from corn ethanol \nbetween 2015 and 2044, on the path we are on now, would exceed 1.4 \nbillion tons. That is 300 million tons more than if the energy were \nsupplied by gasoline instead. So it is counterproductive from a carbon \nemission point of view.\n  We have a chart here that quotes a conclusion from a study at \nStanford University that indicates the harm that ethanol does directly \nto human health.\n\n       Vehicles running on ethanol will generate higher \n     concentrations of ozone than those using gasoline, especially \n     in the winter . . .\n\n  Finally, in 2011 the National Academy of Sciences stated:\n\n       Projected air quality effects from ethanol fuel would be \n     more damaging to human health than those from gasoline use.\n\n  I understand there was a time when we didn't know this, when we had a \ndifferent impression about the health and the air quality implications \nof using ethanol, but we don't have that excuse anymore. It is now \nclear that using ethanol instead of gasoline is net harmful to the \nenvironment and harmful to human health. That all by itself is a pretty \ngood reason to reconsider this, but there are more reasons.\n  One is the fact that it is more expensive to produce ethanol than it \nis to produce gasoline. So not only is this harmful to our health, but \nit costs more to do it. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 \nthe renewable fuel standard will increase the per-gallon cost of \ngasoline by anywhere from 10 to 25 cents. That adds up. That could be \nover $300 a year on average for the average family. It is billions of \ndollars across our economy. That is a deadweight loss. No good comes \nout of that extra cost. It just reduces the standard of living of \neverybody who is forced to bear that cost.\n  In addition to increasing fuel prices, it increases food prices--\nwhich stands to reason. If you take 40 percent of all the corn produced \nin America and you burn it, there is that much less corn available for \nfood. And corn is an incredibly basic and important source of food both \ndirectly and indirectly. This phenomenon alone--the diversion of corn \nfor ethanol production--is deemed by many scholars who have looked at \nthis as costing maybe as much as a full percentage point a year for the \naverage family. That is on the order of over $150 per year that we \nforce people to pay in the form of higher food prices alone.\n  Another example is the indirect way in which higher corn prices \nfilter into the rest of the economy. The fact is that feed grain is \ntypically half the cost of raising livestock, and corn is the dominant \nfeed grain in America. The USDA's Chief Economist stated that the \nrenewable fuel standard increases corn prices between 30 and 40 \npercent. And it got so bad, it got so absurd that in 2012 there were \nfarmers feeding their cattle candy because it was cheaper to buy candy \nthan to buy corn. How absurd is it that the Federal Government policy \nis driving this kind of behavior? It makes no sense at all.\n  Another fact about ethanol is that it is harmful to motors. It is \nharmful to engines. The reciprocating piston engines we use in our \nvehicles--motorcycles, boat engines, and others--are designed to burn \ngasoline, they are not designed to burn ethanol. And the EPA has \nacknowledged that ethanol is harmful to these engines because ethanol \nis corrosive. The EPA acknowledged that ``unlike other fuel components, \nethanol is corrosive.'' It is that water mixture that does damage to \nengines. AAA has warned that raising the ethanol content in fuel \nfurther--which is what current law has in store for us--will damage 95 \npercent of the cars on the road today.\n  The last thing I would point out is that this policy threatens good-\npaying jobs. I visited a refinery in southeastern Pennsylvania, a \nrefinery that employs hundreds of workers in good-paying jobs providing \nthe gasoline we need to move our economy, to move our families, to get \nto and from work, and to do all the things we need to do in life. Their \nability to be a viable, ongoing refinery is jeopardized, it is \nthreatened by the renewable fuel standard.\n  I wish to read a letter from the AFL-CIO business manager, a \ngentleman named Pat Gillespie whose concern is the job security of the \nworkers he represents. And this is a refinery that was shuttered and in \ndanger of never reopening. It took an amazing effort by the \nstakeholders in this community to make this viable, and it is viable \nright now and it is employing hundreds of workers in Delaware County. \nThe point that he makes is this:\n  Our resurrected refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania once again needs \nyour intercession. The impact of the dramatic spike in the cost of the \nRIN credits from four cents to one dollar per gallon will cause a \ntremendous depression in our refinery's bottom line in 2013. Of course \nin the building trades we need them to have economic vitality to bring \nabout the construction and maintenance projects that our members depend \non, and the steel workers of course need the economic vitality so they \ncan maintain and expand their jobs with the refinery. We need your \nassistance, your help with this matter.\n\n  I want to provide the help that they need, that Pennsylvanians need, \nthat we all need from this ill-conceived policy that clearly has no \nplace in the United States anymore. The help is in the form of this \namendment. This amendment solves the problem. It repeals this ill-\nconceived standard completely. It would go away. I know there is \nbipartisan support for this amendment. I have several colleagues who \ncosponsored this amendment. This is our opportunity to pass this \namendment.\n  To recap, this is bad policy on every possible front. The renewable \nfuel standard--forcing us to burn so much of our corn in the form of \nethanol--is harmful to our environment. It is harmful to human health. \nIt increases food prices. It increases fuel prices at the pump. It \ndamages the engines on which we rely. It jeopardizes jobs. What more \narguments do we need to bring an end to this misguided program? We know \nthis. We have known this for some time. Now is the time to act.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let's get on the bill. Let's have \namendments. Let's have lots of amendments. If we had spent the last \nweek mowing down amendments instead of arguing about them, we would be \ndone by now. We could have processed many dozens of amendments easily, \nand one of them could have been this one.\n  I don't think it is too late. We could still get on this bill. We \ncould still do something that would be very sensible for our \nenvironment, for our economy, for consumers, for our health, and for \nthe sake of our jobs. Let's repeal the renewable fuel standard. Let's \ndo it by adopting my amendment, and let's do that by getting on this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again to talk about the urgent \nneed, as October 1 approaches, to vote on a ``no Washington exemption \nfrom ObamaCare'' amendment or bill. Again, this need isn't of my \ncreating. I wish it weren't here, but it is because of an illegal rule \nissued by the Obama administration to completely reverse the clear \nlanguage on the subject in ObamaCare.\n  I will back up and give a brief history.\n  During the ObamaCare debate, a proposal was made by many of us, led \nby Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. The proposal was simple: Every \nMember of Congress and all congressional staff should live under the \nmost onerous provisions of ObamaCare. Specifically, we should have to \nget our health care from the exchanges where millions of Americans are \ngoing against their will, having lost in many cases the previous health \ncare coverage from employers that they enjoyed.\n  So Senator Grassley said that is what Washington should have to live \nwith, and there was explicit, specific language put in ObamaCare to \nthat point for Congress--that every Member of Congress and all \ncongressional staff have to go to the exchange. The intent behind this \nwas crystal clear. As the Senator said, ``The more that Congress \nexperiences the laws that pass, the better.'' I agree with that. I \nagreed with it then, and I agree with it now.\n  Amazingly, that provision got in the final version of ObamaCare. Then \nI guess it was a classic example, if you will, of what Nancy Pelosi \nsaid: ``We have to pass the law to figure out what is in it.''\n  It did pass. Folks around Capitol Hill did figure out what is in it \nwith regard to that section and they said: Oh, you know what. We have \nto go to the exchanges. We don't like that. That is going to create \nout-of-pocket expense. We don't like that.\n  Immediately, furious lobbying started, continued for some time, and \nsure enough, as a result President Obama personally intervened. He was \npersonally involved, and his administration issued a rule on the \nsubject right as Congress safely had left town for the August recess. \nThat rule said two things, basically. No. 1, it said this official \ncongressional staff--we don't know who that is, so every Member of \nCongress will get to decide what staff, if any, under their employment, \nwill have to go to the exchange.\n  That is ridiculous. I think that is ludicrous on its face. That is \nnot what the statute says at all. It says ``all official congressional \nstaff'' and every Member of Congress should not be able to decide \ndifferently, Member by Member, whether anyone at all on their staff has \nto go to the exchange.\n  But the second part of this illegal rule is even more interesting. It \nsaid whoever does go to the exchange, in terms of Members and staff, \ngets to take their very generous taxpayer-funded subsidy from the \nFederal employee health benefits plan with them.\n  The ObamaCare statute doesn't say that at all and, in fact, a \ndifferent part of the ObamaCare statute says exactly the opposite. It \nis about employees in general who go to the exchange. It says when an \nemployee goes to the exchange he or she loses any previous employer-\nprovided subsidy. That is section 1512. That is explicit in the \nObamaCare statute.\n  This special rule for Washington is illegal, flatout illegal and \ncontrary to the statute in my opinion. But it goes into effect October \n1 and that is why my colleagues and I who support the ``no Washington \nexemption'' language had to take action, had to fight for a vote now. \nWe need this debate and vote now, before October 1. That is what it is \nall about.\n  As I said, my distinguished colleague from Iowa who authored this \nlanguage could not have been more clear: ``The more that Congress \nexperiences the laws it passes, the better.''\n  Also, employment lawyers who have looked at the statute agree with me \nthat there is no big subsidy we should be able to take with us to the \nexchange. For instance, David Ermer, a lawyer who has represented \ninsurers in the Federal employee program for 30 years, said, ``I do not \nthink Members of Congress and their staff can get funds for coverage in \nthe exchanges under the existing law.'' That was in the New York Times.\n  Many other employment lawyers have said the same because it is \ncrystal clear from the statute. As National Review Online reported:\n\n       Most employment lawyers interpreted that to mean that the \n     taxpayer-funded Federal health insurance subsidies dispensed \n     to those on Congress's payroll--which now range from $5,000 \n     to $11,000 a year--would have to end.\n\n  Yes. That is the clear language and the clear legislative history of \nthe statute. Yet we have all this hocus-pocus to do exactly the \nopposite, contrary to the law. As the Heritage Foundation said:\n\n       Obama's action to benefit the political class is the latest \n     example of this administration doing whatever it wants, \n     regardless of whether it has the authority to do so.\n\n  The Office of Personnel Management overstepped its authority when it \ncarried out the President's request to exempt Congress from the \nrequirements of the health care law. Changing law is the responsibility \nof the legislative branch, not the executive branch.\n  Also, the Heritage Foundation said:\n\n       Washington's political class and allied big special \n     interest lobbyists are responsible. And until this bad law is \n     fully repealed, the President's team and Congress should \n     submit fully to its multiple and costly requirements, just \n     like everyone else.\n\n  The National Review Online has echoed the same, and they are right:\n\n       Under behind-the-scenes pressure from members of Congress \n     in both parties, President Obama used the quiet of the August \n     recess to personally order the Office of Personnel \n     Management, which supervises federal employment issues, to \n     interpret the law so as to retain the generous congressional \n     benefits.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal opined:\n\n       . . . If Republicans want to show that they ``stand for \n     something,'' this is it. If they really are willing to do \n     ``whatever it takes'' to oppose this law, there would be no \n     more meaningful way to prove it.\n\n  This is why we are here at this moment and this is why it is so \nimportant and necessary to have this debate and this vote now. I am \nvery happy that at least some of my colleagues have properly recognized \nthat, and that includes the distinguished majority floor manager of \nthis bill, and have agreed in principle to this vote. The distinguished \nmajority leader Senator Reid has agreed in principle to this vote. But \nit is interesting that at least in his case, although we have some \nagreement in principle, we have no vote and, frankly, I am not \nsurprised. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. If you agree to a \nvote, then you have to have a vote. We need to have a vote. We need to \nhave a vote by October 1 and I am going to keep fighting for a vote. \nThat is basic fairness, to deal with this illegal rule. Again, the \ntiming is here and now and that is not of my doing. I did not favor the \nillegal rule that makes the issue come before us. I did not favor the \nOctober 1 deadline. That should never have happened at all. But it is \nbefore us and that deadline is before us because of the illegal rule \nfrom the Obama administration. That is why we need a vote. We need a \nvote before October 1.\n  As I said, the distinguished majority leader says he will permit a \nvote. He says that in theory but it does not happen in practice. Again \nwe wait and wait and wait and demand a vote. It does not have to be on \nthis bill. I will continue to come back. I will file this amendment \nwith regard to the CR. That is a perfect place to have this debate and \nvote or we can do it as a stand-alone bill. We can do that easily next \nweek, before October 1. We can do it without disrupting any other floor\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nbusiness, without delaying any other action with regard to the CR or \nanything else.\n\n  In that spirit, let me ask a unanimous consent in that regard. I ask \nunanimous consent that on Wednesday, September 25, 2013, at 10 a.m., \nthe Senate discharge the Senate Committee on Finance from consideration \nof my bill, the No Exemption For Washington from ObamaCare Act, proceed \nimmediately to consideration of that bill, S. 1497; that without any \nintervening motions or debate, the Senate proceed with 60 minutes of \ndebate on the bill evenly divided and controlled by the majority leader \nand myself; that the bill not be subject to any amendments, points of \norder or motions to commit; and that after debate has expired the bill \nbe engrossed for a third reading, read a third time, and the Senate \nimmediately vote on passage, subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold; and that the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the \ntable following that vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. I understand the floor leader is doing that for the \nmajority leader and I think that is very unfortunate. If the \ndistinguished majority leader agrees to a vote in principle, we need a \nvote in reality. I said at the time when he agreed to it in principle \nthat is interesting but I did not think it would happen in reality, and \nsure enough, this week that is correct, it has not happened.\n  I think the majority leader, frankly, is very concerned about this \nvote. That is why he and others actually relied on threats and \nintimidation to try to avoid this vote. That did not work. It is not \ngoing to work. I am coming back with this amendment. I am coming back \nwith this bill. He has agreed to a vote in principle, so let's have a \nvote. Clearly, not from my doing, but because of the illegal Obama \nadministration rule, that vote is timely now. That vote has to \nreasonably happen before October 1, which is why I proposed that \nunanimous consent. That is a way to have the vote which the majority \nleader agreed to in principle without disrupting any other business on \nthe Senate floor. It would literally take 60 minutes of debate and a \n15-minute vote.\n  I am sorry that was not accepted by the majority leader, but needless \nto say I will be back with my bill, with my amendment. The American \npeople deserve a vote because, however it comes out, the American \npeople should be able to know what Senators will stand through that \nvote with Washington and what Senators will stand with America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor let me say to \nthe Senator from Louisiana, I want to talk a little bit about exactly \nthis question of reality and how we can address the Senate's business \nand address the issue of the Senator from Louisiana as well--not in \nprinciple but with an actual vote, because the reality is there could \nhave been already a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from \nLouisiana. I will describe exactly why that has not taken place, but it \ncould have and in my view should have already taken place. It should \nnot have been about principles, it should have been about the reality \nof the vote the Senator from Louisiana is talking about.\n  Here we are. Of course it is hard for the public to figure out \nexactly how the Senate works. The new Senator from Hawaii is a student \nof this. We have a bipartisan energy efficiency bill on the floor of \nthe Senate now.\n  As far as I am concerned, I describe it this way. This is a platonic \nideal of what bipartisan consensus legislation ought to be all about. \nIt is an extraordinary coalition built in favor of this--the Business \nRoundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of \nCommerce--with some of the country's leading business organizations \nthat favor energy efficiency, and they are doing it for a reason. This \nis going to increase American productivity. We are going to save money \nbecause we are not going to waste so much energy and this is going to \ncreate good-paying jobs in a variety of new fields and technologies \nthat are going to be good for people in our country.\n  My view is we should have already finished this debate with relevant \namendments--relevant amendments offered by both sides. In fact, when we \nstarted the debate, for the first 4 or 5 hours there was a good \nbipartisan amendment offered almost hourly. We have them all stacked up \nlike planes hovering over an airport.\n  At that point conservatives indicated there were two areas they felt \nstrongly about getting a vote on. Again, I am not talking about \nprinciples here. We are talking about the reality of a vote, a vote \nthat could have already taken place. One of them was on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana. I happen to disagree with the \namendment strongly, but in all of the discussions I said it seems \nappropriate that there be a vote on that amendment and on another \namendment which I disagree with, involving the Keystone Pipeline. At \nthat point a very clear statement was made by the leadership that if we \nare talking about the energy efficiency bill and these two votes--not \nprinciples, but realities of having those two votes, a vote on the \nVitter amendment and a vote on the Keystone Pipeline--and then have \nrelevant amendments that relate to energy efficiency, we would be able \nto complete this bill. Since we started it last week, I am of the view \nthat we would already have been done by now.\n\n  After that message was communicated by the leadership on this side of \nthe aisle, we saw the response to that. It was in response to a vote on \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana, a vote on the \nproposal offered by Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, and a procedural \nagreement to vote on other relevant amendments. We had scores and \nscores of other amendments offered to this bill that were clearly not \nrelated to energy efficiency. So I say to the Senator from Louisiana: \nThat is the reality--not the rhetoric from the Senator or principles--\nof why there has not been a recorded up-or-down vote.\n  By the way, this is a vote that would have met the Senator's \nprinciples, that he wanted the vote before October 1. We would have \nalready had that up-or-down vote on the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Louisiana. It would have been done in accordance with the \nwishes of the Senator from Louisiana before October 1. The sole hurdle \nin terms of securing that has been the scores of amendments that have \nbeen offered primarily--really exclusively--from colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who want to deal with other energy issues.\n  I want to make one other comment with respect to this. Senator \nMurkowski and I--because we have worked in a bipartisan way since we \nwere given the opportunity to lead the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee at the beginning of this year, and we are honored to have the \nSenator from Hawaii on the committee--have said our sole focus is to \ntry to find common ground on a host of energy issues that have been \nbacked up, many of which colleagues on the other side of the aisle feel \nvery strongly about.\n  I would highlight, for example, nuclear waste legislation, where \nthere has been no progress for years and years. Senator Murkowski and \nI, with Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander, have a bipartisan bill \nwe think would allow us to finally get on top of a critical issue. I \nfeel very strongly--and I know the Senator from Louisiana cares a great \ndeal about this--that we need to look at ways to cap the potential of \nnatural gas, which is 50 percent cleaner than the other fossil fuels. I \nhave been working with industry and environmental leaders on what I \ncall a win-win solution where we could build more pipelines--the \nSenator from Louisiana knows it is important for the infrastructure of \nthe natural gas business--and in the future we are going to make them \nbetter pipelines. We would have pipelines that don't leak so much \nmethane, which would be good for consumers, good for the planet, and it \nwould be good for the industry.\n  We are interested in dealing with nuclear waste issues, natural gas \nissues, and offshore energy issues which, again, are important to the \nSenator from Louisiana. It is pretty hard to get Senators to focus on \nthose kinds of issues if we cannot move a piece of legislation such as \nthis energy efficiency bill which has an unprecedented coalition behind \nit. It has so many obvious benefits, without the mandates and\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nwithout a one-size-fits-all strategy from Washington.\n  I wanted to set the record straight in particular on that point.\n  The Senator from Louisiana and I are going to continue our \ndiscussions, as we have been doing, but I especially want to \nemphasize--since my colleague from Louisiana has been talking about \nwhether people say you can vote in principle but you don't vote in \nreality--that the reality is: We could have already had a vote on the \namendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana before the October 1 \ndate, that he said he felt strongly about, if colleagues on his side \nhad not insisted on all of these other amendments not related to energy \nefficiency.\n  By the way, I made it clear to them--coming from a State that doesn't \nproduce fossil fuels--that I was willing to work with them, \nparticularly in areas I have just described, such as tapping into the \npotential of natural gas.\n  So the reality is there could have already been a recorded up-or-down \nvote on the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana before \nOctober 1, and I hope he and others will continue to work with the \nbipartisan leadership so we can quickly get a finite list of additional \nrelevant amendments that would be offered after the Senator from \nLouisiana gets his vote and after there is a vote on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota. Those are the realities of \nwhat has happened over the last week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished majority floor leader, and I accept them. I know they are \nsincere in terms of his actions and in terms of his involvement.\n  My point, of course, was not about him. My point is I don't think it \nwas an accident that we never got to yes in practice. I don't think \nthat was an accident at all. I don't think it was an accident from the \npoint of view of the majority leader. I don't think it was an accident \nfrom others' point of view.\n  If we want a clear glimpse into their true approach, we have to look \nat the amendments they floated last week, which were literally about \nthreats, intimidation, and bribery. So that is a pretty clear window on \nwhere they are coming from. It is certainly not where the distinguished \nfloor leader is coming from.\n  Let me close by saying there is one more point of reality I would \nunderscore, and that is this: In the Senate there is one Member who can \nvirtually guarantee that a vote happens, and that is the majority \nleader. He has promised an up-or-down vote on this before October 1 in \ntheory. He has the power to clearly make that happen one way or the \nother in practice, so we will see if he does. It is as simple as that.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to mark the \nfifth anniversary--the fifth birthday, if you will--the fifth \nanniversary of the application of the Keystone XL Pipeline. TransCanada \napplied for approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline in September of 2008, \nand here we are, 5 years later to the date, without a decision.\n  Normally, when we celebrate an anniversary or birthday, if you will, \nit is a good thing. It is positive. Obviously, in this case, that is \nnot the case. Five years have gone by with no decision from this \nadministration on the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is mind-boggling.\n  How can we be following the laws, the rules, and regulations of this \ncountry when a company applies for approval of something and there is a \ndecision the administration has to make--is it in the national interest \nor is it not? That is the decision before the administration. We have \nto make a decision. We elect Presidents to make decisions. So here we \nare 5 years later with no decision, not a yes, not a no--five years of \nstudy of the project and still no decision.\n  This project will help generate more energy for our country, more \njobs, economic growth, and tax revenue without raising taxes. It is a \nproject that will help us become energy secure, energy independent, \nwith Canada. Working with Canada, our closest friend and ally, will \nenhance national security so we don't have to get oil from the Middle \nEast, something Americans very much want.\n  As a matter of fact, there was a recent poll put out by Harris done \nthis summer. In that poll--and I have it right here--in a Harris poll \nreleased this summer, 82 percent of voting Americans voiced support for \nthe Keystone XL project--82 percent. Think about that: 82 percent of \nAmericans want the project approved, but for 5 years the administration \nhasn't been able to make a decision, and they are still not making a \ndecision. The indication now is this could go into next year. So now we \nare working on year 6.\n  Think about our economy. Our economy is stagnant. Businesses aren't \ninvesting in new capital and equipment and creating jobs. One of the \nreasons is because of burdensome regulation. This is a clear example: 5 \nyears with no decision.\n  This poll I referred to, some of the other results of it: 82 percent \nof voting Americans support the Keystone XL Pipeline project. That is \nnot an old poll; that was done this summer. Some of the other \ninformation from that poll: 85 percent of people agree Keystone XL \nwould help strengthen America's economic security--85 percent. Eighty-\none percent of people agree Keystone XL would strengthen America's \nenergy security.\n  Seventy-seven percent of the American people--voting Americans--agree \nthat Keystone XL will help strengthen America's national security--as I \njust mentioned, not getting oil from the Middle East. That is a no-\nbrainer. Seventy-five percent agree that Keystone XL would benefit the \nU.S. military by increasing access to oil from Canada, our closest \nfriend and ally.\n  One of the issues this has brought up is concern about the \nenvironmental impact. Let's look at the facts: In the 5 years since \nTransCanada applied for approval--in that 5-year span--the State \nDepartment has done multiple environmental impact statements, I think \non the order of four draft or supplemental environmental impact \nstatements. The finding on the environment has been: ``No significant \nenvironmental impact.'' That is the Obama administration's own State \nDepartment: ``No significant environmental impact'' after 5 years of \nstudy. How many more years of study do we need? How is our economy \ngoing to work when businesses that want to invest billions in building \nvital infrastructure for our economy and create jobs have to wait 5 \nyears before they get a go-ahead? And we are wondering why we have a \nsluggish economy. We are wondering why we are still importing oil from \nthe Middle East.\n  This isn't just about working with Canada to produce energy for this \ncountry. My home State will put 100,000 barrels of oil a day into this \npipeline--the lightest, sweetest crude produced anywhere in the \ncountry--and take it to our refineries in this country to be used by \nAmerican consumers and businesses.\n  Another criticism the opponents will sometimes bring up is that the \noil is going to be exported.\n  They say: Oh, no, the oil is going to be exported; we shouldn't \napprove the Keystone XL Pipeline; we shouldn't work with Canada; we \nshouldn't move our own long-term refineries because it is going to be \nexported.\n  Again, let's take a look at the facts. In June 2011, the Obama \nadministration's Department of Energy put out a study which said \nspecifically that the oil will be used in the United States. The oil \nwill be used in the United States and it will help reduce gasoline \nprices for Americans.\n  That wasn't some proponent who put that out; that was the Obama \nadministration's own Department of Energy after doing their study.\n  Again, let's take a look at the facts. In my State, this kind of \npipeline, as I said, will move 100,000 barrels a day on this pipeline \nwhich we are now moving by truck and by train. This pipeline will help \ntake 500 trucks a day off our\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\nhighways, saving incredible wear and tear but also providing greater \nsafety because we will not have all of those trucks transporting this \noil and gas.\n  Another argument is, if we don't build the Keystone XL Pipeline, then \nthe oil in the oil sands in Canada will not be produced. Those who are \nagainst using fossil fuels--folks who just say, no, we are not going to \nuse fossil fuels anymore, we don't want to use them--they say we don't \nwant to use the pipeline because then the oil sands in Canada will not \nbe produced. Again, look at the facts. The facts are very \nstraightforward. The oil is already being produced and it is moving by \ntruck and train, not by pipeline. If we don't utilize it in the United \nStates, then instead of coming to the United States, it will go to \nChina, where now we are moving it by tanker across the ocean, and it is \ngoing to refineries that have much higher emissions. So we have worse \nenvironmental standards, and instead of us working with Canada to get \nour oil rather than getting it from the Middle East, which we are doing \nnow, all of that oil goes to China.\n  Think about it. Is this what Americans want? Go out and ask them. \nThat is why I cited the poll just a minute ago, saying 80 percent-plus \nsupport this project. I think some of them who don't, aren't aware of \nthe project. But if we ask any American, they are going to say they \ndon't want to rely on the Middle East for oil. They would much rather \nwork with Canada. They would much rather produce it here, such as in my \nhome State, and work with Canada so we are energy independent, we are \nenergy secure, we don't have to rely on the Middle East. Let China and \nthe other countries work with the Middle East to get their oil. Ask any \nAmerican what they think about that proposition and we know what answer \nwe will get. But the President, for whatever reason--here we are 5 \nyears later and he is still not making a decision.\n\n  Today is the fifth anniversary. We are starting on year 6, and the \nquestion is, How much longer does this go on?\n  I have spoken about this in terms of energy and energy security for \nthis country: low-cost, dependable energy, so when American families \nand businesses need energy to fuel their vehicles, they know it is \nreliable, dependable, it is produced in this country and in a country \nsuch as Canada, our closest ally, not in the Middle East, and that we \nare not going to have to send our men and women in uniform into a very \ndifficult situation. We will not have to send them, at a minimum, into \nthe middle of a situation where--look at what is going on in Syria. \nLook at the volatility. We want to depend on that area for our oil? Of \ncourse not.\n  It is about energy. It is about energy security. It is a national \nsecurity interest. It is about jobs.\n  There have been many studies on the number of jobs; the proponents \nargue for one and the opponents argue for another. But let's go back to \nthe State Department's own numbers after 5 years of study. They say \nmore than 42,000 jobs will be created by the project. Don't take a \nstudy from the opponents of the project. Don't take a study from the \nproponents of the project. Take the State Department's own study: more \nthan 42,000 jobs, at a time when our economy badly needs quality \nconstruction jobs, and it doesn't cost one penny of taxpayer money. As \na matter of fact, the project produces hundreds of millions to help \nreduce debt and deficit without higher taxes.\n  For all of these reasons, this project should be approved. For all of \nthese reasons, this project is very much in the national interest.\n  I have worked in this body, and I have worked with our friends and \ncolleagues in the House, to see if we can't approve this \ncongressionally. This is a Presidential decision. The decision before \nthe administration is to decide is this project in the national \ninterest or is it not in the national interest. The American people \nhave already decided. In poll after poll, 70, 80 percent of the \nAmerican people have decided--it doesn't take them 5 years--but the \nadministration can't decide. So Congress should. Congress should step \nup and decide. I believe it is very clearly in the national interest \nfor all of the reasons I have clearly laid out. I think we need to work \nwith our colleagues in the House and find a way to make a decision that \nthe President seems to be unable to make.\n  I believe that this project is in the national interest; that we do \nneed to be energy secure; that we do want the jobs and the economic \nactivity for our people in this country. And I believe this decision \nneeds to be made not on the basis of what special interest groups want \nbut on the basis of what the American people want, and that verdict is \nin, and it is overwhelming.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Helium Stewardship Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there are four Senators on the floor who \nare each going to take about 5 minutes or so as we try--the leadership \nis now working to make it possible for us to have a unanimous consent \nrequest so that we can have a vote on the helium legislation after the \nrespective caucus lunches.\n  So as of now we all will take, the four of us involved--Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Barrasso, Senator Cruz--about 5 minutes. We hope to \nbe able to propound the unanimous consent request as we all talk. We \nwant all Senators to know that we hope to be able to vote on the \nlegislation shortly after lunch.\n  We know that in Washington, DC, it is almost as if there is an \ninexhaustible capacity to manufacture false crises. I am here to say \nthat if Congress does not act immediately to pass the legislation we \nare discussing, scores of American manufacturing and technology \ncompanies employing millions of American workers are going to find it \nimpossible to continue their current operations. That is because \nwithout this legislation, those workers and companies would no longer \nbe able to get access to helium, which is a critical industrial gas \nwithout which these companies cannot operate.\n  Every week in our country there are 700,000 MRI scans performed. \nWithout liquid helium, which is used to cool these superconducting \nmagnets, without which you cannot run MRIs--if you did not have that \ncapacity, millions of Americans would lose access to a critical \ndiagnostic test. Helium is also used for welding in the aerospace \nindustry, and it is essential for manufacturing optical fiber for the \ntelecommunications industry and for chip manufacturing in the \nsemiconductor sector.\n  Without going into all of the history, our government got involved \nwith helium after World War I because the defense sector needed it.\n  Ever since that time--I have been discussing this with colleagues--\nPresident after President, Congress after Congress, has tried to come \nup with a policy that finally gets government out of the helium \nbusiness while still ensuring the needs of the military business and \nour taxpayers were protected in the process.\n  Senator Murkowski and I have worked for many months on this \nlegislation in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and we \nbelieve our bipartisan bill accomplishes this. That is because the bill \nrequires the Federal Government to shift from selling helium at a \ngovernment-set price to selling helium at a market-based price. The \nbill does this over a 5-year period, so there is no panic, no sudden \nchanges in supply, and American businesses can stop worrying about \nwhether the helium supply truck is going to actually show up in the \nnext month.\n  The bill phases out commercial sales over the next 7 or 8 years and \nthen gets the Federal Government out of the helium business entirely. \nWith prices for helium now reflecting their real value in the \nmarketplace, the private sector would have the incentives it needs to \ninvest in new helium supplies to replace what is now a Federal reserve. \nI will wrap up by saying there have been loads of bad puns over the \nyears about Congress floating various ideas for new helium legislation, \nbut this is no joke. If Congress does not pass legislation to extend \noperation of the Federal Helium Reserve, 40 percent of the U.S. supply \nof this absolutely necessary industrial\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\ncommodity will disappear at the end of the month.\n  We have been informed the Federal agency that handles this, the \nBureau of Land Management, would actually start closing the valves on \nOctober 1 if Congress has not acted.\n  I note Senator Murkowski is here. I would ask my colleagues if \nSenator Murkowski could go next.\n  Senator Cruz has been very gracious in terms of how we are trying to \nhandle this. Both Senator Murkowski and Senator Cruz could speak and \nSenator Barrasso is here. I think we would all be done by the 12:30 \nwindow.\n  Let me say to my partner, once again, this is the kind of bipartisan \napproach we have tried to show in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. I am very appreciative of all she does to make our \npartnership to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If I may, I would at this time defer to Senator \nBarrasso and Senator Cruz before my comments. I know both of them need \nto dash off the floor.\n  If Senator Cruz wishes to speak at this point in time, then I will \nwrap up after he and Senator Barrasso have spoken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Oregon and my friend from Alaska for \ntheir leadership.\n  As do they, I support extending the Helium Program. This is a good \nand important program that is critical to industry, it is critical to \njobs, and it is critical to our high-tech community. I salute both the \nSenate and the House for a positive bill that generates revenue for the \nFederal Treasury and that gets the Government, in time, out of the \nhelium business. I think that is a good and positive step.\n  I would note the House of Representatives passed a bill that \ncontinued this program but that devoted the revenue that came from this \nto deficit reduction. At a time when our national debt is approaching \n$17 trillion, I think devoting that revenue to deficit reduction is a \ngood and appropriate place to direct that revenue.\n  When the bill came to the Senate--this bill is projected to generate \napproximately $500 million in new revenue for the Federal Government \nover 10 years. When it came to the Senate, roughly $400 million in new \nspending was added to the bill that came out of that $500 million that \nwas generated.\n  In my view, given the fiscal and economic challenges in this country, \nthat revenue would be better spent paying down our deficit, reducing \nour national debt, than it would be on new spending. Indeed, over the \ncourse of this week, I have had numerous conversations with my \ncolleagues where I have urged them that if new spending were to be \nadded, for them to endeavor to find other areas of Federal spending \nthat could be reduced, that could be cut to make up for that, so we \ncould devote the full $500 million to reducing the deficit. I think \nthat would be the most fiscally responsible approach to be taken.\n  For that reason, I have had concerns about proceeding on this bill \nwith unanimous consent, proceeding on this bill authorizing an \nadditional $500 million in new spending without debate, without a vote. \nEarlier this week, I had lodged internally an objection to do so.\n  I am pleased to note that in conversations with Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Wyden, we have reached an agreement where this matter will not \nproceed by unanimous consent but, rather, will proceed with a rollcall \nvote to be scheduled this afternoon, where each Senator will cast his \nor her vote.\n  With that agreement, I am happy to withdraw any objection and allow \nus to go forward.\n  I would note it is important for economic growth and for the high-\ntech industry to maintain this program, but at the same time I hope \ngoing forward, when new spending is authorized, all of us will work to \ncut spending to compensate so we can devote the maximum resources \npossible to paying down our deficit and paying down our debt.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Do I understand the Senator does not oppose the bill as passed in the \nHouse that would have authorized this program to go forward, but the \nconcern is new revenue has been generated that is being spent for other \nprograms?\n  Mr. CRUZ. That is correct. In terms of a technical offset, the \nspending is offset by the revenue. I am not arguing that it fails to \noffset in the typical language of the Senate; rather, my concern is \nthat is $500 million in new revenue that could be directed to deficit \nreduction. Given the magnitude of our national debt, if we have $500 \nmillion in new revenue from selling helium, sending it to the private \nsector, I would far rather see that $500 million used to pay down our \ndeficit.\n  What I have urged my colleagues to do is, if there are new spending \nprograms that are of particular concern to the citizens of their \nStates, to find other aspects of the Federal budget that could be cut \nto offset it so that entire $500 million could go to deficit reduction \nrather than to funding the new spending.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the Senator yield for a question--I am going to ask \na question and respond to Senator Sessions' point in one second.\n  There are differences between the House bill and the Senate bill. The \nHouse bill does not get the government out of the helium business \npermanently. The Senate bill gets the government out of the helium \nbusiness permanently; A, it does it in a way that is fully offset and, \nB, not only is it offset under our proposal, passed unanimously in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, $51 million would actually be \nused to lower the deficit. There is a full offset, A; get the \ngovernment out of the helium business permanently, and $51 million \nwould be returned to be used for deficit reduction.\n  What I wish to do, by way of moving things along--and Senator Cruz \nhas been very gracious in terms of the handling of this and saw me on \nshort notice. I am very appreciative.\n  I wish to propound the unanimous consent request at this time. I am \nasking the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz, a question, if this is \nacceptable, and then we will go right back to my colleagues.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Texas if we would now move to ask \nunanimous consent that at 2 p.m. the energy committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of the House bill and the Senate proceed to \nits consideration; that the substitute amendment at the desk, which I \nhave been discussing and I have talked about, be agreed to.\n  We would then have 15 minutes of debate equally divided between \nyourself and myself or our designees; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, the bill would be amended and be read a third time and \nthe Senate would proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended; \nthat motions to reconsider would be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, with all of the above occurring with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas would this unanimous consent request be \nacceptable?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am pleased to tell my friend it would be acceptable. I \nhave no objection to that. I appreciate the willingness of the \nChairman, along with Senator Murkowski, to allow this to come to a \nrollcall vote so each Senator may be on the record with their views.\n  Mr. WYDEN. When the Senator--who was good enough to yield me time--\nhas completed with Senator Sessions and colleagues to whom he may wish \nto yield, I will then propound that unanimous consent request.\n  I don't anticipate any objection. Colleagues will know that we would \nthen have a vote shortly after 2 p.m.\n  I thank Senator Cruz.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would just say this. We need to get in our heads in \nthis body that just because you raise revenue and pay for a new \nspending program, that doesn't have implications for the Federal \nTreasury and the budget. In fact, we have rules that guard against it.\n  I thank Senator Cruz for raising and highlighting that. We need to \nconsider it. Because the idea that you can just do that is dangerous \nand it creates more taxing and more spending, more revenue and more \nspending.\n  The Senator from Texas raised the point, just because you raised \nrevenue doesn't mean the people who raise the revenue get to spend it \non what they want. He is perfectly correct to say I think it should be \nused for deficit reduction. I thank the Senator for raising the issue.\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Alabama, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the fine work done by all \nof our colleagues.\n  I wish to support this bipartisan helium bill, S. 783. This is a bill \nwhich is critical to maintaining a stable supply of helium now and into \nthe future. This bill accomplishes that.\n  As a physician, I know how important it is that helium is available \nfor the newest technologies, specifically for use to cool MRI scanners \nand manufacture products such as semiconductors and fiber optic cables.\n  Helium also has important applications for the Department of Defense, \nfor NASA, and the scientific research community. This bill extends the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Interior to sell helium from the \nFederal Helium Reserve in Texas, including important reforms such as \nprovisions already outlined by the chairman of the Energy Committee: \nThe Secretary sells helium at market prices and the Federal Government \ngets out of the helium business once and for all. This, to me, is one \nof the key components of this legislation.\n  In June, the Energy Committee, on which I serve, voted to report the \nhelium bill by voice vote--22 members of the committee. There were no \nobjections stated. This was bipartisan.\n  The House has already passed its own helium bill, which is different \nthan this. I think the Senate should pass its helium bill as soon as \npossible today so we can have an opportunity to negotiate with the \nHouse, get something passed, and then to the President for signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased we are at this point. We \nwill be able to move forward with this important legislation relating \nto our Nation's Helium Program. I would certainly encourage my \ncolleagues to support passage of this bill that we have spent several \nyears now developing in the energy committee to reform it.\n  The bill, as has been mentioned by my colleagues, is a bipartisan \nbill. It was an important piece of legislation that was reported to the \nSenate floor in June by a voice vote. It is yet again another good \nproduct coming out of the energy committee.\n  We need to move to pass this bill but also to reconcile the remaining \nissues we have with the House and we have to do this before October 1. \nOctober 1 is coming at us like a freight train on a lot of different \nissues. But if we want to prevent a shortage of helium gas in this \ncountry, we are going to need to do it and do it now.\n  Again, the chairman referenced some jokes about helium. \nUnfortunately, a lot of folks associate helium with helium balloons, \nparty balloons, and not the things we are talking about. It is such an \nessential component to everything from medical imaging equipment, \nsemiconductor manufacturing, rocket engines, and precision welding. I \nthink folks would be amazed at how helium plays such a significant part \nin our high-tech world and our manufacturing world.\n  We have to act. What we need to do is prevent a massive disruption in \nthe supply chains for all of these important economic sectors. We need \nto pass this bill.\n  As has been mentioned, what we are doing is we are reforming and \nreauthorizing the Federal Helium Program. This program provides 40 \npercent of our domestic and 30 percent of our global helium supplies \nfrom the Cliffside field near Amarillo, TX.\n  The energy committee, as I noted, developed this bill before us. What \nwe focused on was bringing market-based price discovery to the sale of \nthis taxpayer-owned resource.\n  The approach we have taken in committee will ensure a better return \nto the taxpayer, which is what we are all looking for. It prevents a \nsmall number of corporations from effectively being able to pocket \nvalue that which belongs to the American public. It will also improve \nthe management of the Helium Program to account for diminishing \nproduction and provide greater transparency for a program that clearly \nneeds it.\n  So there are a lot of good reasons why we need to do this \nlegislation. And as the chairman has mentioned, we are getting \ngovernment out of the program. That ought to be something certainly all \nof us on this side of the aisle would agree on--getting the government \nout of the business altogether.\n  This bill completes a privatization process Congress set in motion \nback in 1996. It sets a hard-and-fast deadline for getting the Federal \nGovernment out of the helium business once and for all.\n  As has been mentioned, we do have a bill on the other side, in the \nother body, that doesn't take it all the way; it doesn't fully get the \ngovernment out of the business. In our legislation, not later than \n2022, all of the assets that are associated with the helium reserve \nwill be sold off and the Federal Government's involvement in what \nshould be a private market will end.\n  Of all the options before us for preventing an imminent helium \nshortage, this Senate bill is the only one that also addresses the \nlong-term goal of exiting the sector and leaving the development of \nfuture supplies to private industry. As has been mentioned, when we do \nthis--when we get out of the business, when we conduct these auction \nsales--we will generate revenue of approximately $500 million. That is \nboth a good and important thing around here. So what the energy \ncommittee did, in a very bipartisan and very open process within our \ncommittee, we chose to devote some of this revenue to other programs \nwithin our committee's jurisdiction--not creating new programs but \nbasically providing funding for obligations that have already been \nmade.\n  One way or another, we are going to be providing for these payments--\nwhether it is to the abandoned mine land fund, to the Secure Rural \nSchools Program, adjusting the royalty rates for the soda ash \noperators, or addressing the National Park Service backlog or the mess \nleft by the Federal Government when it comes to drilling exploratory \nwells and then abandoning them. So what we have done is we have looked \ncritically at these areas where we have had funding shortfalls within \nthe energy committee's jurisdiction, and a portion of these revenues \nhas been dedicated to that. But we also heard from our colleagues--\nmembers on the committee and others--who said we need to make an effort \nto take some of these revenues and direct them to deficit reduction. So \nwe have reduced the Federal debt by at least $56 million. This was a \npriority of Senator Flake and Senator Risch on the committee, and we \nhave directed that.\n  Again, all of these are priorities among programs within the \njurisdiction of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and given \nthe $56 million that is devoted to deficit reduction, the resources we \nhave devoted to addressing them are more than offset. I think our \nsuccess in striking this balance has been confirmed by both the \nCongressional Budget Office and the bipartisan staff of our Senate \nBudget Committee.\n  We have an opportunity before us today, and I think we have a \nresponsibility to act now, as this October 1 deadline is looming. First \nand foremost, we have to act to prevent a massive disruption to the \nhelium supply chain that could harm so many sectors of our economy. \nThis bill prevents that from happening. We also need to finish what the \nCongress started back in 1996 and fully and finally privatize the \nhelium business so that the Federal Government can get out of the \nindustry. And we should address these other priorities--including \ndeficit reduction and other obligations the Federal Government has \nalready taken on--by making responsible, thoughtful decisions about the \nuse of the revenues associated with the reauthorization and the \neventual closure of the Federal Helium Reserve.\n  For these reasons I would certainly encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the bill when we go to a vote in just about an hour and a half.\n  With that, I yield for my friend and colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Alaska for an \nexcellent statement. It very much reflects our desire to make this \nbipartisan.\n  I particularly appreciate her noting the contributions of two of the \nmembers of our committee, Senators Risch\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\nand Flake, who also made the point that, yes, we are getting the \ngovernment out of the helium business; yes, we are making sure we are \nnot putting at risk millions of high-skilled, high-wage jobs; but we \nhave to be serious, as my friend from Alabama likes to say, about this \nbudget deficit. And so I will be. He and I have talked often about \nMedicare and other areas. We will be serious about that deficit \nreduction, as Senator Murkowski has talked about. And particularly in \nlight of the comments of Senator Risch and Senator Flake, we were able \nto meet the needs of people, working families across this country who \ndepend on these high-skilled, high-wage jobs. So we are meeting those \nneeds, and we are contributing to deficit reduction. So I thought the \nSenator's points were well taken.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 527\n\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \ntoday, the energy committee be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 527 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; that a Wyden \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that there be \n15 minutes of debate equally divided between Senators Wyden and Cruz or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill, as amended; that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with all of the above \noccurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, let me say to the Senators who have \nworked on ending the Federal Government's involvement in this program \nthat this is a great accomplishment, and I thank them for that. I do \nthink there is technically not a budget point of order for the process \nthey have used in funding this bill, although I think Senator Cruz is \nraising a valid concern. I guess if we could do $50 million on deficit \nreduction, we could do more. But I did want to say that I am proud of \nthe thrust of the legislation. I think it is good legislation. I thank \nthem for it. And it does not, I am informed, violate the Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, I have directed my staff on the Budget Committee to \nconduct a detailed analysis of the economic conditions facing working \nAmericans--their wages, their employment conditions, and their \nhousehold finances. I will give a series of talks over the coming weeks \nlooking at that financial situation and the state of our Nation as a \nwhole economically. I will also attempt to look at the causes leading \nto our current financial difficulties and suggest some steps to restore \nAmerica's financial future.\n  This topic is very important. The sad fact is that the state of \nmiddle and lower-income Americans is worsening on virtually every \nfront. The slow growth of the economy (and this has been the slowest \nrecovery from a recession since World War II or the Great Depression) \nis restraining the normal upward movement of income that previous \ngenerations have experienced. It has accelerated in the last several \nyears, but it has been going on--we have to be honest with ourselves--\nfor a much longer period of time. If you don't have a job now, you are \ntwice as likely to only find a part-time job as full-time work, if you \ncan find one at all.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, middle-class incomes have \ndeclined for 18 years. That has happened with different parties, \ndifferent Presidents, and different majorities in the House and Senate. \nThat decline means that savings for college and retirement are growing \nat alltime lows. Young people are not marrying as early as they want, \nsometimes due to bad economic prospects. That means families are \nlaunching later in life, which gives couples less years to pay down a \nmortgage or raise children.\n  Perhaps the greatest single source of our economic anxiety, however, \nis the fear of losing a job or that our children won't be able to get a \njob or our grandchildren won't be able to get a good job.\n  It is not just the unemployment rates that remain too high--at 7.3 \npercent as of August 2013--it is the number of people we all know who \nare working well below their potential because nothing is available \nthat uses their job skills. It is the number of people we know who have \ngiven up looking for work or who are working part time because nothing \nfull time is available to them.\n  Fewer people are working today than in 2007. Almost 4 million fewer \npeople are working today than in 2007, but during that time our \npopulation has increased and the number of workers of working age has \nincreased. Just before the recession hit in December 2007, about 62.7 \npercent of the working-age population was working--62.7. If that same \npercentage was working today, we would have 154 million jobs. But we \ndon't have 154 million, we have 144 million. And only 58.6 percent of \nthe population is working, which is a marked decline. In short, we are \nmissing 9.9 million jobs when we compare this economy to the one in \n2007.\n  Here is another way to look at the job problem. In 2007 we had \n363,000 discouraged workers--people who had given up looking for work \nbecause they couldn't find a job but still had not disappeared from the \nrolls of employment security offices. Today we have 866,000. That is an \nincrease of 140 percent in discouraged workers.\n  Here is another barometer of the middle-class difficulties. We have \n1,988,000 fewer full-time jobs today than in December 2007; however, we \nhave 3,627,000 more part-time jobs. How we calculate this is important. \nPeople with part-time jobs, according to the jobs people at the \nDepartment of Labor, are not counted as unemployed, they are counted as \nemployed, although they may want a full-time job, and most do. So our \neconomy is producing part-time jobs rather than full-time jobs. That \nhas been going on for a long time, and it is not acceptable. These jobs \noften have no health care program or retirement plan.\n  A very high percentage of all jobs created this year are not full-\ntime jobs, and workforce participation--the percentage of people who \nare actually working today--is the lowest since 1975. That is not \nacceptable. And these trends have been going on for some time.\n  Let's take a look at median family income. The Census Bureau \npublished new estimates of household income on Tuesday, August 17. They \nreport that the median income of American households is lower than last \nyear, lower than the year before, and, in fact, is lower than at any \ntime since 1995, adjusted for inflation.\n  This is a very serious trend. While we have done a lot of things to \nmake this economy better, few benefits are going to main-line, hard-\nworking American people. They are struggling out there. You have to go \nback to 1995 to find median household income that is lower than today's \nhousehold income.\n  Even if we take broad measures of income, we get similar results. If \nwe divide all of the income by the population to come up with a per-\ncapita income concept, per-person income is lower today than at any \ntime since 1997. This is an unacceptable trend. It is clear it is not a \nshort-term phenomenon. It is now a negative trend for almost 18 years, \nand it cannot continue.\n  While the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have \nremained strong, that should not and cannot be used to obscure these \ntrends, trends that have accelerated after we emerged from the \nrecession of 2008 and 2009.\n  Many are concerned that the Federal Reserve is furthering the \nNation's economic problems with a growing wealth gap. Their \nquantitative easing has boosted the wealth of the investor class but \nhas not benefited the working class. This is not the way our policies \nshould work. People who know what to do with low-interest money seem to \nbe coming out ahead. But the people who don't have money, don't have \njobs, who are working part time instead of full time, are slipping.\n  Our civil society, the great foundation of the our economy, today has \ncertain weaknesses that we have to talk about. I will address more in a \nseparate speech, but let me give a few thoughts.\n  Few social institutions are more important in helping us through \ndifficult economic times than marriage. However, marriage is \ndisappearing in the\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\nbottom 50 percent of the income distribution. Many people stay too long \nin low-income unemployment situations, and it is not healthy. And too \noften, the fathers are not in those households. If you are in the \nbottom 50 percent of the income distribution and give birth, there is a \ngreater than 50-percent chance that the father will not be living with \nyou when the child comes home from the hospital. Perhaps, as many \nsuggest, our welfare policies are exacerbating these trends. We need to \nlook at that.\n  Also worrying is the decline of charitable giving since 2007. Like \nthe overall economy, this vital part of our social and economic system \nhas not recovered effectively. Total charitable giving fell in 2008 to \n$303 billion from $326 billion. As of the end of 2012, total giving was \nonly $316 billion--still 3 percent below what it was 6 years ago.\n  I would conclude and note that the road we are on is leading to the \ncontinued erosion of the middle-class civil society, the quality of \nlife for hard-working Americans is not improving financially, and the \ncontinued expansion of the welfare state and the permanent entrenchment \nof a political class that profits from the growth of government. It is \ntime we recognize both the disastrous conditions facing working \nAmericans and the moral obligation we have to replace dependency on \ngovernment with the freedom and dignity that comes from work and \nindependence. That has got to be our goal.\n  There are things that can be done to improve these conditions. It is \ntime for us to defend working Americans and their undeniably legitimate \nconcerns about current trends. I will talk about that as we go forward. \nIt is something we need to seriously consider.\n  Relevant here is this question, can we bring into our country more \npeople than we have jobs for? Won't that pull down wages and make it \nharder for people to get work? And this question, shouldn't we defend \nmore effectively our workers against unfair trade and competition from \naround the world? Both of those policies are ones I hope we could have \nbipartisan support on, although I am worried. The Senate's immigration \nbill would increase permanent immigration by 50 percent, would increase \nguest workers--people who come and take jobs--by double, all in \naddition to the 11 million who would be given legal status here.\n  I do think our colleagues are correct to say we should do more about \ntrade and have fair competition on the world stage for our workers. I \nthink we have got to convert more of this welfare spending, the 80-\nsome-odd programs that are fundamentally geared to lower income \nAmericans, that spend $750 billion a year--which is larger than Social \nSecurity, larger than defense, and larger than Medicare--we need to \nconvert some of that to better use.\n  For example, for every $100 spent on these programs, only $1 goes to \njob training. Shouldn't we focus more on getting our unemployed, our \npeople who need more training, trained, ready to move into the \nworkforce, to take jobs? Can we afford to bring in millions of people \nto take jobs and to leave our people on welfare and the unemployment \nrolls?\n  Those are some of the fundamental questions we as Americans need to \nbe asking. But first and foremost, colleagues, we are not able to deny \nthe unassailable fact that we have had a slide in the financial well-\nbeing of millions of Americans, and that this has been going on for \nwell over a decade.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue we \ndon't talk about here, and I am joined by my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Florida, Senator Nelson.\n  We appear on the floor today to talk about an issue which I would \nargue is a clear and present danger to young Americans. What is that? \nWe could probably make a long list of things we are concerned about as \nit relates to young people, but we are here today to talk about \nbullying and harassment.\n  According to the Department of Education, nearly one in three \nstudents ages 12 to 18 is affected by bullying and harassment. Another \nstudy estimates that 60,000 students in the United States of America do \nnot attend school each day because they fear being bullied.\n  With the advent of text messaging and social media, many children \nfind they cannot escape the harassment when they go home at night. It \nfollows them from the moment they wake until the moment they go to \nsleep. This problem was brought once again into the national \nconsciousness in the last couple of days.\n  I am reading a headline from the Tampa Bay Times, dated September 12, \n2013: ``Lakeland Girl Commits Suicide After Being Bullied Online.''\n  Senator Nelson will be talking about that, as will I.\n  Here is the other headline from the Washington Post about the same \nincident: ``Police: Florida Girl Who Committed Suicide Had Been Bullied \nfor Months by as Many as 15 Girls.''\n  I am the father of four daughters and I remember times when my \ndaughters were going through high school. We have one in high school, \none in college, and two out of college. I remember when our daughter \nwas going through high school and instant messaging was one way to \ncommunicate, kind of a back and forth between some of the girls in her \nhigh school class. She was about 15 or 16 at the time. It never rose to \nthe level of any kind of serious harassment. It was something that a \nlot of families I am sure have experienced. But my wife and I were \nblessed that our daughters never were exposed to what this young girl \nwas exposed to. I won't show her picture, but I am looking at a picture \nof her right now. Her name is Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12 years old, of \nLakewood, FL, a beautiful girl subjected to the most horrific kind of \nharassment and abuse. It is almost unimaginable that a group of human \nbeings could do this to another person. Unfortunately, it happens all \ntoo often.\n  Because my colleague from Florida knows the case and the news \narticles better than I, I ask him to highlight this. But I think we all \nhave the same reaction, one of horror, and we are summoned by our \nconscience to do something about this. We can't just say, as some say, \nWell, every generation has faced some kind of harassment, some kind of \nbullying, so it is part of growing up. I have heard this argument. The \nargument is without validity, because no generation prior to this \ngeneration has had the technological burden. When I was growing up and \nsomeone was bullied at school, that was bad enough, but it ended when \nthe schoolday ended. But today that is not possible if you have \ndetermined and vicious people who want to bully another student, \nbecause technology allows that person to be bullied when they leave \nschool, all throughout the night, and then throughout the next day and \nday after day.\n  I turn with respect to my colleague to talk a little bit more about \nthis particular case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, many States such as mine, Florida, have \nstrict bullying policies in place. But we need to go beyond that, and \nFederal legislation is needed because, as the Secretary of Education \nhas said, these laws in the States ``lack consistency and enforcement \nmechanisms'' across the country.\n  So you get to the tragic case in Florida of Rebecca Ann Sedwick. It \nis a tragic reminder that bullying in the social media is increasing in \nboth method and mercilessness.\n  Here is a girl with a single mom. She gets subjected to this bullying \nin class, so her mom takes her out of the school and puts her into \nanother school. This is a 12-year-old little girl. She then is bullied \nonline.\n  This occurs for 2 years. This is what she gets: Why are you alive? \nYou should die. You are ugly. Can you die, please? She gets a constant \ndose of this not only at school, but then in the social media. Her mom \ntried to take\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\naway the cell phone that would have these applications. But when she \ngets her phone back, she gets a new application, and this cyber \nbullying keeps coming through.\n  We have before us legislation that would get educators and parents \nmore involved in trying to prevent this kind of bullying. \nUnfortunately, Congress is crippled by gridlock and for the last 6 \nyears has been unable to pass any major education bill that contains \nthis anti-cyber-bullying language. That is why I suggest my colleagues \nconsider this provision on its own--separate from the broader bill--to \nexpedite our response to what has become an increasing problem. The \nmeasure would require elementary and secondary schools to better \naddress bullying and harassment. This calls on schools to report \nincidents of bullying to parents and others so we can try to prevent \nsuch conduct in theture.\n  I have asked the leadership, the leadership of the committee, as has \nmy colleague, that they consider expediting this passage because of the \nnational attention to this tragic incident in Florida. I can tell you, \nit is all over Florida.\n  I want to thank Senator Casey for his sponsorship and continuing \nleadership on this issue over the last two Congresses, along with \nSenator Kirk. He and Senator Kirk have introduced the Safe Schools \nImprovement Act, which is included in the broader reauthorization of No \nChild Left Behind legislation--if we could then focus on this specific \nissue, if the broader bill is not going to pass, and get this out in \nthe midst of this enormous personal tragedy.\n\n  I cannot understand. For 2 years this has happened to a young child. \nHer mom is doing everything possible, even pulling her out of one \nschool and putting her in another. Yet it continues and it drives this \nyoung lady to go into an abandoned cement plant and take her life \nbecause she doesn't think her life is worth living as a result of all \nof these taunts.\n  I thank Senator Casey for his leadership. Let's see if we can move \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Nelson for his leadership \nand for bringing this horrific example to the attention of the Senate, \nat least on the floor, even though many had seen the news coverage. I \nthank him for his leadership in trying to focus on this, even if a \nlarger education bill does not pass.\n  I will conclude by saying anyone who doubts this is a problem should \nread one or more of these articles about this case, but I am sure we \ncould cite many others. I will make part of the Record both of these \narticles I referred to, the Tampa Bay Times of September 12 article and \nthe Washington Post story of the next day, September 13, that I \nreferred to.\n  I want to read two lines from both stories. From the Tampa Bay story, \nthe sheriff of Polk County, FL, Sheriff Brady Judd, says about Rebecca \nAnn Sedwick, she was ``absolutely terrorized on social media.'' That is \nthe sheriff, a law enforcement official who made a determination about \nwhat happened to this girl.\n  Then in the Washington Post story--this is actually the Washington \nPost but it is the Associated Press; I should correct that--but right \nin the middle of the story by the Associated Press:\n\n       The case has illustrated once more the way that youngsters \n     are using the Internet to torment others.\n\n  In one they refer to being ``terrorized,'' in the other they refer to \nsomeone being ``tormented.''\n  This is a big problem. The legislation I have introduced may not have \nprevented this, but for sure we need legislation where schools at a \nminimum are required to have a code of conduct which includes bullying \nand harassment.\n  By the way, they do not need to wait for a bill to be passed. There \nis no excuse for a school in the United States of America not to have a \ncode of conduct that specifically prohibits bullying right now. Any \nschool district that does not have that in place should be ashamed of \nthemselves and they should get to work and get that done. They don't \nneed to wait for a bill from Washington.\n  That is No. 1, prohibit the conduct very specifically. No. 2, the \nStates need to collect information and make that information available \nand report this information to the Department of Education. But one of \nthe most important features of this, to get it right, is you have to \nspecifically prohibit bullying that is done by way of electronic \ncommunication.\n  Whether or not this bill is passed in the near term, there are things \nschools can do right now. They have no excuse to wait for a bill. That \nis the school's responsibility, and the community's, and the school \ndistrict's.\n  What about other areas of responsibility? Parents have a \nresponsibility. So parents either of the tormenters, the perpetrators \nof this crime, but even parents who do not have children involved on \neither end--every parent has a responsibility. I know people do not \nlike to hear that. They do not like public officials telling parents \nwhat they should do. Frankly, I am not too concerned about that today. \nEvery parent has a responsibility to tell their children not to engage \nin this kind of conduct. If they do not do that, they are not doing \ntheir job. If their child is involved in this kind of bullying, they \nneed to figure out a way to stop their children from doing that. If \nthey do not do that, they are not doing their job. Parents who hear \nabout another child who is being bullied have a responsibility to tell \nsomeone, and the students have a responsibility as well.\n  We are all responsible here. We cannot say it is just the school \ndistrict's problem or just the Federal Government's problem or just the \nState's problem or just the parents' problem. We are all responsible \nwhen this happens and we all have a responsibility to do something \nabout it because this is unacceptable. This is a crime we should never \never tolerate.\n  Unfortunately, we keep reading the stories, we keep hearing about \nthis, and some people are willing to walk away. We need to do more than \njust talk about legislation. I have a very good bill. I thank Senator \nKirk for making it a bipartisan priority. But we have to do more than \njust talk about legislation and pass bills. That is important, but we \nneed to take ownership of this issue as parents, as citizens, and as \nAmericans. We all have a responsibility.\n  May it be said years from now, decades from now, that because of \nhorrific and disturbing stories such as the story from Florida where \nRebecca Ann Sedwick was pushed and tormented to the point where, \naccording to the news article, she committed suicide--let it be said of \nus that we took the right steps to substantially reduce the likelihood \nthat this kind of story ever plays out again.\n  I ask unanimous consent the articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 13, 2013]\n\nPolice: Florida Girl who Committed Suicide had Been Bullied for Months \n                         by as Many as 15 Girls\n\n                         (By Associated Press)\n\n       Tampa, FL.--For nearly a year, as many as 15 girls ganged \n     up on 12-year-old Rebecca Ann Sedwick and picked on her, \n     authorities say, bombarding her with online messages such as \n     ``You should die'' and ``Why don't you go kill yourself.''\n       Rebecca couldn't take it anymore.\n       She changed one of her online screen names to ``That Dead \n     Girl.'' She messaged a boy in North Carolina: ``I'm \n     jumping.'' And then, on Monday, the Lakeland girl went to an \n     abandoned concrete plant, climbed a tower and hurled herself \n     to her death.\n       Authorities have seized computers and cellphones from some \n     of the girls as they decide whether to bring charges in what \n     appeared to be the nation's latest deadly cyberbullying case.\n       The bullying started over a ``boyfriend issue'' last year \n     at Crystal Lake Middle School, Sheriff Grady Judd said. But \n     he gave no details. Police said Rebecca was suspended at one \n     point for fighting with a girl who used to be her friend.\n       Rebecca had been ``absolutely terrorized'' by the other \n     girls, Judd said. He said detectives found some of her \n     diaries at her home, and she talked of how depressed she was \n     about the situation.\n       ``Her writings would break your heart,'' he said.\n       The case has illustrated, once more, the ways in which \n     youngsters are using the Internet to torment others.\n       ``There is a lot of digital drama. Middle-school kids are \n     horrible to each other, especially girls,'' said Perry Aftab, \n     a New Jersey-based lawyer and expert on cyberbullying.\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\n       Last December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days \n     after cutting her wrists because of what she said was \n     bullying, according to the sheriff. Later, after Rebecca \n     complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that \n     another girl wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began \n     home-schooling her in Lakeland, a city of about 100,000 \n     midway between Tampa and Orlando, Judd said.\n       This fall, Rebecca started at a new school, Lawton Chiles \n     Middle Academy, and loved it, Judd said. But the bullying \n     continued online.\n       ``She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,'' \n     Rebecca's mother, Tricia Norman, told the Lakeland Ledger. \n     ``I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she \n     was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea \n     why.''\n       After Rebecca's suicide, police looked at her computer and \n     found search queries such as ``what is overweight for a 13-\n     year-old girl,'' ``how to get blades out of razors,'' and \n     ``how many over-the-counter drugs do you take to die.'' One \n     of her screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting \n     on a railroad track.\n       Police said that she had met the North Carolina boy at an \n     airport and that they had remained friends online. The 12-\n     year-old boy didn't tell anyone about the ``I'm jumping, I \n     can't take it anymore'' message he received from her on \n     Monday morning, shortly before her suicide, authorities said.\n       Detectives said the other girls' parents have been \n     cooperative.\n       Florida has a bullying law, but it leaves punishment to \n     schools, not police. Legal experts said it is difficult to \n     bring charges against someone accused of driving a person to \n     suicide.\n       ``We've had so many suicides that are related to digital \n     harassment. But we also have free-speech laws in this \n     country,'' Aftab said.\n       In a review of news articles, The Associated Press found \n     about a dozen suicides in the U.S. since October 2010 that \n     were attributed at least in part to cyberbullying. Aftab said \n     she believes the real number is at least twice that.\n       In 2006, 13-year-old Megan Meier hanged herself in Missouri \n     after she was dumped online by a fictitious teenage boy \n     created in part by an adult neighbor, Lori Drew, authorities \n     said. A jury found Drew guilty of three federal misdemeanors, \n     but a judge threw out the verdicts and acquitted her.\n       Florida's law, the Jeffrey Johnston Stand Up for All \n     Students Act, was named after a teenager who killed himself \n     after being harassed by classmates. The law was amended July \n     1 to cover cyberbullying.\n       David Tirella, a Florida attorney who lobbied for the law \n     and has handled dozens of cyberbullying cases, said law \n     enforcement can also seek more traditional charges.\n       ``The truth is, even without these school bullying laws, \n     there's battery, there's stalking,'' he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Tampa Bay Times, Sept. 12, 2013]\n\n        Lakeland Girl Commits Suicide After Being Bullied Online\n\n                              (The Ledger)\n\n       Lakeland.--Investigators have identified at least 15 girls \n     who were involved in the social media circle of a 12-year-old \n     Lakeland girl who took her own life after more than a year of \n     constant bullying.\n       At a news conference Thursday, Polk County Sheriff Grady \n     Judd said it appears Rebecca Ann Sedwick jumped to her death \n     at an old cement business after being beat down with hate \n     messages online. Her body was found Tuesday.\n       During their investigation, detectives found multiple \n     social media applications where Sedwick was cyberbullied with \n     messages, including ``Go kill yourself,'' and ``Why are you \n     still alive?''\n       Sedwick was ``absolutely terrorized on social media,'' Judd \n     said.\n       The Sheriff's Office is investigating the cyberbullying, \n     Judd said.\n       Judd said parents of all 15 girls have cooperated with \n     detectives and several cellphones and laptops have been \n     confiscated.\n       Before her death, Sedwick had searched questions online \n     related to suicide, including ``How many over-the-counter \n     drugs do you take to die?'' and ``How many Advil do you have \n     to take to die?''\n       The night before her death, Sedwick gave several warning \n     signs about her planned suicide that were never reported for \n     help.\n       Judd said a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina, whom Sedwick \n     met through social media, knew of her plan. Sedwick messaged \n     him only hours before her death saying she was dead and ``I'm \n     jumping, I can't take it anymore.''\n       Sedwick also changed her name early Tuesday morning on the \n     free messaging application, Kik Messenger, to ``That Dead \n     Girl.''\n       Judd said detectives are trying to investigate the social \n     media applications that Sedwick used, including Kik and \n     Ask.fm, but many of the websites are based in other \n     countries.\n       Florida has an antibullying law that covers cyberbullying. \n     As the investigation continues, Judd said charges, including \n     cyberstalking, could be filed.\n       He said it appears that the bullying started sometime in \n     2012 and was physical at her former school, Crystal Lake \n     Middle School, and then moved completely online.\n       ``We're trying to sort out a bunch of girl talk that goes \n     further than girl talk,'' he said.\n       The investigation is still in its early stages, but Judd \n     said there were warning signs that nobody noticed. If \n     detectives can find evidence, the girls could be charged with \n     felony cyberstalking because Sedwick was under 16 years old.\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, there is a lot of concern all over this \ncountry about what is going on in Washington in terms of the \npossibility that the United States, for the first time in its history, \nmay not pay its debts and what that means to the American economy, what \nit means to the world economy, and what it means to the international \nfinancial system. There is a great deal of concern about the \npossibility that on October 1, the U.S. Government may shut down \nbecause we have some rightwing extremists in the House who want to, \namong other things, abolish legislation passed 4 years ago--the \nAffordable Care Act--and throw something else in there.\n  Before I get to those issues, I wish to speak about the reality of \nwhat is going on in the economy today. What I want to do is something \nthat is not done often enough, and that is to ask where some of our \nrightwing colleagues are really coming from. What are their goals?\n  Fine, they want to shut down the government on October 1. OK, so they \ndon't want to, for the first time in the history of America, pay our \nbills. But what else do they want? What is this rightwing ideology \nwhich has taken over the House? That is an issue that we do not talk \nabout as much as we should.\n  I wish to begin my discussion by looking at the reality of what is \ngoing on in the American economy and why people are so angry and \nfrustrated that the government is not responding to their needs--and \nthey have every reason to be angry.\n  The Census Bureau reported the other day a rather extraordinary fact, \na very depressing fact; that is, in terms of median family income--what \nthe typical American family right in the middle of our economy is \nexperiencing--that family made less money last year than it did 24 \nyears ago. Twenty-four years have come and gone, people have worked so \nhard, and after 24 years they are now earning less money as a family \nthan they did back in 1989.\n  Further, what the Census Bureau told us is the typical middle-class \nfamily has seen its income go down by more than $5,000 since 1999, \nafter adjusting for inflation. So if people are angry in New Mexico and \nif they are angry in California, that is why. They are working hard and \ntheir income is going down.\n  The average male worker made $283 less last year than he did 44 years \nago. How is that for progress? Less money last year, male worker, than \n44 years ago. The average female worker earned $1,700 less last year \nthan she did in 2007--going down. A record-breaking 46.5 million \nAmericans are now living in poverty. We have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world, at almost 22 percent. A \nhigher percentage of American kids live in poverty now than was the \ncase in 1965. In other words, we are moving but we are moving in the \nwrong direction.\n  Meanwhile, the people on top, the wealthiest people in this country, \nare doing phenomenally well. That is the major point that has to be \nmade over and over. This is not an earthquake or a tsunami that has hit \neverybody, we are all in this together and everybody is struggling. Not \nthe case. The wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well.\n  Last week we learned that 95 percent of the new income generated in \nthis country from 2009 to 2012 went to the top 1 percent. That is a \nphenomenal statistic. All of the new income generated--95 percent of \nit--went to the wealthiest 1 percent. Earlier this week\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\nForbes Magazine reported that the wealthiest 400 Americans in this \ncountry are now worth a record-breaking $2 trillion. My colleagues can \ndo the arithmetic. That is an extraordinary concentration of wealth in \nthis country that we have not seen since before the Great Depression.\n  The richest 400 Americans now own more wealth than the bottom half of \nAmerica--over 150 million Americans. One family--and this is not what I \nlearned in the history books when I was growing up about what America \nwas supposed to be like--but one family, the Walton family, owner of \nWalmart, owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American \npeople. Corporate profits are at an all-time high while wages as a \nshare of the economy are at a record low.\n  Wall Street, whose greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior caused \nthis massive economic downturn--their CEOs, their executives, are doing \nphenomenally well. In fact, CEOs on Wall Street are on track to make \nmore money this year than they did in 2009. Believe me, they have \nrecovered, they are doing great, while the middle class of this country \nis disappearing.\n  That is an overview of the reality facing our country: The middle \nclass is disappearing, poverty is at an all-time high, and the people \non top are doing phenomenally well.\n  Now I wish to go from that reality to speak about what rightwing \nextremism is really about, and it is much more than shutting down the \ngovernment; it is much more than not paying the debts we owe and \ncausing a major financial crisis.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues--and I think they already know--that \nif we delve into what some of our colleagues here in the Senate but \nmostly in the House believe, we will find what they believe is--forget \nthe Affordable Care Act which they want to repeal; that is nickels and \ndimes--what they are really all about is repealing every significant \npiece of legislation passed in the last 80 years which protects the \nneeds of the middle class, working families, the elderly, the kids, and \nlower income people. You name the piece of legislation, they either \nwant to repeal it entirely or they want to make massive cuts in those \nprograms.\n  Let me name what those programs are. Social Security. Some of them \nbelieve Social Security is unconstitutional. It is not just that they \nwant to cut Social Security; they don't believe in the concept of \nSocial Security.\n\n  The same thing with health care on the part of the Federal \nGovernment; Medicare, Medicaid. Why should the Federal Government be \ninvolved in those programs? That is not the role of the Federal \nGovernment. Let's abolish Medicare, abolish Medicaid. If a person is 70 \nyears of age and they don't have a lot of money and no health \ninsurance, which Medicare provides, what happens to them? My colleagues \ncan tell me. What happens if you are 70 and you are diagnosed with \ncancer and you don't have health insurance? Everybody knows the end of \nthe story. You die. Well, that is the way life goes because we are all \nin it for ourselves. We don't believe the government should provide \nhealth insurance to all people.\n  If I am a multimillionaire and I get sick, my kids get sick, I have \nthe best health care in the world. But if I am a struggling, middle-\nclass person, working-class person, lower income person, hey, the \ngovernment should not be involved in those areas.\n  Minimum wage. Many of us believe, and the overwhelming majority of \nthe American people believe, that the minimum wage today, at about \n$7.25 an hour, the Federal minimum wage, is too low. I wish to applaud \nthe Governor and the legislature in California for raising their \nminimum wage to $10. But right now we are at about $7.25 for the \nFederal Government. Do people know what most of our colleagues here \nbelieve? It is not just that they are opposed to raising the minimum \nwage; they want to abolish the concept of the minimum wage. That is the \nfact. The American people don't know that.\n  What does that mean? It means if a person is living in a high \nunemployment area where a lot of people are struggling for a few jobs \nand an employer says, The best I can pay is $3.50 an hour--that is what \nI can pay--I have to take that. People think I am kidding. I am not \nkidding. A majority of the Republicans, to the best of my knowledge, \nnow believe in abolishing the concept of the minimum wage.\n  Environmental protection. We have made some real progress in recent \nyears--not enough, but we have made some progress. When we go to New \nYork City, California, Los Angeles, the air is cleaner. We have cleaned \nup a lot of rivers. We have told companies they can't put their crap \nand their toxins into rivers and waterways; they can't put it up in the \nair so the kids breathe it. We have made some progress on that. Some of \nour Republican friends say, It is not that we are just opposed to this \nor that piece of legislation, let's abolish the EPA. Let's abolish the \nability of the American people to protect their health.\n  Let me quote something, and I can quote a lot of sources. I can quote \nmany of the statements made by some of our colleagues, but I want to go \nto the platform of the 2012 Texas Republican Party. Why do I want to go \nthere? Because, in fact, Texas is a large State. The Republican Party \nin Texas is very powerful. But, also, the ideas that come from Texas, \nto be fair to the State of Texas, end up spreading all over this \ncountry, especially in Republican circles.\n  I wish to read some of the proposals in the 2012 Texas Republican \nParty platform. Texas, one of our largest States, controlled by \nRepublicans right now: ``We support an immediate and orderly transition \nto a system of private pensions based on the concept of individual \nretirement accounts and gradually phasing out the Social Security \ntax.''\n  In English, what that means is they believe in the privatization of \nSocial Security, and people, if they have the money, can invest on Wall \nStreet and do what they want. That is the Texas Republican Party \nplatform.\n  What else do they say? I want veterans--and I speak as chairman of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee--to listen to this one: ``We support \nthe privatization of veterans health care.'' In other words, they would \nabolish the Veterans' Administration. We have some 6 million veterans \ntoday getting pretty good health care at the VA. Yet at the mainstream \nof rightwing extremism in this country is the Texas Republican Party \nthat believes we should abolish the VA health care system.\n  Furthermore, what they are saying is: ``We support abolishing all \nfederal agencies whose activities are not specifically enumerated in \nthe Constitution; including the Department of Education and the \nDepartment of Energy.''\n  Goodbye, Department of Education, goodbye, Federal aid to education, \ntitle I, and many other important programs that are supporting public \neducation in America: Goodbye.\n  ``We . . . oppose . . . mandatory kindergarten.'' Right now it is \nwidely regarded that the United States has the worst early childhood \neducation system of any major country on Earth. People can't find \naffordable early childhood education. Their proposal is to abolish \nmandatory kindergarten.\n  I spoke about this earlier: ``We believe the Environmental Protection \nAgency should be abolished.'' No problem. If a company wants to put \ntoxins into the rivers and the lakes and the air, go for it because we \nhave no agency that is going to stop them.\n  ``We recommend repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution, with the goal of abolishing the I.R.S. and replacing it \nwith a national sales tax collected by the States.''\n  In English, what that means is, what they want to do is move to \nregressive taxes, ending all forms of progressive taxation. So they \nwant working people, middle-class people, to pay more in taxes, while \nthe wealthy pay less.\n  ``We favor abolishing the capital gains tax [and the estate tax],'' \nwhich, of course, falls most heavily on wealthy people.\n  Here is what they say--and I have to give these guys credit, they are \nup front, they put this on paper--``We believe the Minimum Wage Law \nshould be repealed.''\n  So there we go. People in America will now work for $3 or $4 an hour \nif that is what the circumstances require.\n  I point out, as I said earlier, this is coming from the Texas \nRepublican Party Platform, and I could have gone elsewhere. But the \nideas that come from them end up filtering among rightwing circles all \nover America.\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\n  Now, interestingly enough, at a time when the middle class is \ndisappearing and the wealthy and large corporations are doing \nphenomenally well, it is important to hear what the CEOs of the largest \nWall Street banks and corporations in this country--the Business \nRoundtable--have to say on the economy. Wall Street--bailed out by the \nmiddle class of this country--corporate America enjoying record-\nbreaking profits.\n  Earlier this year, the Business Roundtable--again, these are the CEOs \nof the major corporations in America. Without exception, these guys are \nmaking millions of dollars a year in income. They have wonderful \nretirement packages, health care benefits for them and their families. \nThis is what they have to say. They came to Washington, and they called \non Congress to raise the eligibility age of Social Security and \nMedicare to the age of 70--70.\n  Wall Street billionaires, CEOs making huge amounts of money, with \nwonderful retirement packages--they now want Congress to raise the \nretirement age of Social Security and Medicare to age 70; they want to \ncut Social Security and veterans benefits, their COLAS; they want to \nraise taxes on working families and, obviously, it goes without saying, \ncut taxes for the largest corporations in America, at a time when one \nout of four of these corporations does not pay a nickel in taxes.\n  That is the background: the middle class collapsing; the rich getting \nricher. Then we have a right wing in this country, fueled by people \nlike the Koch brothers, and others, who are pushing a totally \nreactionary agenda.\n  Let's talk about what that immediate agenda looks like in terms of \nthe CR, the continuing resolution, that, in fact--and this is what is \ngoing to pass in the House, as I understand it--would lock in place \nsequestration for domestic programs, while providing a $20 billion \nboost to defense spending for the next 3 months. That is annualized, \nlooking from the year's perspective.\n  If we do that for a year, that sequestration level, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, sequestration will lead to the loss of \n900,000 jobs and cause a seven-tenths of 1 percent drop in the GDP. \nReal unemployment today is close to 14 percent. With sequestration for \na year, it would result in the loss of some 900,000 jobs--at exactly a \ntime that we do not need it. Many of the jobs lost will be government \njobs, but that should come as no surprise because the extreme right \nwing really does not believe in the concept of government.\n  So when we lose jobs in the teaching profession, when we lose police \nofficers and firefighters and construction workers and VA nurses and VA \ndoctors and scientists and engineers, that is no problem for some of \nthese fellows.\n  Sequestration--we should be clear--has already caused enormous pain \nfor millions of Americans. As I mentioned earlier, this country is way \nbehind our global competitors in terms of childcare, early childhood \neducation.\n  As a result of sequestration, more than 57,000 kids are losing access \nto Head Start and Early Head Start Programs.\n  At a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing, and when millions and \nmillions of parents are wondering how they are going to be able to feed \ntheir kids, what the sequestration does is it literally goes after some \nof the most vulnerable people in this country, who are elderly people, \nlow income, living on minimal Social Security benefits, who cannot even \nleave their homes. They are served right now by the Meals on Wheels \nProgram, and I want to thank all of the Meals on Wheels volunteers out \nthere for doing a great job trying to help these seniors. Sequestration \nwill continue major cuts, throwing thousands and thousands of seniors \noff the Meals on Wheels Program.\n  We have a serious housing crisis in America. Sequestration will make \nit harder for over 100,000 families to get a variety of affordable \nhousing programs.\n  Everybody knows the cost of a college education is soaring. Working-\nclass families cannot afford college today. Yet sequestration would \nresult in 70,000 college students losing Federal work-study grants. \nThat is the means by which they earn some money to help stay in \ncollege.\n  Sequestration will result in cutting back on chemotherapy treatments \nto thousands of cancer patients because of a 2-percent cut to Medicare \nproviders.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program--very important in the \nState of Vermont where it gets cold--massive cuts.\n  Long-term unemployment checks--unemployment remains high--a 10-\npercent cut. That will be continued.\n  So that is where we are right now.\n  And it gets worse. It gets worse. If the Boehner CR is approved, \nprograms that millions of Americans rely on will be cut even further. \nSo everything I told you will get even worse.\n  I think what we are looking at right now is not just the immediate \npain of the continuing resolution or the threat not to pay our debts \nand destroy the credit rating of the United States of America. Those \nare enormous realities. But what we are looking at is a real effort to \ndismember the U.S. Government and wreak havoc on the lives of tens and \ntens and tens of millions of people.\n  To my mind, what we have to do is exactly the opposite of what our \nrightwing friends are suggesting. They are suggesting that we should \nraise unemployment. They are suggesting that we should cut back on \nFederal funding for infrastructure. I believe we should be investing \nbillions and billions of dollars in addressing our crumbling \ninfrastructure--roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, our \nrail system. When we do that, we make this country more productive and \nwe create millions of jobs. I believe we have to invest significantly \nin energy efficiency and sustainable energy. When we do that, we not \nonly protect the environment and combat global warming, but we also \ncreate jobs. I believe we have to rewrite our disastrous trade policies \nso that American jobs are not our No. 1 export. I believe, instead of \nfurther deregulation of Wall Street, Wall Street has to be effectively \nregulated so their greed and recklessness can no longer cause enormous \nproblems for our economy. Instead of lowering taxes for the wealthiest \npeople, I think it is high time they started paying their fair share of \ntaxes.\n  So what we are involved in here is a great debate, which goes beyond \nthe continuing resolution. It goes beyond the shutdown of the \ngovernment. It goes beyond whether the United States fails to pay its \nbills for the first time in history. I believe what we have is an \nideology, a rightwing ideology which reflects, at most, the views of 15 \npercent of the American people. I think that is probably a generous \nperspective. I think the vast majority of the American people do not \nbelieve what rightwing extremism is doing, and it is high time we begin \nto stand and say to these people: If you are going to continue those \nefforts, you may not be back here in the U.S. Congress.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, the House of Representatives is \nvoting on legislation dealing with the farm bill and food stamps. \nRecently--this week--the House of Representatives broke with 40 years \nof tradition, precedent, common sense, and perhaps human decency when \nit bowed to partisan politics and passed a farm bill without a \nnutrition title. They pulled apart what traditionally urban and rural \ninterests have done in this country: coming together to pass a farm \nbill, connecting it with a nutrition title, where it served rural \nAmerica, it served urban America, it was good for hungry kids, it was \ngood for economic development, it was good for conservation and the \nenvironment.\n  The House leadership has announced that later today--sometime this \nafternoon--the House will vote on a bill that would cut the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, by nearly $40 billion. \nThey are taking up this bill because the $20 billion in punitive SNAP \ncuts they failed to pass earlier this year was not enough for the\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nmajority. They do not only cut $20 billion--$20 billion, $20,000 \nmillion--$20 billion in cuts, when the average family gets $4.45 per \nday. Cutting $20 billion was bad enough. That was not good enough for \nthose Members of the House of Representatives who want to see cuts \ntwice as big. Many of those Members of the House of Representatives--or \nat least some of them--are farmers themselves who get huge farm \nsubsidies. It begs the issue a little bit.\n  For some of my colleagues who have seen the movie ``Lincoln,'' at one \npoint, President Lincoln--listening, but perhaps not entirely hearing \nhis staff, who exhorted him to spend more time in the White House, \nwinning the war, freeing the slaves, preserving the Union--President \nLincoln said: I need to go out and get my public opinion baths.\n  Well, I suggest that maybe more of us--those particularly who are \nvoting to cut SNAP, to cut food stamps $40 billion--they may want to go \nout and listen to what people--not dressed like this, not working \naround here who get good benefits and decent salaries, not highly paid \nCongressmen and Senators, not the lobbyists who they may brunch with on \nSunday when those Members do not go back home--but go out and talk to \nsomebody at a labor union hall, go out and talk to somebody in a \nshopping mall, go out and talk to somebody at a school, where \nchildren--I heard a story today at my weekly coffee, where a woman told \nus that her daughter, who teaches in Columbus, has seen during the \nschool lunch program children take some of the food and put it in their \npockets so they can take it home for their brothers and sisters or for \nthe weekend or for their moms or dads.\n  In this still difficult economy--when people receive $4.45 per day, \non the average, for SNAP, for food stamps--people in the House of \nRepresentatives want to cut it nearly $40 billion.\n  It was not enough that 2 million Americans could lose SNAP benefits. \nIt was not enough to them in the first bill that more than 200,000 \nchildren could lose access to the free and reduced-price lunch program. \nThey want to make it harder, and they can say whatever they want. They \ncan say: Well, people--I don't know. Do they get addicted to food \nstamps? Do they dig food stamps because they don't want to work?\n  The fact is, as Chairwoman Stabenow points out, the chair of the \nAgriculture Committee, in the next 10 years, 14 million Americans will \nleave SNAP. Why is that? If we do not do this, why will 14 million \npeople leave SNAP? Because they will get better-paying jobs because \nthey do not want to be in SNAP. Most people who get stamps would rather \nnot. They would rather have enough food on the table. They would rather \nhave enough purchasing power to go to the grocery store and buy food \nwith their own money that they have earned so they can bring that food \nhome and serve their children. That is what most people want to do.\n  I spoke to a woman in Hamilton, OH, some time ago who told me that \nearly in the month she would occasionally take her 9-year-old son to \nMcDonald's or to another fast food restaurant--maybe once in the first \nweek of the month.\n  The second week, she could maybe serve him a hamburger, she could \nserve him meat. The third week of the month, she began to scrape. This \nis a woman who had a full-time job, volunteered, taught Sunday School, \nvolunteered with the Cub Scouts for her son, was a very devoted single \nmother. The fourth week of the month, what typically happened was--she \nlooked at me with her blues and she said: You know, I say to my son--I \nwas sitting there with my son that last week of the month.\n  He said: Mom, how come you are not eating?\n  She said: Well, I am just not hungry.\n  Well, she was hungry; she just had to choose at the end of the month, \ndoes the money go for my son or does it go for me? Like most mothers \nand fathers, she chose to do it for her child. That is the backdrop.\n  If more of my colleagues would follow the admonition of Abraham \nLincoln and go out and get a public opinion bath and listen to what \nreal people are saying--not people who dress like this, not people who \nsit in Congress, not lobbyists who may buy them lunch and come to their \nfundraisers, but really listen to what people have to say about what \nthis means and understand, as Presiding Officer knows from the work he \nhas done in his State of Connecticut, that most of the people getting \nbenefits are children. Eighty-five percent of people receiving food \nassistance are children or their parents or people with disabilities or \nseniors. Many of them have jobs, but their jobs pay $9 an hour. Again, \nthis is not something they do by choice in a great majority of cases; \nit is something they feel they have to do. They are mothers and fathers \nwho get up in the morning and try to give their children a better \nfuture. These are millions of Americans who head out every day looking \nfor work so they can pay their bills and put food on the table.\n  As I said, almost 90 percent--80-some percent of SNAP households are \nmade up of seniors and the disabled and families with children. One out \nof six Americans worries about where their next meal is coming from--\none out of six Americans. How many people in this body have ever really \nthought that way, have talked to people that way, have tried to put \nthemselves in the place of the--that is 50, 60, 70 percent of \nAmericans--one out of six who worries about where their next meal will \ncome from.\n  Then we have the body down the hall, the House of Representatives, \nwho voted--$20 billion in cuts is not enough; let's do $40 billion. \nMaybe we will do more than that.\n  My colleagues in the Congress suggest that SNAP participation has \ngrown too big. They bemoan the state of our economy, the still-too-high \nunemployment rate. We all do. I share that concern. But we must do more \nto help jump-start our economy. I will work with anyone who seeks to do \nso. We know how important these benefits are to our brothers and \nsisters from Cleveland to Cincinnati, from rural Appalachia to \nfarmlands in western Ohio, all across this country. It is important \nthat we stand strong. We need a farm bill. We need a farm bill that \nserves agriculture. We need a farm bill that serves rural development. \nWe need a farm bill that serves conservation and the environment. We \nneed a farm bill that helps us provide energy. We need a farm bill that \nprovides nutrition assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the substitute \namendment, No. 1960, is agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden, and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as I said this morning, Washington, DC, \nseems to have an inexhaustible capacity to manufacture false crises. I \nam here to say that this is not one of them. If the Congress does not \nact immediately to pass the legislation Senator Murkowski and I advance \ntoday, scores of\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nAmerican manufacturing and technology companies employing millions of \nAmerican workers are going to find it impossible to continue their \ncurrent operations.\n  Our government got involved with helium after World War I because the \ndefense sector needed it. Ever since, President after President and \nCongress after Congress has tried to come up with a policy that gets \ngovernment out of the helium business while still meeting the needs of \nour middle-class workers, our businesses, and our taxpayers.\n  Senator Murkowski and I are here to say that our bipartisan bill does \nthat. The reality also is that it raises some revenue. With that \nrevenue, we will be able to meet--we talked about it in the committee--\nongoing needs, particularly for folks hurting in rural communities \nwhere the Federal Government owns most of the land. They are concerned \nabout their schools and their police and their roads. And because of \nthe good work by colleagues on the other side of the aisle--\nparticularly Senators Risch and Flake--we were able to secure an \nadditional $51 million to pay down the deficit.\n  We have 7 minutes on each side. I know colleagues are anxious to \nvote. I yield time to Senator Murkowski. I thank Senator Cruz for his \ncourtesy in this matter. I would yield to Senator Murkowski. I would \nurge all colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nlegislation that came out of our committee unanimously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, thanks to the chairman of our energy \ncommittee, we have been working on this legislation for some time now--\na couple of years. As the chairman has noted, what we are doing with \nthe reauthorization of this Helium Program is we are getting the \ngovernment out of the business of helium. We are on our way to \ncompleting a process that has been underway effectively in Congress \nsince 1996.\n  We have an opportunity today to do the right thing, but we also have \na very clear opportunity to make sure that we do not have a helium \ncrisis, that we do not see a disruption in supply. That is effectively \nwhat could happen if we here in the Senate do not act quickly and work \nwith the House to get this resolved before an October 1 deadline. So \nthat is the imperative to take this vote this afternoon and move it \nacross the line so we can conclude our business as it relates to the \nHelium Program. This is significant. It is important. We have a chance \nto make a difference. We can prevent a massive disruption to the helium \nsupply chain.\n  We recognize that when we are talking about helium, it is not just \nparty balloons; we are truly talking about an impact on our high-tech \nsector, our manufacturing sector, so many sectors of our economy that \nare reliant and dependent on helium. We should also finish the business \nwe started back in 1996--fully privatize the helium business so that \nthe government is out of the way. Truly, what we are doing is making \nsure helium supplies are determined by market forces.\n  As the chairman has noted, we need to address other priorities here \nin the Congress. We have done that with the revenues and the \ndistribution that the chairman has outlined and that I have outlined \npreviously here on the floor, and at the same time we have seen fit to \ndirect a good portion of revenues toward deficit reduction. These are \ngood, responsible decisions.\n  Our legislation here in the Senate differs from what our counterparts \nin the House have done. We end the government's intervention or \nactivities within the helium business. We have a thoughtful glidepath \nout.\n  It is legislation that is not only thoughtful, it is bipartisan. It \nmoved through the energy committee unanimously. I am pleased to be able \nto stand here today with the chairman of the energy committee urging \ncolleagues to support this critically important legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President. I rise today in support of H.R. 527, the \nHelium Stewardship Act, as amended by the Wyden substitute. This bill \nis very important to protecting the U.S. supply of helium. Helium is \nused in MRI scanners, superconductors, and has many other very \nimportant uses. For example, helium is even used to test mechanical \nheart valves to make sure they don't leak.\n  Helium also has important security implications. It is used by DoD, \nNASA, and other agencies. The bill helps those efforts by extending the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Interior to sell helium from the \nFederal Helium Reserve.\n  The bill also includes important reforms such as provisions ensuring \nthat the Secretary sells helium at market prices, and most importantly, \nit gets the Federal Government out of the helium business once and for \nall.\n  The bill would also reduce the Federal debt and deficit by $51 \nmillion. The bill has bipartisan support. In June, the Energy Committee \nvoted to report the helium bill by voice vote. The Senate should pass \nthis bill as soon as possible so we have an opportunity to negotiate \nwith the House.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues had some concerns with the \nbill. I appreciate them giving me the opportunity to speak with them \nbefore the vote about those concerns. I also thank my colleagues for \nagreeing to allow this bill to come to a vote. While I do not support \nevery item in the bill, I believe it is a critical piece of legislation \nthat needs to be passed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the substitute \namendment to H.R. 527, the Responsible Helium Administration and \nStewardship Act, which would reauthorize the Federal Helium Reserve and \nextend its operation for commercial sales. This bill prevents a severe \ndisruption to the Nation's helium supply which threatens critical \nindustries, hospitals, national security, and scientific research.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Murkowski, and \ntheir staffs for excellent work on this bill, which would ensure \ncontinued access to helium so that New York hospitals, our successful \nchip industry, and other high-tech companies will not go over the \nhelium cliff, while making critical reforms to the sale process and \nreducing the deficit. Passage of this bill will prevent shortages for \nbusinesses and hospitals as well as skyrocketing prices that would have \nresulted from closure of the Federal Helium Reserve on October 7.\n  Helium's unique physical and chemical properties have made it \ncritical to the manufacturing of a broad range of technologies from \naerospace to semiconductors, medical devices, and fiber optics. It is \nalso widely used in medical research, cutting-edge science, and \nhospital care. Helium is also essential to our national security, as \nthe Department of Defense relies on it for a range of weapons systems \nand intelligence applications.\n  Here is just a sampling of how critical helium is.\n  MRI scanners at hospitals use helium to cool powerful magnets. \nWithout helium, $2 million machines couldn't be operated without risk \nof damage.\n  Semiconductors cannot be made without helium, which serves as an \nessential coolant during the manufacturing process. Semiconductors are \nthe core of all electronics embedded in cars, computers, health \ndevices, weapons systems, nuclear reactors, et cetera. A robust supply \nof helium allows American semiconductor manufacturers, like \nGlobalFoundries and IBM, to create good-paying, high-tech jobs in \nupstate New York.\n  The production of optical fiber--the backbone of all telecom \ninfrastructure--uses helium to prevent impurities.\n  The Department of Defense uses significant quantities of helium as \npart of the guidance correction systems for air-to-air missiles used by \nour military. It also relies on it for surveillance of combat terrain, \nhelping protect our troops.\n  Our DOE National Laboratories, such as Brookhaven National Laboratory \nin my State, relies on helium for cutting--edge science.\n  Failure to act would hurt our economic competitiveness, cause job \nlosses, and harm our national security when we can least afford it.\n  If we don't reauthorize the Reserve, we would have to get helium from \none of two places: Russia or the Middle East, the only other regions in \nthe world producing it.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this important \nlegislation and I look forward to its swift passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague from Alaska for all of her work. We \nawait our colleague from Texas who would like to speak.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Let me yield 1 minute at this time to our friend who in \nthe House had begun working on this literally years ago. I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for all of his efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. This bill \nis something that shows we can work across the lines of politics in \nthis institution.\n  I began this bill with Doc Hastings, a Republican from Washington \nState, in the House of Representatives a year ago. It passed over \nthere. Now it is over here in the Senate, and the same kind of \nbipartisanship is working to pass this critical bill which is central \nfor companies like Siemens, Philips, and GE just in Massachusetts that \nsupport thousands of jobs in the high-tech sector.\n  There was a shutdown that was looming, but it was a shutdown in the \nhelium industry. This is one shutdown that we are going to make sure \ndoes not happen. I thank the chairman for making this possible because \nit took a lot of leadership to make sure that House bill, the Hastings-\nMarkey bill, is now over here, and it has been solved in a way that \nevery Member should feel very comfortable voting yes for because it \nreally is going to solve a big problem that was going to hit our high-\ntech industry in the United States.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe we have 1\\1/2\\ minutes left. \nLet's go to Senator Cruz, and then hopefully we can vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I am going to be brief and not take my \nentire time. I think the underlying extension and reform of the Helium \nProgram in this bill is a good provision. It maintains the program. \nHelium is critical for our businesses, for our industry, for our high-\ntech community. So I salute the Senator from Oregon and the Senator \nfrom Alaska for working together.\n  As written, the Senate bill raises $500 million over 10 years in new \nrevenue. The House bill took the revenue raised by this program and put \nit to deficit reduction and reducing our debt. The Senate bill--I think \nunfortunately--instead of using the revenue for deficit reduction, uses \n$400 of the $500 million for new spending.\n  I raised internally an objection and asked my colleagues if they \nwould consider reducing spending in other parts of the budget to \nbalance it given that we have nearly a $17 trillion national debt. I \nthink the more fiscally responsible thing to do, if we have $500 \nmillion in new revenue, is to use it to pay down the deficit and the \ndebt.\n  We have worked together in a bipartisan way to allow this to come to \na vote. I thank the Senator from Oregon for agreeing to do that. I \nintend to vote no, but I am hopeful that in conference committee \nperhaps the House and Senate can work together to take care of the \nimportant concerns with the Helium Program but at the same time \ndemonstrate some additional fiscal responsibility, which I think would \nbe a win-win for everyone.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we have a minute and a half. I will be very \nbrief. I thank the Senator from Texas for his courtesy.\n  The bottom line is that the House bill, which the Senator is calling \nfor, does not get the government out of the helium business. That is \nthe single most important distinction. We are reaching out to all those \nhard-hit middle-class workers in aerospace and tech and a whole host of \nindustries. We are doing it in a way that protects taxpayers. It gets \nthe government out of the helium business.\n  This legislation passed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nunanimously. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back and the Senate \nnow proceed to vote on the passage of the bill, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, I am here today with my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Blunt, to talk about our efforts to bring some common \nsense to the EPA's emission standards.\n  It is my firm belief that we can establish emission standards that \nprotect our environment without hurting our economy and without hurting \nthe pocketbooks of families in Indiana and across the country.\n  When the EPA released draft standards in 2012 that would regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions from powerplants, it was clear that the \nadministration's standards far exceeded the level of carbon reductions \nthat would be available using existing technology. They also failed to \nacknowledge that different fuel types pose different challenges when \ntrying to reduce emissions.\n  If we don't address these standards in a commonsense way, the \naffordable, reliable energy that Hoosier families and businesses depend \non will be in doubt. It is absolutely critical that the EPA understand \nthe impact of these standards and the price their proposed regulation \nwould ask Hoosiers to pay.\n  Our amendment urges the EPA to use common sense when putting together \nemission regulations by ensuring that efforts to regulate carbon \ndioxide emissions are realistic about existing technology and do not \nnegatively impact our economy.\n  Our amendment states that if the EPA puts together regulations to \ncontrol carbon dioxide emissions from an industrial source, the EPA \nmust develop the regulations using emission\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nrates based on the efficiencies achievable using existing technology \nthat is commercially available. ``Commercially available'' is defined \nas any technology with proven test results in an industrial setting. It \nalso must be subcategorized by fuel type. Different fuel types must \nhave different emission rates to be reflective of what is realistic for \nfuel producers using all available technologies.\n  Our amendment develops an NSPS for carbon dioxide emissions to \nprotect our environment while also ensuring that the regulations do not \nexcessively burden Hoosier families and businesses that rely on \naffordable power. The EPA is scheduled to release its updated standards \ntomorrow. I urge them to make sure that any NSPS regulation is \nsomething that reflects existing technology. We must prevent anything \nthat would jeopardize the affordable, reliable energy that allows many \nHoosier families--and families and businesses across our country--to \nmake ends meet.\n  Again, I thank my friend Senator Blunt for working with me on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am pleased to work on this with Senator \nDonnelly. This is an amendment which, as he said, requires that we \ncategorize fuel types and that we say what works for various types of \nfuel as opposed to setting some standard that makes it impossible for \nother resources we have to be used. It says that the technology has to \nbe commercially available.\n  We had the Acting EPA Director before the Appropriations Committee \nearlier this year. I asked the Acting Director: The rule that you are \ntalking about, is this technology available? Can somebody go out and \nbuy this? And the response was something like: Well, parts of it are \nout there, but nobody has ever quite put it together yet--which, of \ncourse, meant that the rule, for the first time ever, set a standard \nthat couldn't possibly be reached.\n  In States such as ours, Missouri and Indiana, where Senator Donnelly \nand I are from, we are more than 80 percent dependent on coal. Some of \nour constituents are 100 percent dependent on coal. If you do things \nthat raise their utility bills, families know it and their community \nknows it.\n  This amendment simply would force the EPA to use common sense when \nsetting standards for any facility. The new source performance \nstandards, based upon emission limits for powerplants, for refineries, \nfor manufacturing facilities, for whatever else they can cover, simply \ndon't meet that commonsense standard. In fact, last March when the \nproposed rule went out, there were more than 2 million comments. You \nhave to work pretty hard to find this rule, and you have to really be \ndedicated to read it, and 2 million comments said this won't work. It \nis so obvious that it won't work.\n  The rule said that if someone wants to build a coal plant, they have \nto install carbon capture technology, which according to the rule would \nadd 80 percent to the cost of electricity. It would overstate it a \nlittle bit initially, but not very far in the future--if you get your \nutility bill and multiply it by two, you will be pretty close to what \nyour utility bill would be if the proponents of this rule--if what they \nsay will happen is what happens. What happens if you double the utility \nbill? How many jobs go away? How many families find themselves in \nstress?\n  When cap and trade failed, the President--who had said earlier that \nunder his cap-and-trade plan electricity rates would necessarily \nskyrocket--when it failed, the President said that was only one way of \nskinning the cat. Obviously, the EPA is looking for the second way to \nskin this cat and to impact families. It would make it expensive to do \nwhat can be otherwise done in the country. Businesses and households \nwould need to make a decision about that.\n  What we need to be doing is looking to use all of our resources in \nthe best possible way. More American energy is critical, and we ought \nto be doing everything we can to see how we produce more American \nenergy, a more certain supply, easier to transition from one fuel to \nanother, not harder, not putting one electric plant out of business and \nrequiring that you build an entire new electric plant. Do you know how \nyou pay for an electric plant? Somebody gives you the authority to pass \nall that cost along to the people who are served by it. There is no \nfree electricity out there. It makes a real difference.\n  The most vulnerable families among us are the ones who are most \nimpacted by the higher utility bill. The Bureau of Labor Statistics \nsaid that nearly 40 million American households earn less than $30,000 \na year, and those households spend almost 20 percent of their income on \nenergy. Do you want to make that 30 percent or 40 percent? Surely that \nis not the answer for vulnerable families.\n  If you read the press reports today, the EPA will come out with a \nrule tomorrow. I hope this amendment becomes part of the law that would \nmake that rule, frankly, make common sense.\n  The American people want the administration to stop picking winners \nand losers through regulatory policies. If the Congress wants to have \nthat debate and change the law and do that in the open, that is one way \nto do it, but I think we all know that American consumers have figured \nout where this road takes their family, and they don't want to go \nthere.\n  So I urge support for the amendment Senator Donnelly and I are \nworking on--common sense and real cost-benefit analysis. New standards \nthat work are essential, not new standards that you know won't work. I \nam glad to be a cosponsor of this amendment and urge my colleagues to \njoin Senator Donnelly and me if we get a chance to vote on it as part \nof this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

Madam President, as many of my current and even former \nstaff can tell you, I am fond of saying that I, like other Senators, am \nmerely a constitutional impediment to my staff. But I don't mind being \njust a constitutional impediment. Mine is one of the finest staffs on \nCapitol Hill.\n  Tomorrow my office will say goodbye to Will Goodman, one of the \nfinest. He is going to be leaving for a challenging new opportunity. \nWill joined my staff in January of 2010 as a legislative fellow from \nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense. We barely got him to his desk \nand he had to jump right in with both feet and hit the ground running. \nHe was a valuable member of my legislative team, working on that year's \ndebate over the repeal of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' and the \nratification of the New START treaty. Importantly, Will was a trusted \nstaffer, a willing ear, and a source of support as the Vermont National \nGuard prepared to deploy for Afghanistan.\n  When his fellowship ended, I was pleased when Will accepted my offer \nto become my senior defense adviser. In that role, he was instrumental \nin helping to pass the National Guard Empowerment Act, one of my \nlongtime legislative priorities. Will has been a go-to aid for many \nMembers and their staffs, particularly for the more than 80 Members of \nboth parties of the Senate National Guard Caucus, which I am proud to \ncochair.\n  I know that Vermonters appreciate Will's steadfast commitment to the \nState, to the many veterans who live there, to the Vermont National \nGuard, and to our State's economic development. He has always been \neager to help and has always been a fierce advocate for Vermonters.\n  After nearly four decades in the Senate, I have had dozens of \nstaffers come\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\nand go, but we like to think they always remain part of what we call \nthe Leahy Family.\n  Will's own family is growing. He and his wife Marisha and their \nwonderful son Mark await the arrival of their newest member early next \nyear, though Marcus--as we call him--will be the Big Brother. As his \nfamily grows, he is always going to be part of ours.\n  Marcelle and I wish Will the best.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I read the papers down here and across the \ncountry. It makes it look as if the issue of whether we are going to \nmove forward with the implementation of the health care bill passed a \nfew years ago is just about politics. It is just a political football \nthat is being tossed back and forth between the two sides.\n  While the threats are empty, there is no way we are going to pass a \ncontinuing resolution that is not going to include funding of this \nvital health care law, it still gets an enormous amount of play out \nthere. I think it is important for us to come down to the floor and \nexplain to the American people that this issue is not political, that \nthe health care law is not just a piece of paper.\n  The health care law is a lifeline to millions of families out there \nacross America who have been absolutely drowning in health care costs \nand an inability to access the system over the past several decades. We \ndid not pass this law to score political points. We did not do it to \nmake ourselves feel good. We did it because we saw almost immeasurable \nhuman suffering out on the streets of America to which this place \nneeded to respond.\n  It is not OK that in the most affluent, most powerful country in the \nworld, about 15 percent of our society has the potential to go to bed \nsick every night simply because they cannot afford to see a doctor. It \nis certainly not OK that 50 percent of the bankruptcies in this country \nhistorically have been caused by the misfortune of an individual or a \nfamily member to get sick.\n  So I think it is time that when we talk about the implementation of \nthe health care law, ObamaCare, whatever you want to call it, we are \ntalking about consequences that are not political. They are \nconsequences related to life or death.\n  That is not hyperbole. There are people out there every week dying \nbecause they do not have access to our Nation's health care system \nwhich, if you can find it, is and can be the best health care system in \nthe world.\n  The problem is there are far too many people who have no insurance \nand no way to access it or who are vastly underinsured and cannot get \nthe right access to it. So I just want to talk for a minute about what \nthis is going to mean to our constituents, to your neighbors, and what \nit would mean if, by some miracle of politics, the tea party gets its \nway and this bill was no longer the law of the land come next month.\n  Let me tell you what it already means for a senior citizen who is \nliving on $20,000 a year in New Britain, CT. Today, that senior citizen \ngets to walk in to their doctor to get a wellness visit. They do not \nhave to pay anything out of pocket any longer. Previously they did. You \nwould think that is not a lot of money. But for someone in Connecticut \nwho is living on a fixed income or somebody in Delaware who is taking \nhome a pretty meager Social Security check every month, the costs \nescalate when you are just trying to pay your rent or your mortgage, \nput food on the table, be able to put gas in your car to get back and \nforth to see your grandkids.\n  That extra expense of having to pay for preventive costs can actually \nmake a difference.\n  For those seniors who have pretty high drug costs, one of the worst \nthings this Congress did over the last 10 years was pass a prescription \ndrug bill that had this doughnut hole sitting in the middle of it. If \nyou paid for a bunch of drugs through the Medicare benefit, eventually \nyou would have to start paying out of your own pocket. That could be \nthousands of dollars that senior citizens don't have.\n  This health care bill closes the doughnut hole, eliminates half of it \nalmost overnight and then essentially eliminates it over time. That is \nthousands of dollars in savings for seniors. That is medication that, \nfrankly, a lot of seniors would never have been able to buy but they \nwill now be able to access because of this law.\n  Those things go away if Republicans get their way and ObamaCare is \ndefunded. All of a sudden, if that happens, tomorrow senior citizens \nhave to pay out of pocket for preventive costs. Seniors who have high \ndrug costs all of a sudden have to go back to paying 100 percent of the \ncost of generics versus 50 percent, which is what they are paying now.\n  What about the average family of four who today in Connecticut is \npaying about $605 a month for health care? Probably the health care \nplan is not that good to begin with. It probably has some significant \nholes in it in terms of what it will cover.\n  If this health care bill is implemented, which it will be, that \nnumber goes down from $605 a month to $286 a month for the average \nfamily of four in Connecticut.\n  Let me tell you, the average family of four in Connecticut living in \nStamford, Bridgeport, Norwalk, or Norwich, could use that extra $300 in \nsavings to help save for college, to help put a bit more nutritious \nmeal on the table, maybe to pay some back credit card bills. Three \nhundred dollars is a big deal. That is the big difference this health \ncare bill will make, $605 a month down to $286 in Connecticut. It is a \nbig difference. It is an even bigger difference because the health care \nplan they are going to get for $286 a month is going to be a good one.\n  We are going to finally have some standardization when it comes to \nthe benefits you are getting. When you buy the health care plan in \nConnecticut or wherever you are, you are going to know what you are \ngetting. There is going to be a minimum set of benefits that is going \nto be covered. You are going to be able to know that when you buy \ninsurance you are getting ambulatory patient services, coverage for \nhospitalization, coverage for maternity and newborn care, your \nprescription drugs are covered, lab services, and rehab benefits. Every \nplan is going to be able to cover these things, but not if the health \ncare law were magically repealed.\n  All of a sudden people who were counting on that number going from \n$600 to $300 in Connecticut will be paying $600, probably $700, $800, \nand they will continue to have to deal with a dizzying array of benefit \npackages, many of which simply don't measure up to what families need.\n  What about for Betty Berger? What does this mean for her? She is a \nconstituent of mine in Meriden. She doesn't want anyone to ever have to \ngo through what she went through. She and her husband had health care \ncoverage for themselves and their kids through her husband's plan. Her \nhusband switched jobs. In the week of time between when he was at his \nfirst job and his second job, their son was diagnosed with cancer. Her \nhusband's second job identified it as a preexisting condition and \neffectively refused to cover the son.\n  The Bergers lost everything. They lost their house, they lost their \ncar, they lost their savings simply because their son was diagnosed \nwith cancer during the 1 week in which the husband wasn't employed. \nThat will never, ever happen again after this bill is implemented. No \ninsurance plan regulated under this bill can deny a family access for \nhealth care simply because one of their family members is sick. It is \nunconscionable that ever happened in this country, and it will not \nhappen again if this bill is implemented. But if the Republicans get \nwhat they want and this bill is defunded, if this bill is repealed in \nthat magical fantasy world, the example of the Bergers happens hundreds \nof thousands of times over across the country.\n  Lastly, what about the McCullough family, another family in \nConnecticut?\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\nLittle Kyle McCullough, when I first met him, was 8. He is probably now \n10 or 11 years old. He has a very complicated disease for which he has \nto take $3,000 injections. He will hit his lifetime limit in a matter \nof years and his family will be on the hook for every expense \nthereafter. The health care bill says no more annual, no more lifetime \nlimits for health care coverage. You could have health care insurance \nthat is going to take care of little Kyle McCullough for as long as he \nneeds those injections, at whatever cost it is going to be.\n  It is insurance. Because for people who have a bad lot in life and \nhave a big, complicated, expensive, illness they are going to be \ncovered. If the health care bill is repealed, defunded, or whatever \nRepublicans want to do, Kyle McCullough's family has to pay for that \nout of pocket for the rest of their life, as will thousands of other \nfamilies like them.\n  That is what the stakes are. It is not a piece of paper. It is not a \npolitical football. It is life and death. It is hundreds, if not \nthousands, of dollars that hard-working families throughout this \ncountry desperately need and a health care system they need to be much \nmore fair and much more compassionate.\n  It is not going to happen. It is political fantasy that Republicans \nare going to be able to defund or repeal the health care law as a \nconsequence of the budget debates we are going to have over the next \nfew weeks.\n  Let's be honest about what they are asking. They are asking for \nhigher costs for seniors; they are asking for higher costs for middle-\nclass families; they are asking for more bankruptcies; and they are \nasking for more misery for the thousands of families who are struggling \nto keep their heads above water when they deal with a complicated \nillness. That is the true reality of what is happening out there today \nin our health care system that is getting better by the day and will \nget even better if we move forward with the implementation of the \nhealth care law.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we continue to see that special interest \ngroups remain undaunted in their efforts to ram through an immigration \nbill that will do real damage to the wages and job prospects of working \nAmericans. That is just a plain fact. Consider the economic situation \nwe find ourselves in now. Inflation-adjusted wages--that is the way to \ncompare wages correctly over time--are lower today than they were in \n1999. This is a steady decline. Actually, new numbers indicate they are \nlower than they have been since 1995. Working Americans are not having \ntheir wages go up. Their wages are going down. Median household income \nis lower today--median income, which is the best way to account for how \nfamilies are doing--than it has been every single year since 1989. The \nsize of the workforce today has shrunk to a 35-year low. We have the \nlowest workplace participation since 1975, and a record number of \nAmericans are on welfare, including almost one in six on food stamps.\n  But we still have this determination, it seems, by our masters of the \nuniverse--people who know so much better--that what we really need in \nAmerica is more workers. I would contend it is quite plain--with high \nunemployment and low job prospects, declining workplace participation, \nand declining wages--that what we have a shortage of is not workers, \nbut we have a shortage of jobs, and we need to put our people in those \njobs. That is a very simple concept, and I think it is undisputable.\n  That is why I care about this issue, and I think we have to talk \nabout it. What we are talking about, remember now, is not the end of \nimmigration. We are not talking about anything like that. We are \ntalking about maintaining the greatest immigration flow of any nation \nin the world--maybe in the history of the world--with 1.1 million a \nyear, plus a very generous guest worker program, where people come in \njust to work. And we can support that, but this bill that passed the \nSenate would have doubled the number of guest workers and increased by \nat least 50 percent--over 1.5 million a year--those coming permanently, \nin addition to legalizing 11 million who entered unlawfully. I truly \nbelieve that cannot be sustained and that this is good for the vast \nmajority of the American people.\n  What we are seeing routinely is the one interest that is being \nomitted in all of the debate is the interest of the average working \nAmerican--the average citizen of this country who goes to work every \nday. Everybody else has their interest represented. Everybody else is \nraising money, putting ads on the television, spinning this and \nspinning that, but the average guy is getting hammered by this. It just \nis so.\n  Let me cite some of the things that are going on, and I will run \nthrough this because I think it is important for us to know. Here in \nPolitico, September 17, it starts off saying:\n\n       Nancy Pelosi is huddling with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, \n     top labor leaders and former AOL leader Steve Case in \n     separate meetings this week as supporters of immigration \n     reform try to revive the issue.\n\n  After they got so badly hammered by the American people when it \npassed through the Senate, it is now dead on arrival in the House and \nthey are trying to revive it.\n  The article goes on to state:\n\n       House Republicans bristled when a group of Senators met \n     with outside groups supporting immigration reform and \n     formulated a campaign-style strategy to target more than 100 \n     House Republicans over the August recess.\n\n  To try to pound them into submission, I guess.\n\n       Despite the blowback, Schumer, the so-called leader of the \n     Gang of Eight--\n\n  The leader of the Gang of 8, to be frank\n\n     continued to work the phones over the August recess with a \n     clear message: Please get active on immigration and back \n     reform in the Republican-led House.\n\n  The article says he reached out to all his allies to tell them to go \nforward. He said:\n\n       We had a very good August. But I don't think it's dead by \n     any stretch of the imagination.\n\n  Well, I think he does not want it dead and I think he is working hard \nto keep it alive, but somebody needs to make it clear to the American \npeople that it is not dead and it could be revived. There are special \ninterests out there, traditional Republican allies as well as strong \nDemocratic and liberal activists who are pushing for this legislation.\n  Our friends say they want comprehensive immigration reform, but what \ndoes this phrase really mean? What does it really mean? Isn't that what \nwe should ask? They want a large increase in future low-skilled \nimmigration combined with immediate amnesty for those here illegally \nand a promise of enforcement in the future. And that promise was proven \nto be worthless.\n  The first legislation, which stayed on the floor for weeks and went \nthrough the committee, would only have reduced the illegal flow by \nabout 25 percent. They promised it was the toughest bill in history, \nbut the Congressional Budget Office--our independent analysis--proved \nit would have only minor impact on the illegality while doubling the \nnumber of guest workers, increasing substantially the number in terms \nof annual flow of immigrants who want to be here permanently, plus \namnesty for the 11 million. Instead of what we would normally expect to \nlegalize over 10 years--10 million--we would legalize 30 million under \nthis bill. That is what they proposed here in the Senate. Well, I don't \nthink this is good for America, and I don't think the American people \nwant that to happen.\n  Notice that the one group not represented in all of this is U.S. \ncitizens--the American people. In a recent interview, the President of \nthe U.S. Chamber of Congress, Mr. Tom Donohue--a great American, and I \nknow him and respect him--said this about what is going on, and people \nwho are concerned about this issue need to pay attention because he is \none of the driving forces. He is meeting with La Raza and meeting with \nthe Democrats and Senator Schumer and meeting with others. He wants \nmore workers, apparently.\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\n  Reading from BusinessReport.com:\n\n       An agreement between the national business lobby and the \n     AFL-CIO was crucial to passing immigration reform in the \n     Senate, says U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas \n     Donohue, who spoke today at a breakfast by BRAC. Unions are \n     looking for new members, Donahue says, while businesses \n     need both laborers and highly skilled workers.\n\n  This is a frank statement. I give Mr. Donahue credit. He lays it \nright out there. If you want to know the forces at work here, unions \nbelieve that if we legalize and bring in more people, they will have a \nbetter chance of adding union members.\n\n       Unions are looking for new members, Donahue says--\n\n  That is their interest. They have forgotten the interests of their \nworkers, the ones who were working and whose average wages have \ndeclined and who are being laid off--\n\n     while businesses need both laborers and highly skilled \n     workers.\n\n  We can bring in new workers under the current guest worker \nimmigration program, and we can deal compassionately with people who \nhave been here a long time. We can do that but not with the legislation \nthat came out of the Senate.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       Donahue says the House doesn't need to pass a \n     ``comprehensive reform,'' suggesting problems could be fixed \n     with smaller bills. ``Take the whole thing, go to conference \n     with the Senate, and we'll build a bill.''\n\n  Those of us who care about how legislation is crafted can feel the \nhair rise on the back of our necks when we hear this because this is \nexactly what they are trying to accomplish. They want the House to pass \na bill or two to look like it is tough on enforcement, then go to \nconference and take the Senate bill, which is a total disaster, and \nbuild a bill that he likes, bring it back to the floor of both Chambers \nwhere no amendments can be offered, and ram it through, to some degree \nlike the massive health care bill was rammed through. That is what they \nwant to do.\n  I think the House needs to be careful about this. Once you go to \nconference, once you start meeting with these special groups--the \nDemocrats want votes, union members want members, businesses want cheap \nlabor, immigrant groups want to bring more and more. Where are the \nAmerican people in this? Who is paying for these ads they run on \ntelevision? Not the average guy. I don't know any average guy sending \nthem money to run these ads. It is people who have a special interest \nin it.\n  Just a few days ago, a remarkable event happened. The human resource \nmanagers for some of the Nation's largest businesses groups--that is, \nthe people in charge of hiring--sent a letter to House leaders \nclaiming:\n\n       Many of our companies continue to have difficulty finding \n     sufficient American workers to fill certain lesser-skilled \n     positions. Thus, in addition to addressing the need for more \n     highly skilled immigrants, we strongly support efforts to \n     bolster the availability of a workforce at all skill levels. \n     . . .\n\n  They originally tried to say this bill was designed to bring in more \nhigh-skilled workers and reduce the numbers of low-skilled workers \nbecause of our unemployment problems and other reasons, but they openly \nsay they want all skills.\n  The question is, Are these businesses really suffering from a labor \nshortage? Byron York, an excellent writer--writing, I believe, in the \nWashington Examiner--looked at that question. This is what he found:\n\n       . . . at the same time the corporate officers seek higher \n     numbers of immigrants, both low-skill and high-skill, many of \n     their companies are laying off thousands of workers.\n\n  Isn't that something? Could that be true? Well, let's look at his \narticle. Pretty damning, it seems to me. Remember, this letter I just \nread saying that they have to have more low-skilled workers from the \nhuman resource officials was analyzed by Mr. Byron York. He finds this:\n\n       The officials represent companies with a vast array of \n     business interests: General Electric, The Walt Disney \n     Company, Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt \n     Hotels Corporation, McDonald's Corporation, The Wendy's \n     Company, Coca-Cola, The Cheesecake Factory, Johnson & \n     Johnson, Verizon Communications, Hewlett-Packard, General \n     Mills, and many more. All want to see increases in \n     immigration levels for low-skill as well as high-skill \n     workers, in addition to a path to citizenship for the \n     millions of immigrants currently in the U.S. illegally.\n\n  Well, what did Mr. York discover?\n\n       Of course, the U.S. unemployment rate is at 7.3 percent, \n     with millions of American workers at all skill levels out of \n     work, and millions more so discouraged that they have left \n     the work force altogether. In addition, at the same time the \n     corporate officers seek higher numbers of immigrants, both \n     low-skill and high-skill, many of their companies are laying \n     off thousands of workers.\n\n  They say they need more workers. How can it be they are laying off \nworkers?\n\n       For example, Hewlett-Packard, whose Executive Vice \n     President for Human Resources Tracy Keogh signed the letter, \n     laid off 29,000 employees in 2012.\n\n  So they want more foreign workers and they just laid off 29,000 \nAmericans? Oh, boy. That is a stunning number.\n  It goes on.\n\n       In August of this year, Cisco Systems, whose Senior Vice \n     President and Chief Human Resources Officer Kathleen Weslock \n     signed the letter, announced plans to lay off 4,000--in \n     addition to the 8,000 cut in the last two years.\n\n  So they have laid off 12,000 people, and now they can't find people \nwilling to work.\n\n       United Technologies, whose Senior Vice President of Human \n     Resources and Organization Elizabeth B. Amato signed the \n     letter, announced layoffs of 3,000 this year. American \n     Express, whose Chief Human Resources Officer L. Kevin Cox \n     signed the letter, cut 5,400 jobs this year.\n\n  Maybe they ought to try to give some of those jobs to people they \nlaid off, many of whom probably worked for them for 20 years or more.\n\n       Proctor & Gamble, whose Chief Human Resources Officer Mark \n     F. Biegger signed the letter, announced plans to cut 5,700 \n     jobs in 2012.\n\n  This is really offensive to me, as I think it should be to all \nAmericans. This is the kind of leadership we have in corporate America. \nThey come in here and say they have to have workers, totally ignoring \nthe fact that they are laying them off by the thousands. Maybe they \nfind some who work cheaper. Maybe that is what the interest is.\n\n       Those are just a few of the layoffs at companies whose \n     officials signed the letter. A few more: T-Mobile announced \n     2,250 layoffs in 2012. Archer-Daniels-Midland laid off 1,200. \n     Texas Instruments, [laid off] nearly 2,000. Cigna, 1,300. \n     Verizon sought to cut 1,700 jobs by buyouts and layoffs. \n     Marriott announced ``hundreds'' of layoffs this year. \n     International Paper has closed plants and laid off dozens.\n\n  I will note parenthetically that last week it was announced in \nAlabama that International Paper was closing a plant, and 1,100 people \nwho had worked there 25 and 30 years will be out of work. The plant \nshuttered. But they signed the bill saying they need more workers.\n\n       And General Mills, in what the Minneapolis Star-Tribune \n     called a ``rare mass layoff,'' laid off 850 people last year.\n       There are more still. . . . According to a recent Reuters \n     report, U.S. employers announced 50,462 layoffs in August, up \n     34 percent from the previous month and up 57 percent from \n     August 2012.\n\n  ``It is difficult to understand how these companies can feel \njustified in demanding'' that we ram through an immigration bill \ndoubling the number of workers, increasing dramatically the number of \npeople who would be permanent residents of the United States, claiming \nthey need workers, while these very same companies all signed letters. \nWe are laying off thousands of workers. We have to be realistic.\n  Senator Schumer is meeting with business groups to pressure \nRepublicans to join him in conference. But what do conservative \nthinkers have to say about Senator Schumer's plan? I will share a few \ncomments--and there are many more--from intellectuals and writers, some \nconservative, some maybe not conservative.\n  The National Review wrote this:\n\n       By more than doubling the number of so-called guest workers \n     admitted each year, the bill would help create a permanent \n     underclass of foreign workers. . . . The creation of a large \n     population of second-class workers is undesirable from the \n     point of view of the American national interest, which should \n     be our guiding force in this matter. . . . The United States \n     is a nation with an economy, not an economy with a nation.\n\n  Bill Kristol of Fox News, the editor of the Weekly Standard, joined \nwith Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review, in an unusual joint \neditorial and went on to lay out deep concerns about the passage of \nthis.\n\n       Passing any version of the Gang of Eight's bill would be \n     worse public policy than passing nothing. House Republicans \n     can do the country a service by putting a stake through its \n     heart.\n\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\n\n  Victor Davis Hanson, who has written a book on immigration, is an \nexcellent columnist in California.\n\n       The United States may be suffering the most persistent \n     unemployment since the Great Depression. There may be an \n     unemployment rate of over 15 percent in many small towns in \n     the American Southwest.\n\n  American businesses may be flush with record amounts of cash, and \nfarm prices may be at record levels. But we are still lectured that \nwithout cheap labor from south of the border, businesses simply cannot \nprofit.\n  Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights who \nhas dealt with these issues for years and has had hearings on and tried \nto analyze the meaning and impact of these immigration flows, wrote \nthis:\n\n       Recent history shows that a grant of legal status to \n     illegal immigrants results in a further influx of illegal \n     immigrants who will crowd out low-skilled workers from the \n     workforce. . . . Before the federal government grants legal \n     status to illegal immigrants, serious deliberations must be \n     given to the effect such grant will have on the employment \n     and earnings prospects of low-skilled Americans. History \n     shows that granting such legal status is not without profound \n     and substantial costs to American workers. Does Congress \n     care?\n\n  Thomas Sowell, the great African-American writer, says this:\n\n       ``Jobs that Americans will not do'' are in fact jobs at \n     which not enough Americans will work at the current wage rate \n     that some employers are offering. This is not an uncommon \n     situation. That is why labor ``shortages'' lead to higher \n     wage rates. . . . Virtually every kind of work Americans will \n     not do is, in fact, work that Americans have done for \n     generations.\n\n  Look, salaries do make a difference.\n  David Frum:\n\n       The United States is entering its sixth year of \n     extraordinarily high unemployment. Twelve million Americans \n     who want work cannot find it. Millions more have quit \n     searching. Slack labor markets have depressed wages \n     throughout the economy. . . . Yet however little workers \n     earn, there is always somebody who wishes they earned less. \n     And for those somebodies, the solution is: Import more cheap \n     labor. But not just any cheap labor--cheap labor that cannot \n     quit, that cannot accept a better offer, that cannot \n     complain.\n\n  There is too much truth in that. I am concerned about it and I think \nAmericans should be concerned about it. This is a bill that is \nantiworker.\n  President Obama has said recently that Republicans want to accelerate \nthe gap, the wealth gap between the rich and the poor. That is not so. \nBut his own White House has been the central entity driving--behind the \nscenes as much as they possibly can be because they do not want their \nfingerprints on it or they do not want it to be identified with the \nWhite House--but they have been the central entity pushing the bill. It \nwill have a direct impact on the wages and employment status of \nmillions of Americans, particularly low-income Americans who are the \nones who had their wages decline the most.\n  Professor Borjas, at Harvard, himself a refugee, is the leading \nexpert on wages. It has been documented. We have had a significant \ndecline in wages over the last 30 years and a significant portion of \nthat decline is directly related to the large flow of immigrant labor \ninto America.\n  Of course, it has been accelerated by the illegality that is \noccurring in our country. I think we could sustain something like the \ncurrent legal flow, but we need to end the present illegality, and we \nshould not pass legislation that doubles the number that will be coming \nin.\n  Polls show overwhelmingly that the American people do not support a \nlarge increase in guest workers or low-skilled immigration. For \ninstance, by a 3-to-1 margin, Americans earning under $30,000 support a \ndecrease in legal immigration, not an increase, not a doubling of it. I \nam sure most do not have any idea that Congress is about to pass a law \nthat would double the amount.\n  But the one group that has not been represented in this conversation \nhas been the hard-working people of this country. All Americans, \nimmigrants, millions who have come to our country, and the native-born \nalike will be hurt by an immigration plan that is guaranteed to reduce \nwages and permits even more lawlessness in the future.\n  What makes America unique is the special reverence we place in the \nrule of law and the special faith we place in the everyday citizen. \nLet's stay fast to those principles. Let's stand firm for those \nprinciples.\n  Let me say one more time: The heart of the American people on the \nquestion of immigration is good and decent. They have been misportrayed \nas opposing all immigration and that is not so. But they are concerned \nabout the lawlessness. They believe a great nation, their nation, \nshould have a lawful system of immigration and people ought not, by the \nmillions, violate those laws. Congress and the Presidents have failed \nto respond to their legitimate requests, year after year, decade after \ndecade.\n  It is time for that to end. We need a lawful system of immigration \nthat serves our national interests that we can be proud of, that allows \na number of people to come to this country, as many as we can. But we \nhave to know they have a chance to get a good job, their children will \nhave a chance to get a good job, and we are not displacing American \nworkers who need jobs and a bit higher wage instead of a falling wage.\n  That is what this country ought to be about. It was not part of the \nbill that passed this Senate that is now waiting to go to the House. \nThe House needs to be very careful when they move forward, if they move \nforward, with any legislation, that they do not go to a secret \nconference committee and include all kinds of provisions driven by the \nAFL-CIO and by the chamber of commerce and by La Raza and by Democratic \npoliticians who wanted votes. They have to be sure that is not who is \nwriting this bill because that is who has been writing it so far. It \nought not to happen.\n  The openness with which the advocates of this bill have discussed \nwhat they are trying to do is rather remarkable. I hope it is a signal \nto our House Members to be alert, to do the right thing as they go \nforward in trying to move a bill that ends the illegality, that \nidentifies what the right flow of immigrants into America is and \ncreates a system that will actually work in a practical way in the \nfuture and will deal compassionately with people who have been here a \nlong time and who have tried to otherwise be good citizens and do the \nright thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6639-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6639-S6640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EASTSIDE FORESTRY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a success story \nthat is unfolding in Oregon just this week. It is a success story about \nforestry, economic development, and collaboration. It is a success \nstory about real jobs guaranteed today and into the future at a time \nwhen many rural communities are struggling.\n  In December 2009, I brought together representatives of the timber \nindustry and conservationists, two groups that had been at odds with \neach other for years over Federal timber policy. These two factions \nreached an historic agreement that was referred to as ``the end of the \ntimber wars.'' While this agreement never became law, the Forest \nService embraced portions of it and helped pave the way for the 10-year \nstewardship contract on the Malheur National Forest, valued at $69 \nmillion, that was just awarded to a consortium of local companies.\n  This contract will be a major step in creating a healthier, more \nfire-resistant forest while providing millions of board feet of timber \nto a local mill; in other words, jobs in the woods and jobs in the \nmills. After that contract was announced, Ochoco Lumber, owners of the \nlast remaining mill in Grant County, immediately announced that it will \ninvest $2 million to $4 million in its plant. Ochoco Lumber's forward-\nthinking owner, John Shelk, has consistently sought to innovate and use \ntechnology to keep up with the changing timber landscape.\n  In partnership with Iron Triangle, another local timber company, \nOchoco is poised to stay in the timber business, and keep those \npaychecks coming, for years to come.\n  These investments in healthy forests and innovative mills are having \nimpacts throughout Grant County. Another partner in the consortium has \nannounced that they have purchased an historic hotel in order to make \nsure that there is housing for the influx of workers that everyone \nknows are going to be coming.\n  This is economic development and job creation at the speed of light \nwhen\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\nyou consider the disproportionate suffering the rural communities felt \nduring this recession.\n  It is because of stories like this that I introduced the Eastside \nbill this Congress, which just had a hearing at the end of July. The \nnew bill includes some modifications from a previous bill to reflect \nthe progress on the ground.\n  A healthy forest means a healthy economy and my legislation will \nprovide the certainty to advance the vision laid out in the agreement. \nAdvancing this legislation will mean more jobs, more harvested trees, \nand healthier forests.\n  So I stand today to congratulate Ochoco Lumber and Iron Triangle and \nto thank the U.S. Forest Service. They are the partners that \ncontributed to this this success. My hope is that we can make this kind \nof success the norm for all rural communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6640-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY DIETRICH\n\n  Ms COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \ndistinguished public service of my chief of staff, Mary Dietrich, who \nwill be retiring from the Senate after more than 26 years of public \nservice. Mary's departure is not only a great loss to my office but \nalso a loss to this Chamber and the many Senators and Congressional \nstaff with whom she has worked throughout her years of dedicated \nservice.\n  Mary is not someone who seeks the spotlight, but there is no question \nthat she truly has made a difference. Day in and day out she has \ndemonstrated her commitment to public service. Mary is always willing \nto accept a challenge head on: The greater the challenge that confronts \nher, the greater her tenacity and resolve become. In addition, her \nunparalleled understanding of the Senate is indicative of the deep \nappreciation and respect she has for this Chamber.\n  Her skills and talents have benefitted many Mainers as well. Mary \nworked with me on my successful effort to allow the heaviest trucks to \ndrive on Federal highways in Maine. Previously, the heaviest trucks in \nMaine were diverted onto secondary roadways that ran through our \ncrowded downtowns, past schools and homes, and over busy narrow \nstreets. Because of this change in the law, both drivers and \npedestrians in Maine are safer.\n  Mary also led my team to success in my efforts to require that all \nfresh fruits and vegetables, including fresh white potatoes, be allowed \nas part of the healthy lunches that are fed to our Nation's children in \nschool cafeterias.\n  Prior to joining my staff, Mary already had an exceptional career in \npublic service. Upon graduation from Miami University in Oxford, OH, \nMary went to work for the U.S. General Accounting Office. At GAO, Mary \nmanaged numerous and extensive reviews, investigations, and audits of a \nwide range of government programs. It was at GAO that Mary developed a \nfierce reputation for rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, \nthis is what brought her to the U.S. Senate. After 10 years at GAO, \nMary was detailed to work for former Senator Richard Lugar on the \nSenate Agriculture Committee. Mary was so well respected in this \nposition that by the end of her detail, she had two full committee \nchairmen asking her to join their staffs.\n  In the end, Mary joined the staff of former Senator Ted Stevens on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. While on the Appropriations \nCommittee staff, Mary was known for her superior work and ability to \nhandle complex and challenging matters. These talents enabled her to \nadvance to very senior positions. In this role, she served as a liaison \nto a number of Senators past and present including Senators Arlen \nSpecter, Mike DeWine, Sam Brownback, Thad Cochran, and myself. I was \nfortunate to have Mary serve as the minority clerk on the Financial \nServices and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee when I \npreviously served as ranking member.\n  Similar to her accomplishments while serving as my chief of staff, \nMary's accomplishments on the Appropriations Committee are too numerous \nto list in their entirety. Among them, however, include her work to \nincrease funding to improve education for District of Columbia public \nschool students, and a doubling of funding over a 5-year period for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Those who know Mary well know that one of her favorite actresses is \nJulie Andrews. Julie Andrews once said, ``Sometimes opportunities float \nright past your nose. Work hard, apply yourself and be ready. When an \nopportunity comes, you can grab it.'' When the chief of staff position \nbecame available in my office, asking Mary to lead my office was an \nobvious decision. There was no need for Mary to grab this opportunity. \nI could not think of a better person for the job. That was nearly 4 \nyears ago, and I could not have asked for a more-trusted advisor.\n  Mary Dietrich has been the engine that keeps my staff moving. She has \nguided my staff with the same tact, wicked sense of humor, and sharp \nmind that defined all her years of public service. Her retirement from \nthe Senate is a true loss, and she will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6640-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n\n                      Major Louis Fulda Guillermin\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the military service \nof a Pennsylvania constituent who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our \nNation during the Vietnam War. Tomorrow, September 20, is National POW/\nMIA Recognition Day, so it is only fitting that I tell his story. After \na 45-year absence, Maj. Louis Fulda Guillermin, U.S. Air Force, is \nfinally returning home to Pennsylvania.\n  Louis Guillermin, the only child of the late Wister and Myrtle Booker \nGuillermin, was born on January 6, 1943, in West Chester, PA. Louis \njoined the Air Force after college and completed his pilot training at \nLackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. In addition, he received \nfurther training in radar and celestial navigation instruction at \nConnelly Air Force Base. Louis was commissioned as a second lieutenant \nand awarded his silver wings in April 1964.\n  During his second tour in South East Asia, Major Guillermin flew \ncounterinsurgency missions as a navigator in an A-26A Invader aircraft \nfor the 609th Air Commando Squadron. On April 28, 1968, at the age of \n25, Major Guillermin's aircraft went down over Savannakhet Province, \nLaos. Louis would remain missing for many years and would achieve the \nrank of major while on missing-in-action status. Many years later, his \naircraft was located, and on May 28, 2013, the Department of Defense \npositively identified his remains thanks to the efforts of the Joint \nPrisoners of War, Missing in Action Accounting Command.\n  Despite having been missing for all these years, Maj. Louis F. \nGuillermin was never forgotten. The Vietnam Veterans of America, \nChapter 436, of Chester County, PA, adopted his name for their chapter. \nNow, Louis will be laid to rest on October 5, and on behalf of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation, I would like to welcome \nhim home.\n  I share the story of Major Guillermin not only because the formal \nrecognition of his sacrifice is long overdue, but also as a reminder \nthat there are many others that remain missing. An estimated 1,644 \nmembers of the Armed Forces remain unaccounted for from the Vietnam \nWar. A total of 91 of those are from Pennsylvania. I would also like to \nmention that there are an estimated 83,000 total unaccounted for \nmembers of the Armed Forces since World War II. We as a nation have a \nresponsibility to make every effort in accounting for the missing and \nproviding this information to the loved ones and the communities who \nhave experienced such a profound loss. May Major Guillermin, and all \nmissing-in-action servicemembers who have passed on from this world, \nrest in eternal peace. You have more than earned your dignity and \nhonor, as well as our reverence. You are not forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6640-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6640-S6641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DONATOS PIZZERIA\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of Donatos Pizzeria, LLC, headquartered in Columbus, OH. In \n1963, Jim Grote, then a college sophomore at The Ohio State University, \nopened the first Donatos Pizzeria on the south side of Columbus. Since \nthen, Donatos Pizzeria has expanded to 200\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\nrestaurants in multiple States, and has employed generations of \nOhioans.\n  Mr. Grote founded his business on three fundamentals: creating a \nsuperior product, hiring great people, and adhering to strong \nprinciples that promote goodwill in business and the community. These \nprinciples have made Donatos Pizzeria one of the most well respected \npizza chains in the industry, and in the community. As part of its \nservice to its communities, Donatos Pizzeria provides the opportunity \nfor schools, churches, sports teams, and other social organizations to \nfundraise by purchasing its discounted pizza card, which can be sold to \nreceive a 70% return toward their organization.\n  I extend my sincere congratulations to Donatos Pizzeria on 50 years \nof quality service throughout Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6641-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   TRIBUTE TO JAMES E.

Mr. President, I wish to support three Illinois \ncitizens from East St. Louis who have made a lasting impact on their \ncommunity. These leaders are the late James E. Williams, Sr., the first \nAfrican-American mayor of the City of East St. Louis, his wife Lillian \nCroom Williams and Milton Wharton, a retired circuit court judge of the \n20th Judicial Circuit of Illinois. It is my pleasure to honor their \nservice and highlight their commitment to the city.\n  Besides his service as mayor, Mr. Williams also served as the school \nboard president of District 189. He was well known for his \naccessibility and commitment to public service.\n  Mrs. Williams joined her husband in public service as both an \neducator and civic leader. Her advocacy for higher education and \nsupport for local police, firefighters and teachers are among her \nlasting contributions to the area.\n  Judge Wharton earned his law degree from DePaul University in 1975, \nand was appointed an associate judge for the St. Clair County Circuit \nCourt in 1976. Twelve years later, he was elected as a full circuit \njudge for the 20th Judicial Circuit. He has received numerous awards \nand accolades and is an active Southern Illinois University \nEdwardsville alumni member.\n  These individuals will be honored this month by the Emma L. Wilson-\nKing Foundation, which provides scholarships and other resources to \nlocal students. I join with the foundation in honoring Mr. and Mrs. \nWilliams, Judge Wharton and their families for their important public \nservice contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6641-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6641-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/19/senate-section/article/S6641-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 301.

A bill to establish a national mercury monitoring program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today along with Senator Carper, I am \nintroducing the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act. This \nbill would ensure that we have accurate information about the extent of \nmercury pollution in our Nation.\n  A comprehensive national mercury monitoring network is needed to \nprotect human health, safeguard fisheries, and track the effect of \nemissions reductions in the U.S. This tracking is particularly \nimportant in light of increasing mercury emissions from other \ncountries. By accurately quantifying regional and national changes in \natmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and bioaccumulation of \nmercury in fish and wildlife in response to changes in mercury \nemissions, a monitoring network would help policy makers, scientists, \nand the public to better understand the sources, consequences, and \ntrends in United States mercury pollution.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant ecological and public \nhealth concern, especially for children and pregnant women. It is \nestimated that approximately 410,000 children born in the U.S. were \nexposed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high enough to impair \nneurological development. Mercury exposure has gone down as U.S. \nmercury emissions have declined; however, levels remain unacceptably \nhigh.\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\n  Each new scientific study seems to find higher levels of mercury in \nmore ecosystems and in more species, and the issue of mercury emissions \nis growing in importance around the world. At present, scientists must \nrely on limited information to understand the critical linkages between \nmercury emissions and environmental response and human health. \nSuccessful design, implementation, and assessment of solutions to the \nmercury pollution problem require comprehensive long-term information. \nA system for collecting such information, such as we have for acid rain \nand other pollution, does not currently exist for mercury--a much more \ntoxic pollutant. We must have more comprehensive information and we \nmust have it soon; otherwise, we risk making misguided policy \ndecisions.\n  Specifically, the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act would \ndirect EPA, in conjunction with the Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. \nGeological Survey, National Park Service, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Association, and other appropriate Federal agencies, to \nestablish a national mercury monitoring program to measure and monitor \nmercury levels in the air and watersheds, water and soil chemistry, and \nin marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organisms at multiple sites \nacross the Nation.\n  The act would establish a scientific advisory committee to advise on \nthe establishment, site selection, measurement, recording protocols, \nand operations of the monitoring program.\n  The act would establish a centralized database for existing and newly \ncollected environmental mercury data that can be freely accessed on the \nInternet and that is compatible with similar international efforts.\n  The act would require a report to Congress every 2 years on the \nprogram, including trend data, and an assessment of the reduction in \nmercury deposition rates that need to be achieved in order to prevent \nadverse human and ecological effects every 4 years; and\n  The act would authorize $95 million over 3 years to carry out the \nact.\n  We must establish a comprehensive, robust national mercury monitoring \nnetwork to provide the data needed to help make decisions that can \nprotect the people and environment of Maine and the entire Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Begich, and Mrs. \n        Shaheen):\n  S. 1533. A bill to end offshore tax abuses, to preserve our national \ndefense and protect American families and businesses from devastating \ncuts , and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Whitehouse, Begich and Shaheen, the Stop Tax Haven \nAbuse Act, legislation that is geared to stop the estimated $150 \nbillion yearly drain on the U.S. treasury caused by offshore tax \nabuses. Offshore tax abuses are not only undermining public confidence \nin our tax system, but widening the deficit and increasing the tax \nburden for the rest of American families and businesses.\n  This bill eliminates incentives to send U.S. profits and jobs \noffshore, combats offshore tax abuses, and raises revenues needed to \nfund our national security and essential domestic programs. Its \nprovisions could be part of an alternative deficit reduction package to \nsubstitute for sequestration this year, but should be adopted in any \nevent because the loopholes we would close serve no economic purpose \nand shouldn't exist even if there were no deficit.\n  We should close these loopholes on principle. They are blatantly \nunfair, and we should end them, regardless of our deficit, regardless \nof whether sequestration is in effect. But surely, at a time when \nsequestration is harming families, national security, life-saving \nresearch, students and seniors, we should close these loopholes and \ndedicate the revenue to ending sequestration.\n  The bill is supported by a wide array of small business, labor and \npublic interest groups, including the Financial Accountability and \nCorporate Transparency, FACT, Coalition, Americans for Tax Fairness, \nTax Justice Network-USA, Citizens for Tax Justice, AFL-CIO, SEIU, \nAmerican Sustainable Business Council, Business for Shared Prosperity, \nSouth Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, Friends of the \nEarth, New Rules for Global Finance, U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup, Global Financial Integrity, Jubilee USA Network, and Public \nCitizen.\n  Frank Knapp, president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business \nChamber of Commerce, has explained small business support for the bill \nthis way:\n\n       Small businesses are the lifeblood of local economies. We \n     pay our fair share of taxes and generate most of the new \n     jobs. Why should we be subsidizing U.S. multinationals that \n     use offshore tax havens to avoid paying taxes? Big \n     corporations benefit immensely from all the advantages of \n     being headquartered in our country. It's time to end tax \n     haven abuse and level the playing field.\n\n  The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act is a product of the investigative work \nof the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations which I chair. For more \nthan 12 years, the Subcommittee has conducted inquiries into offshore \ntax avoidance abuses, including the use of offshore corporations and \ntrusts to hide assets and shift income abroad, the use of tax haven \nbanks to set up secret accounts, and the use of U.S. bankers, lawyers, \naccountants and other professionals to devise methods of taking \nadvantage of tax loopholes that Congress never intended. Over the \nyears, my Subcommittee has learned a lot about these offshore tricks, \nand we have designed this bill to fight back by closing many of these \ntax loopholes and strengthening offshore tax enforcement.\n  The 113th Congress is the sixth Congress in which I have introduced a \ncomprehensive bill to combat offshore and tax shelter abuses. A number \nof provisions from past bills have made it into law, such as measures \nto curb abusive foreign trusts, close offshore dividend tax loopholes, \nand strengthen penalties on tax shelter promoters.\n  In recent years, Congress has made a little progress in the offshore \ntax battle. In 2010, we enacted into law the economic substance \ndoctrine, which up to then had been a judicially created policy. The \nlaw now authorizes courts to strike down phony business deals with no \neconomic purpose other than to avoid the payment of tax. Getting the \neconomic substance doctrine enacted was a victory many years in the \nmaking.\n  Also in 2010, Congress enacted the Baucus-Rangel Foreign Account Tax \nCompliance Act or FATCA, which is designed to flush out hidden offshore \nbank accounts. Foreign banks have engaged in a massive lobbying effort \nto weaken its disclosure requirements, but most U.S. banks have had it \nwith foreign banks using secrecy to attract U.S. clients and want those \nforeign banks to have to meet the same disclosure requirements U.S. \nbanks do. Starting next year, foreign financial institutions will have \nto agree to comply with FATCA's disclosure requirements, which include \ndisclosing to the IRS all accounts held by U.S. persons, or else begin \nincurring a 30 percent withholding tax on all investment income \nreceived from the United States.\n  President Obama, who when in the Senate cosponsored the 2005 and 2007 \nversions of this bill we're introducing today, is a longtime opponent \nof offshore tax evasion. And just weeks ago, the G-20 leaders declared \ninternational tax avoidance by multinational corporations to be a \nglobal concern, and pledged to work cooperatively to end abuses.\n  The bottom line is that each of us has a legal and civil obligation \nto pay taxes, and most Americans fulfill that obligation. It is time to \nforce the tax scofflaws, the tax dodgers, and the tax avoiders to do \nthe same, and for us to take the steps needed to end their use of \noffshore tax havens. It is also time to recapture those unpaid taxes to \npay for critical government services, including strengthening our \neducation, health care, and defense to help replace the absurd \nsequestration approach with an alternative balanced deficit reduction \npackage that includes revenues as one component.\n  The bill we are introducing today is a stronger, more streamlined \nversion of the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act introduced in the last \nCongress. This enhanced version includes key provisions from the last \nbill that have not yet been enacted into law, several provisions \nimplementing the President's budget recommendations, and new provisions \nto stop the offshore tax haven\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nabuses featured in hearings held and bipartisan reports filed during \nthe last Congress by my Subcommittee.\n  The provisions retained from the prior version of the bill include, \nwith some clarifying or strengthening language, special measures to \ndeal with foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions that \nsignificantly impede U.S. tax enforcement. They include tougher \ndisclosure, evidentiary and enforcement provisions for accounts at \nforeign financial institutions that do not comply with FATCA; and the \ntreatment of offshore corporations as domestic corporations for tax \npurposes when managed and controlled primarily from the United States. \nThey also include stronger disclosure requirements for offshore \naccounts and offshore entities opening U.S. financial accounts, and \nclosure of a tax loophole benefiting financial swaps that send money \noffshore. In addition, they mandate new disclosure requirements to stop \nmultinational corporate tax evasion by requiring publicly traded \ncorporations to disclose basic information about their employees, \nrevenues and tax payments on a country-by-country basis.\n  The new provisions in this bill would eliminate tax provisions \nencouraging the offshoring of jobs and profits by deferring corporate \ntax deductions for expenses associated with moving and operating \noffshore unless and until the corporation repatriates the offshore \nprofits produced by those operations and pays taxes on them. Another \nset of new provisions would end transfer pricing abuses by immediately \ntaxing any excess income received by foreign affiliates to which U.S. \nintellectual property rights have been transferred, and limiting income \nshifting through U.S. property transfers offshore. Other new provisions \nwould require foreign tax credits to be calculated on a pooled basis to \nstop the manipulation of those tax credits to dodge U.S. taxes. Still \nanother new bill provision would end tax gimmicks involving the use of \nthe so-called ``check-the-box'' and ``CFC look-through'' rules for \noffshore entities. Finally, a new bill provision would close the short-\nterm loan loophole used by some corporations to avoid paying taxes on \noffshore income that is effectively repatriated.\n  Let me now go through each of the bill sections to explain the tax \nabuses they address and how they would work.\n\n\n        Title I--Deterring the Use of Tax Havens for Tax Evasion\n\n  The first title of the bill concentrates on combating tax havens and \ntheir financial institutions around the world that assist U.S. \ntaxpayers in hiding their assets, avoiding U.S. tax enforcement \nefforts, and dodging U.S. taxes. It focuses on strengthening tools to \nstop tax haven jurisdictions and tax haven banks from facilitating U.S. \ntax evasion, to expose hidden offshore assets, and to eliminate \nincentives for U.S. persons to send funds offshore.\n\n\n  Section 101--Special Measures Where U.S. Tax Enforcement Is Impeded\n\n  The first section of the bill, Section 101, which is carried over \nfrom the last Congress and which passed the Senate in 2012 as part of \nanother bill but did not make it through conference, would allow the \nTreasury Secretary to apply an array of sanctions against any foreign \njurisdiction or foreign financial institution that the Secretary \ndetermined was significantly impeding U.S. tax enforcement.\n  We have all seen the press reports about tax haven banks that have \ndeliberately helped U.S. clients evade U.S. taxes. In 2008, UBS, \nSwitzerland's largest bank, admitted doing just that, paid a $780 \nmillion fine, and promised to stop opening accounts for U.S. persons \nwithout reporting them to the IRS. Earlier this year, Switzerland's \noldest bank, Wegelin & Co., pleaded guilty to conspiring with U.S. \ntaxpayers to hide more than $1.2 billion in secret Swiss bank accounts \nand closed its doors. These are just a few examples of how some foreign \nbanks knowingly impede U.S. tax enforcement efforts, and why the United \nStates needs to be better armed with the tools needed to deal with \nthem.\n  This bill section also has added significance now that Congress has \nenacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCA requiring \nforeign financial institutions with U.S. investments to disclose all \naccounts opened by U.S. persons or pay a hefty withholding tax on all \nof the U.S. investment income they receive. FATCA has begun to go into \neffect, but some foreign financial institutions are saying that they \nwill refuse to adopt FATCA's approach and will instead stop holding any \nU.S. investments. While that is their right, the question being raised \nby some foreign banks planning to comply with FATCA is what happens to \nthe non-FATCA institutions that take on U.S. clients and don't report \nthe accounts to the United States. Right now, the U.S. government has \nlimited ways to take effective action against foreign financial \ninstitutions that open secret accounts for U.S. tax evaders. Section \n101 of our bill would change that by providing a powerful new tool to \ndeter and stop non-FATCA-compliant institutions from facilitating U.S. \ntax evasion.\n  Section 101 is designed to build upon existing Treasury authority to \ntake action against foreign financial institutions that engage in money \nlaundering by extending that same authority to the tax area. In 2001, \nthe Patriot Act gave Treasury the authority under 31 U.S.C. 5318A to \nrequire domestic financial institutions and agencies to take special \nmeasures with respect to foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions \nor transactions found to be of ``primary money laundering concern.'' \nOnce Treasury designates a foreign jurisdiction or financial \ninstitution to be of primary money laundering concern, Section 5318A \nallows Treasury to impose a range of requirements on U.S. financial \ninstitutions in their dealings with the designated entity--all the way \nfrom requiring U.S. financial institutions, for example, to provide \ngreater information than normal about transactions involving the \ndesignated entity to prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from \nopening accounts for that foreign entity.\n  This Patriot Act authority has been used sparingly, but to telling \neffect. In some instances Treasury has employed special measures \nagainst an entire country, such as Burma, to stop its financial \ninstitutions from laundering funds through the U.S. financial system. \nMore often, Treasury has used the authority narrowly against a single \nproblem financial institution, such as a bank in Syria, to stop \nlaundered funds from entering the United States. The provision has \nclearly succeeded in giving Treasury a powerful tool to protect the \nU.S. financial system from money laundering abuses.\n  The bill would authorize Treasury to use that same tool against \nforeign jurisdictions or financial institutions found by Treasury to be \n``significantly impeding U.S. tax enforcement.'' Treasury could, for \nexample, require U.S. financial institutions that have correspondent \naccounts for a designated foreign bank to produce information on all \ntransactions by that foreign bank executed through a U.S. correspondent \nbank. Alternatively, Treasury could prohibit U.S. financial \ninstitutions from opening accounts for a designated foreign bank, \nthereby cutting off that foreign bank's access to the U.S. financial \nsystem. Those types of sanctions could be as effective in ending tax \nhaven abuses as they have been in curbing money laundering.\n  In addition to extending Treasury's ability to impose special \nmeasures against foreign jurisdictions or financial institutions \nimpeding U.S. tax enforcement, the bill would add a new measure to the \nlist of possible sanctions that could be applied: it would allow \nTreasury to instruct U.S. financial institutions not to authorize or \naccept credit or debit card transactions involving a designated foreign \njurisdiction or financial institution. Denying tax haven banks the \nability to issue credit or debit cards for use in the United States, \nfor example, offers an effective new way to stop U.S. tax avoiders from \nobtaining access to funds hidden offshore.\n  This provision is estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to \nraise $880 million over ten years. It was passed by the Senate last \nyear as an amendment to help pay for the transportation bill, but, \nultimately, did not make it into law. This non-controversial, \ncompletely discretionary power aimed at foreign facilitators of U.S. \ntax evasion should be enacted into law without further delay.\n\n\n                    Section 102--Strengthening FATCA\n\n  Section 102 of the bill is a new section that seeks to clarify, build \nupon,\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nand strengthen the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, to \nflush out hidden foreign accounts and assets used by U.S. taxpayers to \nevade paying U.S. taxes. The law is currently designed to become \neffective in stages, beginning in 2013, and will eventually require \ndisclosure of accounts held by U.S. persons at foreign banks, broker-\ndealers, investment advisers, hedge funds, private equity funds and \nother financial firms.\n  Some foreign financial institutions are likely to choose to forego \nmaintaining accounts for U.S. persons rather than comply with FATCA's \ndisclosure rules. If some foreign financial institutions decide not to \nparticipate in the FATCA system, that's their business. But if U.S. \ntaxpayers start using those same foreign financial institutions to hide \nassets and evade U.S. taxes to the tune of $100 billion per year, \nthat's our business. The United States has a right to enforce our tax \nlaws and to expect that financial institutions will not assist U.S. tax \ncheats.\n  Section 101 of the bill would provide U.S. authorities with the means \nto take direct action against foreign financial institutions that \ndecide to operate outside of the FATCA system and allow U.S. clients to \nopen hidden accounts. If the U.S. Treasury determines that such a \nforeign financial institution is significantly impeding U.S. tax \nenforcement, Section 101 would give U.S. authorities a menu of special \nmeasures that could be taken in response, including prohibiting U.S. \nbanks from doing business with that institution.\n  Section 102, in contrast, does not seek to take action against a non-\nFATCA institution, but instead seeks to strengthen U.S. tax enforcement \ntools with respect to U.S. persons opening accounts at those \ninstitutions. Section 102 would also help clarify when foreign \nfinancial institutions are obligated to disclose certain accounts to \nthe United States under FATCA.\n  Background. In 2006, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nreleased a report with six case histories detailing how U.S. taxpayers \nwere using offshore tax havens to avoid payment of the taxes they owed. \nThese case histories examined an internet-based company that helped \npersons obtain offshore entities and accounts; U.S. promoters that \ndesigned complex offshore structures to hide client assets and even \nproviding clients with a how-to manual for going offshore. They also \nexamined U.S. taxpayers who diverted business income offshore through \nphony loans and invoices; a one-time tax dodge that deducted phantom \noffshore stock losses from real U.S. stock income to shelter that \nincome from U.S. taxes; and a 13-year offshore network of 58 offshore \ntrusts and corporations built by American brothers Sam and Charles \nWyly. Each of these case histories presented the same fact pattern in \nwhich the U.S. taxpayer, through lawyers, banks, or other \nrepresentatives, set up offshore trusts, corporations, or other \nentities which had all the trappings of independence but, in fact, were \ncontrolled by the U.S. taxpayer whose directives were implemented by \ncompliant offshore personnel acting as the trustees, officers, \ndirectors, or nominee owners of the offshore entities.\n  In the case of the Wylys, the brothers and their representatives \ncommunicated Wyly directives to a so-called trust protector who then \nrelayed the directives to the offshore trustees and corporate officers. \nIn the 13 years examined by the Subcommittee, the offshore trustees and \ncorporate officers never once rejected a Wyly request and never once \ninitiated an action without Wyly approval. They simply did what they \nwere told, and directed the so-called independent offshore trusts and \ncorporations to do what the Wylys wanted. A U.S. taxpayer in another \ncase history told the Subcommittee that the offshore personnel who \nnominally owned and controlled his offshore entities, in fact, always \nfollowed his directions, describing himself as the ``puppet master'' in \ncharge of his offshore holdings.\n  When the Subcommittee discussed these case histories with financial \nadministrators from the Isle of Man, the regulators explained that none \nof the offshore personnel were engaged in any wrongdoing, because their \nlaws permit foreign clients to transmit detailed, daily instructions to \noffshore service providers on how to handle offshore assets, so long as \nit is the offshore trustee or corporate officer who gives the final \norder to buy or sell the assets. They explained that, under their law, \nan offshore entity is considered legally independent from the person \ndirecting its activities so long as that person follows the form of \ntransmitting ``requests'' to the offshore personnel who retain the \nformal right to make the decisions, even though the offshore personnel \nalways do as they are asked.\n  The Subcommittee case histories illustrate what the tax literature \nand law enforcement experience have shown for years: that the business \nmodel followed in offshore secrecy jurisdictions is for compliant \ntrustees, corporate administrators, and financial institutions to \nprovide a veneer of independence while ensuring that their U.S. clients \nretain complete and unfettered control over ``their'' offshore assets. \nThat's the standard operating procedure offshore. Offshore service \nproviders pretend to own or control the offshore trusts, corporations \nand accounts they help establish, but what they really do is whatever \ntheir clients tell them to do.\n  Rebuttable Evidentiary Presumptions. The reality behind these \noffshore practices makes a mockery of U.S. laws that normally view \ntrusts and corporations as independent actors. They invite tax \navoidance and tax evasion. To combat these abusive offshore practices, \nSection 102(g) of the bill would implement a bipartisan recommendation \nin the Levin-Coleman 2006 report by establishing several rebuttable \nevidentiary presumptions that would presume a U.S. taxpayer controls \noffshore entities that they create, finance, or from which they \nbenefit, unless the U.S. taxpayer presents clear and convincing \nevidence to the contrary.\n  The presumptions would apply only in civil judicial or administrative \ntax or securities enforcement proceedings examining offshore entities \nor transactions. They would place the burden of producing evidence from \noffshore jurisdiction on the taxpayer who chose to open an offshore \naccount at a non-FATCA compliant financial institution and who has \naccess to the information, rather than placing the burden on the \nfederal government that has little practical ability to get the \ninformation.\n  Section 102(g)(1) would establish three evidentiary presumptions in \ncivil tax enforcement efforts. First is a presumption that a U.S. \ntaxpayer who ``formed, transferred assets to, was a beneficiary of, had \na beneficial interest in, or received money or property or the use \nthereof'' from an offshore entity, such as a trust or corporation, \ncontrols that entity. Second is a presumption that funds or other \nproperty received from offshore are taxable income, and that funds or \nother property transferred offshore have not yet been taxed. Third is a \npresumption that a financial account controlled by a U.S. taxpayer in a \nforeign country contains enough money--$10,000--to trigger an existing \nstatutory reporting threshold and allow the IRS to assert the minimum \npenalty for nondisclosure of the account by the taxpayer.\n  Section 102(g)(2) would establish two evidentiary presumptions \napplicable to civil proceedings to enforce U.S. securities laws. The \nfirst would specify that if a director, officer, or major shareholder \nof a U.S. publicly-traded corporation creates, finances, or benefits \nfrom an offshore entity, that U.S. corporation would be presumed to \ncontrol that offshore entity. The second presumption would provide that \nsecurities nominally owned by an offshore entity are presumed to be \nbeneficially owned by any U.S. person who controlled that offshore \nentity.\n  All of these presumptions are rebuttable, which means that the U.S. \nperson who is the subject of the presumptions could provide clear and \nconvincing evidence to show that the presumptions were factually \ninaccurate. To rebut the presumptions, a taxpayer could establish, for \nexample, that an offshore corporation really was controlled by an \nindependent third party, or that money sent from an offshore account \nreally represented a nontaxable gift instead of taxable income. If the \ntaxpayer wished to introduce evidence from a foreign person, such as an \noffshore banker, corporate officer, or trust administrator, to \nestablish those\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\nfacts, that foreign person would have to appear in the U.S. proceeding \nin a manner that would permit cross examination.\n  The bill also includes several limitations on the presumptions to \nensure their operation is fair and reasonable. First, criminal cases \nwould not be affected by this bill, which would apply only to civil \nproceedings. Second, the presumptions would come into play only if the \nIRS or SEC were to challenge a matter in an enforcement proceeding. \nThird, the bill recognizes that certain classes of offshore \ntransactions, such as corporate reorganizations, may not present a \npotential for abuse and accordingly authorizes Treasury and the SEC to \nissue regulations or guidance identifying such classes of transactions \nto which the presumptions would not apply.\n  An even more fundamental limitation on the presumptions is that they \nwould apply only to U.S. persons who directly or through an offshore \nentity choose to do business with a ``nonFATCA institution,'' meaning a \nforeign financial institution that has not adopted the FATCA disclosure \nrequirements and instead takes advantage of banking, corporate, and tax \nsecrecy laws and practices that make it very difficult for U.S. tax \nauthorities to detect financial accounts benefiting U.S. persons.\n  FATCA's disclosure requirements were designed to combat offshore \nsecrecy and flush out hidden accounts being used by U.S. persons to \nevade U.S. taxes. Section 102(g) would continue the fight by allowing \nfederal authorities to benefit from rebuttable presumptions regarding \nthe control, ownership and assets of offshore entities that open \naccounts at financial institutions outside the FATCA disclosure system. \nThese presumptions would allow U.S. law enforcement to establish what \nwe all know from experience is normally the case in an offshore \njurisdiction: that a U.S. person who creates, finances, or benefits \nfrom an offshore entity controls that entity; that money and property \nsent to or from an offshore entity involves taxable income; and that an \noffshore account that has not been disclosed to U.S. authorities should \nbecome subject to inspection. U.S. law enforcement needs to establish \nthose facts presumptively, without having to pierce the secrecy veil, \nbecause of the difficulty of getting access to the relevant \ninformation. At the same time, U.S. persons who chose to transact their \naffairs through accounts at a non-FACTA institution are given the \nopportunity to lift the veil of secrecy and demonstrate that the \npresumptions are factually incorrect. These rebuttable evidentiary \npresumptions would provide U.S. tax and securities law enforcement with \npowerful new tools to end tax haven abuses.\n  FATCA Disclosure Obligations. In addition to establishing \npresumptions, Section 102 would make several changes to clarify and \nstrengthen FATCA's disclosure obligations.\n  Section 102(b) would amend 26 U.S.C. Section 1471 to make it clear \nthat the types of financial accounts that must be disclosed by foreign \nfinancial institutions under FATCA include not just savings, money \nmarket or securities accounts, but also transaction accounts, such as \nchecking accounts, that some banks might claim are not depository \naccounts. This section would also make it clear that financial \ninstitutions may not omit from their disclosures client assets in the \nform of derivatives, including swap agreements.\n  Section 102(c) would amend 26 U.S.C. 1472 to clarify when a \nwithholding agent ``knows or has reason to know'' that an account is \ndirectly or indirectly owned by a U.S. person and must be disclosed to \nthe United States. The bill provision would make it clear that the \nwithholding agent would have to take into account information obtained \nas the result of ``any customer identification, anti-money laundering, \nanti-corruption, or similar obligation to identify accountholders.'' In \nother words, if a foreign bank knows, as a result of due diligence \ninquiries made under its anti-money laundering program, that a non-U.S. \ncorporation was beneficially owned by a U.S. person, the foreign bank \nwould have to report that account to the IRS--it could not treat the \noffshore corporation as a non-U.S. customer. That approach is already \nimplied in the existing statutory language and is part of the \nregulations that have been issued to implement FATCA, but this \namendment would make it crystal clear.\n  Section 102(c) would also amend the law to make it clear that the \nTreasury Secretary, when exercising authority under FATCA to waive \ndisclosure or withholding requirements for non-financial foreign \nentities, can waive those requirements only for a class of entities \nthat the Secretary identifies as ``posing a low risk of tax evasion.'' \nA variety of foreign financial institutions have pressed Treasury to \nissue waivers under Section 1472, and this amendment would make it \nclear that such waivers are possible only when the risk of tax evasion \nis minimal.\n  Section 102(d) would amend 26 U.S.C. 1473 to clarify that the \ndefinition of ``substantial United States owner'' includes U.S. persons \nwho are beneficial owners of corporations or the beneficial owner of an \nentity that is one of the partners in a partnership. While the current \nstatutory language already implies that beneficial owners are included, \nthis amendment would leave no doubt.\n  Section 102(e) would amend 26 U.S.C. 1474 to make two exceptions to \nthe statutory provision which makes account information disclosed to \nthe IRS by foreign financial institutions under FATCA confidential tax \nreturn information. The first exception would allow the IRS to disclose \nthe account information to federal law enforcement agencies, including \nthe SEC and bank regulators, investigating possible violations of U.S. \nlaw. The second would allow the IRS to disclose the name of any foreign \nfinancial institution whose disclosure agreement under FATCA was \nterminated, either by the institution, its government, or the IRS. \nFinancial institutions should not be able to portray themselves as \nFATCA institutions if, in fact, they are not.\n  Section 102(f) would amend 26 U.S.C. 6038D, which creates a new tax \nreturn disclosure obligation for U.S. taxpayers with interests in \n``specified foreign financial assets,'' to clarify that the disclosure \nrequirement applies not only to persons who have a direct or nominal \nownership interest in those foreign financial assets, but also to \npersons who have a beneficial ownership interest in them. While the \nexisting statutory language implies this broad reporting obligation, \nthe amendment would make it clear.\n  Finally, Section 102(a) would amend a new annual tax return \nobligation established in 26 U.S.C. 1298(f) for passive foreign \ninvestment companies (PFICs). PFICs are typically used as holding \ncompanies for foreign assets held by U.S. persons, and the intent of \nthe new Section 1298(f) is to require all PFICs to begin filing annual \ninformational tax returns with the IRS. The current statutory language, \nhowever, limits the disclosure obligation to any U.S. person who is a \n``shareholder'' in a PFIC, and does not cover PFICs whose shares may be \nnominally held by an offshore corporation or trust, but beneficially \nowned by a U.S. person. The bill provision would broaden the PFIC \nreporting requirement to apply to any U.S. person who ``directly or \nindirectly, forms, transfers assets to, is a beneficiary of, has a \nbeneficial interest in, or receives money or property or the use \nthereof'' from a PFIC. That broader formulation of who should file the \nnew PFIC annual tax return would ensure that virtually all PFICs formed \nby, financed by, or benefiting U.S. persons are required to file \ninformational returns with the IRS.\n\n\n Section 103--Corporations Managed and Controlled in the United States\n\n  Section 103 of the bill focuses on corporations which claim foreign \nstatus--often in a tax haven jurisdiction--in order to avoid payment of \nU.S. taxes, but then operate right here in the United States in direct \ncompetition with domestic corporations that are paying their fair \nshare.\n  This offshore game is all too common. In 2008, the Senate Finance \nCommittee held a hearing describing a trip made by GAO to the Cayman \nIslands to look at the infamous Ugland House, a five-story building \nthat is the official address for over 18,800 registered companies. GAO \nfound that about half of the alleged Ugland House tenants--around 9,000 \nentities--had a billing address in the United States and were not \nactual occupants of the building. In fact, GAO determined that none of \nthe companies registered at the Ugland\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\nHouse had office space or actual employees there. GAO found that the \nonly true occupant of the building was a Cayman law firm, Maples and \nCalder.\n  Here's what the GAO wrote:\n\n       Very few Ugland House registered entities have a \n     significant physical presence in the Cayman Islands or carry \n     out business in the Cayman Islands. According to Maples and \n     Calder partners, the persons establishing these entities are \n     typically referred to Maples by counsel from outside the \n     Cayman Islands, fund managers, and investment banks. As of \n     March 2008 the Cayman Islands Registrar reported that 18,857 \n     entities were registered at the Ugland House address. \n     Approximately 96 percent of these entities were classified as \n     exempted entities under Cayman Islands law, and were thus \n     generally prohibited from carrying out domestic business \n     within the Cayman Islands.\n\n  Section 103 of the bill is designed to address the Ugland House \nproblem. It focuses on the situation where a corporation is \nincorporated in a tax haven as a mere shell operation with little or no \nphysical presence or employees in the jurisdiction. The shell entity \npretends it is operating in the tax haven even though its key personnel \nand decisionmakers are in the United States. This set up allows the \nowners of the shell entity to take advantage of all of the benefits \nprovided by U.S. legal, educational, financial and commercial systems \nand at the same time avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  My Subcommittee has seen numerous companies exploit this situation, \ndeclaring themselves to be foreign corporations even though they really \noperate out of the United States. For example, thousands of hedge funds \nwhose managers live and work in the United States play this game to \nescape taxes and avoid regulation. In an October 2008 Subcommittee \nhearing, three sizeable hedge funds, Highbridge Capital which is \nassociated with JPMorgan Chase, Angelo Gordon, and Maverick Capital, \nacknowledged that, although all claimed to be Cayman Island \ncorporations, none had an office or a single full time employee in that \njurisdiction. Instead, their offices and key decisionmakers were \nlocated and did business right here in the United States.\n  According to a Wall Street Journal article, over 20 percent of the \ncorporations that made initial public offerings or IPOs in the United \nStates in 2010, were incorporated in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, but \nalso described themselves to investors as based in another country, \nsuch as the United States. The article also described how Samsonite, a \nDenver-based company, reincorporated in Luxembourg before going public. \nToo many of these tax-haven incorporations appear to have no purpose \nother than having the advantage of operating in the United States while \navoiding U.S. taxation and undercutting U.S. competitors who pay their \ntaxes.\n  Still another illustration of the problem came to light earlier this \nyear, in a Subcommittee hearing which disclosed that Apple, a prominent \nU.S. corporation, had established three wholly-owned subsidiaries in \nIreland that claimed the bulk of Apple's foreign sales income, while \nalso claiming not to be tax resident in any country. All three of \nApple's Irish subsidiaries were run by personnel located primarily in \nthe United States. Under Irish law, because the management of the \ncorporations was not in Ireland, they were not considered tax residents \nof Ireland. Under U.S. law, because the corporations were formed in \nIreland, they were not considered tax residents of the United States. \nThey were neither here nor there, and paid no corporate income taxes \nanywhere.\n  Section 103 would put an end to such corporate fictions and \nunjustified tax avoidance by profitable multinational corporations \nthrough offshore loopholes. It provides that if a corporation is \npublicly traded or has aggregate gross assets of $50 million or more, \nand its management and control occurs primarily in the United States, \nthen that corporation will be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation \nfor income tax purposes.\n  To implement this provision, Treasury is directed to issue \nregulations to guide the determination of when management and control \noccur primarily in the United States, looking at whether \n``substantially all of the executive officers and senior management of \nthe corporation who exercise day-to-day responsibility for making \ndecisions involving strategic, financial, and operational policies of \nthe corporation are located primarily within the United States.''\n  This new section relies on the same principles regarding the true \nlocation of ownership and control of a company that underlie the \ncorporate inversion rules adopted in the American Jobs Creation Act of \n2005. Those inversion rules, however, do not address the fact that some \nentities directly incorporate in foreign countries and manage their \nbusinesses activities from the United States. Section 103 would level \nthe playing field and ensure that entities which incorporate directly \nin another country are subject to a similar management and control \ntest. Section 103 is also similar in concept to the substantial \npresence test in the income tax treaty between the United States and \nthe Netherlands that looks to the primary place of management and \ncontrol to determine corporate residency.\n  To address, in particular, the many investment companies that \nincorporate in tax havens but operate with investment managers who live \nand work in the United States, Section 103 specifically directs \nTreasury to issue regulations to specify that, when investment \ndecisions are being made in the United States, the management and \ncontrol of that corporation shall be treated as occurring primarily in \nthe United States, and that corporation shall be subject to U.S. taxes \nin the same manner as any other U.S. corporation.\n  The section would provide exceptions for private companies that once \nmet the section's test for treatment as a domestic corporation but, \nduring a later tax year, fell below the $50 million gross assets test, \ndo not expect to exceed that threshold again, and are granted a waiver \nby the Treasury Secretary.\n  If enacted into law, Section 103 would put an end to the unfair \nsituation where some U.S.-based companies pay U.S. taxes, while their \ncompetitors set up a shell corporation in a tax haven and are able to \ndefer or escape taxation, despite the fact that their foreign status is \nnothing more than a paper fiction. This provision has been estimated by \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation to raise $6.6 billion in tax revenues \nover ten years.\n\n\n  Section 104--Increased Disclosure of Offshore Accounts and Entities\n\n  Offshore tax abuses thrive in secrecy. Section 104(a) attempts to \novercome offshore secrecy practices by creating two new disclosure \nmechanisms requiring third parties to report offshore transactions \nundertaken by U.S. persons.\n  The first disclosure mechanism focuses on U.S. financial institutions \nthat open a U.S. account in the name of an offshore entity, such as an \noffshore trust or corporation, and learn from an anti-money laundering \ndue diligence review, that a U.S. person is the beneficial owner behind \nthat offshore entity. In the Wyly case history examined by the \nSubcommittee, for example, three major U.S. financial institutions \nopened dozens of accounts for offshore trusts and corporations that \nthey knew were associated with the Wyly family.\n  Under current anti-money laundering law, all U.S. financial \ninstitutions are supposed to know who is behind an account opened in \nthe name of, for example, an offshore shell corporation or trust. They \nare supposed to obtain this information to safeguard the U.S. financial \nsystem against misuse by terrorists, money launderers, and other \ncriminals.\n  Under current tax law, a bank or securities broker that opens an \naccount for a U.S. person is also required to give the IRS a 1099 form \nreporting any capital gains or other reportable income earned on that \naccount. However, the bank or securities broker need not file a 1099 \nform if the account is owned by a foreign entity not subject to U.S. \ntax law. Problems arise when an account is opened in the name of an \noffshore entity that is nominally not subject to tax, but which the \nbank or broker knows, from its anti-money laundering review, is owned \nor controlled by a U.S. person who is subject to tax. The U.S. person \nshould be filing a tax return with the IRS reporting the income of the \n``controlled foreign corporation.'' However, since he or she knows it \nis difficult for the IRS to connect an offshore accountholder to a \nparticular taxpayer, the U.S. person\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\nmay feel safe in not reporting that income. That complacency might \nchange, however, if the U.S. person knew that the bank or broker who \nopened the account and learned of the connection had a legal obligation \nto report any account income to the IRS.\n  Under current law, the way the regulations are written and typically \ninterpreted, the bank or broker can treat an account opened in the name \nof a foreign corporation as an account that is held by an independent \nentity that is separate from the U.S. person, even if it knows that the \nforeign corporation is acting merely as a screen to hide the identity \nof the U.S. person, who exercises complete authority over the \ncorporation and benefits from any income earned on the account. Many \nbanks and brokers contend that the current regulations impose no duty \non them to file a 1099 form or other form disclosing that type of \naccount to the IRS.\n  The bill would strengthen current law by expressly requiring a bank \nor broker that knows, as a result of its anti-money laundering due \ndiligence or otherwise, that a U.S. person is the beneficial owner of a \nforeign entity that opened an account, to disclose that account to the \nIRS by filing a 1099 or equivalent form reporting the account income. \nThis reporting obligation would not require banks or brokers to gather \nany new information--financial institutions are already required to \nperform anti-money laundering due diligence for accounts opened by \noffshore shell entities. The bill would instead require U.S. financial \ninstitutions to act on what they already know by filing the relevant \nform with the IRS.\n  This section would require such reports to the IRS from two sets of \nfinancial institutions. The first set is financial institutions that \nare located and do business in the United States. The second set is \nforeign financial institutions which are located and do business \noutside of the United States, but are voluntary participants in either \nthe FATCA or Qualified Intermediary program, and have agreed to provide \ninformation to the IRS about certain accounts. Under this section, if a \nforeign financial institution has an account under the FATCA or QI \nprogram, and the accountholder is a non-U.S. entity that is controlled \nor beneficially owned by a U.S. person, then that foreign financial \ninstitution would have to report any reportable assets or income in \nthat account to the IRS. While foreign financial institutions are \nalready required to report such accounts under FATCA regulations, \nSection 104(a) would provide a clear statutory foundation for those \nregulatory provisions and extend them to U.S. financial institutions as \nwell.\n  The second disclosure mechanism created by Section 104(a) targets \nU.S. financial institutions that open foreign bank accounts for U.S. \nclients at non-FATCA institutions, meaning foreign financial \ninstitutions that have not agreed under FATCA to disclose to the IRS \nthe accounts they open for U.S. persons. Past Subcommittee \ninvestigations have found that some U.S. financial institutions help \ntheir U.S. clients both to form offshore entities and to open foreign \nbank accounts for those entities, so that their clients do not even \nneed to leave home to set up an offshore structure. Since non-FATCA \ninstitutions, by definition, have no obligation to disclose the \naccounts to U.S. authorities, Section 104(a) would instead impose that \ndisclosure obligation on the U.S. financial institution that helped set \nup the account for its U.S. client.\n  Section 104(b) would impose the same penalties for the failure to \nreport such accounts as apply to the failure to meet other reporting \nobligations of withholding agents.\n\n\n            Section 105--Closing the Swaps Offshore Loophole\n\n  Section 105 of the bill targets a tax loophole benefiting swap \ndealers and other parties that enter into swap arrangements, which I \ncall the swaps offshore loophole.\n  In simple terms, a swap is a financial contract in which two parties \ntypically bet against each other on the performance of a referenced \nfinancial instrument or on the outcome of a referenced event over a \nspecified period of time. The bet can be about whether a commodity \nprice or stock value will go up or down over time, whether one foreign \ncurrency or interest rate will gain or lose value compared to another \nduring the covered period, or whether a corporate bond or sovereign \ncountry will default before a specified date. Those swaps are generally \nreferred to as commodity, equity, interest rate, foreign currency, or \ncredit default swaps. Sometimes swaps are used, not to place bets, but \nto allocate revenue streams over time. For example, in a ``total return \nswap,'' one party may promise to pay the other party all financial \nreturns produced by a referenced financial instrument during the \ncovered period. In many swaps, one party makes a series of payments to \nthe other during the covered period to reflect the change in value of \nthe swap over time.\n  Ten years ago, few people outside of financial circles had ever heard \nof a swap, but we all learned a great deal about them during the \nfinancial crisis. We watched AIG teeter on the brink of bankruptcy from \nissuing credit default swaps whose collateral calls it could not meet, \nneeding a $182 billion rescue with taxpayer dollars. Since then, we \nhave seen credit default swaps play roles in financial crises around \nthe world from Greece to Ireland to Portugal. We have also learned that \nvirtually all major U.S. banks engage in interest rate and foreign \ncurrency swaps, and have seen U.S. cities like Detroit incur major \nlosses from entering into complex interest rate swaps that went sour. \nWe have also learned that global swap markets have grown so large that, \nby the end of 2012, according to the Bank for International \nSettlements, their dollar value topped $560 trillion.\n  Well it turns out that there's a tax angle that promotes not only \nswaps dealing, but also offshore finagling. That's because U.S. tax \nregulations currently allow swap payments that are sent from the United \nStates to someone offshore to be treated as non-U.S. source income that \nmay escape U.S. taxation. Let me repeat that. Under existing IRS \nregulations, swap payments sent from the United States are deemed to be \nnon-U.S. source income to the recipient for U.S. tax purposes. That is \nbecause current IRS regulations deem the ``source'' of the swap payment \nto be where the payment ends up--the exact opposite of the normal \nmeaning of the word ``source.''\n  You can imagine the use that some hedge funds that are managed here \nin the United States, but are incorporated offshore and maintain post \noffice boxes and bank accounts in tax havens, may be making of that tax \nloophole. They can tell their swap counterparties in the United States \nto send any swap payments to their offshore post box or bank account, \ntell Uncle Sam that those payments are legally considered non-U.S. \nsource income, and count the swap payments they receive as foreign \nincome not subject to U.S. tax. Hedge funds are likely far from alone \nin sheltering their swap income from taxation by sending it offshore. \nBanks, securities firms, other financial firms and a lot of commercial \nfirms may be doing the same thing.\n  Our bill would shut down that offshore game simply by recognizing \nreality--that swap payments sent from the United States are U.S. source \nincome subject to taxation.\n\n\n          Title II--Other Measures to Combat Tax Haven Abuses\n\n  The second title of the bill concentrates on strengthening key \ndomestic measures used to combat offshore tax abuse. Its provisions \nfocus on strengthening corporate offshore disclosure requirements and \nnondisclosure penalties, anti-money laundering safeguards used to \nscreen incoming offshore funds, procedures to authorize John Doe \nsummonses used to uncover the identities of tax dodgers, and Foreign \nBank Account Reports used to identify assets held offshore.\n\n\n               Section 201--Country-By-Country Reporting\n\n  Section 201 of the bill would tackle the problem of offshore secrecy \nthat currently surrounds most multinational corporations by requiring \nthem to provide basic information on a country-by-country basis to the \ninvesting public and government authorities.\n  Many multinationals today are complex businesses with sprawling \noperations that cross multiple international boundaries. In many cases, \nno one outside of the corporations themselves knows much about what a \nparticular corporation is doing on a per\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\ncountry basis or how its country-specific activities fit into the \ncorporation's overall performance, planning, and operations.\n  The lack of country-specific information deprives investors of key \ndata to analyze a multinational's financial health, exposure to \nindividual countries' problems, and worldwide operations. There is also \na lack of information to evaluate tax revenues on a country-specific \nbasis to combat tax evasion, financial fraud, and corruption by \ngovernment officials.\n  The lack of country-specific information impedes efficient tax \nadministration and leaves tax authorities unable to effectively analyze \ntransfer pricing arrangements, foreign tax credits, business \narrangements that attempt to play one country off another to avoid \ntaxation, and illicit tactics to move profits to tax havens.\n  For example, earlier this year, the Subcommittee hearing on Apple \ndisclosed for the first time that it had three wholly owned \nsubsidiaries in Ireland which claimed the bulk of Apple's sales income, \nbut also claimed not to be tax resident in any country. One of those \nsubsidiaries, Apple Operations International, had no physical presence \nat any address and, in thirty years of existence, no employees. It was \nrun entirely from the United States, but claimed it was not a U.S. tax \nresident. Over a four year period from 2009 to 2012, it declared $30 \nbillion in revenues, but paid no corporate income tax in the United \nStates, Ireland, or any other jurisdiction. Apple Sales International, \na second Irish subsidiary, received sales revenue over a three-year \nperiod, from 2009 to 2011, totaling $74 billion, but did not declare \nany of that income in the United States and apparently only a tiny \nfraction in Ireland. In 2011, for example, it paid no corporate income \ntaxes at all in the United States and only $10 million in taxes in \nIreland on $22 billion in income, producing an overall tax rate of \nfive-hundreds of one percent. It is far from clear that either U.S. or \nIrish tax authorities were fully aware of the actions taken by Apple to \navoid taxation in both countries.\n  Apple is far from alone. Over the last two years, other multinational \ncorporations, including Starbucks, Amazon, Google, and others, have \nbeen excoriated for failing to pay taxes in countries where they have \nmassive sales. Earlier this month, leaders of the G-20 countries \ndeclared aggressive multinational corporate tax avoidance through \nprofit shifting was a global problem, and called for profits to be \ntaxed where economic activities added value or produced profits. The G-\n20 leaders, including President Obama, committed their countries to \nengaging in automatic information sharing to stop tax evasion and to \nsupport an ongoing effort by the Organization for Cooperation and \nEconomic Development the OECD to develop global tax principles aimed at \nending corporate profit shifting and tax avoidance. They also endorsed \nan ongoing OECD effort to develop a standard template for multinational \ncorporations to disclose their income and taxes on a per country basis.\n  Section 201 of our bill would help the United States carry out its G-\n20 commitment to combat multinational tax avoidance while also \nassisting U.S. investors and tax administrators to identify U.S. \ncorporations engaged in profit shifting and tax avoidance. The bill \nwould accomplish those objectives by requiring corporations that are \nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide an \nannual report with basic information about their operations on a \ncountry-by-country basis. Three types of information would have to be \nprovided: the approximate number of corporate employees per country; \nthe total amount of pre-tax gross revenues assigned by the corporation \nto each country; and the total amount of tax obligations and actual tax \npayments made by the corporation in each jurisdiction. This information \nwould have to be provided by the corporation in a publicly available \nannual report filed with the SEC.\n  The bill requires disclosure of basic data that multinational \ncorporations should already have. The data would not be burdensome to \ncollect. It's just information that is not routinely released by many \nmultinationals. It is time to end the secrecy that now enables too many \nmultinationals to run circles around tax administrators.\n  In the case of the United States, the value of country-by-country \ndata would provide critical information in the fight against rampant \ncorporate tax evasion. An article by Professor Kimberly Clausing \nestimated that, in 2008 alone, ``the income shifting of multinational \nfirms reduced U.S. government corporate tax revenue by about $90 \nbillion,'' which was ``approximately 30 percent of corporate tax \nrevenues.'' Think about that. Profit shifting--in which multinationals \nuse various tactics to shift income to tax havens to escape U.S. taxes \nis--responsible for $90 billion in unpaid taxes in a single year. Over \nten years, that translates into $900 billion--nearly a trillion \ndollars. It is unacceptable to allow that magnitude of nonpayment of \ncorporate taxes to continue year after year in light of the mounting \ndeficits facing this country and the sequestration that has been \nimposed.\n  Treasury data shows that the overall share of federal taxes paid by \nU.S. corporations has fallen dramatically, from 32 percent in 1952, to \nabout 9 percent last year. A 2008 report by the Government \nAccountability Office found that, over an eight-year period, about 1.2 \nmillion U.S. controlled corporations, or 67 percent of the corporate \ntax returns filed, paid no federal corporate income tax at all, despite \ntotal gross receipts of $2.1 trillion. A more recent study found that, \nover a recent three year period, 30 of the largest U.S. multinationals, \nwith more than $160 billion in profits, paid no federal income taxes at \nall. A 2013 GAO report found that, contrary to the statutory corporate \nincome tax rate of up to 35 percent, in 2010, overall, large profitable \ncorporations actually paid an effective tax rate of just 12.6 percent. \nAt the same time that corporations are dodging payment of U.S. taxes, \ncorporate misconduct is continuing to drain the U.S. treasury of \nbillions upon billions of taxpayer dollars to combat mortgage fraud, \noil spills, bank bailouts, and more.\n  Corporate nonpayment of tax involves a host of issues, but transfer \npricing and offshore tax dodging by multinationals is a big part of the \nproblem. Section 201 of the bill would take the necessary first step to \nstop transfer pricing abuses by requiring clear disclosures of basic \ncorporate data on a country-by-country basis.\n\n\n   Section 202--$1 Million Penalty for Hiding Offshore Stock Holdings\n\n  Section 202 of the bill addresses a different offshore abuse. In \naddition to tax abuses, the 2006 Subcommittee investigation into the \nWyly case history uncovered a host of troubling transactions involving \nU.S. securities held by the 58 offshore trusts and corporations \nassociated with the two Wyly brothers. Over the course of a number of \nyears, the Wylys had obtained about $190 million in stock options as \ncompensation from three U.S. publicly traded corporations at which they \nwere directors and major shareholders. Over time, the Wylys transferred \nthose stock options to the network of offshore entities they had \nestablished.\n\n  The investigation found that, for years, the Wylys had generally \nfailed to report the offshore entities' stock holdings or transactions \nin their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nThey did not report those stock holdings on the ground that the 58 \noffshore trusts and corporations functioned as independent entities, \neven though the Wylys continued to direct the entities' investment and \nother activities. The public companies where the Wylys were corporate \ninsiders also failed to include in their SEC filings information about \nthe company shares held by the offshore entities, even though the \ncompanies knew of their close relationship to the Wylys, that the Wylys \nhad provided the offshore entities with significant stock options, and \nthat the offshore entities held large blocks of the company stock. On \nother occasions, the public companies and various financial \ninstitutions failed to treat the shares held by the offshore entities \nas affiliated stock, even though they were aware of the offshore \nentities' close association with the Wylys. The investigation found \nthat, because both the Wylys and the public companies had failed to \ndisclose the holdings of the offshore entities, for 13 years federal \nregulators had been unaware of those stock holdings and the \nrelationships between the offshore entities and the Wyly brothers.\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\n  Corporate insiders and public companies are already obligated by \ncurrent law to disclose stock holdings and transactions of offshore \nentities affiliated with a company director, officer, or major \nshareholder. In fact, in 2010, the SEC filed a civil complaint against \nthe Wylys in connection with their hidden offshore holdings and alleged \ninsider trading. Current penalties, however, appear insufficient to \nensure compliance in light of the low likelihood that U.S. authorities \nwill learn of transactions that take place in an offshore jurisdiction. \nTo address this problem, Section 202 of the bill would establish a new \nmonetary penalty of up to $1 million for persons who knowingly fail to \ndisclose offshore stock holdings and transactions in violation of U.S. \nsecurities laws.\n\n\n          Sections 203 and 204--Anti-Money Laundering Programs\n\n  The next two sections of the bill seek to establish preventative \nprograms to screen offshore money being sent into the United States \nthrough private investment funds.\n  The Subcommittee's 2006 investigation showed that the Wyly brothers \nused two hedge funds and a private equity fund controlled by them to \nfunnel millions of untaxed offshore dollars into U.S. investments. \nOther Subcommittee investigations provide extensive evidence of the \nrole played by U.S. formation agents in assisting U.S. persons to set \nup offshore structures as well as U.S. shell companies later used in \nillicit activities, including tax evasion, money laundering, and other \nmisconduct. Because hedge funds, private equity funds, and formation \nagents are as vulnerable as other financial institutions to money \nlaunderers seeking entry into the U.S. financial system, the bill \ncontains two provisions aimed at ensuring that these groups know who \ntheir clients are and do not transmit suspect funds into the U.S. \nfinancial system.\n  Currently, hedge funds and private equity funds are free to transmit \nsubstantial offshore funds into the United States without the same \nsafeguards that apply to other financial institutions--anti-money \nlaundering programs that require them to know their customers, \nunderstand where substantial funds are coming from, and report \nsuspicious activity. There is no reason why this sector of our \nfinancial services industry should continue to serve as an unfettered \ngateway into the U.S. financial system for substantial funds that could \nbe connected to tax evasion, money laundering, terrorism, drug \ntrafficking, or other misconduct.\n  In 2001, after the 9/11 terrorist attack, the Patriot Act required \nall U.S. financial institutions to put anti-money laundering programs \nin place. Eleven years ago, in 2002, in compliance with the Patriot \nAct, the Treasury Department proposed anti-money laundering regulations \nfor hedge funds and private equity companies, but never finalized them. \nIn 2008, the Department withdrew them with no explanation. Section 203 \nof the bill would require Treasury to get back on track and issue final \nanti-money laundering regulations for investment advisors to hedge \nfunds and private equity companies registered with the SEC. Treasury \nwould be free to draw upon its 2002 proposal, and would have 180 days \nafter enactment of the bill to propose a rule and another 270 days to \nfinalize it and put in place the same types of safeguards that now \napply to all other financial firms.\n  In addition, Section 204 of the bill would add formation agents to \nthe list of persons with anti-money laundering obligations. For the \nfirst time, those engaged in the business of forming corporations, \ntrusts, and other entities, both offshore and in the 50 States, would \nbe responsible for knowing who their clients are and avoiding suspect \nfunds. The bill directs Treasury to develop anti-money laundering \nregulations for this group in a little over a year. Treasury's key \nanti-money laundering agency, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, \ntestified before the Subcommittee in 2006, that it was considering \ndrafting such regulations but seven years later has yet to do so. \nSection 204 also creates an exemption for government personnel and for \nattorneys who use paid formation agents when forming entities for their \nclients. Because paid formation agents would already be subject to \nanti-money laundering obligations under the bill, there would be no \nreason to simultaneously subject attorneys using their services to the \nsame anti-money laundering requirements.\n  We expect and intend that, as in the case of all other entities \nrequired to institute anti-money laundering programs, the regulations \nissued in response to this bill would instruct hedge funds, private \nequity funds and formation agents to adopt risk-based procedures that \nwould concentrate their due diligence efforts on clients and funds that \npose the highest risks of injecting suspect funds into the United \nStates.\n\n\n                   Section 205--IRS John Doe Summons\n\n  Section 205 of the bill focuses on an important tool used by the IRS \nin recent years to uncover taxpayers involved in offshore tax schemes, \nknown as a John Doe summons. Section 205 would make three technical \nchanges to make the use of a John Doe summons more effective in \noffshore and other complex investigations.\n  A John Doe summons is an administrative IRS summons used to request \ninformation in cases where the identity of a taxpayer is unknown. In \ncases involving a known taxpayer, the IRS may issue a summons to a \nthird party to obtain information about that U.S. taxpayer, but must \nalso notify the taxpayer who then has 20 days to petition a court to \nquash the summons to the third party. With a John Doe summons, however, \nthe IRS does not have the taxpayer's name and does not know where to \nsend the taxpayer notice, so the statute substitutes a procedure in \nwhich the IRS must instead apply to a court for advance permission to \nserve the summons on the third party. To obtain approval of the \nsummons, the IRS must show the court, in public filings to be resolved \nin open court, that: (1) the summons relates to a particular person or \nascertainable class of persons, (2) there is a reasonable basis for \nconcluding that there is a tax compliance issue involving that person \nor class of persons, and (3) the information sought is not readily \navailable from other sources.\n  In recent years, the IRS has used John Doe summonses to obtain \ninformation about taxpayers operating in offshore secrecy \njurisdictions. For example, the IRS obtained court approval to serve a \nJohn Doe summons on a Swiss bank, UBS AG, to obtain the names of \nthousands of U.S. clients who opened UBS accounts in Switzerland \nwithout disclosing those accounts to the IRS. That landmark effort to \novercome Swiss secrecy laws led to the bank's turning over thousands of \nU.S. client names to the United States and to the Swiss government's \nannouncing it would no longer use its secrecy laws to protect U.S. tax \nevaders. In earlier years, the IRS obtained court approval to issue \nJohn Doe summonses to credit card associations, credit card processors, \nand credit card merchants, to collect information about taxpayers using \ncredit cards issued by offshore banks. This information has led to many \nsuccessful cases in which the IRS has identified funds hidden offshore \nand recovered unpaid taxes.\n  Currently, however, use of the John Doe summons process is time \nconsuming and expensive. For each John Doe summons involving an \noffshore secrecy jurisdiction, the IRS has had to establish in court \nthat the involvement of accounts and transactions in that offshore \nsecrecy jurisdiction meant that there was a significant likelihood of \ntax compliance problems. To relieve the IRS of the need to make this \nsame proof over and over in court after court, the bill would provide \nthat, in any John Doe summons proceeding involving a class defined in \nterms of a correspondent or payable-through account involving a non-\nFATCA institution, the court may presume that the case raises tax \ncompliance issues. This presumption would then eliminate the need for \nthe IRS to repeatedly establish in court the obvious fact that accounts \nat non-FATCA institutions raise tax compliance issues.\n  In addition, Section 205 would streamline the John Doe summons \napproval process in large ``project'' investigations where the IRS \nanticipates issuing multiple summonses to definable classes of third \nparties, such as banks or credit card associations, to obtain \ninformation related to particular taxpayers. Right now, for each \nsummons issued in connection with a\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nproject, the IRS has to obtain the approval of a court, often having to \nrepeatedly establish the same facts before multiple judges in multiple \ncourts. This repetitive exercise wastes IRS, Justice Department, and \ncourt resources, and fragments oversight of the overall IRS \ninvestigative effort.\n  To streamline this process and strengthen court oversight of IRS use \nof John Doe summons, the bill would authorize the IRS to present an \ninvestigative project, as a whole, to a single judge to obtain approval \nfor issuing multiple summonses related to that project. In such cases, \nthe court would retain jurisdiction over the case after approval is \ngranted, to exercise ongoing oversight of IRS issuance of summonses \nunder the project. To further strengthen court oversight, the IRS would \nbe required to file a publicly available report with the court on at \nleast an annual basis describing the summonses issued under the \nproject. The court would retain authority to restrict the use of \nfurther summonses at any point during the project.\n\n\n    Section 206--FBAR Investigations and Suspicious Activity Reports\n\n  Section 206 of the bill contains several provisions to strengthen the \nability of the IRS to enforce the Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) \nrequirements and clarify the right of access by IRS civil enforcement \nauthorities to Suspicious Activity Reports.\n  Under present law, a person controlling a foreign financial account \nwith over $10,000 is required to check a box on his or her income tax \nreturn and, under Title 31, also file an FBAR form with the IRS. \nTreasury has delegated to the IRS responsibility for investigating FBAR \nviolations and assessing FBAR penalties. Because the FBAR enforcement \njurisdiction derives from Title 31, however, the IRS has set up a \ncomplex process for when its personnel may use tax return information \nwhen acting in its role as FBAR enforcer. The tax disclosure law, in \nSection 6103(b)(4) of the tax code, permits the use of tax information \nonly for the administration of the internal revenue laws or ``related \nstatutes.'' To implement this statutory requirement, the IRS currently \nrequires its personnel to determine, at a managerial level and on a \ncase by case basis, that the Title 31 FBAR law is a ``related \nstatute.'' Not only does this necessitate a repetitive determination in \nevery FBAR case before an IRS agent can look at the potential non-\nfiler's income tax return to determine if such filer checked the FBAR \nbox, but it also prevents the IRS from comparing FBAR filing records to \nbulk data on foreign accounts received from tax treaty partners to find \nnon-filers.\n  One of the stated purposes for the FBAR filing requirement is that \nsuch reports ``have a high degree of usefulness in . . . tax . . . \ninvestigations or proceedings.'' 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5311. If one of the \nreasons for requiring taxpayers to file FBARs is to use the information \nfor tax purposes, and if the IRS has been charged with FBAR enforcement \nbecause of the FBARs' close connection to tax administration, common \nsense dictates that the FBAR statute should be viewed as a ``related \nstatute'' for tax disclosure purposes. Section 206(a) of the bill would \nmake that clear by adding a provision to Section 6103(b) of the tax \ncode deeming FBAR-related statutes to be ``related statutes,'' thereby \nallowing IRS personnel to make routine use of tax return information \nwhen working on FBAR matters.\n  The second change that would be made by Section 206 is an amendment \nto simplify the calculation of FBAR penalties. Currently the penalty is \ndetermined in part by the balance in the foreign bank account at the \ntime of the ``violation.'' The violation has been interpreted to have \noccurred on the due date of the FBAR return, which is June 30 of the \nyear following the year to which the report relates. The statute's use \nof this specific June 30th date can lead to strange results if money is \nwithdrawn from the foreign account after the reporting period closed \nbut before the return due date. To eliminate this unintended problem, \nSection 206(b) of the bill would instead calculate the penalty using \nthe highest balance in the account during the covered reporting period.\n  The third part of Section 206 relates to Suspicious Activity Reports \nor SARs, which financial institutions are required to file with the \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Center (FinCEN) of the Treasury Department \nwhen they encounter suspicious transactions. FinCEN is required to \nshare this information with law enforcement, but currently does not \npermit IRS civil investigators access to the information, even though \nIRS civil investigators are federal law enforcement officials. Sharing \nSAR information with civil IRS investigators would likely prove very \nuseful in tax investigations and would not increase the risk of \ndisclosure of SAR information, because IRS civil personnel operate \nunder the same tough confidentiality rules as IRS criminal \ninvestigators. In some cases, IRS civil agents are now issuing an IRS \nsummons to a financial institution to get access, for a production fee, \nto the very same information the financial institution has already \nfiled with Treasury in a SAR. Section 206(c) of the bill would end that \ninefficient and costly practice by making it clear that ``law \nenforcement'' includes civil tax law enforcement.\n\n\n           Title III--Ending Corporate Offshore Tax Avoidance\n\n  The first two titles of the bill focus primarily on strengthening \ntools needed to identify, stop, and punish offshore tax evasion, \nconcentrating on activities that, for the most part, are already \nillegal. Another problem, however, are actions taken by multinational \ncorporations to exploit loopholes in our tax code. Title III of the \nbill seeks to close loopholes that contribute to offshore tax abuse and \ncreate incentives for U.S. corporations to send jobs and operations \noffshore. Most of these provisions are modeled after recommendations \nmade by the President in his budget proposals.\n  Earlier this month, the G-20 leaders endorsed efforts to prevent tax \navoidance and tax evasion through offshore structures. They stated that \n``international tax rules, which date back to the 1920's, have not kept \npace with the changing business environment, including the growing \nimportance of intangibles and the digital economy.'' They agreed that \nbase erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) deprives countries across the \nworld of the funds needed to finance their governments, and results in \nan unfair burden on the citizens who must make up the lost revenues \nthrough increased taxes. The G-20 leaders issued a declaration that \n``we must move forward in fighting BEPS practices so that we ensure a \nfair contribution of all productive sectors to the financing of public \nspending in our countries.''\n  The provisions we are offering today would help do just that.\n\n\n     Section 301--Allocation of Expenses and Taxes on the Basis of \n                     Repatriation of Foreign Income\n\n  Section 301 addresses two key loopholes in the taxation of \nmultinational corporations. First, it would stop corporations from \ntaking current deductions for expenses arising from moving assets and \noperations abroad while being able to still defer paying U.S. income \ntaxes on the income generated from those assets and operations.\n  Offshore Expenses. Under current law, a multinational corporation can \nlower its U.S. taxes by taking deductions for offshore expenses \ncurrently, while deferring paying taxes on its related income. For \nexample, if a U.S.-based company borrows money in the United States to \nbuild a factory offshore, then it can deduct currently the interest \nexpense it pays on the loan from its U.S. taxes. It can also deduct \ncurrently the expenses of moving materials to the offshore factory and \nfor operating the offshore factory on an ongoing basis. But the company \ndoesn't have to pay U.S. taxes on any of the income arising from its \noffshore factory operations until it chooses to return that income to \nthe United States. The end result is that the multinational corporation \ncurrently deducts the offshore expenses from its taxable income, while \ndeferring taxes on the offshore income related to those expenses. That \ndeduction-income mismatch creates a tax incentive for corporations to \nmove their operations, jobs, and profits offshore.\n  Section 301 of the bill would eliminate that offshore incentive by \nallowing multinationals to claim deductions only for the expenses of \nproducing foreign income when they have repatriated the income back to \nthe U.S. parent corporation and paid taxes on it. For corporations that \nchoose to immediately repatriate, and thus pay taxes\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\non, their foreign earnings, the bill would present no change from \ncurrent tax policy. But for multinational corporations that park their \noverseas earnings outside the United States, and defer paying any taxes \non those earnings, the bill would no longer allow them to claim U.S. \ntax deductions for expenses associated with those same overseas \noperations, again, unless and until they return the profits to the \nUnited States and pay taxes on them.\n  It simply does not make sense for American taxpayers to subsidize the \noffshoring of American jobs and operations--but that is exactly what \nthe current tax code is doing. The bill being introduced today would \nstop that unjustified tax subsidy.\n  This provision has been proposed in various forms in the President's \nbudget proposals, and is estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation \nto raise $60 billion over ten years.\n  Foreign Tax Credits. The second loophole addressed by Section 301 \nwould fix a complex mathematical game played by multinational \ncorporations with how they calculate their foreign tax credits. Our \nproposal, which the President has included in his budget proposals, \nwould close the loophole that allows multinationals to use excess \nforeign tax credits from higher tax jurisdictions to shelter income run \nthrough lower tax jurisdictions from U.S. taxes. There is bipartisan \nagreement that this issue needs to be addressed.\n  The first part of this mathematical game is straightforward. Under \ncurrent law, the tax code protects U.S. taxpayers from double taxation \nof foreign income by allowing them to claim a foreign tax credit for \ntaxes paid to a foreign jurisdiction. Those foreign tax credits can be \nused to offset U.S. income taxes owed by the corporation.\n  Here is an example. Suppose ABC Corporation, a U.S. multinational \ncorporation, has $100 in income in Higher Tax Country where it is taxed \nat 40 percent, and another $100 in income in Lower Tax Country where it \nis taxed at 0 percent. Because ABC Corp. paid $40 in taxes to Higher \nTax Country, it would generate a $40 foreign tax credit which it could \nimmediately use to lower its U.S. taxes when it repatriates the foreign \nincome.\n  Now here is where it gets a bit more complex. Under current law, the \ncorporation can use some of the foreign tax credits generated from \npaying taxes in one country to shield from U.S. taxes foreign income \nattributed to another country, including a tax haven.\n  Right now, if a corporation earns foreign tax credits from a higher \ntax jurisdiction and those tax credits exceed the amount used to offset \nthe corporation's U.S. tax liability upon repatriation, current law \nallows those excess credits to be applied to offset U.S tax on income \nrepatriated from a lower-tax jurisdiction, typically a tax haven.\n  Let's go back to our example, using the current maximum U.S. \ncorporate tax rate of 35 percent. ABC Corp. has generated a $40 foreign \ntax credit from the taxes it paid to Higher Tax Country. The $40 \nforeign tax credit allows ABC Corp. to repatriate all $100 of its \nincome from Higher Tax Country free of U.S. tax. Since that income had \nalready been taxed by Higher Tax Country, it is reasonable under the \nprinciple of avoiding double taxation that the corporation should not \nhave to pay any further U.S. tax on that income.\n  But repatriating that $100 would use up only $35 of the corporation's \n$40 foreign tax credit, with a $5 foreign tax credit left over. Under \ncurrent law, the corporation could then repatriate another $14 of \noffshore income from Lower Tax Country, and use its left over $5 \nforeign tax credit to shelter that income from U.S. taxes. But foreign \ntax credits are supposed to prevent double taxation of the same income, \nnot shield foreign income from any taxation at all. By allowing that \nuse of excess foreign tax credits, the tax code encourages \nmultinationals to run income through tax havens.\n  To change that outcome, the bill would require corporations to pool \ntheir foreign tax credits. The bill would then limit the amount of tax \ncredits that could be used, by allowing only that percent of its \nforeign tax credits equal to the percent of foreign income that the \ncorporation has repatriated that year. For example, if the corporation \nrepatriated only 10 percent of its foreign income, it could use only 10 \npercent of its foreign tax credits.\n  By aggregating the foreign tax credits of multinational corporations, \nthe bill would remove the tax incentive for locating offshore income in \nlow-tax jurisdictions, while leveling the global playing field for \nmultinationals operating in multiple countries. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation has estimated that this provision would raise $55 billion over \n10 years.\n\n\n Section 302--Excess Income from Transfers of Intangibles to Low-taxed \n                               Affiliates\n\n  Section 302 of the bill addresses the problem of corporate transfers \nof intangible property offshore, an area rampant with tax abuse.\n  Intangible property includes such valuable items as patents, \ntrademarks, and marketing and distribution rights. Under U.S. tax law, \nif a multinational corporation has valuable intellectual property, it \ncan sell that property to its wholly-owned offshore subsidiary. So long \nas the corporation complies with a set of complicated ``transfer \npricing'' rules, the corporation can then treat any income generated \nfrom that intellectual property as offshore income, and defer paying \nU.S. taxes on it.\n  Current transfer pricing rules are intended to ensure that the U.S. \nparent receives fair compensation in return for the sale of its \nproperty rights to its offshore subsidiary, but these rules are not \nworking.\n  Last year, the Subcommittee held a hearing exposing how the current \nsystem works in a case history involving Microsoft. The hearing showed \nhow Microsoft sold key intellectual property rights to an Irish \nsubsidiary it had established for $2.8 billion. That subsidiary then \nturned around and sold the rights to other Microsoft offshore \nsubsidiaries for $9 billion, immediately shifting more than $6 billion \nin profits offshore, without paying any U.S. taxes.\n  But Microsoft did not stop there. The U.S. parent also sold the right \nto market its products in North and South America to another offshore \nsubsidiary and then bought back from that same subsidiary the right to \nsell Microsoft products in the United States in exchange for payment of \nlicensing fees. In 2011, its offshore licensing agreement translated \ninto Microsoft sending 47 cents of every U.S. sales dollar to its \noffshore subsidiary, shifting even more U.S. source income offshore. In \ntotal, over a three-year period, Microsoft used its transfer pricing \ngimmick to avoid paying $4.5 billion in U.S. corporate income taxes, or \n$4 million in taxes per day. Think about that. Microsoft products are \ndeveloped here. They are sold here, to customers here. And yet \nMicrosoft paid no taxes here on nearly half of its U.S. sales income, \nbecause current U.S. tax law allowed Microsoft to send that money \noffshore and defer indefinitely paying U.S. taxes on it.\n  The code currently includes provisions, particularly Sections 367(d) \nand 482, designed to stop multinationals from improperly transferring \nproperty offshore to avoid U.S. taxes. Those provisions, and the \ncorresponding regulations, require that transfers of property from a \nU.S. parent to a ``controlled foreign corporation,'' or CFC, be \nconducted at an ``arms-length'' price. The problem, however, is that \ndetermining an arms-length price for an intellectual property \ntransaction demands analysis of complex facts with no decisive evidence \nof the proper price. Every case requires expensive and time consuming \nanalysis by the IRS as well as expensive and time consuming litigation \nif the IRS decides to try to overturn an abusive transaction.\n  Section 302 of the bill would help erect a backstop to prevent unfair \nvaluations of intellectual property being used to send money offshore. \nSpecifically, if evidence indicated that the transferred property's \nvalue exceeded 150 percent of the transfer price, and it was \ntransferred to a tax haven, then all gross income attributed to the use \nof such transferred property over 150 percent of the costs allocated to \nsuch gross income would be treated as Subpart F income subject to U.S. \ntaxation. In the case of Microsoft, for example, since the re-transfer \nof its intellectual property rights for $9 billion exceeded the \noriginal transfer price of $2.8 billion by more than 150 percent, it \nwould have triggered taxation on the excess amount. While the Microsoft \ntransactions may very well violate existing transfer pricing laws based \non\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\narms-length determinations, Section 302 would make explicit that when \noffshore transfers result in large profits being transferred to an \noffshore CFC, those excess profits are subject to immediate taxation by \nthe United States, without mandating a complex arms-length evaluation.\n  Section 302 has been designed to avoid taxation of legitimate \nbusiness transfers. For example, to avoid capturing income related to \nlegitimate business operations by the foreign subsidiary using \nintangible property, income derived from such subsidiary's actual use \nin the country would be entirely excluded from any excess income \ncalculation. Further, to avoid impacting legitimate operations that \nsimply earn high rates of return due to a business success, the \nprovision targets only profits that are not taxed by the foreign \njurisdiction. To do so, this provision exempts income that is taxed by \na foreign jurisdiction at a rate of more than 15 percent, with a phase \nout set for rates between 10 percent and 15 percent. In most cases, \nthis exemption would limit the impact of the provision so that it would \naffect only subsidiaries located in tax haven jurisdictions, which, of \ncourse, are the most likely candidates for abuse.\n  We are not alone in targeting transfer pricing abuses involving \nintellectual and other intangible property. The international community \nhas recognized the severity of these abuses when the G-20 leaders \nrecently called for ``ensuring that profits associated with the \ntransfer and use of intangibles are appropriately allocated in \naccordance with (rather than divorced from) value creation.'' The \nleaders went on to endorse ``developing transfer pricing rules or \nspecial measures for transfer of hard-to-value intangibles.''\n  Section 302 does not change U.S. transfer pricing rules generally. \nInstead it simply creates a backstop to ensure that a corporation \ncannot avoid taxes by transferring its property to an offshore \nsubsidiary in a tax haven, and then enjoy windfall profits far in \nexcess of the transfer price without paying U.S. taxes. While the new \ntransfer pricing provision would still depend upon strong enforcement \nby the IRS, it would put in place a new bright-line approach that would \ndeter some of the worst offshore transfer pricing abuses now going on.\n  Section 302 has been estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to \nraise $21.5 billion over ten years.\n\n\nSection 303--Limitations on Income Shifting Through Intangible Property \n                               Transfers\n\n  As just noted, our current tax code makes it far too easy for U.S. \nmultinational corporations to shift intangible property to tax havens \nthrough transfer pricing and other similar schemes. In addition, as \nnoted earlier, tax enforcement authorities are faced with the \ndifficulty of valuing each property involved in a questionable transfer \npricing transaction.\n  Section 303 would address these problems by clarifying current law \nthat the IRS is fully authorized to use certain common sense valuation \nmethods for determining the proper valuation of intangible property \ntransfers. Specifically, this section authorizes Treasury to promulgate \nrules regarding the valuation of transferred intangible property. In \nparticular, if deemed the ``most reliable means of valuation'' by the \nSecretary, tax enforcement officials would be allowed to aggregate \noffshore transfers by a company for the purpose of valuation. And, \nunder this provision, tax officials could consider realistic \nalternatives to the transfer in developing their valuations, if such \nalternatives would lead to the most reliable valuation.\n  By providing tax enforcement authorities with the flexibility needed \nto perform realistic and more accurate assessments of the value of \ntransferred intangible property, we would improve both the accuracy of \nenforcement and the fairness of our tax code. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation has estimated that this provision would raise about $1.7 \nbillion over ten years.\n\n\nSection 304--Repeal of ``Check-the-Box'' Rule for Foreign Entities and \n                     the CFC ``Look-Through'' Rule\n\n  Section 304 of the bill addresses another key offshore tax abuse: use \nof the so-called ``check-the-box'' and CFC ``look-through'' rules to \navoid paying U.S. corporate income taxes on passive offshore income. \nBoth provisions enable multinational corporations to avoid taxation of \noffshore passive income which, under Subpart F of the tax code, is \nsupposed to be taxed. Both provisions discourage repatriation of \noffshore profits, discourage U.S. investment, and deprive the U.S. \nTreasury of tens of billions of dollars.\n  To better understand this Section, it may be helpful to examine some \ngeneral tax principles and a little bit of history. The first principle \nis that, if a U.S. corporation earns income from an active business \nactivity offshore, the corporation generally owes no U.S. tax until the \nincome is returned to the United States. This principle is known as \ndeferral. It is meant to defer taxes on active businesses such as a \nU.S. parent's foreign subsidiary selling products in another country.\n  The deferral principle is also subject to a big exception in Subpart \nF of the tax code. Subpart F provides that deferral of taxes is not \npermitted for passive, inherently mobile income such as interest, \ndividend, or royalty income. The reason is that passive income can be \nearned anywhere--in the United States or outside of it--and, if taxes \nare deferred on offshore passive income, it would create an enormous \nincentive for U.S. corporations to send their funds offshore. To \neliminate that incentive, Subpart F makes passive income immediately \ntaxable, even when the income is offshore. Subpart F's effort to remove \nthe incentive to send U.S. funds offshore, however, has been largely \nundermined by regulations, temporary statutory changes, and weak IRS \nenforcement, not to mention numerous tax gimmicks devised by \nmultinational corporations.\n  One key problem is the 1997 so-called ``check-the-box'' regulation, \nwhich allows a business enterprise to declare what type of legal entity \nit wants to be considered for federal tax purposes by simply checking a \nbox. This rule was issued by the IRS without any statutory direction. \nIt was intended to stop expensive and unproductive litigation and \nconfusion over whether to treat business entities as taxable entities \nor as flow-through entities whose taxes had to be paid by their owners. \nIt was in response to many states creating new business forms in the \nyears leading up to its adoption. Since different states used different \nnames with slightly different characteristics, the regulation was \nintended to help provide relief for taxpayers who were having \ndifficulty determining whether they should be taxed at the entity \nlevel, or have the income pass through to its owners. It was almost \nexclusively viewed as a domestic tax law issue.\n  Almost as soon as it was issued, however, multinational corporations \nbegan to use the rule, not as a way of determining who should be taxed, \nbut as a way to get around paying any taxes at all on passive offshore \nincome under Subpart F.\n  A little over a year after its adoption, after it became clear that \nthe rule would be abused to circumvent Subpart F taxation of passive \nincome, Treasury attempted to revoke the check the box option. That \neffort was met with such opposition from industry groups, however, that \nit was abandoned. In 2006, in response to corporate pressure to provide \na statutory basis for the check the-box rule, Congress enacted Section \n954(c)(6), the so-called CFC look-through rule, which excludes certain \npassive income transferred between related offshore entities from \nSubpart F taxation. That provision was so costly, however, that it was \nenacted for only a three-year period. After it expired in 2009, the \nprovision was revived and has been twice extended, both times on a \ntemporary basis. It is currently in effect, but will expire at the end \nof this year unless extended again.\n  Using the check-the-box and CFC look-through rules to avoid Subpart F \ntaxation requires planning and multiple offshore subsidiaries, which is \nwhy it benefits large multinational corporations, giving them an \nadvantage over their domestic competitors. One common tactic has been \nfor a U.S. parent corporation to establish an offshore subsidiary that \nearns active sales income whose taxes can be deferred indefinitely. The \nU.S. parent also establishes other subsidiaries in tax havens and \ntypically drains money from the active business by requiring it to pay \ndividends, interest on intercompany loans, royalty income, or licensing \nfees to the tax haven subsidiaries. Then, instead of paying taxes on \nthat passive income under Subpart F, the U.S. parent uses the check-\nthe-box rule to\n\n[[Page S6660]]\n\ntreat its tax haven subsidiaries as ``disregarded entities,'' making \nthem invisible for U.S. tax purposes and leaving only the active \nbusiness whose taxes can be deferred indefinitely.\n  The 2012 Apple hearing held by my Subcommittee provided a real life \nexample. That hearing disclosed that Apple Inc., the U.S. parent, \nformed three wholly owned subsidiaries in Ireland, as well as \nsubsidiaries in other countries that actually sold Apple products in \nEurope, Asia and Africa. Apple required the sales businesses to \ntransfer most of their profits to one of the Irish subsidiaries, Apple \nSales International, through licensing and other fees. In three years, \nthose businesses sent sales revenues to Apple Sales International \ntotaling $74 billion. Apple Sales International did not keep all of \nthose funds; it issued dividends totaling $30 billion to another Apple \nIrish subsidiary, Apple Operations International. Under Subpart F, both \nApple Sales International and Apple Operations International should \nhave paid U.S. taxes on the passive income they received, but neither \ndid. Instead, Apple Inc. used check-the-box to treat its Irish \nsubsidiaries as disregarded entities for tax purposes and then deferred \ntaxes on the sales income of their active business subsidiaries, even \nthough those businesses did not actually retain most of the sales \nincome. The end result was that check-the-box enabled Apple to \ncircumvent Subpart F's immediate taxation of its offshore passive \nincome.\n  The loss to the U.S. Treasury from these types of offshore check-the-\nbox arrangements is enormous. Investigations conducted by my \nSubcommittee have found, for example, that for fiscal years 2009, 2010 \nand 2011, Google used check-the-box to defer taxes on over $24.2 \nbillion in offshore passive income covered by Subpart F. Microsoft \ndeferred $21 billion in the same period.\n  Section 304 would put an end to this type of tax avoidance and \nrevitalize Subpart F by prohibiting the application of the check-the-\nbox rule to offshore entities and by eliminating the CFC look-through \nrule altogether. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that \nthis provision would raise $78 billion over ten years.\n\n\n            Section 305--Prohibition on Offshore Loan Abuse\n\n  The final provision in the bill, Section 305, addresses another \noffshore abuse uncovered by my Subcommittee: the misuse of tax \nprovisions that allow offshore funds to be repatriated tax free to the \nUnited States when provided as short term loans.\n  To understand this Section, it is again important to examine some \ngeneral tax principles. One of those principles is that a U.S. parent \ncorporation is supposed to be taxed on any profits sent to it by an \noffshore subsidiary, which is often called ``repatriation.'' If an \noffshore subsidiary loans money to its U.S. parent, that is also \nsubject to U.S. taxes. In both cases, the funds sent to the United \nStates are to be treated as taxable dividends.\n  Once again, however, those simple tax principles have been subverted \nin practice by complex exclusions and limitations. Section 956 of the \ntax code is the provision that makes a loan from an offshore affiliate \nto a U.S. parent subject to U.S. tax. Although the law contains no \nexceptions or limits on the loans covered, the IRS has issued \nregulations that create exceptions for certain types of short term \nloans. The IRS regulations provide, for example, that offshore loans \nmay be excluded from taxation if they are repaid within 30 days, as are \nall loans made over the course of a year if they are outstanding for \nless than 60 days in total. In addition, the IRS permits a controlled \nforeign corporation--a CFC--to loan offshore funds to a related U.S. \nentity to escape U.S. taxation, if the loan is initiated and concluded \nbefore the end of the CFC's calendar quarter. Those loans are not \nsubject to the 30 day limit, and don't count against the aggregate 60 \nday limit for the fiscal year. The IRS has also declared that the \nlimitations on the length of loans apply separately to each CFC of a \nU.S. corporation. So when aggregated, all loans for all CFCs could be \noutstanding for more than 60 days in total.\n  An investigation conducted by my Subcommittee found that U.S. \nmultinationals have used the IRS' convoluted short term loan provisions \nto orchestrate a constant stream of offshore loans from their foreign \nsubsidiaries without ever exceeding the 30 or 60 day limits or \nextending over the end of a CFC's quarter. Instead of ensuring that \ntaxes are paid on offshore funds returned to the United States, Section \n956 has been converted by the IRS regulations into a mechanism used to \nget billions of dollars back into the United States tax free.\n  This offshore tax scheme was illustrated in a 2012 Subcommittee \nhearing that showed how Hewlett-Packard has, for years, used a short \nterm loan program to avoid paying U.S. taxes on billions of dollars in \noffshore income used to run its U.S. operations. Hewlett-Packard \nobtained the offshore cash by directing two of its controlled foreign \ncorporations in Belgium and the Cayman Islands to provide serial, \nalternating loans to its U.S. operations. For a four year period, from \nMarch 2008 to September 2012, Hewlett-Packard used those intercompany \nloans to seamlessly provide an average of about $3.6 billion per day \nfor use in its U.S. operations, claiming the funds were tax-free, short \nterm loans of less than 30 days duration under Section 956.\n  Section 305 would put an end to this repatriation sleight of hand by \neliminating the provision allowing offshore funds returned to the \nUnited States under the guise of short term loans to escape U.S. \ntaxation. Instead, it would reaffirm the general principle that \noffshore funds returned to the United States are subject to U.S. taxes.\n  Conclusion. Offshore tax abuses eat at the fabric of society, not \nonly by widening deficits and robbing health care, education, and other \nneeded government services of resources, but also by undermining public \ntrust--making law-abiding taxpayers feel like they are being taken \nadvantage of when they pay their fair share. Tax law is complicated, \nand where most Americans see an inscrutable maze, too many profitable \ncompanies and wealthy individuals see an opportunity to avoid paying \ntaxes. Our commitment to crack down on their tax-avoidance schemes must \nbe as strong as their determination to get away with ripping off Uncle \nSam and moving their tax burden onto the backs of the rest of American \ntaxpayers.\n  Our nation is suffering greatly from the effects of sequestration, \nwhich were brought on by our failure to reach an agreement on a \nbalanced mix of spending cuts and revenue increases. If we are serious \nabout finding a solution to mindless sequestration cuts and our \nnation's repeated budget battles, we must look at the offshore tax \navoidance abuses that rob our Treasury of the funds needed to pay our \nsoldiers, help the sick, research cures for diseases, educate students, \nand invest in our future. Putting the burden of funding our government \non the backs of hardworking American families and domestic businesses, \nwhile letting a sophisticated minority of multinational corporations \nget away with these types of offshore gimmicks, is grossly unfair.\n  We can fight back against offshore tax abuses if we summon the \npolitical will. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, which is the product of \nyears of work, including hearings and reports of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, offers the tools needed to close the \ntax haven loopholes and use the hundreds of billions of dollars which \nwill come to our Treasury as part of a sensible balanced deficit \nreduction substitute for the damaging irrationality of sequestration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n      Summary of the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, September 19, 2013\n\n       The Levin-Whitehouse-Begich-Shaheen Stop Tax Haven Abuse \n     Act would:\n\n\n        Title I--Deterring the Use of Tax Havens for Tax Evasion\n\n       Authorize special measures to stop offshore tax abuse \n     (Sec. 101) by allowing Treasury to take specified steps \n     against foreign jurisdictions or financial institutions that \n     impede U.S. tax enforcement, including prohibiting U.S. banks \n     from doing business with a designated foreign bank.\n       Strengthen FATCA (Sec. 102) by clarifying when, under the \n     Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, foreign financial \n     institutions and U.S. persons must report foreign financial \n     accounts to the IRS.\n       Establish rebuttable presumptions to combat offshore \n     secrecy (Sec. 102) in U.S. tax and securities law enforcement \n     proceedings by\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\n     shifting to the U.S. taxpayer, who takes advantage of the \n     related loopholes, the burden of proving: who controls an \n     offshore entity; when money sent to or received from offshore \n     is taxable income; and when offshore accounts have sufficient \n     funds to trigger a reporting obligation.\n       Stop companies incorporated offshore but managed and \n     controlled from the United States from claiming foreign \n     status (Sec. 103) and avoiding U.S. taxes on their foreign \n     income by treating them as U.S. domestic corporations for tax \n     purposes.\n       Strengthen detection of offshore activities (Sec. 104) by \n     requiring U.S. financial institutions that open accounts for \n     foreign entities controlled by U.S. clients or open foreign \n     accounts in non-FATCA institutions for U.S. clients to report \n     the accounts to the IRS.\n       Close the offshore swap payments loophole (Sec. 105) by \n     treating swap payments that originate in the United States as \n     taxable U.S. source income.\n\n\n           Title II-Other Measures to Combat Tax Haven Abuses\n\n       (Require annual country-by-country reporting (Sec. 201) by \n     SEC-registered corporations to disclose their 7, employees, \n     gross revenues, and tax payments on a per country basis.\n       Establish a penalty on corporate insiders who hide offshore \n     holdings (Sec. 202) with a securities law fine of up to $1 \n     million per violation.\n       Require anti-money laundering programs (Sec.

Sec. 302 and 303) by taxing \n     excess income earned from transferring that property offshore \n     to a related foreign entity, and by allowing the IRS to use \n     common sense methods to value the transferred property.\n       Repeal check-the-box rule for foreign entities and CFC \n     look-through rule (Sec. 304) to stop U.S. multinationals from \n     disregarding their offshore subsidiaries to avoid U.S. taxes \n     on passive income.\n       Stop offshore loan abuse (Sec. 305) by preventing \n     multinationals from artificially repatriating offshore funds \n     tax-free by treating them as short-term loans from their \n     offshore subsidiaries to their U.S. operations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PROHIBITION ON ENERGY TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) on June 25, 2013, President Obama issued a Presidential \n     memorandum directing the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to issue regulations relating to power \n     sector carbon pollution standards for existing coal fired \n     power plants;\n       (B) the issuance of that memorandum circumvents Congress \n     and the will of the people of the United States;\n       (C) any action to control emissions of greenhouse gases \n     from existing coal fired power plants in the United States by \n     mandating a national energy tax would devastate major sectors \n     of the economy, cost thousands of jobs, and increase energy \n     costs for low-income households, small businesses, and \n     seniors on fixed income;\n       (D) joblessness increases the likelihood of hospital \n     visits, illnesses, and premature deaths;\n       (E) according to testimony on June 15, 2011, before the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate by \n     Dr. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins University, ``The \n     unemployment rate is well established as a risk factor for \n     elevated illness and mortality rates in epidemiological \n     studies performed since the early 1980s. In addition to \n     influences on mental disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and \n     alcoholism, unemployment is also an important risk factor in \n     cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life \n     expectancy.'';\n       (F) according to the National Center for Health Statistics, \n     ``children in poor families were four times as likely to be \n     in fair or poor health as children that were not poor'';\n       (G) any major decision that would cost the economy of the \n     United States millions of dollars and lead to serious \n     negative health effects for the people of the United States \n     should be debated and explicitly authorized by Congress, not \n     approved by a Presidential memorandum or regulations; and\n       (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make United \n     States energy as clean as practicable, as quickly as \n     practicable, without increasing the cost of energy for \n     struggling families, seniors, low-income households, and \n     small businesses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that--\n       (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-income households, \n     and small businesses do not experience skyrocketing \n     electricity bills and joblessness;\n       (B) to protect the people of the United States, \n     particularly families, seniors, and children, from the \n     serious negative health effects of joblessness;\n       (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to develop and \n     authorize an appropriate mechanism to address the energy \n     needs of the United States and the potential challenges posed \n     by severe weather; and\n       (D) to restore the legislative process and congressional \n     authority over the energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not \n     promulgate any regulation relating to power sector carbon \n     pollution standards or any substantially similar regulation \n     on or after June 25, 2013, unless that regulation is \n     explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n                           TITLE II--PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 1201.
