Madam President, it is my pleasure to convene the 113th \nCongress. I welcome back all my colleagues to a place that we love, the \nU.S. Senate.\n  But in particular, I would like to welcome Illinois Senator Mark \nKirk. He has been away from us for a year recovering from an illness. \nWe are all grateful for his recovery. He has been an inspiration to us. \nToday, on the east front of the Capitol, to see him walk up those steps \nsaid it all. So we are very proud of him and glad he is back with us.\n  I also offer a special welcome to the 13 new Members of the Senate. I \nam confident that each Senator will treasure their memories in this \nhistoric legislative body, and that each will serve their State and our \nNation with distinction.\n  All of the Members of this freshman class are accomplished in their \nown right. I can remember many years ago--30 years ago, Madam \nPresident--being a new Member of the House. Speaker O'Neill called us \nin, in small groups, to talk to us. And he said to each of us: All of \nyou are accomplished or you would not be here. You are all politicians. \nIt is not a bad word. And I say that to all our Senators--the new \nSenators--that they are all accomplished or they would not be here, and \nthey should all understand that. They should have confidence in moving \ninto this body because they are just as experienced as the rest of us.\n  I trust that serving in the Senate will be the most rewarding \nexperience of their lives. In this Chamber the 113th Congress will face \nthe most significant challenges of our careers--not just the new \nMembers, all of us.\n  To turn those challenges into triumphs, I urge all Senators--new and \nexperienced--to draw not only on our varied experience at every level \nof government and public service, but also on each other's experience, \nregardless of political party.\n  Daniel Webster said: ``We are all agents of the same supreme power, \nthe people.''\n  Today, as we begin a new Congress, we are afforded the opportunity to \nreflect upon the successes and failures of past Congresses.\n  It has been said that the 112th Congress was characterized by some of \nthe sharpest political divisions in memory. But during the last \nCongress, there were also many commendable examples of compromise. The \nrecent effort to avert the fiscal cliff was an example of both the \ndivisions and the collaborations that mark a moment in history--and it \nwas a moment in history.\n  Although the process of resolving some of the fiscal issues facing \nthis country was extremely difficult and protracted, in the end our two \nparties came together to protect America's middle class. That is \nsomething of which we should all be proud.\n  As we advance the debate over the best way to strengthen our economy \nand reduce our deficit during this Congress, the 113th, Democrats will \ncontinue to stand strong for the principle of balance. I am hopeful and \nconfident my Republican colleagues will do the same.\n  Any future budget agreements must balance the need for thoughtful \nspending reductions with revenue from the wealthiest among us and \nclosing wasteful tax loopholes.\n  The 112th Congress, unfortunately, showed that we had some political \ndifferences, and these differences prevented us from accomplishing as \nmuch as we had hoped during the Congress that was just completed. But \nwe also passed very important legislation, such as the transportation \njobs bill. This was important because it kept 2 million people working, \nand we began the restoration, with that legislation, of our crumbling \ninfrastructure.\n  We made strides to reduce the Nation's deficit and prevented a tax \nincrease for 98 percent of American families and 97 percent of small \nbusinesses. I guess I should have started, Madam President, by telling \neveryone that the marks that people see on my face--that has nothing to \ndo with the fiscal cliff or the disagreements that Speaker Boehner and \nI had. It is from being very pale and living in the desert most of my \nlife.\n  We were able to accomplish, as I indicated, many things to reduce the \ndeficit and prevent a tax increase for American families and small \nbusinesses.\n  We reformed our patent system for the first time in six decades, gave \nsmall business owners access to the capital they need to compete, and \nreauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration, keeping 300,000 \nworkers employed. Not a single piece of that legislation became law \nwithout the votes of both Democrats and Republicans. All those \nlegislative initiatives I just talked about were bipartisan.\n  Unfortunately, many other worthy measures that passed the Senate with \nstrong, bipartisan support then languished, awaiting action by the \nHouse of Representatives. In the 113th Congress, it will be incumbent \nupon the House Republican leadership to allow bipartisan bills passed \nby the Senate to come to a vote before the full House of \nRepresentatives--not before the Republican Members only but before \nDemocrats and Republicans, all 435 Members of the House. Too many good \npieces of legislation died over the last 2 years because House \nRepublican leaders insisted on passing legislation with a majority of \nthe majority; that is, only Republicans. Democrats were ignored most of \nthe time. For example, postal reform, the Violence Against Women Act, \nthe farm bill, and relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy all passed \nthe Senate on a bipartisan basis after extensive deliberation and \ndebate. Yet the House failed to act on all four of these measures, and \nthere were others.\n  As Speaker Boehner saw on New Year's Day, when he allows every Member \nof the House to vote and not only Republican Members of the House to \nvote, Congress can enact bills into law. No legislation can pass the \nSenate without both Democrats and Republicans. During the 113th \nCongress, the Speaker should strive to make that the rule of the House \nof Representatives as well.\n  Still, it is true that the 112th Congress left much undone. That is \nwhy we resolve to pick up where we left off in just a few weeks. The \nfirst crucial matter we will address will be the long-overdue aid to \nvictims of Hurricane Sandy. I am hopeful that the House will act, as \nthey said, on the 15th. Then when we get back here, we will move on it \nvery quickly.\n  We need to strive to be more productive, and we will do little if we \ndon't address a major reason for our inefficiency. Simply, the Senate \nis not working as it should. That is why in the last Congress I made \nplain that Democrats would do something to fix those issues.\n  The beginning of a new Congress is customarily a time that the Senate \naddresses changes to its rules. In the last Congress, Democratic \nSenators Jeff Merkley, Tom Udall, Tom Harkin, and Sheldon Whitehouse \nmade the majority's case for change. I commend these passionate \nleaders. They have made compelling arguments for reform.\n  In recent months, Senators on both sides of the aisle set about \ntrying to broker a compromise. This group was led by two of the \ngreatest Senators who ever served in this body, the finest and the \nbest, Democratic Senator Levin of Michigan and Republican Senator \nMcCain of Arizona. They worked many hours with a group of six other \nSenators to come up with something they thought would work better, and \nI so appreciate their work. But in the waning weeks of the last \nCongress, Senators were justifiably occupied with other matters, \nincluding the fiscal cliff. But I believe this matter warrants \nadditional debate during the 113th Congress, which just started.\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\n  Senators deserve additional notice before voting to change Senate \nrules, so today I will follow the precedents set in 2005 and again in \n2011. We will reserve the right of all Senators to propose changes to \nthe Senate rules, and we will explicitly not acquiesce in the carrying \nover of all the old rules from the last Congress. It is my intention \nthat the Senate will recess today, rather than adjourn, to continue the \nsame legislative day and allow this important rules discussion to \ncontinue later this month.\n  I am confident that the Republican leader and I can come to an \nagreement that will allow the Senate to work more efficiently. We are \ngoing to talk again today. We just haven't had time, with the other \nthings we have been dealing with, to spend enough time together to do \nthis, but we definitely want to move forward to try to make this place \nwork better. I appreciate his willingness to work on this. I will do my \nvery utmost, as I know he will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/03/senate-section/article/S9-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9]\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to welcome everybody \nback after what we all realized was a somewhat abbreviated recess. In \nfact, I believe you would have to go back to 1970 to find the last time \nthe Senate was in session and voting between Christmas and New Year's.\n  In particular, I want to welcome back Senator Mark Kirk. He has made \na brilliant recovery since suffering a debilitating stroke almost a \nyear ago. The fact that Mark is here today says a lot about his \ntenacity, his dedication, and his commitment to the people of Illinois.\n  I am told that about two-thirds of the patients in the facility where \nhe has been recovering over the past year don't return to work, but \ntrue to form Mark opted for an experimental rehabilitation program so \ngrueling, it has been compared to military boot camp. His staff counted \n45 steps from the parking lot to the front door of the Senate, and \nduring his treatment he made walking those steps his goal. Today he did \nit. He did it. So we admire him for his spirit, and we applaud his \nachievement. It is wonderful to have him back and ready to work.\n  I would also like to welcome the new Members who take their oaths of \noffice today, particularly the four new Members of the Republican \nconference: Senator Flake of Arizona, Senator Fischer of Nebraska, \nSenator Cruz of Texas, and Senator Scott of South Carolina. \nCongratulations to you all. We welcome the energy and intelligence each \nof you brings to the challenges we face and especially to the \ntranscendent challenge of our time: a Federal debt so huge, so huge it \nthreatens to permanently alter an economy that has provided generations \nof Americans the opportunity to fulfill their dreams of a better life.\n  Four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits and projected \nspending that no realistic amount of tax revenue could cover have put \nus at a crossroads. Either we tackle our Nation's spending problem or \nit is going to tackle us. It is that simple, and there is no better \ntime to do the work we need to do than right now.\n  The bipartisan agreement we reached earlier this week was imperfect. \nI am the first to admit it--especially the process. But aside from \nshielding 99 percent of my constituents and many of yours from the \npainful effects of a middle-class tax hike--the President seemed all \ntoo willing, by the way, to impose that--it gave us something else: It \nsettled the revenue debate for good. The revenue debate is over. \nPresident Obama declared the other night that those he calls rich are \nnow paying their ``fair share,'' so it is time to move on.\n  The President got his revenue, and now it is time to turn squarely to \nthe real problem, which we all know is spending. We all knew that the \ntax hikes the President campaigned on were never going to solve the \nproblem. Now that he has gotten them, he has a responsibility to put \nhis preoccupation with taxes behind him and to work with us to actually \nsolve the problem at hand. It is time to face up to the fact that our \nNation is in grave fiscal danger--grave fiscal danger--and that it has \neverything to do with spending.\n  This is a debate the American people want us to have. The President \nliked to point out on the campaign trail that most Americans supported \nthe idea of taxing the rich. What he conveniently left out is that even \nmore Americans support the idea of cutting spending. One recent survey \nI saw said that about three-fourths of all Americans say they want to \nsee major spending cuts in Washington. When you look at some of the \nthings Washington has been wasting their dollars on, it is no wonder. I \nmean, if we can't stop spending taxpayer dollars on robo-squirrels, \ndancing robot DJs, or hot air balloon rides for Smokey the Bear, then \nthere is no hope at all because if we can't fix the easy stuff, the \nrobo-squirrels and the robot DJs, the things most of us agree on, how \nare we ever going to get at the hard stuff?\n  That is why the first step in this debate is for Democrats to get \nover their fanatical commitment to guarding every single dime the \ngovernment ever got its hands on. This has to stop. The best time to \nstop it is now.\n  There is actually no better time for this debate. In a couple of \nmonths the President will ask us to raise the Nation's debt limit. We \ncannot agree to increase that borrowing limit without agreeing to \nreforms that lower the avalanche of spending that is creating this debt \nin the first place. It is not fair to the American people, and it is \nnot fair to our children, whom we are asking to foot the bill. The \nhealth of our economy requires it, so now is the time to get serious \nabout spending.\n  If the past few weeks have taught us anything at all, it means the \nPresident needs to show up early this time. The American people will \nnot tolerate the kinds of last-minute crises that we have seen again \nand again over the last 4 years as a result of this President's chronic \ninactivity and refusal to lead on the pressing issues of our time. We \ndon't need speeches, we need action, and we need it now. We need \ncourage because the only way we are going to address the spending that \nis at the root of our Nation's fiscal problems is if the President is \nwilling to bring the members of his party to the table and get them to \nrise above the partisan voices on the left, who treat every single \npenny of government spending as sacred.\n  Hopefully, that kind of cooperation will be forthcoming but, if not, \nwe will have several opportunities in the coming months to force the \nconversation Washington needs to have. The first such opportunity, as I \nhave said, surrounds the President's upcoming request of us to raise \nthe debt ceiling. After that, there is the continuing resolution. But \nlet me be clear, there is no need for drama--no need for drama--and we \ndon't want any. The President knows as well as I do what needs to be \ndone. He can either engage now to significantly cut government spending \nor force a crisis later. It is his call.\n  But for the sake of the country we must have this debate now. So \ntoday I call on my friend the majority leader and the rest of my \nDemocratic colleagues to start working with us right now--not 1 hour, 1 \nday, or 1 week before we hit the debt limit but ahead of time for once \nso we can pass a bipartisan solution on spending that everyone will \nhave an opportunity to weigh in on in early February. We need a plan \nthat can pass the House and actually begin to get Washington spending \nunder control. If we are serious, we will get one done.\n  With taxes now off the table, the only way to achieve a balanced plan \nis to focus on the spending side of the equation, particularly, as the \nPresident pointed out, health care entitlement programs because, as I \nsaid, taxes simply can't go high enough to keep pace with the amount of \nmoney we have projected to spend on them without crushing our economy. \nThe best way to reform these programs is to make them work better. The \ndebt isn't exploding because these programs exist, it is exploding \nbecause they are inefficient. They were created in a different era--the \nera of black-and-white TV. They should be updated for the age of the \niPad, and we should want to fix them not just because we want to lower \nthe debt but because we want to strengthen and improve these programs \nthemselves.\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\n  Over the next few months it will be up to the President and his party \nto work with us to deliver the same kind of bipartisan resolution on \nspending that we have now achieved on taxes, but it needs to happen \nbefore the eleventh hour. For that to happen, the President needs to \nshow up this time.\n  The President claims to want a balanced approach. Now that he has the \ntax rates he wants, his calls for ``balance'' means he needs to join us \nin the effort to achieve meaningful spending reform. The President may \nnot want to have this debate, but it is the one he is going to have \nbecause the country needs it. Republicans are ready to tackle the \nspending problem, and we start today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/03/senate-section/article/S10-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, the majority and \nminority leaders are working together to try to find ways to move bills \nto the floor and get more amendments. I wish to give them time to \ncomplete that work. I therefore object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I know \nhe is working diligently and we have some very positive things \nhappening.\n  Madam President, as we begin the 113th Congress, I have submitted on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Merkley and Harkin a resolution to amend \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  Our proposal to reform the rules is simple, it is limited, and it is \nfair. Again, we are not ending the filibuster. We preserve the rights \nof the minority. We are only proposing the following:\n  No. 1, an end to the widespread abuse of silent filibusters. Instead, \nSenators would be required to go to the floor and actually tell the \nAmerican people why they oppose a bill or nominee in order to maintain \na filibuster;\n  No. 2, debate on motions to proceed to a bill, or to send a bill to \nconference, would be limited to two hours; and\n  No. 3, postcloture debate on a nominee--other than a justice to the \nSupreme Court--would be limited to 2 hours, rather than the current \nlimit of 30 hours.\n  These are sensible changes. These are reforms we are willing to live \nwith if we are in the minority. And yet, we are warned that these \nsimple reforms will transform the very character of the Senate. Will \nleave the minority without a voice. These arguments are covers for \ncontinued abuse of the rules.\n  The reforms are modest. Some would say too modest. But they would \ndiscourage the excessive use of filibusters. The minority still has the \nright to filibuster, but not the right to do so by simply making an \nannouncement and then going out to dinner or, more likely, to a \nfundraiser.\n  Let me just say again: Senators Merkley, Harkin, and I are not \ntalking about taking away the rights of the minority. We are not \nabolishing the right to debate or to filibuster.\n  But there must be change. The unprecedented use, and abuse, of the \nfilibuster and other procedural rules has prevented the Senate from \ndoing its job. We are no longer ``the world's greatest deliberative \nbody.'' In fact, we barely deliberate at all.\n  For most of our history the filibuster was used very sparingly. But, \nin recent years, what was rare has become routine. The exception has \nbecome the norm. Everything is filibustered--every procedural step of \nthe way--with paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the \nprocess, not send it into a deep freeze.\n  Since the Democratic majority came into the upper chamber in 2007, \nthe Senates of the 110th, 111th, and current 112th Congress have \nwitnessed the three highest totals of filibusters ever recorded. A \nrecent report found the current Senate has passed a record-low 2.8 \npercent of bills introduced. That is a 66 percent decrease from the \nlast Republican majority in 2005-2006, and a 90 percent decrease from \nthe high in 1955-1956.\n  I have listened with great interest to the arguments against rules \nreform by the other side. Each day, my Republican colleagues have come \nto the floor and made very impassioned statements in opposition to \namending our rules at the beginning of the new Congress. They say that \nthe rules can only be changed with a two-thirds supermajority, as the \ncurrent filibuster rule requires. And they have repeatedly said any \nattempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is ``breaking the rules \nto change the rules.'' This simply is not true.\n  The supermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct \nconflict with the U.S. Constitution. Article I Section 5 of the \nConstitution states that, ``Each House may determine the Rules of its \nProceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the \nConcurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.'' When the Framers required \na supermajority, they explicitly stated so, as they did for expelling a \nmember. On all other matters, such as determining the Chamber's rules, \na majority requirement is clearly implied.\n  There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents, sitting as \nPresident of the Senate, on the meaning of Article I Section 5 as it \napplies to the Senate. In 1957, Vice President Nixon ruled \ndefinitively: [W]hile the rules of the Senate have been continued from \none Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the Senate \nat the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as \nit does from the Constitution itself, cannot be restricted or limited \nby rules adopted by a majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of \nSenate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or \npractical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in a new \nCongress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed \nis, in the opinion of the Chair, unconstitutional.\n  Vice-Presidents Rockefeller and Humphrey made similar rulings at the \nbeginning of later Congresses.\n  I have heard many of my Republican colleagues quote Senator Robert \nByrd's last statement to the Senate Rules Committee. I was at that \nhearing, and have great respect for Senator Byrd and know that he was \none of the great Senate historians and deeply loved this institution. \nBut we should also consider Senator Byrd's other statements, as well as \nsteps he took as Majority Leader to reform this body.\n  In 1979, when others were arguing that the rules could only be \namended in accordance with the previous Senate's rules, Majority Leader \nByrd said the following on the floor: There is no higher law, insofar \nas our Government is concerned, than the Constitution. The Senate rules \nare subordinate to the Constitution of the United States. The \nConstitution in Article I, Section 5, says that each House shall \ndetermine the rules of its proceedings. Now we are at the beginning of \nCongress. This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of \nthe past.\n  In addition to the clear language of the Constitution, there is also \na longstanding common law principle, upheld in the Supreme Court, that \none legislature cannot bind its successors. For example, if the Senate \npassed a bill with a requirement that it takes 75 votes to repeal it in \nthe future, that would violate this principle and be unconstitutional. \nSimilarly, the Senate of one Congress cannot adopt procedural rules\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nthat a majority of the Senate in the future cannot amend or repeal.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. For \nexample, in 2003 Senator John Cornyn wrote in a law review article: \nJust as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent Congress \ncould not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot enact a rule that a \nsubsequent Senate could not amend by majority vote. Such power, after \nall, would violate the general common law principle that one parliament \ncannot bind another.\n  So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not \n``breaking the rules to change the rules.'' It is reaffirming that the \nU.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules, and that when there \nis a conflict between them, we follow the Constitution.\n  I find some of the rhetoric about amending our rules particularly \ntroubling. We have heard comments that any such reforms, if done by a \nmajority, would ``destroy the Senate.'' Again, I can turn to my \nRepublican colleagues to answer this accusation.\n  In 2005, the Republican Policy Committee released a memo entitled \n``The Constitutional Option: The Senate's Power to Make Procedural \nRules by Majority Vote.'' Not only does the memo support all of the \nsame arguments I make today in support of reform by a majority, but it \nalso refutes many of the recent claims about how the Senate will be \npermanently damaged.\n  In a section of the memo titled, ``Common Misunderstandings of the \nConstitutional Option,'' it responds to the misunderstanding that ``the \nessential character of the Senate will be destroyed if the \nconstitutional option is exercised'' with the following: When Majority \nLeader Byrd repeatedly exercised the constitutional option to correct \nabuses of Senate rules and precedents, those illustrative exercises of \nthe option did little to upset the basic character of the Senate. \nIndeed, many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger today \nin a body that still allows for extensive debate, full consideration, \nand careful deliberation of all matters with which it is presented.\n  What is more important about the Republican memo is the reason they \nbelieved a change to the rules by a majority was justified. Back then \nit was about the filibuster of judicial nominees--and what Republicans \nsaw as a break in longstanding Senate tradition. They claimed they \nweren't using the constitutional option as a power grab, but as a means \nof restoring the Senate to its historical norm.\n  The memo states the following: The Senate is a relatively stable \ninstitution, but its norms of conduct have sometimes been violated. In \nsome instances, a minority of Senators has rejected past practices and \nbipartisan understandings and exploited heretofore ``off limits'' \nopportunities to obstruct the Senate's business. At other times, a \nminority of Senators has abused the rules and precedents in a manner \nthat violates Senators' reasonable expectations of proper procedural \nparameters. These are efforts to change Senate norms and practices, but \nthey do not necessarily have the support of a majority.\n  Such situations create institutional conundrums: what should be done \nwhen a mere minority of Senators changes accepted institutional norms? \nOne option is to acquiesce and allow ``rule by the minority'' so that \nthe minority's norm becomes the Senate's new norm. But another option \nhas been for the majority of Senators to deny the legitimacy of the \nminority Senators' effort to shift the norms of the entire body. And to \ndo that, it has been necessary for the majority to act independently to \nrestore the previous Senate norms of conduct.\n  This is exactly where we find ourselves today. Back then, the \nRepublicans argued the constitutional option should be used because 10 \nof President Bush's judicial nominees were threatened with a \nfilibuster. I believe the departure from Senate tradition we see today \nis far worse.\n  Since Democrats became the majority party in the Senate in 2007, we \nhave faced the highest number of opposition filibusters ever recorded. \nLyndon Johnson faced one filibuster during his 6 years as Senate \nMajority Leader. In the same span of time Harry Reid has faced over \n385.\n  So, as the Republicans argued in 2005, ``[a]n exercise of the \nconstitutional option under the current circumstances would be an act \nof restoration.'' We must return the Senate to a time when every \nprocedural step was not filibustered.\n  But if my Republican colleagues really believe using the \nconstitutional option would be so harmful to the Senate, there is an \nalternative. We don't have to reform the rules with only a majority \nvote. That is up to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Each \ntime the filibuster rule has been amended in the past, a bipartisan \ngroup of senators was prepared to use the constitutional option. But \nwith the inevitability of a majority vote on the reforms looming, \nenough Members agreed on a compromise and they passed the changes with \ntwo-thirds in favor.\n  We could do that again this month. I know many of my Republican \ncolleagues agree with me. The Senate is not working. I said 2 years ago \nthat I would push for the same reforms at the beginning of the next \nCongress--regardless of which party was in the majority.\n  At the time, many people believed the Democrats would lose their \nmajority. So let me be clear. If Leader McConnell had become the new \nmajority leader today, on the first day of the 113th Congress, I would \nask him to work with me on implementing these same reforms.\n  I will say again. The proposed changes will reform the abuse of the \nfilibuster, not trample the legitimate rights of the minority party. I \nam willing to live with all of the changes we are proposing, whether I \nam in the majority or minority.\n  The other side has suggested that a change in the rules is an affront \nto the American public. But the real affront would be to allow the \nabuse of the filibuster to continue.\n  We have to change the way we do business. We have to govern. It is \ntime for us to pay attention to jobs and the economy and the things \nthat matter to American families. That was the message we were sent in \nthe election, and we would do well to listen to it.\n  Under the abuse of the current rules, all it takes to filibuster is \none senator picking up the phone. Period. It doesn't even require going \non the floor to defend it. Just a phone call by one senator. No muss, \nno fuss, no inconvenience. Except for the American public. Except for a \nnation that expects and needs a government that works--a government \nthat actually works together and finds common ground.\n  Some of my colleagues may believe the Senate is working as it should; \nthat everything is fine. Well, Madam President, we do not take that \nview. It isn't working. It needs to change. The American people, of all \npolitical persuasions, are clamoring for a government that actually \ngets something done. The challenges are too great, the stakes are too \nhigh, for a government of gridlock to continue.\n\n\n                               S. Res. 5\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, next week in Casper, a member of \nAmerica's greatest generation will be recognized by the Casper Area \nChamber of Commerce for a lifetime of service and leadership. I am \nhonored to tell my colleagues about my friend, R. Stanley Lowe.\n  In 1943, Stan was in college and had been deferred from the draft \nbecause of his studies. But, at age 19, he wanted to do his part to \nprotect our great Nation. He enlisted in the U.S. Merchant Marine. He \nserved on five ships in the Pacific and Atlantic, each voyage lasting \nseveral months. Stan became a staff officer, in charge of personnel and \npayroll. He was also a chaplain and medical officer, called a \npharmacist's mate and purser.\n  Stan served from 1943 to 1946, seeing things that would have a life \nlong impact on him. The Merchant Marine had the highest rate of \ncasualties of any service, dying at a rate of 1 in 26, and Stan was \nthere to help the injured and comfort the dying.\n  Following his service, he returned to Wyoming to complete his law \ndegree and then practice law in Rawlins. It was there he met the love \nof his life, Anne ``Pat'' Kirtland Selden Lowe, while they were skiing. \nShe was remarkable, too. Pat was among the first female geologists--and \na scholarship in her name continues to support students pursuing \ndegrees in geology at the University of Wyoming.\n  Wyoming has benefited immensely from Stan's career. He served in the \nState House of Representatives and was elected to be the county and \nprosecuting attorney for Carbon County. He spent the majority of his \ndistinguished career as general counsel for True Oil. In 1985, Stan led \na delegation of American lawyers on a goodwill tour to China. The legal \nprofession benefited from his wisdom through his service as counsel for \nthe American Judicature Society.\n  While practicing law, he never forgot about his service and his \nfellow veterans. Stan was appointed to the Wyoming Veterans' Affairs \nCommission by Governor Mike Sullivan in 1991 and upon his retirement he \nwas named chair emeritus. In 2003, Stan was awarded the Civilian \nMeritorious Service Medal. Stan has led the efforts to expand Wyoming's \nonly Veterans Cemetery. His passion for history paved the ground for \nthe Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum.\n  Stan served in supportive and leadership roles in multiple veterans' \norganizations. Stan is a 3 year district commander of the American \nLegion. He was recently honored with the title of Honorary Past \nDepartment Commander, a title only given four other times in the \nhistory of the Wyoming American Legion. Stan continues to highlight \nveterans events and issues through his weekly article in the Casper \nJournal and attends almost every troop homecoming and veterans event.\n  Wyoming's veterans have benefitted immensely from Stan Lowe's wisdom \nand leadership. Stan will turn 90 this year. Wyoming continues to look \nto Stan as the voice for veterans. My wife, Bobbi, and I are happy to \nhave Stan as our friend, and veterans all over Wyoming are fortunate \nbecause Stan chose to serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/03/senate-section/article/S12-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12-S13]\n   MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT, 112th CONGRESS\n\n\n               Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on January 3, 2013, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bills and \njoint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 443.
