Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nfor 1 hour, with the majority controlling the first half and the \nRepublicans the final half.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nH.R. 3979, the legislative vehicle for the unemployment insurance \nextension legislation.\n  The Senate will recess, as we do every Tuesday, from 12:30 p.m. to \n2:15 p.m., to allow for our weekly caucus meetings.\n\n\n                             Koch Brothers\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I went about my business in the Senate \nyesterday, I was informed the Koch brothers are at it again. We know \nthey are at it, but now they are at it in Nevada, among other places.\n  I am told one of their puppet organizations is going to run \ncommercials against me in Nevada. That is quite interesting. As I \nunderstand it, they had focused on places where there is an election. \nThey may not know it, but I am not running for anything for a few \nyears, until my 6-year term is up.\n  What issues will they raise in those ads they say they are going to \nrun in Nevada? That by my criticizing the Koch brothers, I have \nattacked their freedom of speech. The gall of these two brothers is \nstaggering.\n  Keep in mind, they are the fifth richest people not in whatever State \nthey live in--they have lots of different homes in America--but they \nare the fifth richest people in the world. These two mogul \nmultibillionaires are so eager to force their will on the American \npeople that they will do it even in the face of their own hypocrisy, \nwhich we have already established some time ago.\n  I am beginning to think April Fools' Day arrived 1 day early. See, it \nis a fool's errand for the Koch brothers to think they can use their \nmoney to frighten me or to brainwash Nevadans or the rest of the \ncountry. They are spending lots of money to try to do that. People of \nthis Nation trace their freedom of speech back to the Constitution, not \na bank account which has lots and lots of zeros at the end.\n  The Koch brothers are trying to use their immense wealth to buy their \nway around the laws and regulations of this Nation to make themselves \neven richer. Everything they do is so selfish, so self-centered in an \neffort to make them--I guess the sixth richest is not good enough, the \nfifth richest isn't good enough. They want to be the richest because \nthey are into making money and as much as they can. There is nothing \nwrong with that, except what they are doing with their money.\n  I know they say: Well, we gave money in--I think--New York City to \ncancer research. But what they have done to damage the National \nInstitutes of Health is not possible to measure.\n  Here are the rules the multibillionaire Koch brothers want to play \nby: They should be allowed to say false and misleading statements about \nthe Affordable Care Act, but we are not allowed to criticize them for \nit.\n  Just listening to the news, and I haven't heard anything from the \nWhite House directly, but I am told that yesterday, in 1 day, more \npeople signed up for ObamaCare than the previous 3 months. People are \nanxious to have health insurance. They are anxious to have health \ninsurance. I have been very satisfied that I and Members of my caucus \nand people around the country have been standing up to these moguls and \ntheir false, misleading, fearmongering ways.\n  It should be no surprise that these multimillionaire, billionaires, \nvery, very rich, fifth richest people in the world have decided: What \nwe will do is\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\ntry to frighten Reid. There have been times in my life when I have been \na little afraid, but I am not afraid of them. I understand they have \nspent $30,000. Let them spend $300,000 in Nevada. I don't care--and I \ntruly don't.\n  These oil barons have commissioned a group--one of their many \norganizations. As I have said on the floor, most of the ads we see we \nthink have come from Americans for Prosperity. That is their name. But \nthey funnel money through many organizations--the chamber of commerce. \nWhat does the chamber do with those ads? Run ads against Democratic \nSenators because the chamber of commerce is a Republican-oriented \norganization, and it is good to get money from the Koch brothers \nbecause they can hide under the chamber of commerce.\n  This organization they are now floating around that is going to run \nthese ads, against me I am told, is called American Encore. It was \npreviously called the Center to Protect Patient Rights. I guess that \ndidn't work so well, as well more than 10 million people have now \nsigned up for ObamaCare, people who didn't have the opportunity before. \nI guess they decided running ads against me is more important than \nprotecting patients' rights, so now they came up with another catchy \nname, American Encore.\n  No matter what they call their organization or the myriad of \norganizations, they all have one stated purpose, to make these oil \nbarons even richer. If anyone needs further proof--and I am not sure \nanyone does--take a look at the legislation they have influenced with \ntheir money. In recent years, the tea party-driven House of \nRepresentatives has never missed a chance to funnel more tax cuts to \nthe wealthy by raising taxes on the middle class.\n  The vast majority of wealthy people in America are willing to do \nmore. They have spoken to my friend the Presiding Officer. There are a \nlot of rich people in the State of New Jersey. Even though the \nPresiding Officer has worked with people who are badly in need of help, \npeople in New Jersey have walked up to the Presiding Officer and said: \nI am willing to pay more--and the same in Nevada. But every time we try \nto do something to get a few more resources to build roads, bridges, \nhighways, dams, water systems, sewer systems, Republicans in the \nCongress say no.\n  The Republicans in Congress do not represent mainstream Republicans \nin America today. They don't even represent mainstream rich Republicans \naround the country. They are driven by and they are afraid of the tea \nparty.\n  We have a budget proposal coming out today from the House of \nRepresentatives. The person who ran for Vice President the last go-\naround on the Republican ticket is the chairman of the Budget Committee \nand he is coming out with a budget. It is a blueprint for a modern \n``Kochtopia.'' In fact, call it whatever one wants. We might as well \ncall it the Koch budget because that is whom they are protecting, the \nKoch brothers.\n  I am fascinated by this. These proposals are called the Path to \nProsperity. It is a path to prosperity for some people--the rich--\nbecause that budget would end Medicare as we know it. Similar to the \nlast budget the chairman of the Budget Committee in the House came out \nwith, it would slash education funding while expanding tax loopholes \nfor the megarich.\n  Whose prosperity is being plotted in these schemes? Today, as we get \ncloser to the new Ryan budget, we will have to see how much of the Koch \nbrothers' agenda is reflected in this year's budget. We don't have to \nbe a fortune teller to know the similarities are extensive.\n  To any and all groups that wish to attack me on behalf of \nmultibillionaires, fire away. I am very happy--I am even proud--to be \ntargeted by those attacks and will gladly endure them in order to call \nattention to the unscrupulous acts of these two barons. But don't \nexpect Americans to go along with their attempt to rig our democracy \nand hand it over to a couple of power-hungry tycoons--I guess from \nKansas. I know they have homes in New York, and one of them lives near \nhere.\n  The country will be watching but not fooled by the Koch brothers' \nattempts to purchase influence for whom--for the Koch brothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Republican leader.\n\n\n                          Igniting the Economy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Washington Democrats have controlled \nthe White House and the Senate for years now. They have tried just \nabout every tool in the liberal toolbox to turn the economy around. Yet \naccording to the latest Gallup tracking poll, just 19 percent of \nAmericans think the economy is doing well. Millions are out of work, \nand close to 60 percent of Americans say things are getting even worse.\n  By basically any objective standard, we would have to say the \nWashington Democratic approach hasn't worked. We would have to say it \nis time for a change, to do something that can work, and that is what \nRepublicans are proposing again this week.\n  While Senate Democrats dust off the same poll-tested ideas for \npapering over the symptoms of malaise, Republicans are proposing \nconcrete ideas aimed at igniting the economy and giving people real \nhope for something more, something better than what they have been \ngetting for the last 5 years, something which speaks to their hopes and \ntheir potential. In other words, the other side is doubling down on the \nstatus quo while Republicans are offering change.\n  Specifically, we will be proposing numerous jobs-related amendments \nwhich have one unifying purpose; that is, to break through the \nstagnation of the Obama economy and kick domestic job creation into \nhigh gear.\n  Our approach is simple: Let's give free enterprise and private \ninitiative a chance. Let's use the tools we know can lead to the \ncreation of the stable, well-paying 21st century jobs our constituents \nwant and deserve.\n  Too often it seems our friends on the other side are single-mindedly \nfocused on treating the symptoms of a down economy rather than actually \nproviding struggling Americans with positive, meaningful paths to a \nbetter life. They can't seem to get their minds around any legislative \nproposal that puts ordinary Americans and private initiative in the \ndriver's seat instead of the government. To me that largely sums up the \ndifference between the parties. But it goes even further than that, \nbecause Washington Democrats are not just reluctant to embrace any idea \nthat doesn't emanate from Washington; they don't even want to hear \nabout it.\n\n  If we are going to get this country back on track, that needs to \nchange, and that is what Republicans are arguing for this week. What we \nare saying is, if all you want is subsistence-level relief, then that \nis what the party of government is going to give you. But if your goal \nis to help those who want to truly aspire to join the middle class, if \nyou want to really help people maximize their potential and build a \nbetter life, it is time to start looking beyond Washington.\n  Deep down I think our Democratic friends understand this too. I think \nthey understand that pushing big government legislation with words such \nas ``jobs'' or ``affordable'' in the title isn't the same as actually \ncreating jobs or actually making things more affordable. It is like \nhanding someone a menu instead of serving them a meal. The tragic \neffects to this approach are clear: from an Affordable Care Act that \nturned out to be anything but, to a stimulus bill that seemed better at \nstimulating late-night punch lines than good paying jobs. But despite \nall the evidence, Washington Democrats remain stubbornly attached to \nthe same old playbook. If you need proof, just take a look at the poll-\ntested, campaign-crafted agenda they rolled out this week--an agenda \npacked to the brim with base-pleasing show votes and few if any real \nsolutions for the middle class. In fact, the non-partisan Congressional \nBudget Office tells us that one of their proposals could cost up to a \nmillion jobs--cost jobs, not create jobs.\n  Look, this prioritization of party-pleasing show votes over actually \nhelping grow the middle class is a tragedy for our country. The \nAmerican people really deserve two national parties that are serious, \nand it is long past time for Democrats to start engaging with us in a \nserious effort to help Americans who struggle so much in the Obama \neconomy.\n  The good news is they will have their chance this week. The \nRepublicans are filing amendments on a whole range of\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\njob-centered policies, amendments that deserve not just a vote but \nbipartisan support. For example, an amendment from the junior Senator \nfrom South Carolina would eliminate ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek rule, \nwhich is hurting Americans' take-home pay in our already depressed \neconomy.\n  One of our Members from Utah is putting forward an amendment to \nrepeal ObamaCare's job-destroying medical device tax. A good number of \nDemocratic Senators have joined us in the past to get rid of this job \nkiller, and they deserve the opportunity to help us eliminate it once \nand for all.\n  The senior Senator from North Dakota has an amendment that would \nspeed approval of the Keystone Pipeline. This is a project that would \ncreate thousands of jobs right away, and it is just a no-brainer. \nSenate Democrats need to join Democrats across the country who have \nalready endorsed this commonsense initiative and help us pass it.\n  I personally plan to file an amendment that would give Congress the \nability to stop EPA's back-door national energy tax and would also keep \nunelected bureaucrats from blocking desperately needed jobs in Kentucky \nby sitting on surface mining permitting. Remember, this \nadministration's anti-Kentucky policies have helped bring about a \ndepression--that is a depression with a capital D--in many Kentucky \ncoal counties. It is about time they started having a little compassion \nfor the coal families who just want to put food on the table, and that \nis exactly what my amendment aims to do.\n  So these are just a few of the many proposals Republican Senators \nwill be putting forward this week. They represent the kind of solutions \nour country needs right now to finally emerge from this awful economy--\nreal solutions that focus on creating well-paying jobs, increasing \ntake-home pay, training a world-class workforce, and breaking a \nseemingly endless cycle of chronic high unemployment.\n  As I have indicated, we have tried the Washington Democratic approach \nfor years now. We know that it just hasn't worked. We know their new \nagenda isn't serious, that it is nothing more than an ObamaCare \ndistraction strategy. We know this because Democrats actually told us \nit was created by their campaign committee, that it was designed to \nappeal to their base.\n  So if the Democratic majority is finally ready to get down to \nbusiness and create jobs, this is a moment to prove it. This is the \nmoment to drop the endless campaigning. This is the moment to work with \nus to actually create jobs and help the middle class, and this is the \nmoment for legislation that would do just that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1885-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I listened carefully to the statement just made by the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, in which he promised \nconcrete ideas, real hope, change, job-related approaches, free \nenterprise--giving free enterprise a chance, trying to deal with \nputting America back to work. Then he gave us three examples.\n  I might say to the Senator that I am familiar with all three because \nnone of these are new. We have heard them over and over from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. I will not go through each one of them. A \ncouple of them relate to the Affordable Care Act. It is interesting to \nme that the House of Representatives has voted--I believe 45 times--to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act. The Senator from Kentucky said we have \nto get back to free enterprise ideas.\n  Let me tell you about the free enterprise idea when it came to health \ncare. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the free \nenterprise idea was this: If you and your family were unfortunate \nenough to have a sick baby, if your wife was a cancer survivor, if your \nchild had diabetes, the free enterprise answer was: We will raise the \ncost of health insurance to the point that you cannot afford it or we \nwon't even offer it. That was the free enterprise idea on health \ninsurance for millions of American families.\n  There was another free enterprise idea out there in health care as \nwell. It said: We are going to sell you health insurance policies that \njust protect you up to a certain amount of money. If tomorrow you are \nin a terrible auto accident, if the day after tomorrow you are \ndiagnosed with cancer and face millions of dollars of radiation, \nsurgery, and care before you can get your life back together again, be \nmy guest to pay for it yourselves. That is why medical bills are the \nnumber one driver of bankruptcy in America today. That is free \nenterprise at work. But we said, let's put some sensible rules for the \nroad in here, so that families who buy health insurance have the \npromise that they will have peace of mind when they face these life \nthreatening struggles which families face every day.\n  So we passed the Affordable Care Act and not a single Republican--not \none--not a single Republican would join us in that effort. We rejected \nthe free enterprise approach to health care and said let's have \nsomething that basically respects families, basically respects the \nneeds we all have to have protection when somebody in the house is \nsick. Not a single Republican would support us, and they never have \nsince.\n  The bill we passed isn't perfect. Changes will have to be made. I \nhave said that from the start, although I supported it. But not a \nsingle Republican has been willing to sit down and work on bipartisan \ncompromises and changes--not one. It is take it or leave it, and they \nwant to walk away from it.\n  We are not going back to those old days. I can guarantee them that \nthe American people will never return to their idea of health insurance \nbecause it was fundamentally unfair, it was too expensive, and a lot of \nAmericans didn't have a fighting chance to ever have health insurance \nonce in their lives. Things have changed. The reports are in, and the \nreports are telling us that dramatic things are occurring. As the \nAffordable Care Act's initial enrollment period closes, at least 9.5 \nmillion previously uninsured people have gained coverage. Some have \ndone so through the marketplaces created by law, some through private \ninsurance, others through an expanded Medicaid. Incidentally, Medicaid \nhas been expanded in about half of the States.\n  Listen to this: The increased coverage from the Affordable Care Act \nso far amounts to substantial progress toward one of the law's \nprincipal goals. It is the most significant expansion of health care \ncoverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid 49 years ago.\n  The Republicans want to return to the ``good old days,'' and they \nwant to tell these people being uninsured is really better for you. It \nis the free enterprise system.\n  That is not good enough, I say to my friends on the other side of the \naisle. What we have here is an opportunity for families for the first \ntime in their lives to have health insurance coverage.\n  Has there ever been a moment in your life where you had a sick baby \nand you were in the hospital waiting room and you had no health \ninsurance? I have. It happened when I was in law school. I remember it \nto this day, sitting there with my wife and baby with a number in my \nhand waiting to see who would walk through that door and be the doctor \nfor my baby. You will never forget that as long as you live. That \nshouldn't happen to anybody. Everyone should have the peace of mind of \nhealth insurance coverage, and that is what this bill does. If the \nSenators on the other side want to return to the\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n``good old days'' of no coverage, I can just tell you, America is not \ngoing back.\n\n  We are not going back to the days when families with kids graduating \nfrom college had no health insurance while they looked for a job. We \nprotect those families until the kids reach the age of 26. We are not \ngoing back to the days when struggling senior citizens can't afford to \npay for their prescription drugs because of the so-called doughnut \nhole. We are not going back to that day. We are going to move forward \nas a Nation.\n  Is this bill perfect? Of course not. Should it be changed for the \nbetter? Yes. But let's not lose sight of what we have achieved and what \nwe can achieve if we work together.\n\n\n                            The Minimum Wage\n\n  When it comes to the creation of jobs, there is something else I want \nto say. I believe that people who get up and go to work every single \nday, who work hard for a living and are not lazy at all, should not be \nliving in poverty. That is it--a basic statement. If you want to go to \nwork, work hard 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty in \nAmerica, and that is happening because the minimum wage is $7.25 an \nhour. Do the math. It is less than $16,000 a year to live on. Who could \ndo it? Well, some people try and struggle paycheck to paycheck.\n  Yesterday in Chicago, IL, Gloria came to the microphone in the \nFederal Plaza and told the story of working a minimum-wage job. She has \ntwo kids and lives in a homeless shelter--40 hours a week on minimum \nwage and living in a homeless shelter. Come on. This is a better \nNation.\n  Would I pay 10 cents more for a hamburger so Gloria would have enough \nmoney to have the dignity to live in her own place with her children? \nYou bet I would, and I wouldn't think twice about it. We ought to have \nrespect for people who work in this country. Raising the minimum wage \nto $10.10 an hour is our show of respect for the people who get up and \ngo to work every darn day. They are on the buses of New Jersey in the \nmorning. They are on the trains of Chicago in the morning. They just \ndropped the kids off, and they are hoping that they are going to be \nsafe because it is a neighbor and it is the best they can do for \ndaycare. There wasn't a lot in the refrigerator when they left their \nhouse. They are hoping to pick up something before they get home. They \ngo to work every day, and they know that struggle is going to be \nrepeated over and over.\n  The free enterprise system is the best system in the world, but there \nare moments when we need to step in as the American family and set some \nstandards, set some goals.\n\n\n                   Unemployment Compensation Benefits\n\n  The same thing is true for unemployment compensation. We finally have \na bipartisan approach to this in the Senate--five Democrats and five \nRepublicans. We have worked out a plan we are going to pass, I think--\nlet's keep our fingers crossed. We are going to pass an extension of \nunemployment benefits.\n  What do these benefits mean? It means if you are out of work--some \npeople who work for 20 years in the same place, lost their jobs, now \nthey are trying to find another job--we are going to help you keep your \nfamily together while you are looking for that job. How much money are \nwe talking about here? The average is $300 a week.\n  How long could you get by on $300 a week? It would be tough, wouldn't \nit, to pay the rent, mortgage, utility bills, food, clothes, shoes for \nthe kids, cell phone--you need that to find a job, don't you--300 bucks \na week. Well, we have a chance to pass a bipartisan bill on \nunemployment compensation for a 5-month period to cover these folks, \nand the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John \nBoehner, says: Forget it--dead on arrival. Won't even take it up; won't \nconsider it. I think he's wrong, and I think it is unfair, and I think \nthese people deserve a fighting chance. They want to become part of the \nfree enterprise system again, and our giving them a helping hand in \ntime of need is what every family expects and what they usually offer \nwhen asked to help. But instead, what Speaker Boehner has said is: No \nway, you are out of it. You are out of work. You are out of luck. I \ndon't buy it.\n  There have been times in my life and in the lives of most people when \nneighbors, friends and relatives, and even the government came in to \ngive a helping hand. For me it was government loans when I went to \nschool. I couldn't have done it without it. I think it has paid off. It \nsure has in my life. Ultimately the voters have the last word about \nwhether Speaker Boehner's approach against unemployment compensation is \nthe right way to do it.\n\n  There is another bill we are going to take up next week--pay equity. \nMy wife and I have been blessed with a daughter and a son. They are \nboth in the marketplace and both are talented. We are so proud of them. \nThere is no reason why a daughter should be paid less than a son for \nthe same work, but it happens every single day.\n  We have to establish a standard in America of equal opportunity and \nmean it, equal opportunity when it comes to daughters and sons and \nwomen and men in the workplace. It is not too much to ask.\n  The first bill President Obama signed into law as President was the \nLilly Ledbetter Act. I remember this woman. She worked in Alabama in a \ntire factory. After she had been there more than 10 years, she finally \nrealized she was doing the same job as the man standing next to her but \npaid less every single day. She had enough of it so she brought a \nlawsuit against the company. The Supreme Court turned her away so we \nhad to change the law, and the President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act \ninto law to make sure women had a fighting chance.\n  We now want to move it to a new level and make sure that pay equity \nfor those in the workplace is an American dream come true. We can do \nthat. The free enterprise system is good, but, listen--let's be honest \nabout it--in some aspects it doesn't reach the goals we want in terms \nof equal opportunity in this country.\n  I also want to make a point about the whole question of affordable \ncare. I happened to have met a man by the name of Ray Romanowski. He \nwas in a health care clinic in Chicago. He is 62 years old and has been \na part-time worker and musician most of his life. For the first time in \nhis life Ray Romanowski has health insurance. He has a Medicaid card. \nHe was patting his wallet, and he said: I can't tell you how good I \nfeel now that I finally got this health insurance.\n  There are some people who don't understand Medicaid. Medicaid is \nhealth insurance for low-income people in America, and millions depend \non it every single day. Recently some Republicans made statements \ndiscrediting the Medicaid Program. Let me set the record straight: \nMedicaid is successful. It has been a lifeline for millions of people, \nand especially for children. My friends on the other side of the aisle \nfind it easy to discredit a government program. As Senator McConnell \nsaid earlier, we tend to look to the government. Well, we do when there \nis no place else to look. In this case, these individuals had no chance \nfor health insurance without government's help. Over 54 million people \nbenefit from Medicaid, and it is not surprising that interest in this \nprogram grows when our economy is struggling.\n  Before the Affordable Care Act, two out of three people on Medicaid \nwere pregnant women and children--36 million of our most vulnerable \ncitizens. Medicaid also serves the disabled. It has been a lifeline for \nthose who have a low income and are disabled. Before the Affordable \nCare Act, almost 3 million people were covered by Medicaid in Illinois \nand over 50 percent of all births were covered by Medicaid. Since the \nAffordable Care Act was signed into law, over 210,000 people in \nIllinois have signed up for Medicaid, and thousands more who are \neligible are in the process of finishing up their paperwork, and that \nis a success.\n  According to 2011 data, 65 percent of all office space physicians in \nIllinois would take Medicaid patients. Nationwide the number is 70 \npercent. This argument that new Medicaid patients won't have a place to \ngo for care is wrong.\n  I see that Senator Harkin from Iowa, chairman of our HELP Committee, \nis on the floor. He was one of the real leaders when it came to the \ndetermination of the Affordable Care Act and how many people would be \ncovered. I will yield the floor to him in 1 minute, but before I yield, \nlet me say this: The Affordable Care Act is making a difference. For \npeople in the low-income\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\ncategory, Medicaid means when they walk into a hospital facing a \nmedical emergency or need for care, they will not walk away leaving \nbills behind them. Their bills will be paid by the Medicaid system, and \nthat is part of what we are trying to achieve--the personal \nresponsibility that every person, every family, and every business will \nhave a responsibility to have health insurance and an opportunity for \nan affordable alternative.\n  The free enterprise system is a strong system. The free enterprise \nsystem created unfairness and injustice when it came to health care, \nwhich we are addressing with this Affordable Care Act.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Harkin and thank him for his leadership \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank our majority whip again \nfor telling it like it is and what is happening with health care in \nAmerica today. We have come too far to turn back. We have made \ntremendous changes in the way people are going to access the health \ncare system in America because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Look, we all admit there were mistakes made. Were there glitches? \nYes. But we went from a system where people were excluded from getting \nhealth care, and Senator Durbin talked about them. There are various \npeople with preexisting conditions, kids and people who had no access \nto health care whatsoever, and now they are covered. That is a huge \nleap in this country. We made some mistakes, had a few glitches, and we \nworked those out.\n  Our friends on the other side say: No, ditch the whole thing. Get rid \nof everything. Turn the clock back. I agree with the Senator from \nIllinois, people don't want to turn the clock back. They want to move \nahead. They are getting covered more than ever before with affordable \ncoverage they have never had before and we are not going to turn the \nclock back. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1887-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1887-S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take the time this morning to \ntalk about an issue that has been brewing for a long time and is going \nto come to a head in the Senate sometime in the next several days, I \nhope, and it is one which compels us to do something, and that is to \nraise the minimum wage in the United States of America. We have waited \ntoo long to do this, and so we have to act on it as soon as possible.\n  I wish to point out some of the data and some of the statistics \nconfronting us right now. First of all, why should anyone be afraid of \nvoting to raise the minimum wage? The American people are way ahead of \nus on this. Let's look at the polling data.\n  This chart shows the results of a poll to increase the minimum wage \nto $10.10 an hour. It shows that 73 percent of all voters want to raise \nthe minimum wage, and that 90 percent of Democrats, 71 percent of \nIndependents, and even 53 percent of Republicans say we ought to be \nraise the minimum wage. The vast majority of American people want to do \nthis.\n  This is again a chart from across the country. We have Arkansas, \nFlorida, Georgia, my State of Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Wisconsin--\n52 percent, 73 percent, 61 percent, and 54 percent. The vast majority \nof Americans in these States say: Yes, we need to raise the minimum \nwage, so it is not just one part of the country.\n  Small business owners support raising the minimum wage. A poll done \nof small business owners shows that 57 percent say we should raise the \nminimum wage as opposed to 43 percent. Small businesses get it.\n  The voters say that raising the minimum wage will help the economy. \nThis comports with over 600 economists--including what several Nobel \nprize economists have said--who say that raising the minimum wage will \nboost aggregate demand and raise the GDP in America. The economy will \nbenefit.\n  Well, you know what. The American people get it. They may not \nunderstand all of the intricacies of economics and economic analysis, \nbut they get it. Of those who were polled, 56 percent believe it will \nhelp the economy, 22 percent said they don't know, and only 21 percent \nsay it will hurt the economy. The vast majority of Americans understand \nin their bones that raising the minimum wage is going to help the \neconomy. Why? Because they know it will put more spending power in \ntheir pockets.\n  When people in lower wage jobs get more money, what do they do? They \ndon't go to Europe, they don't buy private islands and private jets, \nthey spend it in the local economy, such as Main Street, where the \nsmall businesses are. Again, the American people get it.\n  Why should we be concerned about this right now? The minimum wage has \nnot kept up with average wages. In 1968, the minimum wage was 53 \npercent of the average wage in America. Today it is 36 percent of the \naverage wage in America, which is a tremendous decline between those \nwho get the minimum wage and what the average wages are in America.\n  Since 2009, the last time we had an increase in the minimum wage, \nlet's look at what happened to the things that low-income people have \nto spend their money on. As I said, they are not renting private jets \nand they are not going to fancy restaurants to eat, but they do have to \nspend money on electricity, rent, auto repair, food at home, childcare, \nand mass transit. So the minimum wage has gone up 0 percent since 2009. \nElectricity has gone up 4.2 percent, rent has gone up 7.3 percent, auto \nrepair has gone up 7.6 percent, food at home has gone up 8.8 percent, \nchildcare has gone up 11.7 percent, and mass transit has had a 18-\npercent increase. If you are a minimum wage worker, all of your costs \nhave gone up, but your income has basically stayed the same.\n  Here is another thing the American people get; they understand this. \nCEOs get big raises. Since 2009, the last time we had an increase in \nthe minimum wage, CEO raises have gone up 23 percent, 14 percent, and 5 \npercent, which is about 40-some percent. Minimum wage has stayed the \nsame. Those at the top keep getting more and more and more, but low-\nincome workers get nothing. They keep falling further and further \nbehind.\n  How are we doing compared to other countries? We always say, we are \ndoing all right. What are we doing compared to other countries? Here is \nan example of the national minimum wage rate in nominal U.S. dollars. \nRight now the United States is third from the bottom. There is \nPortugal, Spain, and there is the United States. Look at who is ahead \nof us: Austria, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Ireland, \nBelgium, France, Luxembourg, and Australia. Australia's minimum wage is \n$16.34 an hour in U.S. dollars. France's minimum wage is $11.98, \nIreland is $11.16; New Zealand is at $10.96 an hour. We are way behind \nother countries in what the minimum wage is.\n  Here is who benefits: Twenty-eight million workers will get a raise \nif we raise the minimum wage. Fifteen million women, thirteen million \nmen, four million African-American workers--I will have more to say \nabout that--7 million Hispanic workers, and 7 million parents will get \na raise. Again, that is not just minimum wage workers. Almost everyone \nwho makes less than $10.10 an hour--and many who earn just above \n$10.10--will get a raise. It will not just be those who are making \n$7.25, there will be a lot of other people who will also get a raise.\n  That is another thing I have heard from my Republican friends. They \nsay: Well, there are a lot of people who are making up to $40,000 a \nyear and families will make more money. That is true. Raising the \nminimum wage will not just help people who are in poverty. It is true \nthat it helps to get them out of poverty, but it also helps low-income \nfamilies. Let's say there are two workers in the family and they are \nboth low-income workers. They are making above the minimum wage, but \nthey are low income. Perhaps you have a family with three kids and the \nbreadwinner makes a decent income of $30,000 and the other makes \nminimum wage; that family too will get an increase.\n  Here is what happens: About 21 percent of workers in America will get \na raise, and almost everyone has family income of less than $60,000 a \nyear. Eighty-three percent of workers who will get a raise under my \nbill are in\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nAmerican families making less than $60,000 a year; that is middle \nAmerica. There are a few workers--17 percent--that economists tell us \nhave family income over $60,000, that will also get a boost. But the \nmajority are families making less than $60,000 a year. It is a middle-\nclass bill.\n  Raising the minimum wage helps middle-class families, and it also \ndoes one other important thing--it helps kids. We don't think about \nthis a lot. There are 14 million kids who will benefit from raising the \nminimum wage--14 million kids who are now in low-income families and \nstruggling to get by.\n  I thought it was interesting that the American Pediatric \nAssociation--the folks you take your babies to to see the doctor and \nstuff--says raising the minimum wage will help our kids. It will help \nthem to develop better, have better oral health, better immunization \nrates, and decrease the rate of obesity and its complications. The \nAmerican Pediatric Association Task Force on Child Poverty supports \nraising the minimum wage. They get it. They see these kids in poverty \nand low income. They know what is happening to them. By raising the \nminimum wage, you will help kids have a better life and a better start \nin life.\n  I will talk a little bit about the basics of this bill. First of all, \nour bill, the Minimum Wage Fairness Act, would raise the minimum wage \nfrom $7.25 an hour--where it has been since 2009--to $10.10 an hour in \nthree steps: 95 cents, 95 cents, and 95 cents over 3 years. We then \nindex it to inflation in the future, so no longer will people who make \nthe minimum wage fall below the poverty line. We keep it above the \npoverty line.\n\n  The third thing our bill does is raise the minimum wage for tipped \nworkers. Can my colleagues believe this? When I tell people this, they \nsay: No, you must be wrong, Harkin.\n  Tipped workers in America today have a minimum wage of $2.13 an hour. \nPeople say that can't be right. It is. It has been at $2.13 an hour \nsince 1991. Imagine that--$2.13. Our bill would raise that from $2.13 \nan hour, over about a 6-year period of time, to 70 percent of the \nminimum wage, which is much closer to what it was historically, before \n1991. So it raises it to 70 percent of the minimum wage over 6 years \nand then indexes that also in the future.\n  So, again, why did we settle on $10.10 an hour? Why not $9? I have \nheard that bandied about a lot. Well, here is why we raised it: because \nwe know where the poverty line is. Back in 1968 the minimum wage was \n120 percent of poverty. So we said: If we raise the minimum wage and we \nwant to get it just above the poverty line and index it for the future \nso we wouldn't fall below, where would that be? Well, to get to 107 \npercent of the poverty line--just above the poverty line--it would be \n$10.10. So, again, in 1968 the minimum wage was 120 percent of the \npoverty line. Now it is at 81 percent of the poverty line, and our bill \nwould raise it to 107 percent of the above line for a family of three. \nThat is why we raise it to $10.10--because it hits above the poverty \nline--and then we index it in the future.\n  Let's look at the historic average on this. People say: Isn't that a \nbig increase?\n  Well, historically, whenever we have raised the minimum wage, the \npercent increase has been about 41 percent. Our bill raises it 39 \npercent. So we wanted to keep it also within the boundaries of what we \nhave done in the past. Going clear back to 1939, the average has been \nabout 41 percent.\n  My colleagues might notice that in the 1990s there was a 27 percent \nand a 21 percent increase. That is because for some odd reason we \nraised it twice in the 1990s.\n  So we looked at the decades. Historically, we have raised the minimum \nwage about once every decade. If we look at it in the decades, we are \nagain right about average: 150 percent, 33, 60, 81; in the 1980s it was \nonly 16; then in the 1990s we had two steps, 54 percent. In 2007 when \nwe passed it we raised it 41 percent. By the way, that was signed into \nlaw by a Republican President, not a Democratic President.\n  So we wanted to get it above the poverty line, index it there but \nkeep it within the boundaries of sort of what we have done in the past, \nand that is what this bill does. So it is critical to get it above the \npoverty line.\n  The minimum wage has lost 32 percent of its purchasing power. So \n1968--if we had kept the minimum wage at the same relative status from \n1968 to now, the minimum wage would be $10.71 an hour. It is now $7.25. \nSo in those years 32 percent of its purchasing power has been lost by \nminimum wage workers.\n  Again, I want to cover tipped wages a little bit because that is \nanother important part of our bill.\n  People say: Well, tipped wages--people make tips and all that.\n  We keep hearing from some entities that if we raise the tipped wage, \nit is going to hurt the economy and it is going to hurt the restaurant \nbusiness. That is just not so. Look at the poverty rates.\n  This chart shows restaurant servers, right here. If we take a State \nthat has a $2.13 minimum wage, which is the Federal minimum wage for \ntipped workers--the poverty rate among tipped restaurant workers is \n19.4 percent. Some States have already said they are going to have \ntheir tipped wages the same as the minimum wage. They have done that. \nWhere we have a full State minimum wage for tipped workers the same as \neverybody else, the poverty rate just among restaurant workers falls to \n13.6 percent.\n  If we look at all tipped workers--and a lot of people think that with \ntipped workers, we are only talking about people who wait on tables. \nThat is not so. Forty percent of all tipped workers are not restaurant \nworkers. Right now, we are talking about pizza delivery people, parking \nlot attendants, people who work in hair salons, including manicurists--\nthat is about 40 percent of tipped workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for allowing me a few more minutes.\n  The point being, if we look at all tipped workers in States with a \n$2.13 minimum wage, the poverty rate is 16.1 percent. Where a State has \na minimum wage the same for tipped and not tipped, the poverty rate is \n12.1 percent.\n  We also hear that job growth will be lost if we increase the minimum \nwage. Well, again, we have done some data-taking. If we look at tipped \nrestaurant worker job growth, just from 2009 to 2012, in States that \nhave a $2.13 minimum wage--tipped wage, the same as Federal--the job \ngrowth among restaurant workers has been 2 percent. In a State that has \na minimum wage for tipped workers the same as everybody else, the job \ngrowth has been twice as much--4 percent. This is just among tipped \nrestaurant workers.\n  Look over here at sales per capita in restaurants. This is sales per \ncapita in the State. In those States with a $2.13 minimum wage, $1.42 \nper capita; in States with a full minimum wage, $1.68 per capita. That \nis why economists are saying raising the minimum wage and raising the \ntipped minimum wage is good for the economy. It increases aggregate \ndemand.\n  People say: Why would this job growth be more? Why would the sales be \nmore in a State with a higher minimum wage for restaurant workers?\n  Easy. If the restaurant workers themselves are making enough money to \ngo out and eat or to do other things, they increase the wages for all \nof the other restaurant workers in the State. That is true. How many \ntimes have I heard from people who wait on tables, restaurant workers, \nsay: I wish I could make some more money. I would like to go out to eat \nsometimes too.\n  But they don't make enough money to do that. But in the States where \nthey have a full State minimum wage, both job growth and sales per \ncapita are much greater.\n  Lastly, this is what is unconscionable. This is a restaurant worker \nin the District of Columbia. She got a paycheck, and her paycheck is \nfor zero dollars and zero cents. Have my colleagues ever seen a \npaycheck for zero dollars? Why is that? Because she is a tipped worker \nmaking $2.77, and after they took out her FICA taxes and other taxes \nand things such as that, she got zero dollars. So therefore she had to \nrely upon only her tips.\n  But what are tips? Here is what a lot of people don't understand. How \ndo we\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nclassify a tipped worker? How do we do that? If a person makes more \nthan $30 a month in tips, a person can be classified as a tipped \nworker. Think about that--if a person makes more than $30 a month. So \nif a person works 5 days a week for a month, that is $1.50 a day. If a \nperson makes more than $1.50 a day in tips, a person can be classified \nas a tipped worker and be paid $2.13 an hour. We look at that and say \nthat can't be right. But it is right. That is exactly what is \nhappening.\n  Tipped workers are getting to be at the bottom of the barrel. Yet we \nrely upon them for so many things--people pushing wheelchairs in the \nairport, valet attendants, parking attendants. There are a lot of \npeople who are classified as tipped workers if they make more than $30 \na month in tips--$1.50 a day. Think about that--$1.50 a day. They get \nthat, they get classified as a tipped worker, and they can be paid \n$2.13 an hour.\n  So, again, the time has come. The people of America understand this. \nWorking families understand it. This is a civil rights bill. It is a \nwomen's issue bill. I say it is a civil rights bill because if we look \nat the people who are going to get benefits--13 million people--28 \npercent of African-American workers, 32 percent of Hispanic workers, 19 \npercent of Asian and other workers will get a raise. This is a civil \nrights bill. It is a women's issue bill because 55 percent of the \npeople in America making low wages who will get a raise are women. It \nis a children's issue. Kids who aren't getting adequate health care and \nnutrition and childcare are the kids of people making the minimum wage \nor tipped wages, even less. So it is a civil rights issue, it is a \nwomen's issue, it is a kids issue, and it is an economic issue for \nAmerica.\n  It is time to give America a raise and raise the minimum wage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1889-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1889-S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  JOBS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \njobs. Once again, this week the Senate is taking up an extension of \nunemployment benefits, which will be the 13th such extension since \n2008.\n  Arguably, of course, we came out of an economic downturn and a lot of \npeople were hurt by that; a lot of people were in need of help and \nassistance. Yet here we are, 6 years later, and we are still talking \nabout extending unemployment benefits. Why? Because we haven't created \nenough jobs necessary to get the people who have been unemployed for a \nperiod of time back to work. Once again we have Senate Democrats \nignoring the real issue, which is the lack of jobs that has left so \nmany Americans struggling to find work.\n  The solution to years of high unemployment is not perpetual \nextensions of unemployment benefits but the creation of new jobs--\nsteady, good-paying jobs with the opportunity for advancement. Workers \ndon't want to spend years on meager government benefits; they want to \nreturn to work. But in order for that to happen, there have to be jobs \navailable, and there haven't been too many jobs over the past 5 years.\n  That is why Republicans have proposed a number of amendments to the \nunemployment insurance legislation that would remove obstacles to job \ncreation and encourage businesses to expand and hire new workers. \nUnfortunately, Democrats have shown little interest in job creation \nover the past 5 years, so they are happy to extend unemployment \nbenefits 13 times in 6 years, but they are unwilling to actually do \nanything to treat the causes of unemployment and to help hurting \nworkers get the jobs they are looking for.\n  In fact, Democrats' record on job creation has been pretty dismal.\n  There was the stimulus bill, which completely failed to bring about \nthe economic growth the President promised.\n  There are thousands of new regulations the administration has placed \non businesses which stifle job creation.\n  The backdoor national energy tax which the EPA is trying to put on \npower companies in this country is going to be passed on. People across \nthis country who can least afford it are going to be looking at much \nhigher utility bills.\n  We have the Keystone Pipeline, which has generated open hostility \nfrom Members on the other side, and of course we know that has \nimmediate job creation potential. The Keystone Pipeline, according to \nthe President's own State Department, would create 22,000 shovel-ready \njobs, which could become available as soon as we get the pipeline \napproved.\n  Of course, there is the ObamaCare legislation, passed several years \nago, which continues to wreak havoc on job creation in this country. \nChief among the burdens ObamaCare places on business is the employer \nmandate, which requires all businesses with 50 or more full-time \nworkers, which the administration defines as 30 hours or more a week, \nto provide government-approved health insurance or to pay a fine.\n  That is financially impossible for thousands of nonprofits and \nbusinesses with small profit margins such as restaurants. As a result, \nmany of these businesses are being forced to cut workers' hours below \n30 hours a week to reduce the number of full-time employees on their \nbooks. And when they hire new workers, they are hiring part-time--not \nfull-time--employees.\n  The employer mandate is also discouraging a lot of small businesses \nfrom hiring at all. Businesses that planned to expand are now deciding \nthey will be safer financially if they keep their businesses below 50 \nemployees. As a result, many new jobs are simply not being created.\n  Then there is the costly tax on lifesaving medical devices such as \npacemakers and insulin pumps. This ObamaCare tax, which is so \neconomically damaging that it is opposed by many Democrats as well as \nRepublicans, has already affected more than 300,000 jobs in the medical \ndevice industry. If the tax is not repealed soon, many more jobs in the \nindustry will be lost entirely or sent overseas.\n  Ultimately, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that ObamaCare \nwill result in up to 2.5 million fewer full-time workers. On top of \nthat, the Budget Committee estimates the law will reduce wages by more \nthan $1 trillion.\n  Right now more than 10 million Americans are unemployed. Nearly 4 \nmillion of them have been unemployed for more than 6 months. \nPerpetually extending unemployment benefits does not fix that problem. \nWe need to start creating jobs.\n  I have an amendment to the legislation before us. It is called the \nSolutions to Long-Term Unemployment Act. It includes four commonsense \nmeasures that would support the unemployed and make it easier and \ncheaper for employers to hire new workers.\n  For starters, my amendment would provide direct support to unemployed \nworkers by offering a one-time, low-interest loan of up to $10,000 to \nallow an individual who has been out of work for 6 months or longer to \nrelocate to a city or State that has a lower unemployment rate.\n  Unemployment rates vary substantially across the United States. My \nhome State of South Dakota, for example, has an unemployment rate of \n3.6 percent, which is far below the national average. We have a hard \ntime in my State of South Dakota, believe it or not, in actually \nfinding workers to fill the jobs. I talk to employers all the time in \nmy State who are trying to find people to fill the jobs that are \navailable in South Dakota.\n  So moving to a State with a low unemployment rate can substantially \nincrease workers' chances of getting a job. Unfortunately, most long-\nterm unemployed Americans lack the means to pack up and move to a new \ncity or State.\n  My amendment would help ensure that lack of resources does not \nprevent Americans from heading out to where the jobs are.\n  My amendment also would support workers by cleaning up the mess that \nis Federal worker training programs. Currently, there are more than \n50--50--worker training programs spread across nine different Federal \nbureaucracies. Needless to say, that leads to a lot of duplication. And \nworse, a majority of these programs have never been evaluated to see if \nthey actually work.\n  My amendment would consolidate 35 of these programs into one \nstreamlined\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nprogram and move control to the States. With every State facing \ndifferent unemployment challenges, trying to administer a one-size-\nfits-all program from Washington makes absolutely no sense. Putting \nStates in control would allow each State to tailor its workforce \ntraining programs to the needs of its own citizens.\n  My amendment would also provide two incentives to encourage \nbusinesses to hire the long-term unemployed.\n  First, my amendment would permanently exempt long-term unemployed \nworkers from ObamaCare's requirement that businesses with 50 or more \nworkers provide government-approved health care to their employees or \npay a fine.\n  Many employers want to hire more workers but they are afraid. They \nare afraid of the financial hit their businesses will take if they end \nup subject to ObamaCare's costly mandate. My amendment would allow \nbusinesses to hire those new workers without that fear.\n  This idea recently gained broad bipartisan support in the House of \nRepresentatives. The House has acted on a similar measure to exempt \nveterans from the ObamaCare employer mandate headcount. That measure \npassed the House of Representatives by a vote of 406 to 1. That is a \nstrong indication that we need to provide relief from ObamaCare's \ncostly mandates to ensure those who need and want to work are able to \nfind good jobs.\n  I am confident that if the majority leader would allow this provision \nto get a vote on the Senate floor, we would see a similar outcome that \nwould benefit long-term unemployed individuals.\n  Finally, my amendment would provide another hiring incentive by \ngranting a 6-month payroll tax holiday for each long-term unemployed \nworker that a business hires. For an employer hiring a worker that is \nmaking $40,000, that 6-month payroll holiday means a savings of $1,240.\n  If it is the Senate's will to extend these benefits, Republicans want \nto ensure this extension is paired with the kind of help that will \nactually ensure we do not have to extend unemployment benefits a 14th \nor a 15th time. That is why we are here offering measures to address \nthe root cause of unemployment--the lack of jobs.\n  It is vital that we stop putting bandaids over the problem and start \nfocusing on solutions. Democrats may not have made job creation a \npriority for the last 5 years, but they can start making it a priority \ntoday. And they can do that by the majority leader allowing votes on \nRepublican proposals to make it easier and less expensive to create \njobs.\n  We just heard--we keep hearing--proposals that are being brought to \nthe floor by Democrats that will drive up the cost of doing business, \nmake it harder, create more obstacles to hiring people and to creating \njobs. The proposed 40-percent increase in the minimum wage, for \nexample--I have visited with employers in my State of South Dakota, \nsmall employers. I had a meeting with employers, where the size of \ntheir businesses range from 30 employees up to about 200 employees, all \nof whom concluded that an increase of that magnitude in the minimum \nwage would make it much harder for them to grow their businesses and to \ncreate jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that raising the minimum \nwage would cost our economy up to 1 million jobs. Why? Because it makes \nit more expensive, more difficult for employers to create those jobs \nand to hire new workers. As a consequence, there are fewer jobs that \nget created in our economy.\n  Well, if the goal is to lift people into the middle class, to get \nmore people to work, I do not know why we would look at policies that \nhave proven in the past to make it more difficult to create jobs and \ncost us jobs in our economy. And we have the Congressional Budget \nOffice saying it would cost us up to 1 million jobs and also raise \ncosts for people in this country; in other words, the things people \nhave to buy. It would raise prices for the things people have to rely \non in their daily lives.\n  Those are the types of things we continue to hear from the other \nside--proposals that, frankly, sound good and maybe poll well but when \nyou really get down to brass tacks do not get the job done. And \nclearly, the object is creating jobs--something we have not done here \nnow for 5 years because we consistently get policies from our \nDemocratic colleagues and from the President that drive up the cost of \ndoing business, drive up the cost of hiring new employees, put more \nobstacles in the way of job creation, instead of putting policies in \nplace that we know--that we know--will create jobs, good-paying jobs, \nand give people an opportunity for advancement that will help lift them \ninto the middle class.\n  We can do it. It is high time we did it. I hope, again, that the \nmajority leader will allow votes this week on Republican proposals--and \nthere are many of them here--that actually will make it easier and less \nexpensive to create jobs in this country. It is long past time that we \nstart providing real help for the unemployed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1890-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1890-S1893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the legislation \ncurrently under consideration. But I want to begin by briefly \ndiscussing how we arrived at this point.\n  In January, I was one of a few on our side of the aisle who voted to \nbegin debate on the bill to extend unemployment insurance benefits. I \nsaid at the time--and I still believe today--that the Senate should \nhave a full and open debate on this important issue, a debate that \nincludes consideration of modifications and changes to the program.\n  The President, after all, said the program needs reforms. This is an \nopportunity to implement those reforms.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle--Republicans and Democrats--have \nacknowledged the need for reforms. So my vote to consider this \nlegislation early on, when it came up, was not about supporting or \nopposing an extension of the emergency unemployment insurance program, \nbut it was about initiating a debate on this important topic and \nsetting the stage for both sides to work together to find a credible \nway of paying for this extension, if it was granted, and having \nresponsible reforms in terms of amending or changing the current law so \nwe could avoid some of the duplication and some of the misuse of funds \nthat go into this particular program.\n  So those two things--a responsible pay-for and measures to reform the \nprogram--were critical. I felt that was the debate we needed and, in \nfact, we did have a bipartisan discussion back and forth with the \ncaucus on our side of the aisle and the caucus on the other side.\n  It is clear that we have gotten to the point where not all of us are \nhappy with the result that came forward. I see my colleague from Nevada \nSenator Heller on the floor. No one could have been a better leader in \nterms of pulling the group together, working to find a sensible \nsolution to this issue. I commend him for the efforts he has made.\n  However, I am disappointed in not having the ability to offer \namendments when a bill comes to the floor, and being shut down by the \nmajority leader who simply says: I am going to use Senate procedures--\nsome of them arcane procedures--to deny the opposing party any \nopportunity to include their ideas, their thoughts, their amendments in \nthe process.\n  Throughout the discussion we have had with our colleagues across the \naisle in trying to form a consensus and bring the bill forward, some of \nus were disappointed that those items that we offered, that we thought \nwere reasonable, were not included in the final version.\n  You do not always get everything you want. But nevertheless, at least \naround here you used to be able to go down to the floor and say: I want \nto give my colleagues a shot at hearing what my amendment tries to \naccomplish, and allow it a vote. And if you win, you win; if you lose, \nyou lose. In the end, you look at the total package, as amended--or at \nleast as attempted to be amended--and make a decision: Do I want to \nsupport this or not support this?\n  That is the position we were in, and I had what I thought were two \nreasonable requests. One was prohibiting the simultaneous collection of \nSocial Security disability insurance and receiving unemployment \ninsurance.\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n  Look, the law is basic and it is common sense. If you are eligible to \nreceive unemployment benefits, you have to be determined as someone \ncapable of performing suitable work. I had an amendment to incorporate \nthis proposal into the language of the final bill that is going to come \nbefore us. The amendment language is identical to the language \npreviously proposed by Senate Democrats that would offset Social \nSecurity disability benefits by the amount of unemployment insurance \nreceived.\n  So, as I said, by law, a person has to be able to work to qualify for \nunemployment benefits. Yet, as we have found, some people claiming \nthose benefits also are claiming Social Security disability benefits. \nThe law provides that in order to claim disability payments, you have \nto prove that you are not capable of working, that there are basic \nmedical reasons why you cannot work.\n  But here we have, documented by agencies of the government, people \nwho are getting checks for both programs. All we were trying to do--all \nI am trying to do is put forth a provision that says you cannot do \nboth; you either are able to work or you are not able to work. If you \nare not able to work, you can qualify for disability payments. But if \nyou are able to work, you may qualify for unemployment benefits if \nthere is no work available, but you should not be able to qualify for \nboth.\n  While some adjustments have been made, there still are several \nbillions of dollars of costs to the taxpayers because of this \nduplication.\n  Secondly, I offered a provision that gave the States the flexibility \nto make decisions as to how people would qualify for these benefits. I \nhear frustration from employers all across Indiana that are basically \nbeing told by people who are looking for work: I would rather keep \ncollecting unemployment than accept the job you are offering to me.\n  In this time of slow economic growth, as we come out of the recession \nvery slowly, some people, as has been documented to me by many \nemployers across the State of Indiana, are basically saying people \nwould rather collect the benefits.\n  So we put in what was called a suitability provision that would \nprohibit individuals from receiving emergency unemployment compensation \nif they fail to accept any offer of suitable work. That is defined as \nwork within their capabilities or suitable work referred to them by the \nState employment agency. Unfortunately I thought we had bipartisan \nsupport. Instead they said let's study this. It has been studied. It \nhas been documented. We do not need to study. ``Study'' is a way for--\nlet's take this decision out of the process and it will put it down \nsome dark, deep hole and maybe some study will come out later on.\n  So the bottom line is that the two amendments I had hoped would be \npart of this final package have not been incorporated. What I am asking \nfor, what I have been asking for now, is the opportunity to bring those \ntwo proposals forward, debate it on this floor, call for a vote. I am \nnot going to filibuster it. I am not going to delay it. I am not going \nto throw a monkey wrench into the process. Let's have a time-limited, \nstraightforward debate and give Members the opportunity to vote their \nyes or vote their no.\n  Then, at the end, when this process has been worked through, as the \nSenate was designed to do but under the leadership of the current \nmajority leader has not been able to do, once again--once again--the \nvery function, the design of the Senate has been thwarted by the \nleadership or lack of leadership of the majority leader who simply \nsaid: I will use procedural measures to keep you from offering any \namendment to this bill.\n  I do appreciate the work that went on behind the scenes to try to \ncome up with a consensus bill. I think that fell short of where I would \nlike to go. I would at least like to have the opportunity as a Senator \nto offer on the floor an amendment to the bill and then accept the \nresults, yea or nay.\n  Since both of these things that I have mentioned have had bipartisan \nsupport, why are we not allowed to vote for it or against it. Why are \nwe not allowed to have the opportunity to do what the Senate is \nsupposed to do on behalf of the constituents whom we all represent? \nThat was the basis for my decision to go forward with this. A lot of \npeople misunderstood that, but it was simply a decision I made that we \nought to return to some form of regular order.\n  The reason we come to the Senate is to be able to be a participant in \nfashioning legislation. Our majority leader Senator Reid has disallowed \nthat opportunity, meaning essentially robbing the soul of the Senate, \nthe purpose of the Senate, the purpose of Senators, turning us into \nrobots, rubberstamping whatever the majority leader wants us to pass or \nnot pass, telling us that the 200-and-some years of tradition, of \ndebate and vote in the Senate, the ability to offer an amendment has \nbeen denied us.\n  Once again here we are back in the same situation because we have one \nindividual who has made a decision that the minority does not count, \nthat Senators--even some in the majority--do not count. They do not get \nto offer amendments either. We are going to do it his way and not the \nway it has been done for more than 200 years.\n  With that in mind, having the ability to bring forward something that \nI think has bipartisan support, is responsible, will address the \nreforms the President called for has been once again denied. With that, \nI simply cannot support going forward with this, even though there are \npeople out there who are legitimately looking for work, making every \npossible effort, should be able to qualify for an unemployment program. \nBut the most basic of reforms that ought to be debated and voted on--we \nought to have the courage to put our yes or our no to it so people back \nhome know where we stand--that has been denied us yet once again.\n  This is a dysfunctional body, led by a dysfunctional leader. It is \nnot operating as the Constitution has put forth, as the tradition of \nthe Senate has required. It is a shame. It is a shame on us that we are \nnot even allowing debate and the opportunity to offer reforms, even \nwhen they have bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking the two \nprevious speakers for their comments and their dedication to their \nparticular cause. My friend from Indiana knows both of his amendments \nare something I would have supported if given the opportunity to \nactually vote on them, but the important point is this, we are moving \nforward. The Senate is moving forward with a debate on a bipartisan \nproposal to responsibly extend unemployment benefits. I am encouraged \nby our progress so far. I hope we can continue to work with our \ncolleagues to pass this piece of legislation.\n  In speaking on this bill, I would be remiss not to again thank my \nfriend from Rhode Island for his tireless efforts to help unemployed \nAmericans by temporarily extending unemployment insurance benefits. I \nadmire his dedication. I am greatly pleased we are here today to \nsupport a bipartisan effort and to help all Americans keep American \nfamilies on their feet in a very difficult economic climate.\n  I also wish to thank Senators Collins, Portman, Murkowski, and Kirk \nfor their continued willingness to come to the table to craft a bill \nthat would garner enough support to pass in the Senate. I also, as I \njust mentioned, wish to acknowledge the contributions of both Senator \nCoats and Senator Ayotte, who though not cosponsors of this particular \nversion of the bill have been essential in these negotiations, as well \nas Senator Isakson and Senator Hoeven, who have also been engaged in \nthis matter in recent months.\n  Last December the Federal unemployment insurance benefits were \nallowed to expire, leaving millions of job-seeking Americans wondering \nhow they would cover their mortgage, pay the utilities, fill their car \nwith gas, put food on the table for their families. My constituents who \nhave written to me, who have called my office, and the people I have \nspoken with when I am home in Nevada have shared many heartbreaking \nstories with me.\n  I have heard from individuals all across the spectrum, from every \nsector, from every industry. I would like to share one of those letters \nfrom Michael in Carson City, NV, who wrote to me several weeks ago. \nAfter Michael and his friend moved to Nevada from California just a few \nyears ago, they needed\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nunemployment insurance benefits to help them bridge the gap between \njobs. Sometimes they had to visit the local food pantry to keep food on \ntheir table, but Michael kept looking for a job.\n  Eventually he found some work as a substitute teacher. He also found \nanother part-time job working nights and even weekends. Through \nperseverance, Michael ended up finding a full-time job, and now he and \nhis wife and their young daughter are enjoying some financial stability \nthat they did not have just a few years ago.\n  I think Michael's story is a great example of how valuable \nunemployment insurance is to American families who have fallen on some \nhard times. I thank Michael for taking the time to share that story \nwith me. I am very glad his family is doing well in Carson City.\n  I have another letter from John from Henderson. John lost his job \nlast April. He has been looking for work for nearly 1 year now. \nUnemployment insurance has helped him keep a roof over his head. It \nalso helped him keep the power on. John is doing everything he can to \nmake ends meet while he continues to search for a job, but it is \ngetting tougher and tougher to put food on the table and provide for \nhis young family.\n  Without any help, John and his family may lose their home. They are \nworried about where to go and they are worried about what options they \nhave left. I have a stack of letters just like these, Nevadans sharing \ntheir individual experiences with me. Those stories are why I am here \ntoday and I have fought so hard to find a way to temporarily extend \nthese benefits in a responsible way.\n  These are real American families trying to make ends meet. They are \npeople who want to get back to work, want to be self-sufficient, want \nto provide for their families. Without unemployment insurance, many of \nthem would have lost their homes, been forced to search and seek out \nadditional government services. Unemployment insurance helps people \nbefore things go from bad to worse and does make a difference for \nmillions of Americans.\n  Last week I spoke briefly on the need to extend these benefits. I \nwant to reiterate an important point that I think is often \nmisunderstood. Unemployment insurance benefits go to unemployed \nindividuals who are actively seeking employment. I share the desire of \nmy colleagues and constituents to rein in out-of-control Federal \nspending and reduce the dependence on Federal aid, but I believe \nunemployment insurance is a critical safety net for American families, \nespecially during periods of high unemployment such as we are currently \nexperiencing.\n  Further, additional benefit tiers are only available to States that \nmeet certain unemployment rate thresholds, meaning that the duration of \nbenefits decreases as the State recovers. This ensures that job seekers \nin the hardest hit States have access to critical resources when they \nneed it the most. Nowhere is this more apparent and important than in \nmy home State of Nevada, which has the unfortunate distinction of \ncarrying the Nation's highest unemployment rate for nearly 5 years--\nnearly 14 percent unemployment at the highest.\n  Nevada's current unemployment rate at 8.5 percent remains still one \nof the highest in the country, high above the national average and far \nfrom where we need to be as a State. What concerns me even more is the \nfact that thousands of Nevadans have dropped out of the workforce \nentirely, people who lost their jobs, exhausted both their State and \nFederal unemployment insurance benefits and were still unable to find \nwork in this tough economy.\n  Nevada is now trending in the right direction, thanks in large part \nto the vision of our Governor, Governor Sandoval. But again, we still \nhave a long way to go. That is why we need to temporarily extend \nunemployment insurance benefits to give the people of Nevada, Rhode \nIsland, and many other States some financial certainty as our country's \neconomy recovers.\n  As we continue to push forward to restore our economy, the need for \nthese benefits will naturally diminish. This brings me to another \nimportant point I wish to highlight about this bill. There is a \ntemporary extension of unemployment insurance benefits, 5 months to be \nexact. Temporary extensions of these programs during high periods of \nunemployment have found bipartisan support in the past. I think they \nmerit bipartisan support. I agree we should not indefinitely extend \nthese programs. I would also like to see additional reforms. We should \ncontinue that discussion.\n  I strongly agree with my colleagues on this side of the aisle that \nthe key to our economic recovery is through the creation of new jobs. \nUnder this administration, there are still three workers for every \navailable job, leaving far too many qualified workers out of a job \nsimply because there are not enough opportunities available.\n  My Republican colleagues, including Senators Hoeven, Thune, Lee, and \nmany others, have introduced more than a dozen bills to spur job \ncreation by reducing governmental burdens and making it easier for \nbusinesses to grow and create new jobs--bills that will help reduce the \nneed for unemployment insurance benefits, strengthen our economy, and \nimprove the financial security of millions of Americans.\n  I hope that as we are debating this bill before us today, we have the \nopportunity to debate and vote on these important job creation \nmeasures.\n  I know there are some questions regarding how State workforce \nagencies might administer retroactive benefits and enforce some of the \nnew requirements provided in this bill. These concerns are not \nunreasonable. However, I firmly believe that not only can Congress work \nwith States to overcome any of these challenges, but Congress has the \nresponsibility to overcome these challenges. No bill is perfect, and \nthe varying capabilities of State systems compound the difficulty of \nthe task at hand.\n  This isn't a new obstacle for Congress. Every person in this Chamber \nis familiar with the challenges involved in finding a balance between \nFederal and State laws and ensuring that what we do in Washington isn't \nan undue burden back home. We deal with that problem every single day. \nAdditionally, the Department of Labor has provided $345 million to \nStates over the past 5 years to help States modernize their systems so \nthat they are more responsive and efficient.\n  I know we can find a way to work with our State agencies to find a \nway to reduce the burden of administering these benefits. In fact, \nDepartment of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez wrote a letter last week in \nresponse to some of these very concerns and believes that the \nchallenges are not--I repeat, are not--insurmountable. As a former \nlabor secretary for Maryland and now Secretary of the U.S. Department \nof Labor, Mr. Perez has hands-on experience with unemployment insurance \nat both the Federal and State levels. In his letter, Secretary Perez \nindicated that the Department of Labor already has guidance on how to \nadminister retroactive benefits. This is not the first time there has \nbeen a gap in UI extensions. Although this gap may be a little longer \nthan usual, Secretary Perez states that ``we are confident that we \ncould successfully address this challenge again.''\n  It may also be difficult to implement measures in our UI systems to \ndetermine whether someone is a millionaire, but I think most of us \nwould agree that jobless millionaires and billionaires should not be \nreceiving unemployment benefits. The limited resources we have to \nprovide for this social safety net ought to be reserved for Americans \nwho need this help the most. Some State systems may not be responsive \nor responsible enough to get this done by the time these benefits \nexpire again. I recognize that. But if we continue to provide a series \nof short-term extensions without any reforms, we will never fix the \nunderlying issues. We have known for years that there are some well-off \nindividuals abusing the UI system, and it is long past time that we do \nsomething about it.\n  We should not be content to just extend Federal programs if we know \nthere are inefficiencies. We need to do something to make these \nprograms run more efficiently, effectively, and ensure that our hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars are used in a responsible fashion.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle on this legislation. It hasn't always been easy, but I thank my \ncolleagues for their patience and their continued hard work to help the \nAmerican people find\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nsome stability as they look to get back to work. I look forward to \nmoving to this bill, passing it, and working with the House to restore \nunemployment insurance benefits as we continue working to improve the \nhealth of the American economy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014. In my view, this \nlegislation is flawed in many respects, and that being the case, I \nintend to vote against it.\n  First and foremost, it needs to be said that the fact that we are \neven having a debate about extending unemployment benefits is \nunfortunate. Throughout the Obama administration, our Nation has been \nplagued with lackluster job growth, lower and lower rates of labor \nforce participation, and high levels of long-term unemployment. Indeed, \nunder this President it has been harder to find a job than at any other \npoint in our Nation's recent history.\n  But, as has been said before, these are just symptoms of a much \nlarger problem. The plight of the long-term unemployed--which this bill \nis supposed to address--is not the major problem facing America today. \nInstead, the major problem is that despite the best efforts of many of \nus in Congress, our government hasn't done enough to foster economic \ngrowth. In fact, more often than not in recent years government has \nstood in the way. It has been an impediment.\n  We are now more than 5 years into this administration, and it is \nbecoming increasingly clear that President Obama does not have a plan \nto address these problems. True enough, he has proposals that would \nexpand the government and redistribute income but nothing resembling a \nplan to promote growth in the private sector or to actually put people \nback to work. Many of the President's redistribution schemes end up \ncosting labor supply and jobs, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice has made clear with respect to ObamaCare and the President's \nproposed minimum wage hike.\n  Growth is what we should be debating, ideas and proposals that would \nactually grow our economy and help people find jobs. But instead we are \nhere once again to debate an extension of the emergency unemployment \ncompensation program, or EUC.\n  Let's talk about the EUC program for just a few minutes.\n  The proponents of this legislation have told us that extending \n``temporary'' unemployment benefits is vital to our economy, but I \nthink the facts tell a much different story. Between July 2008 when the \nprogram started and December 2013 when it expired, we spent roughly \n$265 billion on EUC benefits. That is more than a quarter of a trillion \ndollars on a temporary Federal benefit program. For much of that time \nthe program paid up to 73 weeks of Federal benefits, amounting to a \nrecord total of 99 available weeks of unemployment benefits when you \nadd the State and Federal benefits together. All told, we have paid EUC \nbenefits for 66 months, which is 2\\1/2\\ years longer than any similar \nemergency unemployment program in U.S. history.\n  In other words, EUC is a program with a long track record, and when \nwe look at the record, we see that it hasn't had the positive economic \nimpact proponents of the program often claim it has. Indeed, despite \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits we have already paid \nunder this program, we have suffered through the worst jobs recovery in \nour Nation's history, and the long-term unemployed have suffered the \nmost.\n  There is evidence to suggest this program has actually made the \nrecovery worse. For example, according to recent research published by \nthe National Bureau of Economic Research, ``unemployment benefit \nextensions can account for most of the persistently high unemployment \nafter the Great Recession.''\n  So while some Democrats have claimed that extending unemployment \nbenefits is the best way to create jobs, the facts certainly tell a \ndifferent story.\n  I am not going to condemn anyone for wanting to extend a helping hand \nto those who continue to face difficulties under the Obama economy, but \nif we are going to debate yet another extension of Federal unemployment \nbenefits, we should at the very least get our facts straight.\n  So with all this in mind--the cost of the EUC program and the \nquestionable benefits--let's take a look at the legislation before us \nnow.\n  One thing I would like to point out is that with this legislation we \nhave once again abandoned regular order and bypassed the committee \nprocess entirely. I have remarked on this problem here on the floor \nseveral times before. When we ignore the traditional role of the Senate \ncommittees, we short-circuit the legislative process, and more often \nthan not we end up with an inferior product. This bill is certainly no \nexception.\n  We learned this last month when the National Association of State \nWorkforce Agencies, NASWA, sent a letter to the Senate outlining its \nconcern with this bill. Chief among these concerns was that it would be \nextremely difficult for States to retroactively pay unemployment \ninsurance claims, as this bill would require. Indeed, according to \nNASWA, backdating EUC claims ``would make it nearly impossible'' to \napply individual State work search requirements, which is a key factor \nin determining eligibility for unemployment insurance. In addition, the \nletter indicated that there would likely be a large increase in new EUC \noverpayments as a result of this retroactivity requirement.\n  Due to these concerns and others, NASWA concluded that it would take \nStates up to 3 months to implement this legislation, which is \nproblematic because although the bill before us is technically for a 5-\nmonth extension, only 2 months of benefits would be paid prospectively. \nIn other words, many States would not be ready to implement this \nlegislation by the time it expires.\n  This is more than a glitch or a bump in the road; it is State \nworkforce agencies--the very people who will have to implement this \nlegislation on a day-to-day basis--telling the Senate that this bill is \nunworkable. According to the NASWA letter, there are a number of States \nthat would consider not participating in the program due to these \nproblems and the short time available to address them.\n  Labor Secretary Perez sent his own letter in response to NASWA's \nstatement, promising to help States address these concerns. Oddly \nenough, however, this letter was very short on actual details as to how \nthat assistance would be offered.\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\n  All of that said, these are the kinds of problems I was talking \nabout--problems which can be addressed if committees are given an \nopportunity to operate. Had the committee had an opportunity to vet \nthis legislation, we could have also fully examined the offsets my \ncolleagues are using to pay for this EUC extension. These are also \nproblematic.\n  The main pay-for in this bill is the use of what is called pension \nsmoothing, which is little more than a budget gimmick but an especially \npernicious budget gimmick when repeated. It has the potential to do \nreal harm to pension plan funding levels, threatening the future \nretirement security of American workers.\n  Since the great recession of 2008, pension plans have struggled to \nregain their footing financially. The drastic drop in interest rates \nforced many plans to dramatically increase their pension contributions \nto keep pace. In 2012, at the historic low point for interest rates, \nCongress essentially gave pension plans 4 years of funding relief to \nget through the worst period of low interest rates. Congress did this \nby allowing pensions to fund their plans as if interest rates were \nhigher than they really were.\n  But we can't indefinitely pretend that interest rates are \nartificially high and contribution levels artificially low. Reality \nstill matters. The reality is that, although still low by historical \nstandards, interest rates are no longer at rock bottom and pension \nfunding needs to gradually adjust to market rates just as current law \nprovides.\n  Put simply, we should avoid additional pension smoothing because it \npermits lower pension funding, and poor pension funding is bad pension \npolicy. Pension funding remains a serious concern, and this is not the \ntime to make it easier to underfund pensions. Doing so is worse than \njust kicking a can down the road. This can of pension underfunding will \nexplode on American workers in the form of underfunded pensions that \nwill somehow have to be rescued either through painful cuts in \nbenefits, much higher PBGC premiums, or taxpayer-funded bailouts. There \nis no other way around it.\n\n  The other major offset in this bill is the extension of customs user \nfees. This is also problematic. Traditionally speaking, offsets in the \ntrade space are reserved for legislation that actually extends trade \nprograms, such as the Generalized System of Preferences or the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. If we start using these offsets in other \nareas, we won't have anything left over when it comes to extending \nthese important programs.\n  Both of these offsets--pension smoothing and customs user fees--fall \nunder the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, just like the \nunderlying UI extension. Once again, had the committee been given an \nopportunity to consider these issues, it is likely that these offsets \nwould not have been used.\n  As we can see, there are a number of problems with this bill that \ncould have been considered and addressed had the Finance Committee been \nallowed to do its work. And it should have been allowed to do its work. \nOther problems could be addressed if there were a fair and open \namendment process here on the floor. Sadly, it doesn't appear that we \nare going to get that either as the Senate Democratic leadership \nappears poised to once again try to force a major piece of legislation \nthrough the Senate without giving the minority an opportunity to offer \namendments.\n  Before our next vote on this legislation, I think we will see a \nnumber of amendments filed, many of which would likely improve the \nbill. Others would address the more pressing need to stimulate the \neconomy and create jobs.\n  I personally have amendments that would do both. For example, I have \nan amendment that would repeal the ObamaCare tax on medical devices, \nwhich enjoys bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate and \nwould prevent further job losses in one of our most important U.S. \nindustries.\n  I have another amendment that would repeal the ObamaCare employer \nmandate. I am sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \ndeem this out of bounds, but they shouldn't. After all, the Obama \nadministration seems pretty intent on delaying the employer mandate; it \nhas already been delayed for 2 years. If the mandate is that harmful to \nimplement, why don't we do away with it altogether and ensure that it \ndoesn't cost us any more jobs and further requests for unemployment \nbenefits?\n  One amendment I have would help to ensure that the retroactive EUC \nbenefits do not threaten program integrity. Specifically, it would \nrequire States, as part of their EUC agreements, to certify that paying \nretroactive benefits will not lead to an increase in fraud or \noverpayments.\n  These are just some of the amendments I may offer to this bill, and \nall of them, in my opinion, would be improvements. But it doesn't look \nas though we are going to be able to offer amendments in the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world--and I am saying that pretty \nsarcastically at this time. I know many of my Republican colleagues \nhave amendments they would like to offer as well. Yet my friends on the \nother side of the aisle don't want to have a real debate about these \nissues. Instead, they are content to let the majority leader fill the \ntree and block any and all Republican amendments from coming up for a \nvote. One can only wonder what they are afraid of. Presumably the \nmajority has the votes to defeat any amendments the minority wants to \noffer. Where is the harm in having a real debate? Where is the harm in \nhaving an open amendment process? I can only conclude they are worried \nthat some of the votes they would have to take would be difficult \npolitically. Indeed, preventing difficult votes seems to be priority \nNo. 1 for the current Senate majority.\n  At this point, it appears they have the votes to pass the bill. I \nassume we will be through with this process this week. Yet, while the \nSenate debate over unemployment insurance may be coming to an end, I \ncan only conclude that the process failures we are seeing in this \nChamber will continue as we move on to the next item of business, which \nis, in my opinion, very unfortunate.\n  This week's debate over EUC is just the latest example of what is \nwrong with the Senate these days. Sadly, it doesn't look as if things \nare going to get better under the current leadership. These are \nimportant issues. We really need to let the Senate operate the way it \nalways has, and let's quit playing these games of power play.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I rise today to speak about an issue \nwhich should be under the category of ``unfinished business,'' and is a \npriority for the American people, and that is unemployment insurance. \nIn this case it is emergency unemployment compensation and the trauma \nso many people have lived through--not just over weeks--over the last \nfew months, and which, of course, was preceded by a very difficult \neconomy.\n  The bill that is before the Senate is bipartisan, and that is good \nnews and the way it should be. It is a bipartisan bill to provide what \ncan only be described as an essential lifeline for individuals who have \nbeen out of work. Millions of people have been out of work in the so-\ncalled long-term unemployment category. This lifeline is often directly \nconnected to the life and daily struggles of middle-class families who \nrely upon this program to stay afloat as they seek work.\n  Sometimes I think there is a misconception--or some may want to make \nthis argument in a deliberate way--that somehow emergency unemployment \ncompensation is for people who are out of work but not looking for \nwork. In fact, these are folks who are\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nlooking for work day after day and week after week. I would have \npreferred a longer-term agreement rather than just the 5 months that \nare proposed in the agreement. It is very important that we have \nfinally reached a point where we can pass a measure that will provide \nprotection and support for folks as they look for work.\n  Thursday we had a procedural vote which was bipartisan to move the \nbill forward. Thankfully, this week the Senate will be voting on the \nbill itself. We hope the House will follow suit and provide this kind \nof much-needed boost for those who are out of work.\n  The numbers are staggering. For example, when we look at the numbers \nin Pennsylvania, almost 75,000 people immediately stopped receiving \nunemployment benefits when the emergency unemployment compensation \nexpired on December 28. I can't even imagine what that was like for an \nindividual or for an individual and his or her family--3 days after \nChristmas, right in the middle of the holiday season. It is supposed to \nbe a time of joy. It is a time when families are spending lots of time \ntogether in ways they cannot often do during the year. To have their \nunemployment run out on December 28 had to be horrific for those \nindividuals.\n  Between December 28 and March 15--in addition to the 75,000 I \nmentioned for Pennsylvania--over 110,000 Pennsylvanians lost their \nbenefits. Through May--the bill would go to June 1 and be retroactive \nto December 28--it is estimated that 158,400 Pennsylvanians and almost \n2.8 million Americans will have lost their emergency unemployment \ncompensation. They are the folks who have been hurting and will be \nhurting unless we take action, and they are the ones, of course, who \nwill benefit if we take action.\n  Unemployment insurance doesn't just provide an economic relief to \nthat individual and his or her family. It is also an economic jump-\nstarter. For example, in 2012, Mark Zandi, a respected economist--I \nwill say for the record he has roots in Pennsylvania, but he is \nrespected across the board--said that for every dollar of emergency \nunemployment compensation, there is $1.52 in new economic activity. It \nis that old ``spend a buck,'' and what do you get for a buck? In the \ncase of emergency unemployment insurance, you spend a buck and you get \na buck fifty-two in return. I don't care what market you are in. That \nis a pretty good return--especially when it is helping people so \nsubstantially. This is about providing that lifeline for those families \nat a time when they really need it, and it is also about the economic \nbenefits for the rest of us. A lot of people have heard these numbers \nas well--analyses that specifically focus on the extension of benefits \nin 2014. They have also indicated--by using other data--the impact it \nhas on the economy.\n  I will give an example. The Economic Policy Institute has estimated \nthat extending unemployment benefits in 2014 would generate $37.8 \nbillion in economic activity. That is the impact for this year as found \nby the Economic Policy Institute--$37.8 billion.\n  This is about all of us. This is not about a group of people over \nhere we hope to help. That is a wonderful sentiment. This is about \nwhether they are going to have an opportunity--just a fair shot--to \nhave a chance to get back into the economy and back into work. It is \nalso about the rest of us in another way as well. It is about whether \nwe are going to make sure everyone has an opportunity for that fair \nshot. Of course, it is also about the rest of us because we benefit \nwhen this program continues because of the economic boost and the $1.52 \nfor the buck you spend on it, as well as the $37.8 billion of activity.\n  We have heard about the numbers and the rationale for continuing this \nprogram, both of which I would argue are not just compelling but \nurgent. But what about the real people. There are two people in my \nhometown--one I had spoken to in the past and the second person was \nsomeone I had never met before. I just want to give an example of these \ntwo individuals and their lives in Scranton, PA, where I live--\nLackawanna County--which has a very high unemployment rate.\n  The first person is Joe Walsh. Joe has lived in my hometown all of \nhis life. He was a tradesman for 40 years, so he had a very specific \nskill that allowed him to work and support his family. He worked as a \nsuperintendent for 14 years, and in 2008 the company he worked for \nneeded to downsize, and he lost his position and immediately went on \nunemployment insurance. He worked on and off over the years for \ncontractors who needed temporary workers, but he was unable to find \nanything steady, which is a story we have heard too often.\n  On December 28 of 2013--the day I mentioned before--Joe exceeded his \nunemployment insurance benefits and has not received any support since \nthen, but he continues to look for work and file his claims. Joe is \nmarried and has three grown children. He says he feels ``lucky'' \nbecause his wife works and is able to keep their household afloat \nduring a very difficult time.\n  Joe is 63 years old, and for all of those years and all of those \ndecades he has had a skill and work ethic that allowed him to work. He \nsaid that if he had a mortgage now, he would not be able to survive. He \nfinds it difficult to find the kind of work he had before--tradesman \nwork, which requires a skill.\n  The second person we had a press conference with is someone I met in \nour neighborhood--we go to the same church--Vera Radice. Vera has \nspoken to me before about her circumstances. Over the years she was \nwith several banking institutions. She was employed steadily from \nFebruary of 1995 until July of 2014. She was doing good work for all of \nthose years for two different banking institutions.\n  She has a Bachelor of Science degree from Cookstown University and an \nassociate's degree from Luzerne County Community College. She has the \neducation you often need to find the job you want, and she has almost \n20 years of experience. Now she is left with volunteering and looking \nfor work. She has attended all of the CareerLink workshops in \nLackawanna County. She spends at least 3 days a week at CareerLink \nsearching for work over and over.\n  These are the people--and not just tens of thousands or hundreds of \nthousands, but literally millions of others across the country--who are \nin the same situation as they are. It is time we did the job we were \nelected to do and put this emergency unemployment compensation program \nback into place and give people a fair shot--nothing else. They are \njust asking for a fair shot to find work so they can support their \nfamilies, be a part of the economy, a part of this country, and the \nworld of work they were so much a part of for most of their lives.\n  I would like to see all of us come together in a bipartisan fashion \nand get this passed and get it to the House. I hope our House \ncolleagues are listening not just to my voice but, more importantly, I \nhope they are listening to the voices of people who they represent--the \nVeras and Joes of the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday my colleagues agreed by a voice \nvote to proceed to a debate on the bipartisan agreement to restore \nemergency unemployment insurance to 2.7 million Americans. This is \ngreat progress from where we have been the last few months, as I have \nmade the case to renew these benefits.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for their support and urge them to \ncontinue to move this compromise to passage, as it represents our best \npath forward to quickly provide aid to our constituents and supporting \nour economic recovery. I hope the voice vote yesterday is indicative of \nbroad support going forward, and that this agreement will not be bogged \ndown by unnecessary roadblocks.\n  Millions of Americans who have worked hard, who were laid off through \nno fault of their own, and are searching for work are looking to us to \nget this commonsense extension done and done promptly. I would again \nlike to thank my colleagues who have joined in this effort. They \nrecognize this is the right thing to do for our workers and it is the \nright thing do for our economy.\n  I would also like to particularly thank my Republican cosponsors who \nhave brought constructive thoughts and ideas to the table, helping \nbring us here to this point. Senator Heller has been a stalwart in \nextending these emergency benefits. Senator Collins, Senator Portman, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Kirk have all contributed valuable thoughts, \nalong with Senator Coats and Senator Ayotte. This has been an effort \nthat has truly been bipartisan. I think it represents a coming together \nof proposals from both sides, but ultimately to serve the best \ninterests of our constituents who again are looking for work in a very \ndifficult market.\n  We have been working together since literally last year before these \nbenefits expired on December 28. We know how important it is to provide \nthis assistance to families throughout this Nation. We also understand \nthat we have to go ahead and not only provide support for the families \nbut also to support the local economy. This will do it. It will provide \nresources that will immediately go back into the economy and stimulate \ndemand and stimulate growth.\n  I want to also thank my colleagues for the way they have thoughtfully \napproached some of the issues. Senator Collins has helped build upon \nthis important reform to provide a mechanism which we hope will get \npeople back to work sooner. We have incorporated another assessment in \nthe process. It is fully paid for. People will get, in the course of \ntheir extended benefits, the opportunity and also the obligation to \ncome back in, be assessed, be given advice, be given some coaching. We \nthink, and some data suggest, this is one of the most effective ways to \nget people back into a job in a difficult market.\n  Senator Portman is a former Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, and one of the real experts, who has been key to identifying \nappropriate pay-fors which are critical.\n  Senator Murkowski and Senator Kirk worked to include an examination \nof the work suitability and work search standards across the States so \nwe can be better informed and better prepared when we have to deal with \nfurther reforms to our unemployment compensation system.\n  This agreement incorporates many good ideas of my colleagues. It is \nimportant we build upon the historic reforms Congress undertook in \n2012. I will try to discuss those reforms in more detail later in the \nweek. But as I said again, most importantly, it will help people who \nhave worked, who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, \nwho are desperately searching for work and must search for work in a \ndifficult economy. It will help our economy overall.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a whole series of \nissues--including unemployment insurance and the minimum wage--that are \ndesigned to help Americans attain economic mobility and get a fair shot \nto move up in the way our economy is designed to work.\n  This morning the Budget Committee had a hearing entitled \n``Opportunity, Mobility, and Inequality in Today's Economy.'' We heard \nfrom three very strong witnesses, including Nobel laureate Joseph \nStiglitz. We talked about important topics central to understanding the \nlong-held American dream: If you work hard and play by the rules, you \nshould be able to support your family, provide an opportunity for your \nkids, and have a fair retirement. But for too many--as the Presiding \nOfficer knows--opportunity and mobility are especially hard to find and \nincome inequality is growing.\n  I am an optimist. I know the solutions are here if we work to find \nthem, and I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about some of the \nsolutions. First, let's try to put a human face on the problem of \ninequality in our economy.\n  Income inequality in the United States is at a record level. It is \nhigher in the United States than virtually any other developed country. \nPresident Obama has called income equality the central challenge of our \ntimes. The Presiding Officer and I share a Roman Catholic background. \nLast week the President was talking to Pope Francis in the Vatican, and \nthey talked about how this is not just an American challenge but a \nglobal challenge.\n  According to the CBO, the average income of a household in the \nrichest 1 percent in this country was nearly 180 percent higher in 2010 \nthan it was in 1979 in real dollars. By comparison, the average income \nfor a household in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution had \nonly grown by about 25 percent--about one in seven--of what the \nhouseholds in the highest income levels had grown.\n  Since 1979, the top 1 percent of our population's share of national \nincome grew from 8.9 percent to 14.9 percent. So 1 percent has 15 \npercent of the national income by 2010, but at the same time the bottom \n80 percent of our American population saw their share of national \nincome significantly shrink.\n  For me the issue is not just inequality because there will always be \nsome inequality. Fate, luck, and health will produce some unequal \noutcomes. But what I think is great about this country is that while we \ncan see inequality and tolerate some degree of it, what we will not \ntolerate is people being locked into unequal situations.\n  We want to have a society where people may be born poor or may have \nan accident or a fate that will have them in a lower economic status \nbut they can still raise their ceiling and achieve all they can. But in \nthe case of social mobility, the United States is now one\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nof the poorest performing of the developed countries.\n  Today a child born into the bottom quintile in the American economic \nlife only has a 7.5-percent chance of ever being in the top quintile. \nIn a country such as Denmark in Europe--and we think of Europe as a \nmore stratified society--that number is nearly double what the number \nis in the United States.\n  It is not just inequality, it is mobility. We are not giving people a \nfair shot, to use the words of the great American singer Curtis \nMayfield, ``to move on up'' to their destination and that place where \ntheir dreams can take them if they work hard enough.\n  What we need to do is embrace strategies that let people move on up \nand have a fair shot to achieve. We don't only need to embrace \nstrategies for success, we have to eliminate structures and eliminate \nbarriers that lock people out of economic opportunities that they \nshould be able to achieve similar to anyone else.\n  One solution is the minimum wage bill that we will start to talk \nabout soon. It is about working Americans who are earning minimum wage \nor just above minimum wage and how this will affect them.\n  I think I can safely say the vast majority of Virginians would agree \nwith this proposition: No one who works full time--8 hours a day, 40 \nhours a week, 52 weeks a year--should live in poverty. But today \nsomeone making the minimum wage earns about $15,000 a year, which is \n$3,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. If you are a \nsingle mom with a couple of kids--and so many people are raising \nchildren on their own--and work full time at the minimum wage, you are \nbelow the poverty level.\n  The minimum wage today is at a historic low. The minimum wage has \nlost 33 percent of its buying power since its peak in 1968. If the \nminimum wage in 1968 had just kept pace with inflation, it would be \n$10.71 per hour today and not in the $7 range.\n  Workers who regularly receive tips are treated even worse. They get \npaid a subminimum wage--what is called a tipped minimum wage--of $2.13 \nan hour. As long as you make $30 in tips a month, your company can pay \nyou $2.13 an hour. Overwhelmingly these workers work in restaurants but \nnot exclusively, and similar to other minimum wage workers they are \npredominately women.\n  Twenty-eight million Americans will receive an increase in pay if we \nraise the minimum wage under the bill that is currently before the \nSenate. It has been reported out of the HELP Committee, and we will \ntake it up soon. More than half of those who will receive a raise are \nwomen. The vast majority are adult workers. Over 14 million American \nchildren have a parent who will receive a raise if we increase the \nminimum wage.\n  The Minimum Wage Fairness Act will boost the minimum wage to about \n$21,000, lifting families above the poverty line. In total--get this--\nthe bill we will hopefully debate and vote on soon is estimated to lift \nnearly 7 million Americans out of poverty and above the poverty level. \nWhat could we do, as we debate, that would have more effect on people's \nlives than lifting 7 million people above the poverty level, which we \nwould do if we pass the bill.\n  Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour will increase GDP by \nnearly $22 billion as workers spend their raises in local businesses \nand communities. In Virginia about 744,000 of my fellow citizens will \nreceive a raise. For this reason, business owners whom I talk to--not \nall but a huge number and especially small business owners--know that \nthe minimum wage increase makes good business sense.\n  Yesterday I visited a supermarket just across the Potomac in \nAlexandria. It is called MOM's Organic Market. They have 11 locations \nin the DC metropolitan area and Philadelphia. They are contemplating \nopening another store in New York City. I met with the owner Scott \nNash, and I talked to his employees. I asked the employees: How long \nhave you worked here? The answer I got back was 7 years, 8 years, 10 \nyears. They made it their practice to pay their employees a $10 minimum \nwage now, and they are going to increase it. They fully support the \nbill currently pending before the Senate to increase the minimum wage.\n  Scott Nash is not alone. We are celebrating a very important \ncentennial this year. It is a centennial of one of the smartest things \nan American employer ever did. I will read a quote.\n  After the success of the moving assembly line, Henry Ford had another \ntransformative idea. In January of 1914, he startled the world by \nannouncing that the Ford Motor Company would pay $5 a day to its \nworkers. The pay increase would be accompanied with a shorter workday--\nfrom 9 to 8 hours. While this rate did not automatically apply to every \nworker, it more than doubled the average autoworker's wage. While \nHenry's primary objective was to reduce worker attrition, newspapers \nfrom all over the world reported the story as an extraordinary gesture \nof good will.\n  Here is the important part:\n\n       Henry Ford had reasoned that since it was now possible to \n     build inexpensive cars in volume, more of them could be sold \n     if employees could afford to buy them. The $5 day helped \n     better the lot of all American workers and contributed to the \n     emergence of the American middle class. In the process, Henry \n     Ford had changed manufacturing forever.\n\n  This quote is not from some Democratic talking point. This quote is \nfrom the Web site of the Ford Motor Company--a press release they \nissued in January to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Henry Ford's \nnovel decision.\n\n  There was an employer who knew the American economy was based on \nconsumer demand and if workers could be paid more, they would buy more, \nit would help his company, and it would help America. The Senate can \ntake action in this way, and the Senate can take action in other ways \nto give people a fair shot to move on up in American society.\n  In fact, we have already acted on a couple of bills I hope the House \nwill pick up. We acted on immigration reform, which strengthens border \nsecurity, creates a pathway to legal status and citizenship for \nmillions of undocumented immigrants, and helps businesses and families. \nThis eliminates a barrier that keeps people from moving up, and the CBO \nestimates it will significantly improve the American economy. \nImmigration reform is about a fair shot. Immigration reform is about \nmoving up.\n  We also acted on ENDA, legislation to end discrimination in the \nworkplace against folks based on sexual orientation. A person can't \nmove on up and achieve their economic dreams if folks can fire someone \nat will if they don't like the kind of person someone is or who they \nlove. So ENDA, which awaits action in the House, is also a bill about \nmaking sure people have a fair shot and can move on up.\n  We can act this week. We are now on the bill to provide unemployment \ninsurance to those who are still struggling in the economy. Soon we \nwill consider paycheck fairness for women. A person can't achieve all \nthey can if they are going to be paid significantly less than their \ncolleagues just because of gender.\n  In coming weeks we will also consider jobs skills and education \nlegislation, which are real keys to economic opportunity for so many.\n  What we need to do is pretty simple. What the Presiding Officer did \nand what so many others in this Chamber did when we were Governors was \nto try to give individuals the tools to create their own opportunity, \nto create their own mobility, as well as to take the steps we could \nwhen there were barriers or structures in the way to move those out of \nthe way so people had a fair shot to succeed.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                National Sexual Assault Awareness Month\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today marks the beginning of National \nSexual Assault Awareness Month. It comes at a time when Congress is \nabout ready to take up reauthorization of the Justice For All Act--a \nlaw that has improved public safety, strengthened victims' rights, and \ndelivered justice all across this country. I am proud to be the lead \nRepublican sponsor of this bill, and I am even prouder of what it has \naccomplished and what it will continue to accomplish.\n  Thanks to the Justice For All Act and similar initiatives, law \nenforcement agencies across America now have greater resources to \nreduce the\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nrape kit backlog. I might just explain. A rape kit is, as it sounds, a \nforensic collection of evidence collected at the scene of a sexual \nassault. Much to our chagrin, we have learned over time that many of \nthese rape kits--this forensic evidence--is not forwarded to a lab for \ntesting and, thus, the DNA of the assailant is not identified. So we \nrealized that local jurisdictions needed more resources and more \nguidance and more expertise when it came to testing these untested rape \nkits because of the incredible evidence it provides, both to acquit \npeople who have been falsely accused of crimes, as well as to identify, \nindict, and convict serial sexual assailants.\n  This is sort of unique in many ways because people who commit rape \ndon't just do it one time. Many times they will do it time and time \nagain until they are caught. Worse yet, this is a crime of opportunity. \nMany times it involves children as well, as we know. So now we know \nthat thanks to the Justice For All Act and similar initiatives which \nhave allowed these rape kits to be taken off the evidence locker shelf \nand tested, that what has been a national scandal, which has allowed \nviolent criminals to remain on the streets, is now being addressed more \nand more.\n  I am not here to suggest that everything that can be done has been \ndone, but it is important for us to make sure these rape kits are \ntested and to get these serial sexual assailants off the streets and \nbrought before a court of law and justice.\n  Even a relatively small reduction in the backlog can lead to major \ngains in public safety and peace of mind. In the city of Detroit, for \nexample, the processing of 1,600 old sexual assault kits, including \nsome from the 1980s, allowed authorities to identify 100 different \nserial rapists, ten of whom were convicted rapists already. So this is \npowerful evidence. Incredibly, police sometimes keep this forensic \nevidence for 20 or 30 years, and it is still susceptible to being \ntested, and for the rapist to be identified and to be taken out of \ncirculation.\n  In the city of Houston, meanwhile, a backlog that once reached 6,600 \nuntested rape kits is now in the process of being completely \neliminated--thanks, in large part, to the support provided by this \nlegislation.\n  I wish to take a second to highlight the SAFER Act, which was \nincluded in the Violence Against Women Act and which passed just this \nlast year, and the fact that it funded a provision of the Justice For \nAll Act known as the Debbie Smith Act. I have had the pleasure of \nmeeting Debbie Smith for whom this legislation was named, and she has \nbecome a tireless advocate for the sorts of reforms and improved \nfunding that are contained in the SAFER Act and in the Justice For All \nreauthorization.\n  The SAFER Act mandated that more of the money the Federal Government \ngranted must be used to actually test old rape kits as well as dedicate \na portion of that money to inventory--evidence that had been sitting on \npolice evidence locker shelves or had been sent to laboratories but had \nnot yet been tested. This law, passed in 2013, has already played a \ncrucial role in making Federal support available for tackling the rape \nkit backlog.\n  I was proud to introduce that legislation and I am proud to sponsor \nreauthorization of the Justice For All Act. As I said a moment ago, I \nam enormously gratified and proud of what these laws have helped us \naccomplish. Upholding victims' rights and keeping dangerous predators \noff the street are two of the most solemn obligations the government \nhas, and we should never forget it.\n  With hundreds of thousands of rape kits still untested, we have a \nlong way to go; there is no question about it. It is encouraging to see \nthe progress that has been made. Hopefully, this will encourage us to \ntake even further steps to make sure these untested rape kits are \ntested and the people who are innocent are vindicated from any charges. \nBut the people who commit serial sexual assault, both against other \nadults and minors, should be and will be brought to justice.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Shifting gears to the economy, I wish to repeat a call I made \nyesterday and once again urge the majority leader in the context of the \nlegislation we are currently considering to allow Republican ideas for \neconomic growth and job creation to come to the floor for a vote.\n  I realize President Obama has stubbornly chosen to stick with the \nsame policies that have given us the weakest economic recovery \nfollowing a recession since World War II. It is also the highest--the \nlongest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression. Indeed, \nafter promoting the same fiscal and economic strategy for the last 5 \nyears--a strategy that involves higher taxes, more Federal spending, \nand more debt--the President and his allies seem to see no reason to \nchange course. His proposed budget for 2015, for example, would \nincrease Federal spending by $791 billion. It would also increase taxes \nby $1.8 trillion over 10 years, and increase our national debt by $8.3 \ntrillion. That is on top of the $17 trillion already--about $56,000 for \nevery man, woman, and child in America.\n  For those keeping score, the President has already raised taxes by \n$1.7 trillion during his presidency and increased our national debt by \nfour times that much. In other words, if more taxes and more spending \nwere the path to prosperity for this great Nation, America would be \nbooming, unemployment would be at zero, and our economy would be \nchugging along, creating new jobs right and left. Instead, the evidence \nis in. We are experiencing stagnation and mass unemployment. It is said \nthat insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over but \nsomehow expecting a different result. If that is the definition of \ninsanity, then maintaining the current policies of spending, tax, and \ndebt are the definition of insanity.\n  There has to be a better way, and there is, if only the majority \nleader would allow the Senate to do what it is supposed to do. This \nbody used to once be known as the world's greatest deliberative body, \nwhere we had the great debates on the issues of the time, and then we \nhad a vote, and we all accepted the majority vote in those instances. \nBut now, the new tactic by the majority leader seems to be to bring a \nbill to the floor without going through a committee where members of \nthat legislative committee are allowed to offer amendments and to get \nvotes on those amendments to help shape the committee product. We don't \neven do that anymore, and we didn't do that on this underlying \nunemployment insurance extension bill we will be voting on this week.\n  So Members of the Republican Conference--the Republican Members of \nthe Senate--have offered 45 amendments, all of which are designed to \nimprove the underlying piece of legislation and not just kick the can \ndown the road. I would think the majority leader and the President of \nthe United States would welcome our efforts to try to improve the \nunderlying legislation--but apparently not.\n  For example, can't we do a better job, let's say, of directing \nFederal dollars for workforce training efforts in places such as West \nVirginia and Texas so that for the good jobs that do exist, we could \nmatch the skills of these people who have been unemployed for a long \ntime to those good jobs that pay very well and do exist in abundance. \nSo we have 45 different suggestions and ideas we would like to offer in \nthe spirit of cooperation and trying to do our jobs as Members of the \nSenate. However, so far, the majority leader has steadfastly and, I \nmight add, stubbornly, pushed for another extension of unemployment \ninsurance without anything else attached that would actually improve \nworkforce training and programs that would upgrade stale skills for \npeople who have been unemployed for a long period of time so they can \nqualify to do the good-paying jobs that exist.\n  One of the favorite parlor games here in Washington, DC, is to spin \nvarious narratives to explain what is happening in Washington. \nSometimes I have heard the majority leader and others say the \nRepublican Party is the party of no. Well, that is a false narrative. \nWe have 45 different amendments that would improve this underlying \nlegislation. We have been shut out and, more importantly, the 26 \nmillion people I represent in the State of Texas have been shut out of \nthis debate and this discussion and this effort to come forward with a \nbetter product. Isn't that what we are here for?\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\n  I mentioned some of these ideas that have been proposed yesterday. \nFor example, I mentioned a bill, sponsored in different forms, by the \nsenior Senator from Maine and the junior Senator from South Carolina \nthat would relieve the burden of ObamaCare, which has been complained \nabout mightily by organized labor and others, that has compelled--or \ninduced, I should say--employers to take 40-hour workweeks and shrink \nthem to 30 hours or less in order to avoid ObamaCare penalties. So this \namendment would relieve that burden on workers and businesses by \nrestoring the traditional 40-hour work week. Why wouldn't that be a \nsubject worthy of debate and a vote in the Senate?\n  I mentioned a separate bill introduced by the junior Senator from \nSouth Carolina that would modernize workforce training and eliminate \nduplicative governmental programs. There are more than 40 different \ngovernment programs that purport to train people to improve their job \nskills all across the country.\n  I have had the chance to visit some of those locations in Texas, and \nthey do a very good job. But rather than have 40-plus different \nprograms, why don't we have 1 or 2 and use the extra money from all \nthat duplication in order to put more money into these programs so they \ncan train more people and get them back to work faster? That is another \nof the amendments that have been shut out of this process so far.\n  I also mention legislation sponsored by the senior Senator from Utah \nand the junior Senator from Kentucky respectively that would eliminate \nObamaCare's job-killing tax on medical innovation--something that I \nbelieve, if allowed to come for a vote, would receive an overwhelming \nmajority vote on a bipartisan basis in the Senate.\n  Also, the junior Senator from Kentucky has a piece of legislation \nthat would make it easier for Congress to block major regulations that \ncannot pass a simple cost-benefit analysis.\n  Meanwhile, the junior Senator from Wyoming and the senior Senator \nfrom North Dakota, whom I see on the floor, have a bill that would \nexpedite the approval of natural gas exports to our NATO partners in \nEurope and to Ukraine and help relieve that stranglehold Vladimir Putin \nand Russia have on Europe because they control most of their energy \nsupply. It would also approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, thereby \ncreating thousands of well-paying American jobs and would transport \nNorth Dakota oil and Canadian oil all the way down to Texas, where it \nwould be refined into gasoline and jet fuel and create thousands of \njobs in the process.\n  In addition, another amendment that has been offered on this \nunderlying legislation that would help the economy grow and help get \npeople back to work and rein in excessive Federal regulation that is \nkilling jobs--the senior Senator from Oklahoma has a bill that would \nstop new EPA regulations until--until--the Agency could tell us exactly \nwhat the impact of those regulations would be on jobs and the economy.\n  So most of the ideas I have listed have been submitted as one of \nthese 45 amendments to the underlying unemployment insurance bill. Yet \nthe majority leader, who is the traffic cop on the Senate floor--the \nrules of the Senate give him complete, 100-percent discretion to decide \nwhich amendments are going to get a vote and which will not--the \nmajority leader seems determined to prevent any votes on any of these \nideas.\n  If we are truly serious about job creation and if we are truly \nserious about doing everything possible to get America back to work--\nbecause of the dignity work provides and the means it provides people \nto provide for their own families and to pursue their dreams--why on \nEarth would we deny Members a chance to vote on these job-creating \npieces of legislation? Well, unfortunately, I think we got a little bit \nof a peek into the majority leader's playbook last week when he and \nothers had a press conference upstairs and talked about this agenda \nthey had for the time from the present through the election. And they \nwere pretty candid about it. This is an agenda they dreamed up in \nconjunction with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The \nmajority leader said as much in his announcement. In other words, this \nis a political plan by the political arm of the Democratic Senators' \ncampaign committee. So this is not about finding solutions or else the \nmajority leader would welcome these suggestions we have offered.\n  I would say to the majority leader, do not allow votes on these \namendments simply to placate me and others of my political party. Do \nnot do it for us. Do it for the 3.8 million people who have been \nunemployed for more than 6 months. Do it for them. Do it for the untold \nnumbers of people who have simply given up looking for work. Our labor \nparticipation rate--the percentage of Americans actually in the \nworkforce--is at a 40-year low. So it is not only the tragedy of the \nunemployment numbers that we see reported, it is people who are not \nreflected in those unemployment numbers because those statistics do not \ncount people who have given up. And that is what the low labor \nparticipation rate indicates. These are the people who need our help, \nand they are the ones who deserve a vote on these constructive \nsuggestions to the underlying piece of legislation. I hope the majority \nleader will reconsider.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in January of this year, I came to the \nfloor to talk about and honor one of my constituents, Javier Martinez, \nwho was killed on December 28 of last year, just as 2013 was ending. He \nwas shot while walking to a friend's house in New Haven. He was 18 \nyears old.\n  In the aftermath of that tragedy, I have spoken with Javier's family \nand his friends about his life and legacy. As I said on the Senate \nfloor a few months ago, Javier was a kind and intelligent young man, \nwell on his way to becoming a leader in his community. He cared a lot \nabout the environment. He worked with the Nature Conservancy and the \nNew Haven Urban Resources Initiative to plant trees and protect \nendangered species. His classmates at the Common Ground High School in \nNew Haven would like to plant a tree at the site of his death and \ndedicate a garden in his honor because of his interest in the outdoors \nand the natural resources that enhance the beauty of our world, which \nhe loved so much.\n  Yesterday morning I visited some of Javier's classmates at the Common \nGround High School in New Haven. I spoke to a group of young people who \nwere serious about ending gun violence because it is such a serious \ncause of heartbreak, grief, loss, and sacrifice--not just in New Haven, \nnot just in Sandy Hook, but throughout our country in big and small \ntowns, rural and urban neighborhoods, people from all backgrounds and \ndifferent walks of life. I spoke to the Common Ground AP U.S. \nGovernment class, where the students and their teacher, Brian Kelahan, \nwere kind enough to welcome me and share with me some of their views on \ngun violence and the justice system in this country. I told them what I \nfirmly believe: that I have a duty to listen to them and to all people \nwho live in Connecticut because they have a unique insight and a depth \nof understanding and perspective that should be shared here in \nWashington, DC, in this body and around the country.\n  It is my job to bring that perspective, those insights back to \nWashington. So I want to begin by showing my colleagues a picture of \nthose Common Ground students who were Javier's classmates. This \nphotograph was taken at the top of East Rock. Unfortunately, it is \nsomewhat indistinct as to who is pictured here. But it is overlooking a \nscene that Javier knew well with people who were his friends. They are \ndedicated to ending gun violence in this country because they know \nfirsthand the toll it takes. They have been no stranger to gun violence \nin their neighborhoods. Many of them have to travel long distances to \ncome to this school--the Common Ground High School in New Haven--from \nneighborhoods that are afflicted with gun violence, and they suffer the \ntraumatic, emotional, sometimes physical threats that come with that \nexposure to violence.\n  Connecticut also has been no stranger to gun violence over the last \nyear and a half, and I have come to the floor many times with my \ncolleague Senator Murphy to commemorate the courageous and strong \npeople of New Town\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nand in particular the families who suffered the loss of 20 beautiful \nchildren and 6 great educators.\n  What the students who met with me yesterday morning wanted me to hear \nbears telling and repeating here. They were speaking truth to power. \nWhat they wanted all of my colleagues to hear and what I strongly \nbelieve is that as tragic as the mass slayings are in this country, no \nless tragic, no less horrific, no less important is the shooting of one \ninnocent 18-year-old young man like Javier while walking to a friend's \nhouse. It may not make the national news. It rarely does anymore \nbecause we have come to regard gun violence, in a way, like the \nbackground noise of our society. It may not feature prominently in the \nheadlines. Individual gun violence is a plague, still, that affects all \nof us as it affects any one of us. We cannot let these shootings \ncontinue in our urban communities. Many of them are committed with \nhandguns. Many are the result of illegal gun trafficking and straw \npurchases. Far too many are ignored by the news media--simply \ndisregarded background noise.\n  Gun violence affects all of us wherever we live in Connecticut and \nthe country. If anything positive is to come of these tragedies in New \nTown and New Haven--and in the 30,000 other deaths that have happened \nsince New Town--as a result of gun violence, it should be the uniting \nand bringing together of all who have been touched by gun violence, \nwhich is all of us. That goal is one that will drive me, and I am sure \nothers here, to seek an end to gun violence with commonsense, sensible \nmeasures, such as the ones we considered--background checks, mental \nhealth initiatives, school safety.\n  The Presiding Officer helped to craft a very sensible and commonsense \napproach to background checks. We prohibit felons, criminals, mentally \nderanged people, and addicts from having these firearms, but we have no \nuniversal background check system to make sure they do not purchase \nthem. How effective can enforcement be if there is no real way of \nchecking who is buying these firearms?\n  A young woman who is a senior at Common Ground, in fact, asked me \nwhat laws can be effective when people are willing to break them, buy \nfirearms even though they are prohibited from doing so. That is an \nimportant question. The answer is that no law is perfect, none can be \nabsolutely perfectly enforced, but regulations and restrictions on \ndangerous people having firearms can reduce the level of gun violence \nin our society, reduce the number of criminals buying weapons. \nBackground checks especially have been shown--there is empirical \nevidence--to reduce the number of guns that get into the wrong hands.\n  Students and teachers asked me about the way our country deals with \ncriminal justice. Systematic disparities continue to plague our justice \nsystem, resulting in severely disproportionate rates of incarceration \nfor young men and women of color. They spoke about the overlapping \ncultures of law enforcement and school discipline and about the need to \nreduce prison populations and bring about much needed reform in the way \nsentences are calculated, not only as a matter of fairness but also to \nreduce the cost in our society of incarceration.\n  These young people are thinking about where our society should be \ngoing. What is our plan and our strategy for making our neighborhoods \nand communities better places and safer places to live?\n  I made a commitment to those students pictured here in this picture \nthat I would come back again. And I will. I made a commitment that I \nwould tell their story, which is really Javier's story--a story of hope \nand promise, dreams and aspirations, cut short by gun violence because \nhe was in the wrong place at the wrong time and murdered.\n  That investigation may be ongoing, but we already know the answer to \nthe fundamental question: Can we do something to reduce gun violence? \nThe answer is yes, in his name, in the name of 30,000 people who have \nperished along with him from gun violence, needless and senseless \ndeaths that are all our responsibility.\n  I respect the Second Amendment, as I know the Presiding Officer does. \nI respect the right of people under the Constitution and the Second \nAmendment to own and possess firearms and use them for hunting, for \nrecreation, target practice. I will continue to honor the memory of \nJavier Martinez and the lives and aspirations and homes of the students \nat Common Ground, and work not only to build that garden but to make \nthe neighborhood around it safer and the community around it a more \nnurturing and better place to live.\n  I have made no secret of the fact that I believe this body has a \nresponsibility to act, and its failure to do so is shameful and \ndisgraceful. The students of Common Ground agree. If their aspirations \ninclude organizing to make more people aware of the need for this \naction, I commend them. In fact, I urge them to participate in this \neffort.\n  I wish to close with the words from a card they sent me with this \nphotograph. The card read:\n\n       Senator Blumenthal, we are so grateful for your help in \n     remembering Javier Martinez, supporting our Common Ground \n     community and taking action to stop gun violence. It means so \n     much to have you by our side as we recover and make meaning \n     in this incredibly difficult time. Know that we will stay \n     with you in the struggle to build a safe and peaceful \n     community.\n\n  I know it sounds more like rhetoric than reality. But I will tell my \ncolleagues in the Senate that as long as the young people of Common \nGround and others like them are at our side, we will prevail in \ncommonsense measures to reduce gun violence, and we will prevail in the \nfight to make America a better, safer place to live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nunemployment insurance legislation we are currently considering. While \nwe all want to help those who are unemployed, the real solution is to \nget them a job, is to create a growing economy and more jobs. We need \nto get this economy going. One way we can do it is by empowering our \nenergy sector.\n  That does not mean spending more government money. What it means is \ntaking the shackles off billions in private investment that is ready to \ngo into energy development in this country. In 2011, the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce commissioned a study. The study took a look at the energy \nprojects that are stalled in this country due to government bureaucracy \nand redtape.\n  That study found there are more than 350 energy projects, projects \nthat will both produce renewable energy as well as projects that will \nproduce traditional energy that are stalled at a cost of $1.1 trillion \nto the American economy, at a cost of almost 2 million jobs for the \nAmerican people.\n  I want to take a minute to read from that report:\n\n       In aggregate, planning and construction of the subject \n     projects would generate $577 billion in direct investments, \n     calculated in current dollars. The indirect and induced \n     effect, where we apply the multiplier, would generate an \n     approximate $1.1 trillion increase in U.S. Gross Domestic \n     Product, GDP, including $352 billion in employment earnings \n     based on present discounted value over an average \n     construction period of 7 years.\n       Furthermore, we estimate that as many as 1.9 million jobs \n     would be required during each year of construction.\n\n  Two million jobs. Many of these projects are still blocked by \ngovernment redtape and the permitting process. That is why I have \nintroduced a States First All-of-the Above Energy Plan for our country \nto get these projects going. If you think about it, it just makes \nsense. The States, after all, are the laboratories of democracy. Let's \nmake them the laboratories of energy for our country.\n  The right energy plan is about much more than just energy. It means \neconomic growth, it means national security, and it means jobs--jobs \nfor those who are currently unemployed and jobs at a good wage. Today I \nam offering amendments to the unemployment insurance legislation that \nwill do all of those things.\n  The first one I wish to talk about for a minute is the Energy \nSecurity Act. I am pleased to join with the senior Senator from Wyoming \nMr. Barrasso and also our ranking member on the Energy Committee, \nSenator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, as well as other cosponsors on the \nlegislation, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, obviously a big energy-\nproducing State, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, and Senator David \nVitter of Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\n  What the Energy Security Act does, quite simply, is first it approves \nthe Keystone XL project. This is a more than $5 billion pipeline that \nhas been in the permitting process now for more than 5 years. We are \nnow in the sixth year of the permitting process trying to get a permit \nfrom the administration. We have thousands of pipelines all across this \ncountry, millions of miles of pipeline, and here is a project that for \n6 years the administration has held in limbo.\n  The latest greatest technology moves Canadian oil, our closest ally, \nCanada, moves oil from Canada as well as oil from my State, North \nDakota, and Montana to refineries across the United States. We import \n50 percent of our oil. Do Americans want to get that from the Middle \nEast or do they want to produce it here in our country and get it from \nour closest friend and ally, Canada? That is an obvious answer. That is \nwhy in poll after poll, 3 to 1, Americans want this project approved. \nBut it remains in limbo, now in its sixth year of the permitting \nprocess on the part of the administration.\n  So when I talk about those 350 projects, when I talk about $1.1 \ntrillion in GDP, when we talk about almost 2 million American jobs that \nstudy performed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce identified, you can see \nwhat they are talking about when you talk about this project that has \nbeen held up now into the sixth year.\n  The legislation, the Energy Security Act, would approve that project, \nbut it would also approve the 24 pending applications that would allow \nus to export LNG, liquefied natural gas, to our allies who need that \nhelp. Right now in this country we produce 30 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas a year. We consume about 26 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas. That is growing rapidly. Believe me, I know. We are flaring off \nnatural gas in our State that we want to get to market. We need a \nmarket for that product. But right now we are not allowed to export \nliquefied natural gas to countries such as the NATO countries.\n  Look what is going on in Eastern Europe, such as what Russia is doing \nin Ukraine. What is next? One of the reasons Russia is able to take \nthat kind of action and the European Union is reluctant to put \nsanctions in place as a response is because Europe, Ukraine, are \ndependent on Russia for natural gas for energy. Over one-third of the \nsupply of the EU's energy comes from Russia.\n  So we have an opportunity here. We can create economic activity. We \ncan create jobs. We can use that natural gas we produce beyond what we \nneed here at home to help our allies and at the same time stand up to \nRussian aggression. That is why I say this is about jobs. This is about \ngetting our economy growing. But this is also very much about national \nsecurity, our national security here at home, energy security for our \ncountry, but also security working with our allies to stand up against \nthe kind of aggression we see from Russia and from President Putin \nright now.\n  In terms of jobs, the Obama administration's State Department, their \nown State Department, has estimated the Keystone XL Pipeline during the \nconstruction phase will create more than 40,000 jobs. That is just that \none project, more than 40,000 jobs. If you look at some of the studies, \nvery conservative studies on job creation that will occur by approving \nthese LNG applications, the National Economic Research Associates \nidentifies more than 45,000 jobs that would be created by expediting \napproval of those permits.\n  Let me give you two examples so you understand the magnitude of what \nwe are dealing with here. Cheniere Energy wants to invest $11 billion \nin an export facility at Corpus Cristi, TX. That is not one penny of \ngovernment spending--not one penny. We have a huge deficit and we have \na huge debt. We have got to get on top of it. That means controlling \nour spending, but that means we have to have economic growth.\n  So here are companies willing to invest and create jobs and create \neconomic growth and create tax revenues--not raising taxes, creating \ntax revenue. Why in the world do we hold them up? How does that make \nsense? How is that common sense? Here we are on an unemployment \ninsurance bill where we are going to spend more government money to pay \npeople who remain unemployed when we could approve these projects and \nput them back to work at good-paying jobs. Instead of growing the \ndeficit, we could actually create tax revenues from a growing economy--\nagain, not higher taxes, from a growing economy that helps reduce our \ndeficit and debt.\n  So the Cheniere Energy project, $1 billion investment facility in \nCorpus Christi, creates a market for some of the natural gas that is \nnow being flared off, according to the Perryman Group, 3,000 direct \nconstruction jobs, far more indirect jobs during the construction \nphase. Here is another project. Exxon wants to build the Golden Pass \nLNG facility at Sabine, TX, which is on the border between Texas and \nLouisiana. That is a $10 billion investment. Perryman Group estimates \nthat between both the direct construction jobs and indirect jobs, on \nthe order of 45,000 jobs for that project during construction, almost \n4,000 permanent jobs.\n  So you can see when we talk about NERA, the National Economic \nResearch Associates, saying, hey, there are going to be 45,000 jobs for \nthese projects, that is a very conservative estimate. It creates so \nmuch more--not just good-paying jobs but also a growing economy, cash \nrevenues to help with the deficit and national security, and security \nworking with our allies at a critical time, a critical time in Eastern \nEurope.\n  In addition, I have offered other legislation I filed, that I am now \noffering as an amendment to this unemployment insurance bill--again, \nlegislation that will create jobs and help people get back to work.\n  The second one I want to mention is the Empower States Act. The \nEmpower States Act gives primary regulatory responsibility to the \nStates when it comes to regulating hydraulic fracturing. The reality \nis, a Federal one-size-fits-all approach does not work for hydraulic \nfracturing, because the way hydraulic fracturing is done across this \ncountry is different in different States. The way they hydraulically \nfracture in States, for example, in West Virginia, where they are going \nafter natural gas is very different than the way they do it in North \nDakota where we are going after oil. We drill down 2 miles, 2 miles \nvertical drill bore to reach the oil, and then we drill out for miles \nat that level.\n  We produce primarily oil and natural gas--huge amounts of natural gas \nand gas liquids as a byproduct--but we are miles away from any potable \nwater, which is much closer to the surface, so it is very safe. The \nwater that is produced--both the frack water as well as the water that \ncomes up with that oil and natural gas--we put back downhole through \nsaltwater disposal wells, in essence recycling the water. Anything that \ncan't be reused goes back downhole and that creates a recycling \nprocess.\n  That is different than the way it is done in the Marcellus shale in \nplaces such as New York, Pennsylvania, and it is different than the way \nit is done in West Virginia and different than the way it is done in \nthe Utica shale in Ohio. There are some similarities with the way it is \ndone in Texas in the Eagle Ford, where they also drill for oil.\n  But the point is, the way this is done, the technologies that are \nused, even the product we are going after--and certainly the formations \nare different across the country.\n  When we put a Federal one-size-fits-all approach in place, it doesn't \nwork. Not only does it not do the job in terms of making sure we have \nthe right kind of regulation, it holds up projects. It prevents job \ncreation. It doesn't allow our economy to grow. It doesn't empower us \nto produce the energy that could be produced across this country with \nthe right approach, with the right energy plan.\n  As far as job creation, our State is now the fastest growing State. \nWe have the lowest unemployment, and we have the fastest growing \neconomy, 7.6 percent in the most recent statistic versus a 2.6-percent \naverage for the other States. Again, this is about creating a growing \neconomy. It is about creating jobs.\n  Also, I am offering the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act legislation I \nfiled as an amendment to this bill. DEJA is a series of bills that has \nalready passed the House. This is all legislation that has already \npassed the House. So we know if we can get a vote in the Senate, the \nlegislation we can pass in the\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\nSenate has already gone through the House. We are already a huge \ndistance on the journey to getting this done.\n  What does the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act do? It does exactly what \nthe title says. It reduces the regulatory burden, it sets goals, it \nhelps us produce more energy and create jobs.\n  For example, we establish an American energy development plan for \nFederal lands. We have all of these Federal lands--millions and \nmillions of acres of Federal land both onshore and offshore. The \nDepartment of Interior should have a plan to develop energy on those \npublic lands, and they should set goals to do so. This legislation \nwould require them to do just that.\n  We freeze and study the impact of EPA rules on gasoline regulations. \nThat benefits all Americans at the pump, not only small businesses that \nare looking to hire people but families, all consumers.\n  We provide onshore oil and gas leasing certainty, meaning that the \nDepartment of Interior has to approve the permits within a stipulated, \nreasonable period of time. It advances offshore wind production. This \nis about producing renewable energy as well as traditional energy. It \nstreamlines the permitting process. It provides access to the National \nPetroleum Reserve for development in Alaska. It requires the BLM to \nhold live Internet auctions. Let's use this new technology to encourage \ninvestment in job creation and energy development in new and creative \nways.\n  It establishes rules on surface mining that make sense, commonsense \nrules. It increases States' revenue sharing for Outer Continental Shelf \ndrilling, offshore drilling, and it also offers lease sales off the \nVirginia coast.\n  Clearly, developing these new areas creates revenue for the States, \ncreates revenues for the Federal Government, creates more energy for \nour country, and creates more jobs--not spending Federal money, \ninvesting hundreds of billions of private dollars that are currently \nsidelined in these new and exciting projects.\n  Finally, I am offering the stream buffer rule legislation that I \nfiled as a stand-alone bill. I am offering that as an amendment as well \nto this UI bill. The Department of Interior wants to implement a \nFederal one-size-fits-all rule for stream buffer zones, meaning mining \nproximity to rivers and streams. Again, a one-size-fits-all, one-size \nFederal approach for every situation does not work. Allow the States to \ntake the primary role in regulating the stream buffer zones and let \nthem do what makes sense.\n  With all of this legislation, we can empower hundreds of billions in \nprivate investment. We can put that investment in good old-fashioned \nAmerican ingenuity into getting our country going, getting our economy \ngrowing, and getting our people back to work.\n  We can do it. The way we can get started is simply by voting. That is \nwhat we do in the Senate. That is what we do in this Senate forum. Let \nus put forward our ideas and let's have a vote. If it passes, we can do \nthese things. But why in the world wouldn't we get a vote? That is what \nthis body is all about. Let's have the debate. Come to the floor and \nlet's have a debate. Let's debate each one of these and a lot more. \nThat is what we do. Then let's vote. That is how we will decide. That \nis what the American people expect us to do. They sent us to the Senate \nto do just that.\n  The question I have is why aren't we voting on these amendments and a \nlot more if we are serious about getting people back to work? If \nsomebody wants to come down and refute this, come on down, do it, and \nthen let's vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I commend my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, \nnot only for his leadership on so many energy initiatives, but for the \nproposal he has put forth this afternoon.\n  I am pleased to be able to join him in support of those various \nmeasures--measures that, as he has outlined, will not only as a nation \nallow us to move forward and take that leadership role, which we so \nrightly have and should use as something to benefit not only ourselves \nand our economy, jobs within the Nation, but to benefit other nations. \nThe proposal he has advanced--again, that I am pleased to join him on--\nis one that allows for incredible jobs and opportunities with the \nconstruction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, provisions that will allow \nfor expedited processing of our LNG exports.\n  It recognizes, again, that when we produce more in this country--when \nwe produce more of a resource that not only allows us to be more energy \nsecure, but that also helps our friends and allies around the world, it \nalso helps to truly effectively reduce the cost of that energy to \nAmerican consumers.\n  How can this possibly be a negative? How can this possibly be bad \nwhen it adds to jobs, when it strengthens our economy, and when it \nmakes us more secure as a nation.\n  There are many win/wins that we see in these energy proposals we have \nin front of us that Senator Hoeven has offered. But, again, if we only \nhave an opportunity to kind of talk aloud about them but never actually \nhave the chance to move them forward through a legislative process so \nthey can actually become law so we can actually see those benefits play \nout, it doesn't do us much good.\n  I appreciate what my colleague has outlined this afternoon through \nhis proposals. I know we will have an opportunity to speak further to \nthem tomorrow, and I look forward to doing that as well.\n\n\n                               King Cove\n\n  I want to take 5 minutes in this late afternoon to continue to \neducate not only my colleagues but folks within this administration and \naround the country about an injustice that continues to unfold in a \nsmall corner of my State, a very remote part of my State in \nsouthwestern Alaska for the small community of King Cove. There are \nabout 950 people who live in King Cove.\n  I have been fighting since I came to the Senate, and before I came my \nfather took up this fight, in an effort to get a small connector road, \na small 10-mile, one-lane gravel, noncommercial-use road that will \nallow the people of King Cove access to an all-weather airport so they \ncan get out in the event of medical emergencies.\n  We had another one last night. I had an email saying the weather had \ncompletely taken over in the gulf in King Cove, and there was an \nemergency call that went out. It was for a 58-year-old fisherman who \nhad been injured. He had been out on a Seattle-based processor called \nthe M/V Golden Alaska.\n  This fisherman happened to live in Seattle, and he was onboard this \nboat. They were out near Unimak Island, which is out toward the chain \nin the North Pacific, when this fisherman was accidentally sprayed with \na high-pressure hose and it severely injured his eye. It was 1 a.m. \nwhen this incident happened.\n  We have this big vessel, a big processing vessel of 305 feet, heading \nfrom Dutch Harbor to Seattle when the accident happened. I don't have a \nmap with me, but if we can envision, there is a lot of big, wide-open \nocean, and medical care is a long way away. This fisherman couldn't \nwait for that medical care. The closest deepwater port was King Cove.\n  King Cove got the word that they had an injured fisherman onboard and \nthey said: Look, our clinic can't handle somebody who has critical \nneeds. See if you can take the boat over to Cold Bay so that not \nnecessarily he can get medical care, he could get on an aircraft out of \nCold Bay that could fly him the 600 miles or thereabouts to Anchorage \nfor the medical care he needed. But the problem they faced was they had \nwind gusts of up to 60 miles per hour. They had rough seas, very rough \nseas.\n  The ship's captain said: I am not going into Cold Bay. I am not going \nto try to hoist a man who has been severely injured in his eye--I am \nnot going to try to hoist him up a 20-foot ladder at the Cold Bay dock. \nWe are not going to do that.\n  So they went into King Cove, a safer, more protected cove, and they \nwere able to get the gentleman there at 11:30 a.m. The physician's \nassistant--we don't have a doctor in King Cove, we have a PA, somebody \nwho basically does a good job in stabilizing folks. She contacted the \nemergency room in Anchorage.\n  The ER folks said: Look, you have to get this guy to an \nophthalmologist as\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\nsoon as you possibly can in order to preserve as much of his eyesight \nas possible.\n  As I mentioned, not only does King Cove not have a doctor, they don't \nhave any kind of a eye specialist. The nearest ophthalmologist is in \nAnchorage, more than 600 miles away.\n  The PA, Katie Eby, did what health professionals at the clinic always \ndo in an emergency like this. She calls for help to our Coast Guard. \nShe begs the Coast Guard to come. The Coast Guard says they will come, \nbut they can't come now. They can't chance the weather to get in there. \nThey are not going to risk a pilot and his crew to get into this \nsituation where we unnecessarily put even more lives at risk. They \nsaid: Look, we are going to have to wait until the conditions improve \nand the winds die down. So the physician's assistant tries to stabilize \nthe fisherman, manage his pain as best she can and basically she waits, \nholding the hand of a man and telling him the Coast Guard will come.\n  The Coast Guard did finally make it in around 3 in the afternoon the \nnext day. So this injured fisherman waited 13 hours for the winds to \nsettle.\n  The problem with this story, of course, is there were other \nalternatives for this fisherman who had been injured, who had to wait \nin pain wondering if he was going to go blind, if he was going to \ncompletely lose his eyesight while he was waiting for the Coast Guard \nhelicopter to come in, to pluck him out, to fly him over to Cold Bay, \nand have a flight take him to Anchorage. The other alternative--the \nsafe, reliable, affordable way out is a 10-mile, one-lane, gravel, \nnoncommercial-use road. If that fisherman could have been put in an \nambulance and taken across that road, a dozen hours could have been \nspared.\n  Yesterday's medevac marks the fifth medevac by the Coast Guard in \nthis current year. In 2014, we have had five Coast Guard medevacs. Keep \nin mind, each one of these medevacs costs around $210,000 per flight. \nSo for those who are saying we can't have a road in King Cove because \nit is going to cost the taxpayers money, it is costing the taxpayers \nmoney because we are footing the bill for the Coast Guard.\n  Thank goodness the Coast Guard is there. But we are also putting the \nlives of these men and women--our fine coasties--at risk when we are \ndoing this. If we had a road, who is building the road? It is the State \nof Alaska. Who is maintaining the road? It is the Aleutians East \nBorough. This is not the U.S. taxpayer who is paying for this, again, \n10-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road.\n  There are options here. But the Secretary of the Interior has \ndetermined she wants to look at other options. She wants to find other \nalternatives. The fact of the matter is we have been looking at \nalternatives for a long time now, and those alternatives have been \ntried and failed or studied and reviewed and discarded.\n  But the one thing we are pretty sure of is that this fisherman from \nSeattle who was injured and had to wait 13 hours to get out--we are \npretty sure we could have put him on an ambulance across that road--if \none existed--and he would not have had to wait for 12 hours.\n  We are pretty sure that the 63-year-old woman who suffered heart \nissues on Valentine's Day and had to wait hours and hours for the Coast \nGuard to pluck her out of King Cove before she was able to safely make \nit to the hospital in Anchorage, we are pretty sure she could have been \nspared some of that agony.\n  We are pretty sure that a couple of weeks ago when a father who had \nbeen crushed by a 600-pound crab pot--his pelvis crushed and his legs \nbroken--that for hours and hours and hours he waited in the King Cove \nclinic to get medevaced out, and of the fact that his infant son, a 1-\nmonth old baby named Wyatt who was there in respiratory distress also \nhad to be medevaced out on the same day, only that baby had to make it \nthrough the night in the arms of the physician's assistant, and the PA \nknowing and feeling the infant was in distress and actually feeling him \nstop breathing.\n  If we had a road in place, with the agony of not only the individuals \nwho have been injured but the loved ones who care about them, there are \nbetter alternatives, and, it is very clear to me, alternatives that \nwork for the people who live there and the people who are in the area--\nthe fishermen.\n  Maybe I am taking this a little too personally because my oldest son \ncrabbed in the Bering Sea this winter. He was out in those waters. He \nwas out in that foul weather. He was working in a very dangerous \nindustry. Anybody who has ever watched ``Deadliest Catch'' knows what I \nam talking about. Both my sons fish in these areas. They go through the \nGulf of Alaska. They go through Nunivak Pass every year as fishermen. \nIf something should happen to them or to somebody else on their crew, \nand the closest deepwater port for them happened to be King Cove but \nthe weather was to the ground, I want a road for them.\n  I want a road for the people in King Cove. I want a road for the \nSeattle fisherman who is transiting back. It is a lifeline. It is a way \nto get to help. Right now, the one thing keeping these people from \ngetting help is the Secretary of the Interior because she has concluded \nthat we cannot build a 10-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use \nroad without disturbing the waterfowl, the black brant, and the geese \nthat go through the Izembek.\n  We have all heard my story on this many times before. We know we can \nbuild this small road and have it coexist peacefully with the birds \nthat go through there. We know the people who live there will continue \nto care for the waterfowl and the wildlife just as they have for \nthousands of years.\n  I don't want to keep coming to the floor and ranting about why we \nneed this road. I don't want to make it appear we are sensationalizing \nthe injuries of men, women, and children for the purpose of winning \nthis fight. But I am not going to have somebody die out there when we \ncould have found a safer and saner path forward.\n  So I am going to keep coming to the floor. I hope the Secretary of \nthe Interior is listening, that folks in the administration are \nlistening, and that they understand we in Alaska can be responsible for \nthe lands where we live, and we can provide for the health and safety \nof those who are out there and those who are transiting through. But we \nneed this Secretary to do the right thing for the people of the State \nof Alaska and provide for a life-saving road.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for a few minutes, \nif I could, as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                          Iran U.N. Ambassador\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There is an issue facing this country that needs to be \naddressed firmly and decisively. I am encouraged there is a bipartisan \neffort to deal with this issue, and the issue is very simple. The \nperson who has been nominated to be the U.N. Ambassador for Iran is a \ngentleman who participated in the takeover of our Embassy in Tehran, \nholding hostage 52 U.S. personnel for 444 days.\n  This is a slap in the face by the Iranian Government to the American \npeople, to the hostages, and it should not be allowed to stand. Senator \nCruz, I believe, will be offering a unanimous consent request \npotentially dealing with this issue, but I just wanted to rise for a \nfew minutes and speak in support of what he is trying to accomplish in \nthe Senate. I am somewhat encouraged that there is a bipartisan effort \nforming among our intel folks to deal with this affront to the American \npeople, to all those held hostage, and basically to human dignity. The \nidea that the Iranians would be appointing someone connected in such an \napparently direct way with the Embassy takeover back in 1979 to \nrepresent their nation in the U.N. tells us all we need to know about \nIran.\n  This hardline-moderate divide doesn't exist. This is all a game. \nPresident Ruhani, when he was the nuclear negotiator for Iran, bragged \nabout how much progress they made when the heat was off. If he were \ntruly moderate\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nhe wouldn't have been on the ballot and wouldn't be serving today at \nthe pleasure of the Ayatollah. Nobody serves in a high position in Iran \nwithout the blessing of the Supreme Leader.\n  So the idea of making this gentleman--I don't want to butcher his \nname--the Ambassador to the United Nations from Iran when he has \nactively participated in violating every diplomatic principle involved, \nthe idea of invading a consulate or embassy and taking hostages runs \nafoul of every principle of international law and diplomatic behavior.\n  It would be different if in the last 30 or so years the Iranian \nregime had changed. We have relationships with people today who are \nsome of our strongest allies who used to be our enemies. There is \nnothing changing in Iran since the Embassy takeover that would place \nIran in the column of a friend of America. This regime has been \nactively involved in worldwide terrorism plots. They have provided \nequipment to those who were fighting in Iraq to kill our soldiers. They \nsupport Hamas and Hezbollah, terrorist organizations. They have been \ndesignated by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. \nThey are trying to build a nuclear weapon, not a powerplant. So they \nhave actually been no good for a very long time. I hope this body will \nsend a signal to the Iranians that we will not accept on U.S. soil the \nperson who has been designated, because this person was actively \nengaged in holding 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, in contravention \nof every law on the books and human decency. If Iran wants a new \nrelationship with the United States, this is not a good way to start \nit.\n  I think there will be a lot of bipartisan objection to allowing this \nperson to come to New York. We have provisions in our laws that give us \nthe right as the host nation to exclude people who have been involved \nin acts of terrorism against the United States or their neighbors and \nany security threat. Again, the idea of doing business with former \nenemies is the way of life. The idea of accepting that the Ambassador \nto the United Nations from Iran as one of the people intricately \ninvolved in the takeover of our Embassy and holding Americans hostage \nfor 444 days is an affront to us as a people and to the United Nations \nas a whole. He has served in other posts in Europe. That is not the \nissue. It is our Embassy that was taken over; it was our people who \nwere held hostage, and the surviving hostages are very upset, as they \nshould be. We don't want to reward people for doing bad things. This \nwould be the ultimate reward for somebody who did a very bad thing.\n  It would be a mistake to engage Iran in this way and not push back. \nIf there is to be a better relationship with Iran, it is worth fighting \nfor. We are going to have to stand up to these people because they will \ntake advantage of us if we allow it.\n  I look forward to supporting Senator Cruz and others who want to join \nin the effort to stop this appointment because it is wrong.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cruz pertaining to the introduction of S. 2195 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            DEA'S Final Rule\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to urge the Drug \nEnforcement Administration to issue the final rule necessary to \nimplement the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010. I note \nthat year--2010--because that is the year this bipartisan bill was \npassed.\n  What it does is it provides consumers with safe and responsible ways \nto dispose of unused prescription medications and controlled \nsubstances.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn, who was the lead cosponsor on the Republican \nside of this legislation, as well as Senator Grassley and Senator \nBrown, for working with me on the legislation.\n  The important law expands safe disposal options for individuals and \nfor long-item care facilities, and it promotes the development and \nexpansion of prescription drug take-back programs.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this simply means that when you get \nprescription drugs and you do not use all of them--or your doctor \nprescribes something else--you do not just leave them in your medicine \ncabinet, where someone else might be taking them. Instead, you find a \nsafe place to dispose of them, so someone else does not start taking \nthem and potentially get hooked on the drug.\n  Why did I mention 2010? Well, 2010 was the year President Obama \nsigned this bill into law. It has now been 4 years--4 years--as we have \nawaited the rules. I will describe why, but I think it is time to put \nthis law into action.\n  The DEA issued a proposed rule in December 2012. Unfortunately, that \ntook 2 years. There were some comments then about making sure the rules \nworked for our long-term care facilities--you can imagine, there are a \nlot of prescription drugs at long-term facilities--and the Departments \nof Defense and Veterans Affairs. But these issues should be addressed \nin the final rule. It is time now to get this rule done so we have more \noptions to easily and safely dispose of our prescription drugs.\n  I know the final rule is now at the Office of Management and Budget \nfor their approval. I have spoken to them about this rule. I am also \naware they have only had the rule for 35 days. So they are not really \nthe ones who have been holding this up. They have 90 days to get this \nout, and they have pledged that they hope to get that done.\n  We need to get the rule done, and let me tell you why. As a former \nprosecutor, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact that drug \naddiction has on families and communities. During my 8 years as chief \nprosecutor in Hennepin County--the largest county in our State--drug \ncases made up about one-third of the caseload.\n  Most Americans know that we have a problem with serious drugs. But \nwhat most Americans may not know is that one of our most serious drug \nproblems is, in fact, drugs that are in the medicine cabinet--drugs \nthat are prescribed legally.\n  Within those cabinets are some of the most addictive prescription \ndrugs out there--like pain killers and beta blockers. Prescription \ndrugs such as these are some of the most commonly abused drugs--and \npeople are surprised by this, but they are ahead of cocaine, heroin, \nand methamphetamines in many States.\n  Teenagers now abuse prescription drugs more than almost any other \ndrug, and the majority of teens who abuse these drugs get them for \nfree. They get them in that medicine cabinet or, more likely, a friend \nof theirs gets them from their mom's or dad's medicine cabinet--often \nwithout the knowledge of the person who has it.\n  I think we all know that many leftover drugs are lying around. You go \nto see the dentist for surgery, and they prescribe you something for \npain. You feel OK. You only take 1 or 2, and then you have 10 left, and \nthey are just sitting in the medicine cabinet.\n  We used to tell people to flush these drugs down the toilet. This is \nnot a good idea for our water supply, and I think most people know \nthat. Some people will tell you that the proper way to dispose of your \ndrugs is to crush up your extra pills, then mix them with--and this is \nwhat they say--kitty litter or coffee grounds.\n  We need to do all we can to keep these dangerous drugs out of the \nhands of teens, but I am just not sure--especially if someone does not \nhave a cat--that kitty litter is a realistic solution. Not everyone \nthese days makes their own coffee nor has coffee grounds. We are \ndealing here with a very serious\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\nproblem, and all we are hearing about is kitty litter and coffee \ngrounds. That is why we passed this bill.\n  One option parents have is to dispose of leftover drugs at a National \nTake-Back Day. Listen to this. Over 3 million pounds of prescription \nmedications have been removed from circulation through seven National \nTake-Back Days that have been held since 2010. I participated in one of \nthose days in Brooklyn Park, MN, last fall.\n  While these events have been incredibly successful, one-day events \nthat are held a few times each year do not fully address the problem of \nhow we are going to dispose of our drugs safely.\n  For instance, let's say you heard about a Take-Back Day right after \nyou had your dental surgery. Great, you can bring over those pills and \nsafely dispose of them, but then you remember your kid has a soccer \ntournament, and you cannot make it that day to dispose of the drugs. It \nlooks like those pills are going to stay sitting right where they are \nin the medicine cabinet. I doubt many people have the time right then \nand there to call and ask when the next Tack-Back Day might be and put \nit on their calendar in a red pen.\n  We have to be realistic. These Take-Back Days are great. In my State, \nespecially in the metropolitan area, under the leadership of our \nsheriff Rich Stanek we actually have some permanent facilities in \nplaces where they can be brought permanently--the drugs--in the \nlibraries and places like that, but we really have gone the extra step. \nThe reason our law enforcement is such a big fan of this law is they \nknow we could take so many more drugs in if, for instance, long-term \ncare facilities were able to simply bring the drugs to one location \neach and every day.\n  If, for instance--and some of our drug stores have been open to this, \nsome of these national chains--imagine how good this would be if they \nwould just be willing to take these back and then they bring them \nsomewhere. But to do that they need certain legal protections. They \nneed protections about how they transport them. That is why we have \nbeen awaiting these rules.\n  Given the Food and Drug Administration's recent approval of some very \npowerful drugs, I think it is even more important that we make sure \nwhen these drugs are out there that they are able to be disposed of.\n  Offering more ways for people to dispose of their unneeded \nprescription drugs is also a crucial component of stopping the recent \nrise we have seen in heroin. Now, that might seem counterintuitive. You \nmight say: Why would that help with heroin? That is not a prescription \ndrug. How could that reduce the amount of heroin out there when we know \nwe have seen huge increases in the amount of heroin. We have seen it in \nour State.\n  The heroin epidemic in Minnesota and all across the country is \ndeadly. In the first half of 2013, 91 people died of opiate-related \noverdoses in the Twin Cities--in Hennepin and Ramsey Counties--compared \nto 129 for all of 2012--just to give you a sense of 6 months compared \nto a year. Hospital emergency department visits for heroin nearly \ntripled from 2004 to 2011.\n  In the 7,000-person community of St. Francis, MN, three young people \nhave died of opiate overdoses since May. Another three young people \nhave been hospitalized for heroin overdoses. One was only 15 years old.\n  Experts blame this rise in heroin use to, first of all, some pure \nheroin coming from Mexico, but, secondly, an increased use of \nprescription drugs like OxyContin and Vicodin. That is because, \naccording to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as many as 4 \nout of 5 heroin users got their start by abusing prescription drugs. \nThat is a pretty phenomenal number.\n  I think people think of heroin like from the 1970s and people \nshooting up. Well, it is not like that anymore. They can take it by \npills. They can take it different ways. What happens is, when they \nstart with these prescription drugs, and they have access to them, they \nget hooked, they get addicted; and then, when they cannot get the \nprescription drugs--which does happen--then they turn to heroin, and \nheroin right now is much easier to obtain.\n  So the answer here--because those drugs are similar in how they make \nthem feel--the answer is to stop them from getting addicted in the \nfirst place. I think often times, when people just see a drug in the \nmedicine cabinet or know that it is OK to take one of these types of \ndrugs--OxyContin and other things for pain--they actually do not intend \nto get addicted. These are many of the people I just had a roundtable \nwith at Hazelden, one of the Nation's premier drug treatment centers, \ntalking about this. A lot of times the people who end up dying from a \nheroin overdose actually may even be casual heroin users. They are not \ndoing it every single day. But that is because the heroin was a \nreplacement for the prescription drugs they started getting addicted to \nwhen they got them out of a medicine cabinet or maybe they were \nprescribed them.\n  We know this is not going to fix everything. But certainly making it \neasier and empowering people to dispose of these drugs will, No. 1, \nclearly cut down on the use of these prescription drugs, and then, we \nbelieve, lead to less heroin use in the long term.\n  Americans all across the country--in cities, suburbs, and small \ntowns--need options to get rid of leftover pills before they fuel \naddictions and claim the lives of their loved ones.\n  The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act provides these options. \nBut we cannot take these crucial steps in the fight against drug abuse \nuntil the DEA issues its final rule.\n  After 4 years, it is time to make these rules official--4 years that \nfamilies and long-term facilities have lost out on safe and easy \noptions to get rid of unused prescription drugs; 4 years that those \nplastic amber bottles have piled up in medicine cabinets across \nAmerica; 4 years that dangerous pills have been left vulnerable to \nmisuse, potentially falling into the hands of our loved ones fighting \naddiction or criminals or being accidentally consumed by an innocent \nchild.\n  We need the final rules. We must get them done right. But with so \nmuch at stake, we must get them done now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, it is April Fools' Day, but it sure feels \nmore like ``Groundhog Day'' because we are once again here considering \nan extension of unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who \nhave been out of work for months, and some of them even for years.\n  While assistance to those without work serves an important purpose in \nhelping Americans transition, we are failing to address the underlying \nand more important issue: How do we grow the economy and create jobs \nfor all of our citizens?\n  A growing economy creates new opportunities for Americans to find \nmeaningful work, and with meaningful work comes an opportunity for \nAmericans to improve their economic security and advance up that \neconomic ladder.\n  It is one of the reasons Senator Wyden and I started the Economic \nMobility Caucus. We wanted to study the facts and explore policy \nimprovements that can make a difference to increase the likelihood that \nall Americans can do just that--improve their standard of living and \nmove up that economic ladder to a better life.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, their monthly report \nindicates that 10.5 million Americans are unemployed; 7.2 million \nAmericans are working part time because they cannot find full-time \nwork; 2.4 million Americans want to work but have stopped searching. \nWhat a sad circumstance that is for those folks.\n  Our labor participation rate is hovering around its 35-year low at 63 \npercent. While those statistics and the lives these numbers represent \nare pretty discouraging, I want to talk about a piece of good news. We \nknow we can create jobs and we can create a growing economy, and we \nknow from the facts, from the studies, that entrepreneurship, starting \na business, giving Americans a chance to pursue the American dream, is \nthe key.\n  The Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City has studied entrepreneurship. \nThey make clear that most new jobs come from young companies created by \nentrepreneurs. In fact, since 1980, nearly all of the net new jobs that \nhave been created in our country have been created by companies less \nthan 5 years old. It kind of makes sense. Big businesses often are \nlooking for ways to\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\ncut costs, reduce their workforce. New businesses wanting to succeed \nincrease their workforce. In fact, these new businesses create, on \naverage, 3 million jobs each year.\n  Unfortunately, the number of new business startups, those business \nformed each year, are around their lowest total since the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics began keeping track over 40 years ago. So while we \nknow that startup companies have a great opportunity to create jobs, we \nare creating the fewest number of startup businesses in nearly 40 \nyears.\n  A couple of authors, John Dearie and Courtney Geduldig--they are \nauthors of a book called ``Where the Jobs Are''--point out in that book \nthat ``the vital signs of America's job-creating entrepreneurial \neconomy are flashing red alert.'' John and Courtney spent an entire \nsummer traveling the United States. They met with more than 200 \nentrepreneurs in dozens of cities to learn about the challenges those \nentrepreneurs are facing.\n  What they found is no surprise to anybody in this Chamber. They are \nthe same issues I hear when I am back in Kansas. Those who start a \nbusiness struggle with access to money, to capital to start that \nbusiness; a lack of skilled talent; a complex Tax Code; a regulatory \nburden; and, boy, a lot of uncertainty, most of it, much of it, \nresulting from the action or lack of action here in Washington, DC.\n  A few years back I set out with a bipartisan group of Senators to \naddress the challenges entrepreneurs face. Together we developed \nlegislation that is now called Startup Act 3.0 to help create a better \nenvironment for those whose dream it is to start a new business. The \nSenate majority leader is frequently talking about allowing votes on \nlegislation that has bipartisan support. This bill, Startup 3.0, is \nsuch a bill.\n  I spent time working with Senator Warner and Senator Coons, Senator \nKing and Senator Klobuchar, as well as Senator Blunt and Senator Rubio. \nWe introduced what I would say is a very commonsense approach to \naddressing factors that influence an entrepreneur's chance of success: \ntaxes, regulations, access to capital, access to talent.\n  This legislation has been introduced as an amendment to the \nunemployment insurance extension bill the Senate is now considering. \nUnfortunately, at least so far, we have been denied having a vote on \nwhat is clearly a job-creating measure. I have offered this as an \namendment to other bills on the Senate floor, but if the past is any \nexample of what will happen on this bill, the chances of us being able \nto offer the amendment, have it considered and voted on, do not look \nvery probable.\n  Startup 3.0 makes changes to the Tax Code to encourage investment in \nstartups and provides more capital for those who are ready to grow and \nhire. To address burdensome government regulations, this legislation, \nnow this amendment, requires Federal agencies to determine whether the \ncost of new regulations outweighs the benefits, and it encourages \nFederal agencies to give special consideration of the impact proposed \nregulations would have on a startup business.\n  As any entrepreneur knows, a good idea is essential to starting a \nsuccessful business. So Startup 3.0, an amendment now to this bill, \nimproves the process by which information that is funded by Federal \nresearch, information that is garnered by Federal research, is more \nreadily available to those who want to start a business, so that tax-\nfunded innovations can be turned into companies that spur economic \ngrowth.\n  Finally, Startup 3.0 provides new opportunities for highly educated \nentrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States where their \ntalent and new ideas can fuel economic growth and create jobs in \nAmerica.\n  For more than 2 years, Startup Act 3.0 has earned praise from \nbusiness owners, from chambers of commerce, from economic development \nofficials, from entrepreneurs, from economists, and elected officials. \nRecently, the California State Senate passed a resolution calling on \nCongress to pass Startup Act 3.0. The President's Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness, when it was in existence, had voiced strong support \nfor several of the bill's provisions.\n  Unfortunately, none of that support from across the country has \nprogressed in the Halls of Congress to see this legislation seriously \nconsidered. I can tell you that the reason Congress has not been able \nto address our economic challenges is not for lack of good ideas. In my \nview, it is a lack of leadership in the Senate and within the \nadministration, within Washington, DC, to address the challenges \nAmericans face.\n  There are plenty of good ideas that can provide immediate relief to \nAmericans, many ideas in addition to Startup 3.0. Some of those \nexamples are a 40-hour workweek. The House is poised to pass \nlegislation. Some of my colleagues are proposing amendments here in the \nSenate to change full-time employment from 30 hours, as outlined in the \nAffordable Care Act, back to 40 hours.\n  Small businesses, restaurants, school districts, and community \ncolleges across Kansas and around the country are already cutting hours \nto comply with the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act. By \nfixing this provision, we can make certain that hard-working Americans \nhave the opportunity to work more hours, earn a bigger paycheck, or \nfind full-time employment.\n  Many of us believe--in fact, a large majority of the Senate in a \nbipartisan way believes--that approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline will \nhelp us in two ways: reduce energy costs in the United States, a very \nimportant factor in new jobs and expanding the economy, as well as \nincreasing employment during the construction of that pipeline.\n  A recent poll by Washington Post and ABC News shows that Americans \nsupport this 3 to 1. Again 80-some Senators voted in moving forward \nwith the Keystone Pipeline. Yet it has not happened. The President has \nnot made a decision in regard to Keystone Pipeline, has stalled this \nissue. Nothing in the Senate would suggest the leadership of the Senate \nis ready to move this ball forward.\n\n  The President talks about trade promotion authority, spoke about it \nin one of his State of the Union Addresses. Yet that is another issue \nthat has not been considered by the Senate. The President apparently \nhas backed off of this issue out of deference to politics. Yet we \nknow--we certainly know this in Kansas--that the airplanes we make in \nsouth central Kansas, the wheat we grow in western Kansas, the cattle \nwe grow in our State, that we raise in our State, clearly much of the \neconomic activity that comes from those activities occurs because we \nare able to sell those agricultural commodities, those manufactured \ngoods around the globe.\n  Millions of Americans can be better off if there is greater \nopportunity for what we manufacture, the agricultural products we grow, \nif they have a wider market. The President and this Congress, \nparticularly the Senate--not this Congress, the Democratic majority \nhere--have focused much of their attention on, for example, the bill we \nare on, extending the unemployment insurance timeframe, apparently in \nthe near future increasing minimum wage.\n  Consider these facts. There are 3.6 million Americans at or below the \nminimum wage level. Minimum wage workers make up 2.5 percent of all \nworkers, and 55 percent are 25 years old or younger. So it is a \nrelatively small portion of the workforce and a young portion of the \nworkforce. I am certainly willing, happy to have a debate about the \nneed to increase the minimum wage, to extend unemployment benefits, in \npart because I want the Senate to operate.\n  One of my greatest complaints since my arrival in the Senate is the \nSenate no longer functions as it has historically, in which issues of \nimportance to the country, whether they are Republican issues, \nDemocratic issues, American issues, middle of the road--this place \ntakes up those issues very rarely. I am willing to have a debate about \nwhat is proposed here.\n  But what I am thinking we are doing is we are missing the real issues \nif we only deal with those. The minimum wage and extension of \nunemployment benefits is a symptom of a larger problem. It is that \nAmericans want and need jobs. In my view, this Senate and this \nPresident have done nothing to increase the chances that Americans have \na better shot at finding a better job.\n  We have to grow the economy. By growing the economy--I think that\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nsounds like something that is far removed from the everyday lives of \nAmericans. But growing the economy simply means we are creating greater \nopportunities for American men and women, for husbands and wives, for \nsons and daughters, for families to have the opportunity to pursue a \ncareer they feel comfortable in, that is satisfactory to their economic \nneeds, and gives them the hope they can improve their lives \nfinancially.\n  So growing the economy is about creating a greater opportunity for \nevery American to pursue what we all have grown up calling the American \ndream. Unfortunately, the facts, if you believe the Congressional \nBudget Office, indicate that raising the minimum wage will increase \nunemployment. In fact, the numbers I saw--this was not the CBO score, \nbut a Texas university study indicated that raising the minimum wage to \n$10 an hour or more would reduce jobs in my home State by 27,300 jobs.\n  I doubt that voters care much about CBO reports or about a Texas \nuniversity study, but they are acutely aware--they see it every day in \ntheir own lives--of the lack of opportunity, the dearth of jobs, the \nreduction in hours, the reduction in opportunity. These reports make \nclear they are happening because of failed policies and the refusal of \nthe Senate and the President to address the broader issue of what can \nwe do to create jobs for Americans.\n  I thought the message of the 2010 election, the election where I was \nbrought to the Senate on behalf of Kansans--I thought the message that \nwe all would have, should have received, the message of the election, \nwas the desire for every American to have the chance to improve their \nlives through a job, through a better job, and through a secure job. In \nmy view, it is time for us to focus on growing the opportunities for \nall workers everywhere.\n  With a willing Congress, including leaders who understand these \nchallenges and are willing to address them, I am certain we can create \ngreater opportunities for millions of Americans, including those who no \nlonger or who currently have no meaningful work. The lack of a job is \nterrible. I think there is a certain moral component, a sense of well-\nbeing, a sense of who we are as human beings when we have a job that \nnot only fulfills us financially but gives us a sense of purpose in our \ndaily lives.\n  As the Senate considers a short-term extension of unemployment \ninsurance, we must not lose sight of that longer term goal of creating \nan environment for job creation. Again, I would offer Startup Act 3.0, \na bipartisan amendment, a bipartisan piece of legislation offered as an \namendment, as an opportunity to do that, as part of the consideration \nof the extension of unemployment benefits. There is no better way to \ncreate jobs than to support entrepreneurs and to foster the development \nof new businesses.\n  Small business is, as we always say, the backbone of American jobs. \nSo let's stop having this ``groundhog day'' moment every few months and \nlet's start tackling the challenges that entrepreneurs across the \ncountry are telling us about, that Americans are telling us about, that \nwe learned in the 2010 election mean so much to every American.\n  Unfortunately, this President and this Senate have done nothing to \nimprove the chances that every American has a better job and a brighter \nfuture. Please, this is so important. There is so much we can do. Too \nmany times we focus on what we are unable to agree upon. But there is \nso much we can agree upon, so many things we can do. The American dream \ndepends upon us doing so and doing so now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am on the floor for the 63rd \nconsecutive week we have been in session to ask my colleagues to \nfinally wake up to the threat of climate change. The evidence mounts of \nunprecedented and dangerous changes, from the latest Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change report to the recent warning from the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science.\n  The American people demand action in ever-greater numbers. Yet \nCongress continues to sleepwalk, lulled by special interest influence \nand polluter propaganda. The influence and propaganda are spread \nthrough an apparatus of denial. This apparatus is big and artfully \nconstructed--phony-baloney organizations designed to look and sound as \nif they are real, messages honed by public relations experts to sound \nas if they are truthful, payroll scientists whom polluters can trot out \nwhen they need them. The whole thing is big and complicated enough that \nwhen we see its parts, we could be fooled into thinking it is not all \nconnected. But it is just like the mythological Hydra: many heads, same \nbeast. And this denial beast pollutes our democracy just as surely as \nits sponsors pollute our atmosphere and oceans. Some editorial pages \nspread the polluter party line so consistently that it appears they \nhave gone over and actually joined the apparatus.\n  The climate denial network controls the political arm of the \nmultinational corporations, the so-called U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Polluter-funded super PACs target officials who don't fall in line--\ninterestingly, often Republicans, in an effort to purify the party in a \ncoal-fired crucible.\n  The whole deniers' castle can look pretty daunting, but it is based \non rejecting science and ignoring empirical evidence. That is a weak \nfoundation. It won't stand. The castle is built on sand and its fall is \ninevitable. Remember from Apocrypha: ``But above all things Truth \nbeareth away the victory.'' And it will.\n  There are cracks in the foundation already. Some leading news sources \nhave begun to put climate denial into their policy against printing \nmisinformation and discredited theories. They just won't print that \nnonsense. Many executives recognize the significance of climate change \nand are distancing their companies from the policies and politics of \nclimate denial. They don't want any part of that nonsense. Many local \nofficials are doing all they can to protect their communities from the \neffects of climate change. They know climate denial is nonsense.\n  It has been wrong that the climate change denial campaign has been so \nignored by major media outlets. Media Matters found that all the major \nnetwork Sunday TV talk shows in all of 2013 discussed climate change \nfor a grand total, all combined, of 27 minutes. NBC News's ``Meet the \nPress'' mentioned climate change once. When several of the Sunday shows \ndiscussed climate change on February 16 of this year for a grand total \nof 46 minutes combined, it was more climate coverage than in the past 3 \nyears.\n  It has been wrong that polluters so often got their way on the \neditorial page. Whether through a desire to appear fair and balanced or \na willful effort to help polluters, newspapers still publish editorials \nor letters to the editor that dispute consensus science, disparage \nscientists or journalists who report the truth about climate change, \nand exaggerate the costs of taking action to stop it. Often, their \nauthors have direct ties to coal and oil interests, and rarely is the \nconnection disclosed.\n  As we can see from this chart, some papers do it more than others. \nThe denier champ is the Wall Street Journal editorial page, with eight \ndenier letters in the first 10 months of 2013. That is one every 5 \nweeks. I think they have actually joined the denier apparatus and are \nnow a part of the scheme, but they are on the wrong side of history.\n  On the right side is the Los Angeles Times, whose editorial page last \nyear released a note from editor Paul Thornton announcing they would no \nlonger print climate denial letters.\n  Thornton's note read:\n\n       I do my best to keep errors of fact off the letters page; \n     when one does run, a correction is published. Saying \n     ``there's no sign humans have caused climate change'' is not \n     stating an opinion; it's asserting a factual inaccuracy.\n\n  Reddit is one of the Internet's most popular social and news Web \nsites, ``the front page of the Internet.'' According to the Pew \nResearch Center, 1 in every 17 American adults uses Reddit. Reddit \nscience has 4 million subscribers. That is about twice the circulation \nof the New York Times. Reddit Science has banned posts on climate \ndenial because, as its moderator, Dr. Nathan Allen, explained, ``We \nrequire submissions to [Reddit Science] to be related\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nto recent publications in reputable peer-reviewed journals, which \neffectively excludes any climate denial.''\n  The L.A. Times and Reddit Science are not alone in seeing that the \nclimate denier castle is built on lies. More and more American \ncorporations are responding to the facts, understanding that they are \nultimately responsible to their shareholders and customers. Major \nutilities--for example, PG, the Public Service Company of New Mexico, \nand Exelon--all quit the U.S. Chamber of Commerce after a chamber \nofficial called for putting climate science on trial like the Scopes \nMonkey Trial of 1925. The chamber may have been infiltrated and \ncaptured by the polluters, but major corporations get it: Coke and \nPepsi, UPS and FedEx, GM and Ford, Google and Apple, Walmart--we can go \non and on. The denier castle is crumbling.\n\n  Many of the businesses getting serious about reducing carbon \npollution are actually based in States that are represented in Congress \nby Members who won't take the problem seriously at all. Coca-Cola, \nheadquartered in Georgia, says:\n\n       We recognize climate change is a critical challenge facing \n     our planet, with potential impacts on biodiversity, water \n     resources, public health and agriculture. . . . Beyond the \n     effects on the communities we serve, we view climate change \n     as a potential business risk, understanding that it could \n     likely have direct and indirect effects on our business.\n\n  Texas- and Maryland-based Lockheed Martin states:\n\n       From 2007 through 2011, Lockheed Martin reduced its \n     absolute carbon emissions by 30 percent, and continues to \n     focus on carbon emission reductions by championing energy \n     conservation and efficiency measures in our facilities.\n\n  Sprint, the mobile carrier headquartered in Kansas, gets it.\n\n       We understand that climate change is a critical issue and \n     that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is an important goal. \n     Because Sprint is a large corporation with thousands of \n     locations, millions of customers and billions of dollars in \n     operating costs, we have many opportunities to reduce global \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  The denier castle is crumbling at the local level too. Scores of \nlocally elected officials are fighting to slow climate change and \nprotect their residents, even if in Congress their Congressman won't \nlisten. One of those local leaders is Mayor Frank Cownie of Des Moines, \nwhom I met on my recent trip to Iowa. Iowans are taking climate change \nseriously, and Mayor Cownie is one of over 1,000 mayors represented on \nthis map all across the country who have signed the U.S. Conference of \nMayors Climate Protection Agreement. Their pledge is to meet or beat \nthe Kyoto Protocol emission reduction targets in their own cities and \npress their State governments and the Federal Government to enact \nmeaningful greenhouse gas reduction policies.\n  Seventy-eight current and former mayors from Florida have signed on. \nWith over 1,000 miles of coastline, Florida is at serious risk from \nsea-level rise. According to the World Resources Institute, of all the \npeople and all the housing in America threatened by sea-level rise, 40 \npercent is in Florida.\n  Thirty-one former and current mayors from Texas have also signed on \nto the climate agreement. Texans are waking up to the threat of climate \nchange. A recent poll showed that roughly 55 percent of Texans say the \nUnited States should reduce greenhouse gas emissions regardless of \nwhether other countries do the same.\n  Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, our former Republican colleague from \nthis Chamber, understands the benefits of cleaner energy. He fought to \nkeep in Kansas his State's renewable portfolio standard, which \nencourages utilities to ramp up generation of renewable electricity. \nThe standard has already helped create thousands of Kansas jobs.\n  Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, a coal-producing State, has taken \na commonsense stance on climate change that defends the well-being of \nhis State. He said:\n\n       [W]e have to acknowledge our commitment to address \n     greenhouse gas emissions, while stressing the need for a \n     rational, flexible regulatory approach.\n\n  I have to say I agree with him. I stand ready and many of us stand \nready on this side to work with coal-State colleagues to ease their \ntransition away from a polluting fossil fuel economy.\n  When we think of what the costs are going to be to all of us of \nfailing to address this problem, the cost of easing the transition for \nthose who will suffer from it is easily worth undertaking. But to do \nany of that, we first have to break through the barricade of lies built \naround Congress in Washington. We can't keep pretending this isn't \nreal. That is why once a week for over 60 weeks I have come to the \nfloor to press this point. It is real. It is happening. It is not going \nto go away if we ignore it.\n  There is one thing and one thing only that prevents our action, and \nthat one thing is the politics of the Republican Party. There is one \nthing and one thing only that makes this the politics of the Republican \nParty, and that one thing is the special influence of the polluters. \nBut against the relentless facts and science, against Mother Nature's \nrelentless truth, that castle is built on sand and will fall. But above \nall things, truth beareth away victory.\n  For the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our future, for the \nsake of our honor, it is time for us to wake up.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we are in the midst of a debate about \nextending unemployment insurance for millions of Americans who are \nunemployed, some of whom have been out of work for some time. It is a \nproblem for the country.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of Americans \nwho want to work but who have stopped looking for a job is 3.1 million. \nOver 91 million Americans are outside the labor force entirely. \nAccording to a recent report in CNN Money:\n\n       Only about 63 percent of Americans over the age of 16 \n     participate in the job market, meaning they either have a job \n     or are just looking for one. That is nearly the lowest level \n     since 1978, driven partly by baby boomers retiring but also \n     by workers who had simply given up hope after long and \n     fruitless job searches.\n\n  As a matter of fact, we saw at our budget hearing this morning a \nchart which showed the decline in workers by age group, and it was \ninteresting. The younger workers had the biggest decline in percentage \nworking, and the older, 62 and above, are working at a greater rate \nthan they were in previous years. So that is an interesting statistic. \nBut we do have a problem, particularly among a lot of our younger \npeople finding work.\n  At the same time we are having these difficulties, this \nadministration has engaged in a systematic dismantling of the \nprotections our immigration laws provide for American workers, \nproducing for them--our workers--lower wages and higher unemployment. \nThat is just a fact. Why are wages down? And wages are down, as we \nheard from all witnesses, Republican and Democratic, in the Budget \nCommittee this morning. Wages have declined significantly in the last 5 \nyears. They have been declining, just at a lesser rate, since 1999.\n  In fact, our review of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \npublished statistics for 2013 reveals that under the guise of setting \npriorities for enforcement of our laws, this administration has \ndetermined that almost anyone in the world who can enter the United \nStates then becomes free to illegally live, work, and claim benefits \nhere as long as they are not caught committing some felony or serious \ncrime.\n  Based on what the President has said, and what the Vice President has \nsaid, it would appear an individual could come to America on a work \nvisa, and 1 day after the visa has expired just continue to stay in \nAmerica and be able to work and could be confident that they will not \nbe deported because the policy of this government is not to deport \npeople unless they catch them at the border entering illegally or they \nhave committed a serious crime.\n  A recent report this week shows that even the serious crime issue is \ncloudy. An independent report earlier this week said one-third of \nthose--68,000--who had been involved in criminal activity in some way \nare not being deported. So this applies not only to\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nthose who unlawfully enter our borders but also those who enter on a \nlegal visa and don't leave when that visa expires.\n  The President and Members of Congress are arguing, it appears, based \non the bill that cleared the Senate, for a historic surge in the amount \nof legal immigration into our country at a time of high unemployment. \nThe White House has preposterously claimed, amazingly, that an influx \nof new, mostly lower skilled workers will raise wages. This is a \nconclusion not supported by any credible academic evidence or even the \nCongressional Budget Office's own report analyzing the massive Senate \nimmigration bill. The CBO concluded the bill would add 46 million \nmostly lesser skilled legal immigrants by 2033 and that average wages \nwould fall for one dozen years if it were to become law and \nunemployment would increase and per capita GDP--growth in America--\nwould decline, I think for 20 years.\n  And, apparently the House of Representatives is considering proposals \nto bring in hundreds of thousands of guest workers at a time when we \nare talking about extending unemployment for Americans who can't get \njobs.\n  Dr. George Borjas at Harvard has found that high immigration levels \nfrom 1980 to 2000 resulted in an 8-percent drop in wages for American \nworkers without a high school degree. Let me repeat that. This is \nProfessor Borjas at Harvard, raised in Cuba and immigrated to America. \nHe is perhaps the most authoritative academic in the world on \nimmigration and its effect on wages and the labor force. He found that \nhigh immigration levels from 1980 to 2000--and he studied that \ncarefully, using census and other data--resulted in an 8-percent drop \nin wages for American workers without a high school degree. Eight \npercent is a lot. It is several hundred dollars a month for a person \nwho didn't graduate from high school. Actually, it is about $250 a \nmonth. So there is a reason workers who are earning $30,000 and less \nsupport a reduction in net immigration levels by a 3-to-1 margin. \nWorking people know what is happening out there. They know their wages \nare going down. They know particularly lower skilled people, some young \npeople who didn't get to graduate from high school or who got in \ntrouble, are not having much success at all.\n  Average household income has fallen steadily since 1999, and only 59 \npercent of U.S. adults are now working. African-American youth looking \nfor work cannot find jobs. We don't have a shortage of workers in this \ncountry--we do not have a shortage of workers in this country. We have \na shortage of jobs. That is a fact.\n  Some might ask: How can you be so sure of that, Senator? I believe in \nthe free market, and I tell the chamber of commerce and the big hotel \nmagnates, if we have a shortage of workers, why aren't wages going up? \nWages are going down. We don't have a tight labor market. We have a \nloose labor market, and it is impacting adversely American workers.\n  The idea that we ought to double the number of guest workers who come \ninto the country legally when the President of the United States is not \ngoing to enforce immigration laws and we will not use comprehensively \nthe E-Verify system indicates we are going to see a decline in wages \nfor average Americans out looking for jobs.\n\n  The President's own economic adviser, Gene Sperling, former Director \nof the National Economic Council, recognized this, saying recently that \n``our economy still has three people looking for every job,'' three \npeople for every job. Majority Leader Reid has cited that statistic on \nthe Senate floor as well.\n  So this Senate passes a comprehensive immigration bill that doubles \nthe number of guest workers. Don't think these are workers who are \ngoing to work seasonal jobs in agriculture. They will be able to move \nthroughout this country and take jobs from wherever, providing \nbusinesses with a ready source, a new source of additional labor that \nhelps keep the labor market loose.\n  My amendment, the Accountability through Electronic Verification Act, \nis a proven way to help out-of-work Americans. This legislation was \nintroduced in this Congress by Senator Grassley and cosponsored by \nmyself and Senators Boozman, Corker, Enzi, Fischer, Hatch, Johanns, \nLee, Vitter, and Wicker. So we have offered legislation to deal with \nthis, and I have offered it as an amendment to this unemployment \ninsurance legislation, but I have been told it will be blocked. We will \nnot get a vote. The leader has filled the tree.\n  What this proposal would do is it would create some jobs for \nAmericans who are out of work. It absolutely would. It would work, and \nit would immediately help create jobs. That is why the establishment \ndoesn't want to see it happen, if you want to know the truth.\n  The legislation would permanently authorize and expand the E-Verify \nProgram. That is a simple Web-based tool that allows employers to \nmaintain a legal workforce by verifying the work eligibility of \nemployees. E-Verify works by checking data against records maintained \nby the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security \nAdministration. It is quick and easy. An employer simply puts in a \nSocial Security number, it runs against the Social Security database, \nand an employer receives an answer as to whether this person is a \nlawful applicant for a job.\n  Although in 1986 Congress made it unlawful--in 1986--for an employer \nto knowingly hire or employ illegal aliens, these laws have never been \neffectively enforced. They just have not. They have gotten comfortable \nwith this, not having it enforced. Under current law, if the documents \nprovided by an applicant for a job to an employer reasonably appeared \nto be genuine, then the employer has met its obligation.\n  Incidentally, shortly after the 1986 amnesty law was passed, when it \nwas promised amnesty would not be granted again, the now-assistant to \nPresident Obama and the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, \nCecilia Munoz, who was then a senior policy analyst of La Raza, led the \ncharge to undo these enforcement provisions. So the person chosen by \nPresident Obama to be the Director of the Domestic Policy Council and \nwho has been given the responsibility to deal with immigration, use to \nwork for La Raza where she sought to undo enforcement.\n  Ms. Munoz authored a report for La Raza entitled ``Unfinished \nBusiness: The Immigration Reform & Control Act of 1986.'' In that \nreport she argued that Congress had a moral obligation to ``repeal \nemployer sanctions'' and that workplace enforcement is ``inherently \ndiscriminatory.''\n  Now think about that. The person the President has chosen, who is \nsupposed to be helping us create a lawful system of immigration in the \nUnited States, has as her prior effort written a paper that says \nbasically it is a moral requirement of America to repeal any employer \nsanctions. This is the mentality running our government today; that it \nis morally wrong to say to employers they should only hire people \nlawfully in our country. She went on to say that any kind of workplace \nenforcement--apparently in which our employers would be disciplined or \npunished if they violate the law--is inherently discriminatory.\n  Because identity theft and counterfeit documents became a thriving \nindustry after the 1986 amnesty, Congress created an E-Verify program \nin 1996.\n  In 1996, after realizing this was turning into a joke--nobody was \nfollowing the intent of Congress and anybody could produce false \ndocuments--Congress passed a law which said we would end this game and \ncreate a system that would work. Employers required to use E-Verify \ntoday include the Federal government, certain Federal contractors and \nemployers of certain immigrant students. The program for other \nemployers is voluntary and free for them to use, and it has been very \nsuccessful throughout the country by any who use it.\n  According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in fiscal \nyear 2012, 98 percent of queries resulted in a confirmation of work \neligibility immediately or within 24 hours. So most of them \noverwhelmingly immediately access the computer system, put in a Social \nSecurity number and other data they require, hit the computer button, \nand it quickly comes back. On a few occasions there is a question and \nit may take up to 24 hours.\n  It is not slowing down employment, it is not a big burden on \nemployers, and it protects them from being accused of deliberately \nhiring illegal\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\naliens if the report comes back that the Social Security number \nmatches. According to a January 2013 USCIS customer satisfaction \nsurvey, E-Verify received an 86 out of 100 in the American customer \nsatisfaction index scale--19 points higher than the customer \nsatisfaction rating for the overall Federal Government.\n  There is no objection to this. The only objection to it is by certain \nbusiness lobbyist groups and certain activist immigration groups who \ndon't want it to work, and they want to keep other businesses from \nusing it because it does in fact identify people in the country who are \nnot allowed to take jobs and it would keep them from receiving these \njobs.\n  This legislation would make the program mandatory for all employers \nwithin 1 year of enactment of the law. This legislation would also \nincrease penalties for employers who do not use the system when it is \nmandated or continue to illegally hire undocumented workers.\n  Employers would be required to check the status of current \nemployees--but within 3 years--and would be permitted to run a check \nprior to offering someone a job. In other words, they can run a check \nbefore they actually offered a job and determine whether the person was \nlawfully able to take the job. This could help them a lot.\n  Employers would also be required to recheck those workers whose \nauthorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the United \nStates on temporary work visas.\n  This legislation would require employers to terminate the employment \nof those found unauthorized to work due to a check through E-Verify, \nand would reduce employers' potential liability for wrongful \nterminations if they participated in E-Verify.\n  The legislation would establish a demonstration project in a rural \narea or an area without substantial Internet capabilities--although \nthere are not many left--to assist small businesses in complying.\n  The legislation also addresses identify theft concerns by ensuring \nthat the Social Security Administration catches multiple uses of Social \nSecurity numbers--different people using the same social number to get \njobs with a fake document and a false Social Security number.\n  And for victims of identity theft, this legislation would amend the \nFederal criminal code to clarify that identity fraud is punishable \nregardless of whether the defendant had knowledge of the victim. So \nthis provision addresses a 2009 Supreme Court decision holding that \nidentity theft requires proof that the individual knew the number being \nused belonged to an actual person.\n  E-Verify has been proven to deter employers from hiring illegal \nworkers and will help put Americans back on the payrolls.\n  Since I have seen legislation move through Congress--comprehensive \nreform legislation that is going to fix our immigration policies--one \nof the things I have observed is that whatever works is what gets \nobjected to. If someone offers a bill which appears to work but doesn't \nwork, that will pass. E-Verify has been proven and will work to deter \nemployers from hiring illegal workers, and will help put Americans back \nto work. That is why we apparently don't have any ability to get it up \nfor a vote. A number of States have enacted E-Verify laws, and it is \nworking in those States with great results.\n  According to a 2013 Bloomberg government study entitled ``Early \nEvidence Suggests E-Verify Laws Deter Hiring of Unauthorized Workers'':\n\n       Soon after E-Verify laws were signed in Arizona, \n     Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, unauthorized \n     workers in specific industries appeared to drop off employer \n     payrolls. This prompted employers in many cases to fill \n     positions with authorized workers, American workers who are \n     here lawfully, maybe a young 22-year-old African American who \n     needs a job, would like to get married, maybe raise a family.\n\n  With respect to my State of Alabama, the Bloomberg study says:\n\n       Employment trended lower immediately after the law was \n     enacted. Employers then added more crop production workers in \n     the months before [the law] took effect, when compared with \n     the same period the year before. That growth in production \n     jobs was among the largest in the nation. This study \n     hypothesizes that authorized hires probably filled the jobs \n     of unauthorized workers who had left the state.\n\n  Isn't that what we would like to see? Wouldn't we ask people to come \nto the country lawfully? We admit 1 million people a year for permanent \nresidence on a guaranteed path to citizenship absent serious criminal \nactivity. We are generous about immigration. Make no mistake about it. \nBut we do need to make sure that people who don't follow the law, don't \nwait their turn, don't meet the requirements of American immigration \nlaw--they shouldn't be able to come unlawfully and take jobs when \nAmericans are out of work in record numbers.\n  Regarding South Carolina's law, the study found this:\n\n       The number of crop production workers fell. . . . And then \n     hiring surged as the law took effect in 2012. Farmers say \n     they added workers because their normal labor supply \n     vanished.\n\n  The study also found that:\n\n       [t]he state's commercial bakery industry had been losing \n     workers, then gained them as E-Verify took effect.\n\n  So people who were unlawfully there couldn't get past E-Verify. It \nexposed them as being unlawful, and the businesses lost workers. But \nthen they hired people back, and the people they hired back were lawful \nworkers--either here as immigrants lawfully or native born.\n  The study, which is based on research from the Pew Hispanic Center, \ngoes on to say this:\n\n       [t]he abrupt shifts in employment across multiple \n     industries convey a similar narrative: soon after E-Verify \n     laws are adopted, workers drop off employer payrolls and, in \n     a number of industries, new hires fill those vacant \n     positions. The robustness of this effect reinforces the \n     likelihood that this phenomenon is due to something other \n     than chance.\n\n  Our goal must be to help struggling Americans move from dependency to \nindependence, to help them find steady jobs with rising pay, not \nfalling pay. Making E-Verify permanent and requiring all employers to \nuse it is one simple thing we can do to work towards that goal.\n  Let me just say, the E-Verify system is already established. The \nsystem is in place. It can accommodate the increase in inquiries. It is \nall a computer system. It is all done virtually instantly. It is not as \nif we have to create a new system or add tens of thousands of people to \nmake it work. The system is already working and it can handle larger \nnumbers.\n  Our policy cannot be to simply relegate more and more of our citizens \nto dependence on the government for assistance while importing a steady \nstream of foreign workers to fill available jobs. That is not in the \ninterest of this country or our people.\n  I would just like to add that Senators Grassley, Lee, Vitter, Enzi, \nBoozman, and Hatch are cosponsors of this amendment. We know what is \nbeing said out there. We are being told that Americans won't work, they \nare not looking for jobs, and that businesses can't hire. The Bloomberg \nstudy on how the E-Verify system has been implemented indicates quite \ndifferent.\n  According to a report on Syracuse.com on January 8, 2014:\n\n       In Syracuse [New York], thousands showed up for the Destiny \n     USA job fair on June 14, 2012. More than 50 employers \n     interviewed candidates for roughly 1,600 jobs.\n\n  On January 29, 2013, a Fox affiliate in Atlanta reported:\n\n       Northside Hospital held a job fair Wednesday, but had to \n     call it off early due to the overwhelming number of people \n     that showed up looking for work. The hospital was hoping to \n     fill 500 jobs.\n\n  On May 17, 2013, news outlets in Philadelphia reported:\n\n       More than 3,700 job seekers overwhelmed the Municipal \n     Services Building in Center City for a job fair Friday \n     morning intended for ex-offenders. . . . The city anticipated \n     a big crowd and therefore doubled the staff to handle the \n     responses, but the crowd was still too big to handle, forcing \n     the event to be cancelled and leaving hundreds on the plaza \n     outside.\n\n  We need to help ex-offenders find jobs. I am aware of a major \ncorporation in Alabama, in talking to a Federal judge recently, which \nsaid they will start taking a chance on former offenders. Properly \nexamined and picking the right ones, they found out they are doing \nfine. We shouldn't be denying young people--particularly young men--who \nmay have gotten in trouble at a younger age ever being able to have a \njob. One of the goals this country has to have is to help our ex-\noffenders in employment.\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\n  On May 20, 2013, the New York Times reported in an article entitled, \n``Camping out for five days, in hopes of a union job,'' the following:\n\n       The men began arriving last Wednesday, first a trickle, \n     then dozens. By Friday there were hundreds of them, along \n     with a few women. They set up their tents and mattresses on \n     the sidewalk in Long Island City, Queens . . . and settled in \n     to wait as long as five days and nights for a slender chance \n     at a union job as an elevator mechanic. . . . There were more \n     than 800 by sun-up Monday. . . . The union accepts 750 \n     applications for the 150 to 200 spots in its four-year \n     apprenticeship program.\n\n  There are more examples, and I could go on. But I do believe this \nidea that Americans won't work is not correct. If we take a person who \nhas been unemployed for a while and place them in a position where the \nlabor is physical, it takes a while to get in shape. If you are going \nto play ball, it takes a while to get in physical condition. People \ngoing into the Army are not expected to meet the physical fitness test \nthe first week. They build up to it.\n  Businesses have to participate in this effort, too. Businesses need \nto understand they are not entitled and cannot expect--for the \ngovernment of the United States to produce perfectly fit, well-trained \npeople for every single job they would like to fill. Sometimes they \nhave to hire people, train them on the job, let them work into it and \nlearn the skills on the job. It is some new idea, apparently, that \nbusinesses have to have so much training. We certainly need to use the \njob-training programs in this country to more effectively train workers \nfor real jobs out there. It is a valid criticism of our trade schools \nand some of our community colleges that they are not focusing on \nreality. But my State has done a great job--a far better job than in \nmost States--and I saw a report recently about how Mississippi is doing \nan excellent job. I believe our program is at least as effective, if \nnot better. So we are doing better. But businesses have always had to \nbring people into their workplaces and train them to handle the \nphysical challenges that some jobs require.\n\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair for an opportunity to share these \nremarks. I am disappointed that when we are talking about unemployment \nin America, we have a Congress and a Senate refusing to even allow this \namendment to come up for a vote. Without a doubt it would work, be \nfair, and would simply make it more difficult for people who are not \nhere lawfully, who shouldn't be able to get jobs in America--would make \nit more difficult for them to get that job, freeing that position up \nfor unemployed Americans who need to get in the workforce and off the \nwelfare rolls. That is the goal.\n  We have a huge number of welfare programs. We spend $750 billion a \nyear on means-tested programs to help people who are lower income, and \nthat is 50 percent more than the defense budget, more than Social \nSecurity, and more than Medicare. Those programs are not working well. \nThey need to come together in a coherent whole with a unified vision. \nThe vision should be to help people who are in stressful circumstances; \nhelp them aggressively, in a practical, realistic way; put them in a \njob-training program that would allow them to take a job. We could \neasily do that with the money we are spending now. We would have more \nAmericans working and off the welfare rolls. We would save billions of \ndollars at the same time. They would make more money, be more \nfulfilled, have more self-respect, and reduce the budget deficit at the \nsame time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. President, last week, I called on members of the \nSenate to come together and support reauthorization of the Justice for \nAll Act, a bipartisan law that increased resources devoted to DNA and \nother forensic technology, established safeguards to prevent wrongful \nconvictions, and enhanced protections for crime victims. The bipartisan \nbill to reauthorize this historic law was reported unanimously by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last fall. Every Senate Democrat has cleared \nthe way for passage of this important measure, and I hope Senate \nRepublicans will soon follow suit so that we can take one step closer \nto reauthorizing this law that protects and supports victims of crime.\n  The programs created by the Justice for All Act have had an enormous \nimpact, and it is crucial that we reauthorize them. The legislation \nstrengthens important rights for crime victims, reauthorizes the Debbie \nSmith DNA Backlog Grant Program, seeks to improve the quality of \nindigent defense, and increases access to post-conviction DNA testing \nto help protect the innocent.\n  The reauthorization legislation also strengthens the Kirk Bloodsworth \nPost Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program. Kirk Bloodsworth was the \nfirst person in the United States to be exonerated from a death row \ncrime through the use of DNA evidence. The program named for Mr. \nBloodsworth provides grants to States for testing in those criminal \ncases like Mr. Bloodsworth's where someone has been convicted but where \nsignificant DNA evidence was not tested. The Justice for All \nReauthorization Act of 2013 expands State access to post-conviction DNA \ntesting funds by restricting the evidence preservation conditions set \nfor this program to felony cases, which is a more attainable goal for \nStates.\n  This legislation also takes important steps to ensure that all \ncriminal defendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, \nreceive effective representation. It requires the Department of Justice \nto assist States in developing an effective and efficient system of \nindigent defense. I know as a former prosecutor that the system only \nworks as it should when each side is well represented by competent and \nwell-trained counsel.\n  The bill also asks States to produce comprehensive plans for their \ncriminal justice systems, which will help to ensure that criminal \njustice systems operate effectively as a whole and that all parts of \nthe system work together and receive the resources they need.\n  The bill reauthorizes and improves key grant programs in a variety of \nareas throughout the criminal justice system. Importantly, it increases \nauthorized funding for the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement \nGrant program, which is a vital program to assist forensic laboratories \nin performing the many forensic tests that are essential to solving \ncrimes and prosecuting perpetrators.\n  We need to continue the bipartisan work that has been done. During \nthe Judiciary Committee mark-up we unanimously adopted amendments \nbefore passing the bill, one from Senator Dianne Feinstein, and one \nfrom Senator Jeff Flake. Both amendments strengthened rights for crime \nvictims, and added to the comprehensive improvements contained in the \nbill.\n  I thank Senators Coons, Udall of New Mexico, McConnell, Klobuchar, \nFranken, Portman, Feinstein, Hatch, Schumer, Landrieu, Burr, Collins, \nBennet, and Shaheen for their support as cosponsors of this bill.\n  I am glad to be partnering with Senator John Cornyn on this \nlegislation. We have done important work in the Judiciary Committee to \nsupport law enforcement and victims of crime. Last week, he and I \nintroduced sweeping legislation to improve the use of forensic evidence \nin criminal cases. The Criminal Justice and Forensic Science Reform Act \nhelps ensure that forensic labs throughout the Nation operate according \nto the highest standards, and that State and local labs have the \nresources they need. Both that measure and the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act of 2013 are important priorities to support our \ncriminal justice system and law enforcement.\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\n  We must stand behind these bipartisan efforts, and I urge Senate \nRepublicans to join all Senate Democrats in supporting passage of the \nJustice for All Reauthorization Act of 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1913-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COVINGTON CATHOLIC COLONELS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe my Senate colleagues are well \naware of how seriously we take our college basketball in my home State \nof Kentucky. The Kentucky High School Athletic Association, KHSAA, \nState Basketball Championship has been played every year since 1918 and \nis truly a special event.\n  Kentucky is one of three States that does not divide its schools into \nclasses based on size--that means one State, one tournament, and only \none champion. Teams that advance out of their district tournaments play \nin one of sixteen regional tournaments--the winners of which advance to \nplay in the KHSAA Sweet Sixteen in Lexington's legendary Rupp Arena.\n  This year, over 14,000 fans packed the stands for the championship \ngame and watched Covington Catholic High School defeat Scott County in \nan overtime thriller. I rise today to pay tribute to the players, \ncoaches and fans of the 2014 champions--the Covington Catholic \nColonels.\n  For the Colonels, led by head coach Scott Ruthsatz, the road to the \nschool's first-ever title was not easy--it seldom is in this grueling, \nstatewide tournament. Covington Catholic found themselves down in the \nsecond half in three out of their four Sweet Sixteen games--including \nthe championship. The players never gave up hope, though. On his team's \n27 to 18 halftime deficit in the championship game, tournament MVP Nick \nRuthsatz--Scott's son--said coolly, ``We've been in this position \nbefore and we knew we could pull through.''\n  As it turned out, Nick's confidence was not misplaced. The Colonels \nstormed back, tying the game at 47 with only 50 seconds to go, and \nsending the game into overtime. In the extra period, it was the \nColonels staunch defense and clutch free throws that propelled them to \na 59 to 51 victory.\n  The 97th KHSAA Basketball Championship, like so many before it, was \nan excellent display of athletic ability as well as sportsmanship. This \ntournament would not be what it is without the efforts of the players, \ncoaches, fans, and teachers of all the participating schools. They are \nall worthy of our praise.\n  However, in Kentucky, there can only be one champion. Thus, I ask \nthat my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating the Covington \nCatholic Colonels on winning the 2014 KHSAA State Basketball \nChampionship.\n  An article was recently published in the Cincinnati Enquirer \nchronicling Covington Catholic High School's championship win. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objections, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, \n                             Mar. 24, 2014]\n\n        Covington Catholic Rejoices in Historic Basketball Title\n\n                            (By James Weber)\n\n       Lexington.--Ben Heppler stood at center court on the Rupp \n     Arena floor and kept looking around at the all the chaos and \n     celebration around him.\n\n       Chaos, celebration and cheer, same first letters as \n     Covington Catholic Colonels, who were celebrating their first \n     state basketball championship March 23.\n       ``I'm trying to soak it all in,'' Heppler said. ``I'll \n     remember this for the rest of my life.''\n       Cov Cath outlasted Scott County in overtime, 59-51 Sunday \n     afternoon, March 23, at the University of Kentucky's historic \n     basketball arena. It was the third title in Northern Kentucky \n     history, and the second in the past six tournaments by a \n     Ninth Region team (Holmes, 2009). It was also the first in \n     Cov Cath history in its ninth trip to the Sweet 16.\n       ``It's incredible,'' said senior forward Mark Schult. ``You \n     dream of it, as a little kid, going out and winning your last \n     game, and it's hard to believe we actually did it.''\n       The Colonels finished with a 33-2 record. After losing to \n     Holmes in the 35th District final, the Colonels won seven \n     straight games. They trailed in the second half in three of \n     the four state tourney games.\n       With a veteran team and most of the student body in \n     attendance as the Colonel Crazies, it was a great day for \n     Covington Catholic.\n       ``It's so special,'' said head coach Scott Ruthsatz. ``You \n     have to look at the administration on down, what they're \n     doing at Covington Catholic. You have to give so much credit \n     to the Crazies. Our Colonel Nation really supported us, and \n     not just this game, all season long. Being the first winner \n     of it, it feels fantastic.''\n       Said Heppler: ``It's really special to be the first ones \n     and hang that first banner up there. We've always had that \n     empty spot and since Coach Ruthsatz's first day we said we \n     would be the ones to put it up there. The 6 a.m. workouts in \n     the summer, playing in the gym all those times, it paid \n     off.''\n       Cov Cath's fitness and toughness in adversity paid off \n     against the experienced Cardinals, who were seeking their \n     third state title (35-4). After an early 9-3 lead, Cov Cath \n     was on the wrong end of a 22-4 run and trailed 27-18 at \n     halftime. Scott had three 3-pointers in a 70-second span by \n     junior Hines Jones, who averaged four points a game for the \n     year. Forward Tony Martini had Scott's first five points and \n     posted 17 points and 16 rebounds for the game. Cov Cath shot \n     just 6-of-22 in the first half, several of those misses \n     coming from around the rim.\n       ``We've been in this situation before and we knew we could \n     pull through,'' Nick Ruthsatz said. ``We knew eventually we \n     would start hitting some, and the fourth quarter we just \n     buckled down. All the conditioning through the summer pulled \n     us through.''\n       Cov Cath trailed by four points, 47-43, with 1:33 to go. \n     Ruthsatz tied the game with a pair of foul shots with 51 \n     seconds to play.\n       Ruthsatz gave Cov Cath its first lead since 9-8 early in \n     OT, then tied the game at 51 with 2:16 to play. A tip-in by \n     junior Bo Schuh gave the Colonels the lead for good with 1:46 \n     to play.\n       After three missed shots by the Cardinals on their next \n     possession, Ruthsatz grabbed the rebound and made two foul \n     shots with 57 seconds to play to make it 55-51. Following \n     another missed shot, CCH senior Parker Keller made two free \n     throws, then Heppler scored the final points of the season on \n     a fast-break layup.\n       ``We just played better defense, tried to lock them down,'' \n     Heppler said. ``That's the experience of this team with three \n     senior starters and Parker hitting those huge free throws at \n     the end. It's a team game. Everybody can score. Most teams \n     around the state don't have five guys who can guard \n     everybody, so that works to our advantage.''\n       Ruthsatz had 25 points and five assists. Schult had 12 \n     points and six rebounds. Heppler scored eight with a pair of \n     treys. Freshman guard Cole VonHandorf had nine points, and \n     Schuh posted 12 rebounds.\n       One of VonHandorf's chief tasks was guarding Scott County \n     star guard Trent Gilbert, who came in averaging 26 points per \n     game. The Mr. Basketball finalist, who is getting interest \n     from several Division I schools, only scored 10 points on 4-\n     of-25 shooting. Cov Cath rotated several defenders on him and \n     often double-teamed him in the backcourt.\n       ``We just tried to pressure him as much as possible, \n     because we knew he's a great shooter,'' Scott Ruthsatz said. \n     ``You can never leave him open. We had a hint of the way he \n     likes to go and shoot, and we tried to keep fresh guys on \n     him.''\n       The fatigue may have hand in two crucial foul-shot misses \n     by Gilbert. A 91-percent shooter for the year, Gilbert made \n     28 in a row in the Sweet 16. However, he missed the front \n     ends of two one-and-one situations late in regulation.\n       ``I love stepping up and being able to shut him down,'' \n     VonHandorf said. ``They told me if I shut him down, we win. I \n     tried my best. He's a great player; I'll give him so many \n     props. I can't wait to see where he goes next year. \n     (Assistant coach) Joe Fredrick told me all of his moves, I \n     had them all down, I felt I could play him fairly well.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1913-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1913-S1914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

The authority to adjust enforceable levels in the Senate for \nunemployment relief is contingent on that legislation not increasing \nthe deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 \nthrough 2018 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through \n2023.\n  I find that amendment 2874, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act of 2014, to H.R. 3979 fulfills the conditions of the \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for unemployment relief, including not \nincreasing the deficit over either of the 2013 through 2018 or 2013 \nthrough 2023 budget windows. Therefore, pursuant to section 114(d) of \nH.J. Res. 59, I am adjusting the budgetary aggregates, as well as the \nallocation to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nrevisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n    [Pursuant to section 111 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and\n          section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          $s in millions               2014       2014-18      2014-23\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Budgetary Aggregates:*\n    Spending:\n        Budget Authority.........    2,928,080          n/a          n/a\n        Outlays..................    2,939,218          n/a          n/a\n    Revenue......................    2,311,031   13,699,529   31,095,846\nAdjustments Made Pursuant to\n section 114(d) of the Bipartisan\n Budget Act: **\n    Spending:\n        Budget Authority.........        9,875          n/a          n/a\n        Outlays..................        9,875          n/a          n/a\n    Revenue......................        1,632       15,668        8,469\nRevised Budgetary Aggregates:\n    Spending:\n        Budget Authority.........    2,937,955          n/a          n/a\n        Outlays..................    2,949,093          n/a          n/a\n    Revenue......................    2,312,663   13,715,197  31,104,315\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nn/a = Not applicable.

Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous \nconsent request at the present time relating to the nomination of \nKatherine M. O'Regan to be an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  Every year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides \nbillions of dollars to public housing authorities but provides little \noversight for how the money is spent. Many housing authority directors \nare more concerned with padding their own nests instead of providing \nsafe, affordable housing for people in need. One way to change this is \nto make detailed spending information available to the general public.\n  I will object to Ms. O'Regan's nomination because I have not yet \nreceived a response to my February 14, 2014 letter to HUD Secretary \nShaun Donovan regarding HUD's effort to collect Public Housing \nAuthority salary and compensation data for calendar year 2013. \nSpecifically, I asked when the data would be available to the general \npublic on the HUD website and whether it would be available in a \nsearchable, standard electronic format.\n  This is the second time HUD has requested salary and compensation \ndata from the 3100 housing authorities across the United States. HUD \nfirst requested data for the top five wage earners in August 2011. At \nthat time, I requested that this data be made available to the general \npublic. HUD stated in a December 2011 letter:\n\n       This information will be posted on a HUD website, \n     consistent with applicable law. We are now in the process of \n     collecting this information for the first time, and expect \n     that it will be posted during the first quarter of the year.\n\n  Despite HUD's pledge, the full set of data has never been posted on \nthe Department website. Instead, it only posted three pages of \naggregate data in June 2012, and HUD didn't provide the full set of \ndata to my office until May 2013, nearly 2 years after the data \ncollection process was initiated.\n  HUD is aware of the impact this data can have when made available to \nthe public. Shortly after the compensation information was requested in \n2011, Congress imposed a 1 year salary cap for all housing authority \nexecutives. Housing authorities are now using Federal funding not \ncovered by the salary cap to continue paying large salaries and \ncompensation packages. The compensation data currently being collected \nwould shed light on this practice and should be posted on the HUD \nwebsite as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1914-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1914-S1915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL GME SUPPORT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of my colleagues, \nSenators Harkin, Alexander, Casey and Isakson to submit the following \nstatement for the Record.\n  On October 30, 2013, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee unanimously reported the Children's Hospital GME Support \nReauthorization Act of 2013, S. 1557, out of Committee. On November 12, \n2013, the Senate passed S. 1557 by unanimous consent.\n  This legislation is the product of years of bipartisan negotiation, a \nprocess which resulted in broad Senate support for the Act. The list of \noriginal Senate cosponsors for S. 1557 demonstrates this point. This \nlist includes Senators Casey, Isakson, Harkin, Alexander, Blumenthal, \nBlunt, Brown, Kirk, Murphy, Reed, Roberts, Warren, and Whitehouse.\n  Prior to the enactment of the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical \nEducation, CHGME, Payment Program, there was significant disparity in \nfederal graduate medical education, GME, support between adult teaching \nhospitals and children's teaching hospitals. In 1998, children's \nhospitals received less than 0.5 percent of the level of federal GME \nsupport that adult teaching hospitals received. In the 2001 final rule \nfor the CHGME Payment Program, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, wrote, ``The intent of the CHGME Act is to create parity \nin GME payments among all hospitals providing GME. It is clear that \nprimarily two factors cause this disparity in children's hospitals: (1) \nlow Medicare utilization; and (2) Prospective Payment System (PPS)-\nexempt status.''\n  The CHGME Payment Program has made considerable progress in achieving \nparity in GME payments, increasing the number of pediatric training \npositions at participating children's hospitals. However, a small \nnumber of freestanding children's teaching hospitals remain ineligible \nfor the program. In 2003, Senate Committee on Appropriations noted the \nfollowing:\n\n       It has come to the Committee's attention that a limited \n     number of freestanding perinatal hospitals and children's \n     psychiatric hospitals have been excluded from participation \n     in this program despite the fact that these teaching \n     institutions are not eligible for Graduate Medical Education \n     funding under Medicare. The Committee expects [the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)] to explore the \n     appropriateness of including these hospitals in the \n     Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Program and \n     to offer recommendations that might allow for their \n     inclusion.\n\nSenate Report 108-81.\n  HRSA responded in a 2004 report to Congress which concluded that \naddressing this eligibility issue would require Congress to amend the \nstatue governing the CHGME Payment Program. S. 1557 addresses this \nlong-standing issue. The reauthorization legislation authorizes the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to make \navailable up to 25 percent of CHGME appropriations that exceed $245 \nmillion for ``qualified hospitals'' that: (1) have a Medicare payment \nagreement and are excluded from Medicare inpatient hospital prospective \npayment system; (2) have inpatients that are predominantly individuals \nunder 18 years of age; (3) have an approved medical residency training \nprogram; and (4) are not otherwise eligible to receive payments from \nthe CHGME Payment Program or the Medicare program. The total amount the \nSecretary can make available for these purposes in any fiscal year is \nlimited to $7 million, thus ensuring that adequate resources remain \navailable for the children's hospitals that currently participate in \nthe program.\n  The Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act provides the \nSecretary with the necessary authority to address the disparity in GME \npayment facing certain children's teaching hospitals. These changes are \nin keeping with the intent of the CHGME Payment Program. As such, these \nhospitals should have the opportunity to apply for support through the \nCHGME Payment Program in order to sustain and build their teaching \nprograms, and ultimately increase the supply of much-needed \npediatricians and pediatric specialists. We urge the Secretary\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nto weigh these benefits in using the new authority under S. 1557 should \nfunding be available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1915-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after the financial crisis in 2008, its \nroot causes and the resulting taxpayer-funded bailout; increasingly \nopaque trading activities that now dominate all stock-trading volume in \nthe U.S.; a string of high-profile convictions of hedge-fund managers \nand equity analysts; and global settlements with investment banks \ninvolving every assortment of ``whale'' and dodgy tax-avoidance scheme, \nmany Americans are now of the view that Wall Street is no longer a \nvehicle for the creation of investment capital or a reliable engine of \nentrepreneurialism and economic growth that it has become the province \nof high-frequency and automated traders. As billionaire investor and \nlongtime HFT critic Mark Cuban admonished a few years ago, it has \nbecome a platform to be exploited by every technological and \nintellectual means possible by whoever can afford them.\n  At least that is the perception.\n  It is exactly that perception that has fueled major public concern \nabout revelations contained in Michael Lewis' new book, ``Flash Boys: A \nWall Street Revolt''. Lewis's book tells the story of the computer-\ndriven world of high-frequency trading, HFT, co-location and customized \ndata. Indeed, Lewis' narrative appears to have struck a raw nerve among \nconsumers, by confirming a latent belief and skepticism that Wall \nStreet is indeed an insider's game and that the public's best interests \nare, at most, an afterthought.\n  If true, Lewis' claim that the market is rigged through variations of \nHFT could potentially affect everyone from institutional investors to \nany individual who pays into a pension or mutual fund.\n  On HFT, one big issue is: how fair is it for certain firms to line \ntheir trading systems up with data centers used by exchanges to let \nthem shave-off millionths of a second from every transaction, front-run \nthe market, drive-up prices and profit accordingly, at the expense of \naverage investors who do not enjoy that same capability. Another is: to \nwhat extent does HFT and so-called quick-draw trading expose the market \nto undue risk-taking and potential instability like the 2010 ``flash \ncrash'', in which the Dow Jones dropped 9% in 20 minutes, temporarily \nerasing $1 trillion in market value?\n  These are questions that must be taken seriously by policymakers; \nregulators; and, where warranted, law enforcement officials. Indeed, \nthe Commodities Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, is rightly examining \narrangements between HFT firms and exchanges to determine whether \ninsiders are receiving competitive perks, such as reduced rates, that \ncould harm smaller investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nSEC, is similarly looking into potentially improper relationships \nbetween exchanges and HFT firms. New York Attorney General Eric \nSchneiderman has labeled certain pernicious HFT practices as ``Insider \nTrading 2.0'' and launched investigations into practices such as co-\nlocation, which permits trading firms to be geographically advantaged \nover competitors, and other arrangements that permit early access to \nmarket-moving information. Just yesterday, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, FBI, disclosed that it was also looking into related \nmatters.\n  Congress, as well as regulators at the SEC and CFTC should fully \ninvestigate these issues and pursue proposals that can minimize \nsystemic risk and bolster trust in our markets. But we cannot ignore \nthe inherent limitations that exist in regulating an issue as complex \nas HFT. The technology and resources readily available to trading firms \neasily dwarf those available to our government's primary regulators. \nHigh-frequency traders have huge incentives to gain even the slightest \nedge through speed and technology because the pay-offs can be \nexorbitant. For example, a company called Spread Networks reportedly \nspent $300 million to lay a fiber-optic cable between Chicago and New \nJersey to increase the time it took for information to make it from the \nfutures market to the exchanges by 3 milliseconds. That amount nearly \nmatches the entire operating budget of the CFTC for 2013. Policymakers, \ntherefore, face an uphill battle in which regulatory fixes quickly \nbecome obsolete as the trading firms' approaches and algorithms adapt \nalmost as rapidly as information travels on their fiber-optic cables.\n  Against this backdrop, industry must see for itself an opportunity to \nself-regulate. Rather than hide behind self-serving, arcane arguments \nthat support a status quo that allows for front-running and other \nunethical trading practices, industry must gather-around strong self-\nimposed, market-based solutions to the uncertainty and potential harm \ncreated by HFT that ensure fundamental fairness and transparency in \nmarkets that are technologically evolving at break-neck speed. Indeed, \nindustry can either sit back and wait for regulators or Congress to \naddress these issues with a possibly detrimental outcome for all \nconcerned, or it can be proactive in developing meaningful approaches \nthat not only address the instant problem but also help restore much-\nneeded, long-overdue confidence in the integrity of the financial \nmarkets.\n  Some leaders in industry have recently expressed support for reforms \naimed at minimizing unfairness that stems from the ``fragmentation and \ncomplexity'' of trading. But more needs to be done: key exchanges, \ntrading firms, investors, banks, and self-regulatory bodies such as the \nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, FINRA, should explore \npotential solutions that would ensure technology is employed in a way \nthat encourages competition and innovation, while also increasing the \ntransparency and integrity of the markets.\n  Congress should keep a watchful eye on developments in this field--I \ncertainly will. Federal regulators and law enforcement should continue \nto hold accountable those actors and institutions that cross the line \ninto illegality, market-manipulation, and acting on non-public \ninformation. Whatever policy solutions are pursued, they must both \nenhance the functionality of the market and restore public trust and \nconfidence in Wall Street. Industry, specifically traders and \nexchanges, must focus on cooperation instead of clamoring for speed in \na race to the bottom, which would only leave investors in the dust and \nforce consumers to shoulder the burden of another financial crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1915-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1915-S1916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, I wish today to honor Myles Eckert, an 8-\nyear-old boy from Waterville, OH, whose simple act of generosity has \nled to national attention. Myles found a $20 bill in a restaurant \nparking lot and, rather than save it for himself, gave it to Ohio \nNational Guard Airman Lt.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the life of Stanley Grinstein, a successful businessman, \na patron of the arts, a philanthropist, and a social activist. He was \nalso a great friend of mine, and I will miss him dearly.\n  Born in Seattle in 1927, Stanley moved to Los Angeles with his family \nand graduated from the University of Southern California. He and his \nfather started what would become a thriving forklift business that \nStanley ran until he sold the company in 2000.\n  In 1952, Stanley married Elyse, the love of his life. The couple \nbegan collecting art and soon became well-known patrons of modern \nartists.\n  In January 1966, Stanley joined fellow art patrons Sidney Felsen and \nKen Tyler to establish Gemini G.E.L., an artists' workshop and art \nprint publisher. The first facility of its kind on the West Coast, \nGemini quickly became a magnet not only for emerging Los Angeles \nartists but also for leading New York artists.\n  Among the many artists who worked and published at Gemini were Robert \nRauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, David Hockney, and Frank \nStella. In 1981, Gemini donated its archives--containing works by these \nand other modern masters--to the National Gallery of Art. By this time, \nStanley had begun his 26-year tenure as a trustee of the Los Angeles \nCounty Museum of Art, LACMA. Over the years, he and Elyse made many \nmajor gifts to LACMA, including a seminal work by Marcel Duchamp and \nall 124 of Robert Rauschenberg's posters.\n  Beyond the art world, Stanley was a deeply committed social activist \nwho generously gave his time and resources in support of human rights, \nfree speech, justice, and equality.\n  Stanley was also a longtime benefactor of the Cedars Sinai Medical \nCenter, where he served on the Board of Directors, Executive Committee, \nand Advisory Council for the Arts. A passionate believer in the role \nthat art can play in the healing process, Stanley helped fill Cedars \nSinai with art and brought joy to countless patients.\n  Stanley Grinstein believed in living every moment to the fullest and \ninspiring others to enjoy what he called ``the party of life.''\n  I send my deepest condolences to Stanley's beloved wife Elyse; their \ndaughters Ayn Grinstein, Ellen Grinstein Perliter, and Nancy Grinstein; \nsons-in-law Chuck Perliter and Neal Rabin; and six grandchildren \nAmanda, Joe, Alex, Willie, Tess, and Dia.

Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to my \ngood friend Gloria Molina, who is serving her 24th and final year on \nthe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Gloria is a trailblazer \nwho has inspired countless young women to pursue public service, and \nshe is retiring from office at the end of this year after more than \nthree decades of extraordinary service on behalf of the people of \nCalifornia.\n  Gloria Molina was raised in Pico Rivera, the eldest of ten children \nborn to a Mexican mother and Mexican-American father. A graduate of El \nRancho High School, she worked full time as a legal secretary while \nattending college and becoming certified as an adult education \ninstructor, teaching clerical skills to adults at the East Los Angeles \nSkills Center.\n  Gloria entered government service as a staff member, first for \nAssemblymember Art Torres and later for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. \nIn 1982, after serving in the Carter White House and with the San \nFrancisco Department of Health and Human Services, she made history as \nthe first Latina ever elected to the California State Assembly.\n  Gloria was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 1987 and the \nCounty Board of Supervisors in 1991, making headlines each time for \nbecoming the first Latina to serve in those positions.\n  Since 1991, Supervisor Molina has represented nearly 2 million \nresidents in the First District of our Nation's largest county, where \nshe has focused on making services more effective and on completing \nmajor capital projects that improve the quality of life for residents \nof her district and the entire county. Among the initiatives she \nchampioned are the Metro Gold Line Eastside Extension, a six-mile light \nrail line connecting East L.A. to downtown and the rest of the county's \nmass transit network; the state-of-the-art LAC-USC Medical Center in \nBoyle Heights; the Plaza de Cultura y Artes\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\nat El Pueblo Historic Monument, a museum dedicated to showcasing and \npreserving the history of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in Los \nAngeles; the Los Angeles River and San Gabriel River Master Plans, both \nof which serve as blueprints for ``greening'' local rivers and their \ntributaries; and the construction of more than 1,100 new affordable \nhousing units in the First District.\n  I have known Gloria for many years, and I am honored to salute her as \nshe prepares to retire from elective office. I am pleased to join \nGloria's many friends, family members, associates, admirers, and \ngrateful constituents in wishing her health, happiness, and all the \nbest as she embarks on the next phase of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1917-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING ONCOLOGY NURSES\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Columbus \nChapter of the Oncology Nursing Society, or CCONS, on a legacy of \nexcellence in oncology nursing and quality cancer care. CCONS' 25th \nAnnual Spring Conference, ``Kaleidoscope of Oncology Care,'' will be \nheld on April 3, and in May, during Oncology Nursing Month, the society \nwill celebrate its 30th anniversary. I would like to take a moment to \nreflect on the work and achievements of this valued organization and to \nespecially recognize CCONS' president, Bertie Ford, for her leadership.\n  Since 1984, CCONS has worked to lead the transformation of cancer \ncare. Its members are leaders in their communities and represent the \nmost effective cancer care advocates in their workplaces. These \noncology nurses are vital supports of patient-centered interventions, \nleveraging clinical knowledge and technology every day to provide the \nhighest quality cancer care to patients not only in Columbus but across \nOhio.\n  We are making progress in the fight against cancer. The 5-year \nsurvival rate for all cancers among adults is 68 percent--a marked \nimprovement over the mid-1970s when it was 50 percent. But as cancer \ntreatment becomes more complex, the health care system demands higher \nquality and more efficient care. As Congress works to increase patient \naccess to quality health care, I praise the commitment of CCONS in \nfostering excellence in oncology nursing and in the care of cancer \npatients.\n  My mother passed away in 2009 while in hospice care. I will never \nforget the nurses who took care of her in such a loving way when they \ndidn't know her personally until those last few weeks. It made all the \ndifference in the world to her and our family. For that, I always thank \nnurses and others who care for those in need.\n  Congratulations to CCONS on its 30th anniversary and for the \nimportant work its members do in Ohio's communities every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1917-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SHAUN CAREY\n\n Mr. HELLER.

In 1992, Mr. Carey was named public works director for the city \nof Sparks. He was later named assistant city manager in 1999 and then \ncity manager in 2000.\n  Under Mr. Carey's stewardship, Sparks has experienced continued \ngrowth through the economic challenges of recent years. He has \nstreamlined city services and kept debt the lowest in the region \ndespite economic challenges. Through his management, Sparks remains a \nfull service city and continues to be responsive to its citizens.\n  Mr. Carey's leadership was instrumental in the development of the \nSparks Marina, and his guidance has been vital in coordinating the \nlocal area's continuing development. Under Mr. Carey's tenure, Sparks \nnow boasts a whitewater recreation center, a new community center, and \none of the largest artificial turf sports complexes in the world. \nThanks to Mr. Carey, Sparks has become known as the premier event \ncenter for the region and is the fifth largest city in the State.\n  I offer Mr. Carey my warmest congratulations and hope he enjoys a \nrich and rewarding retirement, knowing that his years of service will \nnot be forgotten by the grateful residents of Sparks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1917-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DAVID RATCLIFFE\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

SCHWAB\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the life and \nservice of a brave and patriotic Nebraskan. First Lieutenant Donald K. \nSchwab was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for going above and \nbeyond the call of duty during his service in World War II. First \nLieutenant Schwab was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze \nStar, and three Purple Hearts for his valor, and I applaud the \nupgrading of his Distinguished Service Cross to the Medal of Honor, our \nNation's highest military honor.\n  Schwab was born in Hooper, NE, in 1918 and enlisted in the U.S. Army \nupon graduating from high school. In World War II, his tour of duty \nincluded posts in North Africa, Italy, and France. On September 17, \n1944, near Lure, France, First Lieutenant Schwab showed tremendous \nbravery and valor though his actions in combat. Ordered to overwhelm \nthe enemy line, Schwab led his men twice toward the Germans amidst \nheavy gunfire. He rallied his decimated force for a third charge on the \nhostile\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nstrong-point, working their way to within 50 yards of the Germans. He \nthen stormed a line of German foxholes alone, reaching a key machine \npistol nest which had caused heavy casualties among his men. After \nripping off the cover of the firing pit, Schwab forced the German \nsoldier inside to accompany him back behind friendly lines, surviving a \nbarrage of gunfire. His actions so disorganized the hostile infantry \nresistance that the enemy withdrew. This episode of selfless heroism \ndismantled a strong German position, aiding the Allied front.\n  First Lieutenant Schwab was wounded three times in Active Duty but \ncontinued to serve in the U.S. Army until October 26, 1945. Schwab \nreturned to the family farm in Hooper and later worked as a rural mail \ncarrier. His service continued in civilian life through his involvement \nin his church council, the Hooper and Logan View school boards, and \nother organizations. Schwab's commitment and connection remained strong \nin part through his membership in the Cornelius Tillman American Legion \nPost 18 and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10535 in Hooper.\n  First Lieutenant Schwab died at age 86 in 2005. Although the Medal of \nHonor comes 9 years after his death, the bravery and heroism he showed \nin 1944 is now rightly recognized. I congratulate his wife Maralee, his \nchildren, and his grandchildren, who accepted this award in his memory. \nNebraskans have a long and proud tradition of military service. \nSchwab's actions exemplify selflessness and courage, setting a worthy \nexample for many others who would follow.\n  First Lieutenant Schwab's commitment to community and country is \ntruly inspiring. I ask my colleagues, my fellow Nebraskans, and all \nAmericans to join me in honoring his service, recognizing the valor for \nwhich the Medal of Honor was awarded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1918-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1918-S1919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO CONGRESS RELATIVE TO THE SECRETARY OF THE \nINTERIOR'S CERTIFICATION UNDER SECTION 8 OF THE FISHERMAN'S PROTECTIVE \nACT OF 1967, AS AMENDED (THE ``PELLY AMENDMENT'') (22 U.S.C. 1978) THAT \n NATIONALS OF ICELAND HAVE CONDUCTED WHALING ACTIVITIES THAT DIMINISH \n     THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN \n       ENDANGERED SPECIES OF WILD FAUNA AND FLORA (CITES)--PM 37\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On January 31, 2014, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell certified \nunder section 8 of the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 (the ``Pelly \nAmendment'') (22 U.S.C. 1978), that nationals of Iceland are conducting \ntrade in whale meat and products that diminishes the effectiveness of \nthe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild \nFauna and Flora (CITES). This message constitutes my notification to \nthe Congress consistent with subsection (b) of the Pelly Amendment.\n  This is the third certification by United States Government agencies \nof Iceland for their continued whaling activities. In 2004, Secretary \nof Commerce Donald L. Evans made a certification regarding Iceland \nunder the Pelly Amendment because its scientific whaling program \ndiminished the effectiveness of the International Whaling Commission \n(IWC). When Iceland resumed commercial whaling in 2006, Secretary of \nCommerce Carlos M. Gutierrez continued Iceland's certification. In \n2011, Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke increased actions to be taken by \nmembers of the Cabinet, Federal departments and agencies, and U.S. \ndelegations by again certifying Iceland for diminishing the \neffectiveness of the IWC.\n  A single Icelandic company, Hvalur hf, conducts fin whaling. Iceland \ndoes not consume most of these fin whales; rather, they are exported, \nmainly to Japan. Iceland's commercial harvest of fin whales escalated \ndramatically in 2009 and 2010, was suspended in 2011 and 2012 due to \ndifficulties in the Japanese market after the 2011 earthquake and \ntsunami, and resumed in 2013. Between 1987 and 2008, Iceland hunted a \ntotal of 7 fin whales. In 2009, Iceland hunted 125 fin whales, followed \nby 148 in 2010, zero in the years 2011-2012, and 134 fin whales in \n2013. On December 16, 2013, Iceland set its 2014-2019 fin whale quota \nat 154 fin whales per year, an increase in its previous yearly whaling \nquota. According to the IWC, a harvest of 46 fin whales in the North \nAtlantic is biologically sustainable.\n  Iceland's actions jeopardize the survival of the fin whale, which is \nlisted in CITES among the species most threatened with extinction, and \nthey undermine multilateral efforts to ensure greater worldwide \nprotection for whales. Specifically, Iceland's continued commercial \nwhaling and recent trade in whale products diminish the effectiveness \nof CITES because: (1) Iceland's commercial harvest of fin whales \nundermines the goal of CITES to ensure that international trade in \nspecies of animals and plants does not threaten their survival in the \nwild; and (2) Iceland's current fin whale harvest and quota exceeds \ncatch levels that the IWC's scientific body advised were sustainable.\n  In her letter of January 31, 2014, Secretary Jewell expressed her \nconcern for Iceland's actions, and I share these concerns. Just as the \nUnited States made the transition from a commercial whaling nation to a \nwhale watching nation, we must enhance our engagement to facilitate \nthis change by Iceland.\n  To ensure that this issue continues to receive the highest level of \nattention, I have directed: (1) relevant U.S. agencies to raise \nconcerns with Iceland's trade in whale parts and products in \nappropriate CITES fora and processes, and, in consultation with other \ninternational actors, to seek additional measures to reduce such trade \nand enhance the effectiveness of CITES; (2) relevant senior \nAdministration officials and U.S. delegations meeting with Icelandic \nofficials to raise U.S. objections to commercial whaling and Iceland's \nongoing trade in fin whale parts and products and to urge a halt to \nsuch action, including immediate notification of this position to the \nGovernment of Iceland; (3) the Department of State and other relevant \nagencies to encourage Iceland to develop and expand measures that \nincrease economic opportunities for the nonlethal uses of whales in \nIceland, such as responsible whale watching activities and educational \nand scientific research activities that contribute to the conservation \nof whales; (4) the Department of State to re-examine bilateral \ncooperation projects, and where appropriate, to base U.S. cooperation \nwith Iceland on the Icelandic government changing its whaling policy, \nabiding by the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, and not engaging \nin trade in whale parts and products in a manner that diminishes the \neffectiveness of CITES; (5) the Department of State to inform the \nGovernment of Iceland that the United States will continue to monitor \nthe activities of Icelandic companies that engage in commercial whaling \nand international trade in whale parts and products; (6) Cabinet \nsecretaries and other senior Administration officials to evaluate the \nappropriateness of visits to Iceland in light of Iceland's resumption \nof fin whaling and ongoing trade in fin whale parts and products; (7) \nrelevant departments and agencies to examine other options for \nresponding to continued whaling by Iceland; and (8) all relevant \ndepartments and agencies to report on their actions, within 6 months of \ncertification, and any updates as needed beyond, through the \nDepartments of State and the Interior. In addition, previous Pelly \ncertifications of Iceland, and the direction to take actions pursuant \nto those certifications, remain in effect. I concur with the \nrecommendation, as presented by the Secretary of the Interior, to \npursue the use of non-trade measures and that the actions outlined \nabove are the appropriate course of action to address this issue. \nAccordingly, I am not directing the Secretary of the Treasury to impose \ntrade measures on Icelandic products for the whaling activities that \nled to the certification by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  The Departments of State, Commerce, and the Interior will continue to \nmonitor and encourage Iceland to\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\nrevise its policies regarding commercial whaling. Further, within 6 \nmonths, I have directed relevant departments and agencies to report to \nme through the Departments of State, Commerce, and the Interior on \ntheir actions. I believe that continuing focus on Icelandic whaling \nactivities is needed to encourage Iceland to halt commercial whaling \nand support international conservation efforts.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 1, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1919-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 12:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \npro tempore (Mr. Wolf) has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4302.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of South Dakota petitioning the United States \n     Congress to reauthorize federally provided terrorism \n     reinsurance for insurers; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 1019\n\n       Whereas, insurance protects the United States economy from \n     the adverse effects of the risks inherent in economic growth \n     and development while also providing the resources necessary \n     to rebuild physical and\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\n     economic infrastructure, offer indemnification for business \n     disruption, and provide coverage for medical and liability \n     costs from injuries and loss of life in the event of \n     catastrophic losses to persons or property; and\n       Whereas, the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, \n     produced insured losses larger than any other man-made event \n     in United States history, with claims paid by insurers to \n     their policyholders eventually totaling some $32.5 billion, \n     making this the second most costly insurance event in United \n     States history; and\n       Whereas, the sheer enormity of the terrorist-induced loss, \n     combined with the possibility of future attacks, produced \n     financial shockwaves that shook insurance markets causing \n     insurers and reinsurers to exclude coverage arising from acts \n     of terrorism from virtually all commercial property and \n     liability policies; and\n       Whereas, the lack of terrorism risk insurance contributed \n     to a paralysis in the economy, especially in construction, \n     tourism, business travel, and real estate finance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress originally passed the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-297 (TRIA), \n     in which the federal government agreed to provide terrorism \n     reinsurance to insurers and reauthorized this arrangement via \n     the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, Pub. L. \n     109-144, and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-160 (TRIPRA); and\n       Whereas, under TRIPRA the federal government provides such \n     reinsurance after industry-wide losses attributable to annual \n     certified terrorism events exceed one hundred million \n     dollars; and\n       Whereas, coverage under TRIPRA is provided to an individual \n     insurer after the insurer has incurred losses related to \n     terrorism equal to twenty percent of the insurer's previous \n     year earned premium for property-casualty lines; and\n       Whereas, after an individual insurer has reached such a \n     threshold, the insurer pays fifteen percent of residual \n     losses and the federal government pays the remaining eighty-\n     five percent; and\n       Whereas, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has an annual \n     cap of one hundred billion dollars of aggregate insured \n     losses, beyond which the federal program does not provide \n     coverage; and\n       Whereas, TRIPRA requires the federal government to recoup \n     one hundred percent of the benefits provided under the \n     program via policy holder surcharges to the extent the \n     aggregate insured losses are less than twenty-seven billion \n     five hundred million dollars and enables the government to \n     recoup expenditures beyond that mandatory recoupment amount; \n     and\n       Whereas, without question, TRIA and its successors are the \n     principal reason for the continued stability in the insurance \n     and reinsurance market for terrorism insurance to the benefit \n     of our overall economy; and\n       Whereas, the presence of a robust private and public \n     partnership has provided stability and predictability and has \n     allowed insurers to actively participate in the market in a \n     meaningful way; and\n       Whereas, without a program such as TRIPRA, many of our \n     citizens who want and need terrorism coverage to operate \n     their businesses all across the nation would be either unable \n     to get insurance or unable to afford the limited coverage \n     that would be available; and\n       Whereas, without federally provided reinsurance, property \n     and casualty insurers will face less availability of \n     terrorism reinsurance and will therefore be severely \n     restricted in their ability to provide sufficient coverage \n     for acts of terrorism to support our economy; and\n       Whereas, unfortunately, despite the hard work and \n     dedication of this nation's counterterrorism agencies and the \n     bravery of the men and women in uniform who fought and \n     continue to fight battles abroad to keep us safe here at \n     home, the threat from terrorist attacks in the United States \n     is both real and substantial and will remain as such for the \n     foreseeable future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-\n     Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate \n     concurring therein, that the United States Congress and the \n     President of the United States reauthorize the Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Program.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-205. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     provide full, sustainable funding for the Payment in Lieu of \n     Taxes (PILT) program for fiscal year 2015 and into the \n     future; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Memorial No. 1006\n\n       Whereas, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program was \n     established in 1976 to offset costs incurred by counties for \n     services provided to the federal government and to the users \n     of federal lands located within a county; and\n       Whereas, the State of Arizona is composed of 113,417 square \n     miles of land, of which 42% is federally owned, nontribal \n     land that is unavailable for economic development and not \n     part of the property tax base. Less than 17% of the land in \n     Arizona is private land; and\n       Whereas, the national average PILT payment in fiscal year \n     2013 was $0.66 per acre, which is far below the amount that \n     federal lands would return through both value-based taxation \n     and economic development; and\n       Whereas, counties are required to provide law enforcement, \n     search and rescue, emergency services, road building and \n     maintenance, and other community services on, or associated \n     with, tax-exempt federal public lands; and\n       Whereas, Congress failed to provide funding for the PILT \n     program in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, \n     jeopardizing $32 million in PILT funding for Arizona counties \n     and causing great uncertainty about county finances and \n     services in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015; and\n       Whereas, a one-year extension of PILT funding for fiscal \n     year 2014 was included in the farm bill conference report, \n     but the fate of fiscal year 2015 funding is still unknown; \n     and\n       Whereas, a lack of PILT funding places the large, \n     unsustainable burden of providing services on federal lands \n     squarely on the backs of local county taxpayers, while the \n     presence of that federal land creates barriers to further \n     economic opportunities; and\n       Whereas, failure to secure PILT funding for fiscal year \n     2015 and into the future for Arizona counties in a timely \n     manner will critically impact the budget process and \n     structural solvency of counties and will substantially \n     compromise their ability to provide essential services; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has the duty to reimburse \n     local jurisdictions for the presence of federal public lands.\n       Wherefore, Your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress provide full, \n     sustainable funding for the PILT program for fiscal year 2015 \n     and into the future to help create financial stability within \n     Arizona's counties.\n       2. That the United States Congress work with the State of \n     Arizona and county governments to identify and implement \n     policies to promote economic development on, or associated \n     with, public lands.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-206. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Ohio commending Israel for \n     its cordial and mutually beneficial relationship with the \n     United States and Ohio and supporting Israel in its legal, \n     historical, and moral right of self-governance and self-\n     defense on the entirety of its own lands; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 340\n\n       Whereas, Israel has been granted its lands under and \n     through the oldest recorded deed, the Old Testament, a tome \n     of scripture held sacred and revered by Jews and Christians. \n     The claim and presence of the Jewish people in Israel have \n     remained constant throughout the past 4,000 years of history; \n     and\n       Whereas, The legal basis for the establishment of the \n     modern State of Israel was a binding act of international law \n     established in the San Remo Resolution, which was unanimously \n     adopted by the League of Nations in 1922 and subsequently \n     affirmed by both houses of the United States Congress. This \n     resolution affirmed the establishment of a national home for \n     the Jewish people in the historical region of the Land of \n     Israel. In addition, Article 80 of the United Nations charter \n     recognized the continued validity of the rights granted to \n     states or peoples that already existed under international \n     instruments. Thus, the San Remo Resolution remains valid, and \n     the 650,000 Jews currently residing in the areas of Judea, \n     Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem reside there legitimately; and\n       Whereas, Israel declared its independence and self-\n     governance on May 14, 1948, with the goal of reestablishing \n     its God-given and legally recognized lands as a homeland for \n     the Jewish people; and\n       Whereas, The United States, having been the first to \n     recognize Israel as an independent nation and as Israel's \n     principal ally, has enjoyed a close and mutually beneficial \n     relationship with Israel and its people. Israel is the \n     greatest friend and ally of our country in the Middle East, \n     and the values of our two nations are so intertwined that it \n     is impossible to separate one from the other; and\n       Whereas, There are those in the Middle East who have \n     continually sought to destroy Israel from the time of its \n     inception as a state, and those same enemies of Israel also \n     hate and seek to destroy the United States; and\n       Whereas, The State of Ohio and Israel have enjoyed cordial \n     and mutually beneficial relations since 1948, a friendship \n     that continues to strengthen with each passing year: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the House of \n     Representatives of the 130th General Assembly of the State of \n     Ohio, commend Israel for its cordial and mutually beneficial \n     relationship with the United States and Ohio and support \n     Israel in its legal, historical, and moral right of self-\n     governance and self-defense on the entirety of its own lands, \n     thus recognizing that Israel is neither an attacking force \n     nor an occupier of the lands of others and that peace can be \n     afforded the region only through a whole and united Israel; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     send duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker and Clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, to the President \n     Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, to the\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\n     members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and to the news \n     media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-207. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     Congress of the United States and the U.S. Department of \n     Veterans Affairs to take a stronger role in investigating and \n     eliminating delays in veterans' health care; to the Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1923, April 1, 2014, in the first column, the following \nlanguage appears: . . . investigating and eliminating delays in \nveterans health care; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . \ninvestigating and eliminating delays in veterans' health care; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n                        House Resolution No. 300\n\n       Whereas, The men and women who serve our country deserve \n     our utmost respect and appreciation. Many of them are injured \n     in the line of duty and come home to face challenging \n     physical disabilities and other health issues. These veterans \n     need our continued support after they have left active \n     service. All veterans are entitled to the best health care we \n     can give them; and\n       Whereas, Several VA facilities have a backlog of patients \n     waiting for colonoscopies or endoscopies, necessary \n     procedures for diagnosing cancers of the colon and digestive \n     tract. As many as 7,000 veterans have been on the backlog \n     list, often waiting over a year while experiencing pain and \n     other symptoms that could not be properly treated without \n     proper diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, At least 19 veterans have died due to delays in \n     commonly used medical screenings, such as colonoscopies. \n     Although the backlog problem was uncovered as early as July \n     of 2011, little progress has been made in increasing the \n     numbers of veterans who receive the necessary medical \n     procedures: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the U.S. \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to take a stronger role in \n     investigating and eliminating delays in veterans' health \n     care; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       P0M-208.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nand extend the deduction for new and existing energy-efficient \ncommercial buildings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Schatz to introduce the Energy Efficiency Tax \nIncentives Act.\n  Encouraging energy efficiency improvements is a smart and cost-\neffective way to reduce pollution, increase the competitiveness of our \nemployers, and to create jobs in both our construction and \nmanufacturing sectors.\n  As I have discussed previously on the floor of the Senate, our energy \nproblem in this country can be primarily attributed to a waste problem. \nRecently, the Department of Energy calculated that we waste 57 percent \nof all energy produced.\n  Our goal in introducing this bill is to prevent that waste by \nproviding focused incentives that encourage significant improvements in \nenergy efficiency and truly innovative energy efficiency technologies.\n  While my colleagues will explain how the bill does this for our homes \nand the industrial sector, I would like to focus on how our bill \nimproves energy efficiency outcomes for commercial and multifamily \nbuildings.\n  About 40 percent of energy consumption in the United States comes \nfrom our buildings, and up to 80 percent of the buildings standing \ntoday will still be here in 2050. Encouraging efficiency in new \nconstruction, and making these existing buildings more efficient, would \ngenerate billions of dollars in energy savings, spur job creation, and \nreduce carbon emissions.\n  Until January 1, 2014, Section 179D of the Internal Revenue Code \nprovided a tax deduction that allowed for cost recovery regarding \nenergy efficient energy efficiency improvements to a building's \nlighting, HVAC, and envelope.\n  Typically, the cost of energy consumption is part of a business's \nexpenses and thus immediately deductible. Section 179D was an important \nprovision because it aligned the Internal Revenue Code to similarly \nincentivize energy savings through efficiency improvements. In terms of \nmeeting our energy demands, some of the cheapest and cleanest energy we \nhave is the energy we don't use because of these improvements.\n  Unfortunately, the 179D deduction expired at the end of 2013. As we \nmove forward with tax extenders, it is critical that this provision be \nrestored.\n  Our bill restores the 179D deduction by extending it through 2016. In \naddition, our bill makes commonsense reforms to that section.\n  We update the energy efficiency standards that must be met to qualify \nfor the 179D deduction, including by providing automatic standard \nupdates for the years the deduction is available. We want to be sure \nthat this incentive is going to technologies that meet truly efficient \nstandards.\n  We also make the deduction more accessible to all real estate owners \nand those involved in implementing energy efficiency improvements, \nincluding through updated partial deduction standards and allocation \nprovisions.\n  Finally, the bill recognizes that, in the same way we encourage new \nconstruction to meet these standards, we should encourage energy \nefficiency retrofits.\n  Our current tax policies do not yet provide an effective incentive \nfor retrofitting our existing building stock. For example, the Empire \nState Building retrofit project, which will reduce that building's \nenergy consumption by 40 percent, did not qualify for a section 179D \ndeduction under its current structure.\n  Our bill would provide a deduction for retrofits of existing \ncommercial and multifamily buildings to further encourage retrofit \nprojects. Like section 179D, the deduction would be performance-based \nto encourage ambitious improvements and make the credit more accessible \nto building owners.\n  Before turning to my colleagues, I would like to reiterate that \nAmerica's energy and economic future requires a focus on these energy \nincentives. Initiatives like our bill are needed not only to generate \njobs, and savings for businesses and taxpayers, but also to improve our \nenvironment and make our nation more energy secure.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to join Senators Cardin and \nSchatz in introducing the Energy Efficiency Tax Incentives Act.\n  This bill has been drafted cooperatively, and my colleagues have been \nespecially accommodating of changes requested by California's experts. \nI thank them for their hard work on this bill.\n  This legislation revises and extends energy efficiency tax incentives \nfor homes, commercial buildings, and industrial facilities.\n  The bill continues the effort for energy efficiency improvements that \nI began with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire in 2001. I was proud to \npass that legislation with Senator Snowe in 2005.\n  The Energy Efficiency Tax Incentives Act builds on that law by \nreforming tax code incentives to implement a performance-based regime \nin which incentives grow larger as energy efficiency increases.\n  The policy improvements in this bill were recommended by energy \nefficiency experts.\n  This bill establishes energy and water efficiency incentives for \ncommercial buildings and industrial facilities, about which Senator \nCardin and Senator Schatz have focused their remarks.\n  I would like to focus on a different provision in the bill: tax \ncredits for home renovations that will increase energy efficiency of \nhomes by at least 20 percent.\n  The tax credit would increase in size with every 5 percent of \nadditional energy efficiency improvement achieved.\n  Homeowners who improve the efficiency of their home by more than 50 \npercent will qualify for a maximum credit of $5,000.\n  In addition to increased energy efficiency, this bill helps address \nthe continued double digit unemployment in the construction sector.\n  It is clear that we need policies that will help put the construction \nindustry back to work, but with 10 percent of homes still vacant, any \nstimulation of new-home construction could make the situation worse.\n  That is why this bill is so creative--it stimulates the construction \nindustry by incentivizing the renovation of existing homes.\n  This bill creates tax incentives for energy efficiency home \nrenovation based on the energy performance of the home, rather than \njust the cost of the equipment.\n  Current policy allows homeowners to claim credits for the purchase of \nenergy efficient insulation, windows, doors, heaters, air conditioners \nand water heaters. That approach is expensive, costing about $2 billion \nper year.\n  By restructuring the credit to apply to whole-home energy renovations \nthat reward energy efficiency performance, this proposal has the \npotential to increase effectiveness while substantially lowering the \ncost to the U.S. Treasury.\n  This legislation also includes provisions to promote effectiveness \nand prevent abuse. The contractor carrying out the work must sign an \naffidavit certifying the work was done, as well as submit photographs \nof the work. Additionally, the contractor must use certified, computer-\nbased energy efficiency measurement tools.\n  The credit would be limited to renovations of primary residences that \ndo not increase the size of the home. The credit would be capped at 30 \npercent of the cost of renovation in order to prevent homeowners from \nmaking large claims for relatively inexpensive renovations.\n  Since it is a tax credit, all claims would be subject to IRS audits.\n  In addition to incentivizing energy efficiency improvements, the bill \nalso creates an Industrial Process Water Use Project Credit.\n  This is a technology-neutral, performance-based tax credit for \nimplementing efficiency measures to reduce the use of water in the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  In a state like California, which frequently faces very dry \nconditions, rewarding water conservation and efficiency measures is \nbeneficial.\n  Much like the energy provisions, the bill increases the tax \nincentives as water savings grow.\n  The incentive begins with a 10 percent tax credit for implementing \nefficiency measures that achieve at least\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\n25 percent reduction in water use. The tax credit then increases by 10 \npercent for each 25 percent additional water savings, with a 30 percent \nmaximum.\n  This bill is important because it will help incentivize the \nconstruction industry to upgrade buildings across the country.\n  The 113 million homes in America account for 22 percent of the U.S. \nenergy use, according to the Department of Energy. And 4.8 million \ncommercial and 350,000 industrial facilities account for an additional \n18 percent.\n  These buildings also account for 27 percent of carbon dioxide \nemissions in the United States, according to the Energy Information \nAdministration.\n  Experts and scientists believe improving energy efficiency is one of \nthe most cost-effective ways to combat climate change and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  A recent McKinsey & Co. study concluded that maximizing energy \nefficiency for homes and commercial buildings could help reduce U.S. \nenergy consumption by 23 percent by 2020.\n  This is a jobs bill that also rewards energy and water efficiency \nrenovations. It will lead to more jobs in the construction sector, an \nincrease in energy efficiency, a reduction in pollution, and an \nexpansion of the market for efficient technology and products.\n  This bill is supported by the Alliance to Save Energy, Efficiency \nFirst, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, and the \nNatural Resource Defense Council.\n  This sort of investment--putting Americans back to work to upgrade \nthe country's infrastructure--is the type of legislation on which \nCongress should be spending more time.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important role \nthat energy efficiency plays in our transition to a clean energy \neconomy, and the importance of supporting energy efficiency efforts \nwith strong Federal policy. Today, Senators Cardin, Feinstein, and I \nintroduced comprehensive legislation, called the Energy Efficiency Tax \nIncentives Act of 2014, to reform, improve, and extend crucial tax \nincentives for energy efficiency. Our legislation focuses on three key \nsectors: commercial buildings, homes, and industry and manufacturing. \nMy colleagues have spoken ably about the first two already today, and I \nwould like to spend a few moments discussing the third title of this \nbill.\n  This bill would create targeted, non-permanent incentives to help the \nU.S. industrial sector become more globally competitive by employing \nsmart technological improvements to reduce energy use and encourage \nwater reuse.\n  We have continually seen the eagerness of U.S. industries to innovate \nand improve the processes by which they produce countless high-quality \ngoods. This set of incentives will help U.S. manufacturers accelerate \nand expand cutting-edge ideas while also reducing costs.\n  Industrial and manufacturing facilities have processes specific to \neach industry and even to each facility. Therefore, industrial \nefficiency improvements must be focused on these processes, not \nbuilding retrofits like we see in commercial and residential efficiency \nmeasures. My colleagues and I have worked to develop incentives that \ntarget energy-intensive processes common to the industrial sector. They \ninclude advanced motors, water reuse, combined heat and power and waste \nheat recovery, thermal biomass, and efficient chillers. I would like to \ntake a few moments to describe the various sections of the industrial \nefficiency title of the bill.\n  On average, motors account for over 65 percent of an industrial \nenergy user's electricity use, according to analysis by the \nInternational Energy Agency. This bill creates a credit for advanced \nindustrial use motors, including variable speed motors. New advances in \npower electronics and controls over the past 5 years have advanced the \npotential for new smart motor technologies to provide a significant \nenergy savings potential if these new motors are placed widely into \nservice.\n  According to the National Water Reuse Association, the U.S. currently \nreuses only 7.3 percent of its water, and there is significant \npotential for gains in this area. The industrial sector, which is \nresponsible for 62.5 percent of domestic freshwater withdrawals, is an \nideal place to introduce transformative water reuse and water saving \ntechnologies. The bill would create a technology-neutral, performance-\nbased investment tax credit for reuse, recycling, and/or efficiency \nmeasures related to industrial water reuse in the manufacturing sector.\n  A recent Department of Energy study estimates that achieving the \nPresident's goal of 40 gigawatts of Combined Heat and Power, also known \nas CHP, would save energy users $10 billion a year compared to current \nenergy use. In 2008, Congress enacted a 10 percent investment tax \ncredit for combined heat and power systems. The bill would expand that \ncredit's applicability, from the first 15 megawatts to the first 25 \nmegawatts of system capacity. The bill would also remove the existing \noverall system size cap of 50 megawatts, allowing a greater number of \ncombined heat and power projects to be financially viable and move \nforward. Finally, the bill would create two new tiers of the credit for \nCHP systems that achieve especially high efficiency levels. By \nencouraging adoption of CHP and waste heat recovery technologies, this \nbill is a common-sense set of incentives that will help manufacturers \nto become more efficient, reduce energy costs, create highly skilled \njobs, and ensure the delivery of reliable power.\n  New technologies have developed recently that can take advantage of \nlow-grade heat sources. Called Waste Heat to Power, these systems can \nachieve even greater levels of efficiency from industrial and \nmanufacturing applications.\n  Currently no incentives exist to promote thermal-only biomass use for \ncommercial and industrial applications. Using biomass for thermal \napplications has numerous advantages over using biomass to produce \nelectricity. Thermal use is significantly more efficient, less \npolluting, and more appropriately-scaled to biomass resources.\n  Finally, large water-cooled chillers are the engines of air-\nconditioning systems for almost all large buildings. This bill would \nestablish a tax credit that incentivizes the replacement of older \nchillers that still use environmentally harmful CFC refrigerants with \nchillers that are both more efficient and use fewer harmful chemicals.\n  Recent years have seen a resurgence in American industry and \nmanufacturing. As we work to get our economy back on track, become more \ncompetitive globally, and fight climate change, we should consider \nrobust efficiency incentives for our industrial sector as a crucial \ntool in achieving those goals.\n  I would like to commend my colleagues Senator Cardin and Senator \nFeinstein for their hard work on this bill. It represents the latest \nthinking in terms of straightforward, performance-based technology-\nneutral, non-permanent efficiency incentives. As we aim to improve \nefficiency in the industrial, commercial building, and residential \nsectors, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this critical \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Moran, \n        Mr. Wicker, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 2191. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nObamaCare and what I have long believed is a march to rationing of \nhealth care.\n  The ObamaCare bill and the accompanying regulations now tower over 7 \nfeet--1 foot above where I stand--when stacked together, and they have \nprovision after provision that will deny patients the care they want, \nthe care they need to ensure they get the life-sustaining and \nlifesaving treatments that are best for them.\n  These rationing elements in ObamaCare have been documented by a \nrecent report of the National Right to Life Committee's Powell Center \nfor Medical Ethics. This study is entitled ``The Affordable Health Care \nAct and Health Care Access in the United States.''\n  Perhaps most egregious about ObamaCare is that it directly inserts \nthe Federal Government into the personal lives of Americans, their \nfamilies, and their doctors.\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\n  We all know about the individual mandate that coerces people into \npurchasing a product they may not want by threatening to tax them. And \nI have often spoken about my personal nemesis in the rationing board \nthat I am going to bring up--the Independent Payment Advisory Board, \nIPAB. This is a board made up of 18--15 voting and 3 nonvoting--all \nunelected bureaucrats who will decide what gets to stay and what must \ngo in Medicare coverage. They will decide which treatments and services \nwill be covered and which will not. And there is no accountability \nwhatsoever. It would, in fact, take a two-thirds majority of the U.S. \nSenate to undo any of their actions. As a result, this board diminishes \nour constitutional responsibility.\n  This President has already raided half a trillion dollars from \nMedicare to pay for ObamaCare, and then he gave himself the ability to \ngo after even more Medicare dollars without any accountability. This, \nmy friends, is frightening. It is irresponsible. But there is more.\n  It is conceivable that the Independent Payment Advisory Board won't \njust limit Medicare access; it will also propose ways for the Federal \nGovernment to limit what Americans of all ages are allowed to spend out \nof their own private money--not taxpayer funds--to save the lives and \nhealth of their families.\n  Shocking but true: ObamaCare tells bureaucrats on the board to make \nsure we are not even allowed to keep up with medical inflation. \nFurther, it is conceivable that the board will suggest ways for the \nFederal Government to impose so-called quality and efficiency standards \non doctors and hospitals with the purpose of limiting the health care \nwe can get.\n  So here is the deal: If a doctor dares to give her patient treatment \nbeyond what those standards allow, the doctor will be punished. That \ndoctor will be excluded from all of the health insurance plans \nqualified under ObamaCare. Unbelievably, under ObamaCare, Washington \nbureaucrats can dictate one uniform standard of health care that is \ndesigned to limit what private citizens are allowed to spend out of \ntheir own money to save their own lives.\n  But the Independent Payment Advisory Board isn't the only rationing \nprovision in the ObamaCare or Affordable Healthcare Act. If only. \nObamaCare also has a Cadillac tax for having too much health care \ncoverage. Patients all across America need to know there is a provision \nof ObamaCare that punishes them and their employer if they provide \ncoverage that is above the arbitrary limits imposed by the Federal \nGovernment. This is an additional 40-percent tax on individuals who \nneed more expensive treatments and coverage oftentimes essential to \nbattle life-threatening illnesses. Even worse, these ObamaCare limits \nwere drafted in a way they will never be able to keep up with medical \ninflation. This means insurance companies will have to cut back even \nmore on patient treatments and services or people will be forced to pay \nan incredibly higher tax.\n  What about those individuals who are already suffering from life-\nthreatening illnesses who really need the care? This is why we should \npass the legislation I am offering.\n  Do Americans know that there is a provision in ObamaCare that lets \nthe Federal Government--not them and not their employer--decide if \ncoverage is ``excessive or unjustified''? This isn't government-\nsubsidized coverage in the exchanges, nor is it the federally funded \nMedicare and Medicaid coverage. This is their own and their employees' \nprivate money--their money. The Federal Government is given the \nauthority to decide if the way it is being spent is excessive or \nunjustified, and they are going to do it through the provision of \nObamaCare that allows the Obama administration to review premiums by \npressuring private insurance companies to stop offering coverage or \nface adverse government consequences.\n  So far we have talked about the private coverage, but there are also \nsimilar provisions for seniors' coverage. It wasn't bad enough that the \nPresident diverted one-half trillion dollars from Medicare to pay for \nObamaCare to begin with, he also granted the Department of Health and \nHuman Services the authority to deny private market-offered coverage \nfor services and treatments that could save your life. Before ObamaCare \nthese private market programs such as the prescription drug program and \nMedicare Advantage could allow seniors to add their own money to \npurchase coverage they want and need beyond what the government will \npay. ObamaCare allows Washington bureaucrats to deny that choice.\n  Folks, this isn't how we should be treating our seniors. It isn't how \nwe should be treating people who need access to life-saving treatment \nand services. This isn't how we should be treating anybody.\n  That is why today I come to the floor to introduce the Repeal \nRationing in Support of Life Act of 2014. My legislation repeals these \nprovisions that allow the Federal Government to intercede on very \npersonal decisions. It repeals the provisions that authorize rationing \nboards to deny patients the ability to access the care that may save \ntheir lives.\n  This legislation is relatively simple and should be supported by all \nof my colleagues to address some of the egregious changes from the \nAffordable Care Act that patients should be aware of but that many \ndon't even know exist. This is down the road. We are trying to stay \nahead of the curve. That is why I am introducing this legislation.\n  This legislation builds upon my Restoring Access to Medication Act. \nThis bill repeals the provision of ObamaCare limiting a patient's right \nto purchase over-the-counter products with their own money. It is also \na continuation of my efforts that I discussed when introducing the Four \nRationers Repeal Act many times on this floor. It repeals the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board. It repeals the euphemistically but \nmisleadingly named Innovation Center. It repeals the changes made to \nthe Preventive Services Task Force and makes sure any comparative \neffectiveness research is used by the doctor and the patient, not \ncoverage providers or CMS, to determine the best care for patients, not \nsimply try to lower costs.\n  I really believe that in order to protect this all-important doctor-\npatient relationship we need to repeal and most importantly to replace \nObamaCare with the real reforms that work for Kansans and all \nAmericans. However, until we can accomplish full repeal we at least \nneed to ensure we are protecting the life-saving care and treatment \nthat Americans need by attacking the elements of ObamaCare that ration \ncare, and passing the Repeal Rationing and Support of Life Act of 2014. \nI urge my colleagues to support this proposal and take the steps \nnecessary to protect the lives of their constituents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Isakson, and \n        Mr. Paul):\n  S. 2193. A bill to amend the Horse Protection Act to provide \nincreased protection for horses participating in shows, exhibitions, or \nsales, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with \nSenators McConnell, Isakson and Paul that will preserve the Tennessee \nWalking Horse tradition while stopping the contemptible practice of \nillegal soring.\n  The Horse Protection Act Amendments Act of 2014, will preserve the \ncentury-old Tennessee Walking Horse tradition and stop the contemptible \npractice of illegal soring.\n  This legislation builds upon a bill introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Marsha Blackburn that has support of 11 \nother congressmen and the American Farm Bureau. The Tennessee Farm \nBureau commented about Congressman Blackburn's bill in a letter to me \nthat said her legislation would ``allow the vast majority of horse \nowners, trainers and breeders and those who play by the rules to \nconfidently participate in the horse shows.''\n  A competing bill, advocated by the Humane Society of the United \nStates, has also been introduced in the Senate and would ban many \nindustry-standard training and show devices. This legislation has been \ndescribed by the Performance Show Horse Association as legislation that \nwould ``do little more than create another layer of bureaucracy at the \nUSDA while denying horse enthusiasts the opportunity'' to participate \nin competitions that are the\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nbasis of the Tennessee Walking Horse industry.\n  The Humane Society Bill goes too far. In baseball, if a player \nillegally uses steroids, you punish the player--you don't shut down \nAmerica's national pastime. With Tennessee Walking Horse shows, when \ntrainers, owners or riders illegally sore a horse, we should find a \nmore effective way to punish and stop them--not shut down one of \nTennessee's most treasured traditions. The problem with the Humane \nSociety bill is that it destroys a Tennessee tradition known around the \nworld.\n  Julius Johnson, Commissioner of Agriculture for Tennessee, said that \nthe Humane Society legislation will, ``damage the industry \nsignificantly and potentially eliminate the performance horse all \ntogether.''\n  When I first went to Japan in 1979 to recruit Nissan, the Tennessee \nWalking Horse was one of the things the Japanese knew best about our \nstate. In fact, the emperor had his own Walking Horse because it has an \nenjoyable gait that makes riding a more pleasurable experience. When \nthe first major supplier of Nissan, Calsonic, came to Shelbyville, the \ncompany's gift to Tennessee was Calsonic Arena, where the Tennessee \nWalking Horse National Celebration is held.\n  In 2013 the Tennessee Walking Horse tradition included more than 360 \naffiliated shows, and it featured more than 220,000 registered horses \nnationwide, including more than 55,000 in Tennessee, according to the \nTennessee Walking Horse Association.\n  Our goal is to find a way to preserve the Tennessee Walking Horse \ntradition and stop the cruelty to horses. We need a balanced approach, \nand that is what this bill provides.\n  This legislation takes four primary steps to preserve the Tennessee \nWalking Horse tradition while ending the illegal practice of soring. \nThe bill would create consistent oversight by consolidating the \nnumerous ``horse industry organizations'' that currently handle \ninspections into one organization overseeing inspections, governed by a \nboard. The board would be composed of appointees by the States of \nTennessee and Kentucky, as well as experts in the Tennessee Walking \nHorse industry.\n  Next the bill requires the use of objective, scientific testing to \ndetermine whether trainers, riders or owners are using soring \ntechniques. Examples of this objective testing include blood samples \nand swabbing the horse for chemicals used to sore a horse.\n  Lastly, the legislation would ensure the integrity of horse \ninspectors by instructing the horse industry organization to establish \nrequirements to prevent conflicts of interest with trainers, breeders \nand owners involved in showing the Tennessee Walking Horse.\n  We have proposed three improvements to the legislation introduced in \nthe House. First, the new consolidated horse industry organization \nwould be required to identify and contract with equine veterinary \nexperts to advise the horse industry organization on testing methods \nand procedures, as well as the certification of test results.\n  Next the legislation creates a suspension period for horses that are \nfound to be sore. Owners whose horses are found to be sore will have \ntheir horses suspended from showing for 30-days for the first offense, \nwith additional offenses requiring 90-day suspensions. This is on top \nof existing penalties already in the Horse Protection Act. For a first \ntime offense a person could spend one-year in jail and also pay a $3000 \nfine. For a second or future offense a person could spend two-years in \njail and also pay a fine of $5000.\n  Lastly, the legislation creates four-year term limits for board \nmembers of the horse industry organization that would oversee \ninspections.\n  We can end the contemptible practice of illegal soring without \nshutting down the century-old tradition of the Tennessee Walking Horse. \nI urge my colleagues to carefully consider this legislation and the \nbalanced approach it provides.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRUZ:\n  S. 2195. A bill to deny admission to the United States to any \nrepresentative to the United Nations who has engaged in espionage \nactivities against the United States, poses a threat to United States \nnational security interests, or has engaged in a terrorist activity \nagainst the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to an \nextraordinarily dangerous situation that our country faces under \ncurrent law, which allows no terrorists to be granted visas to the \nUnited States under the cover of being ambassadors to the United \nNations.\n  The President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hasan Ruhani, has \nrecently announced that Hamid Aboutalebi is his new ambassador to the \nU.N., which is, of course, headquartered in Manhattan, NY, and a visa \napplication has been duly filed. In most cases--indeed, until now, in \nall cases--such applications for ambassadors have been granted in \naccordance with article 13 of the United Nations charter, but Mr. \nAboutalebi's is a special case, as he was a member of The Muslim \nStudents following the Imam's Line, the group who held 52 Americans \nhostage in Tehran for 444 days from 1979 to 1981. He protests that his \ninvolvement was limited to translation and negotiation, but he was \nsufficiently involved for the Muslim Students organization, which is \nstill active, to feature to this day his photo on their official Web \nsite celebrating that historic outrage against the United States of \nAmerica. Now the Obama administration is considering granting this \nperson a visa to come to the United States. I have to wonder--as did \nCIA Director Stansfield Turner in the movie ``Argo''--you don't have a \nbetter bad idea than this?\n  It is unconscionable that in the name of international diplomatic \nprotocol, the United States would be forced to host a foreign national \nwho showed a brutal disregard of the status of diplomats when they were \nstationed in his country. This person is an acknowledged terrorist.\n  In his January 23, 1980, State of the Union Address, then-President \nJimmy Carter called the hostages ``innocent victims of terrorism'' and \ntheir captivity an act of ``international terrorism.'' I do not believe \nthat anyone--beyond perhaps the Supreme Leader in Tehran--has debated \nPresident Carter's characterization since then, nor do I think I have \never agreed more emphatically with President Carter.\n  It is therefore necessary to amend the statute that currently gives \nthe President the discretion to reject an applicant on the ground that \nhe or she, as it currently states, has engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States and poses a national security threat.\n  The legislation I am introducing, S. 2195, will require the President \nto deny a U.N.-related applicant a visa if the President determines the \napplicant has engaged in terrorist activity against the United States, \nhas engaged in espionage against the United States, or poses a national \nsecurity threat to the United States.\n  I will note that I very much appreciated the kind comments and the \nimpassioned support for this legislation from the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  This legislation speaks to the larger issue of whom we have to let \ninto this country. How would we feel, for example, if the Taliban had \nsent Osama bin Laden to be an ambassador to the United Nations from \nAfghanistan or how would we feel if some other country sent an \nambassador who was complicit in the terrorist attack that murdered 220 \nmarines, 18 sailors, and 3 soldiers in Beirut in 1983 or how would we \nfeel if another country sent as an ambassador someone who was complicit \nin the terrorist attack on Khobar Towers that murdered 19 airmen in \n1996, to name but a few potential examples? None of these examples \nwould necessarily meet the current statutory requirement of having \nengaged in espionage. They murdered or kidnapped or tortured innocent \nAmericans, but they didn't necessarily engage in a specific act of \nespionage. But all unequivocally should be excluded. This legislation \nwould ensure that such people can never use the United Nations to gain \nentry into the United States.\n  I had intended this afternoon to ask the Senate for unanimous consent \nto pass this legislation to change the standard so that we could \nexclude a known terrorist from entry into this country. However, I am \npleased to report that I have been told there is a real possibility of \nbipartisan cooperation on this--a real possibility that both sides of \nthe aisle will work together to expeditiously change this law\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\nso we can keep this known terrorist out of the United States. I am \nencouraged by that possibility of cooperation. I hope it comes to \nfruition. And I hope this week we see the Senate act in a bipartisan \nway and in a unanimous way to change this law to exclude this known \nterrorist.\n  I wish to make a broader point. This nomination is willfully, \ndeliberately insulting and contemptuous. It is not an accident that \nRuhani picked a known terrorist who held Americans hostage to send to \nour country. I would suggest that this action should serve as a wake-up \ncall that the regime in Tehran is directed by the same policies that \nresulted in the hostage crisis in the first place.\n  There has been considerable optimism expressed by the Obama \nadministration in the months following the election of President Ruhani \nthat Iran is somehow softening its position toward the West, that \nRuhani is somehow a moderate and is acting as a good-faith partner in \nits negotiations over its nuclear program. This nomination should \ndispel those illusions. And the professed optimism of this \nadministration flies in the face of reason.\n  On the eve of the first round of these talks in November, the \nRevolutionary Guard transferred American pastor Saeed Abedini, unjustly \nincarcerated simply for professing his Christian faith, from the Evan \nPrison to the even more brutal Rajai Shahr Prison, carefully selecting \nthe date of that transfer to be the anniversary of the hostage crisis--\nwhat they call ``Death to America'' day in Iran.\n  After the joint plan of action was agreed to in late November, which \none of our closest allies has rightly assessed as a ``very, very bad \ndeal''--a historic mistake--President Ruhani triumphantly tweeted--in \nEnglish, no less--that in the Geneva agreement, ``world powers had \nsurrendered to Iran's will.'' These are hardly the words of a friend.\n  Last February the Iranian Government released a statement declaring \nthat the Nation of Israel is ``a cancerous tumor that must be \nremoved.'' These are not the words of a rational negotiating partner.\n  The choice of Mr. Aboutalebi for ambassador to the United Nations \nonce again demonstrates that the same militant hatred of America that \nhas dominated Iran's foreign policy since the revolution continues to \nflourish unabated. Indeed, there is a reason Iran refers to Israel as \nthe ``Little Satan'' and America as the ``Great Satan.''\n  It is astonishing, it is dismaying, it is dangerous that the \nadministration continues to engage in these talks given the clear and \nconsistent message of hostility coming out of Tehran.\n  The legislation I am introducing will take the first step by \nestablishing that there are no circumstances under which the \nperpetrators of the hostage crisis--those who have committed overt acts \nof war against America--will be welcomed into the United States. This \naction should be followed by the President suspending the Geneva \nnegotiations unless and until Iran not only ceases this behavior but \nalso ceases all enrichment activities and dismantles their nuclear \nprogram in its entirety. Then and only then should there be meaningful \ndialogue between our two countries.\n  In 1979 our citizens had to wait more than a year--during which they \nwere tortured by their captors--before they were finally released on \nJanuary 20, 1981--not coincidentally on the very day on which Ronald \nReagan was inaugurated as President.\n  I am encouraged at the prospect of bipartisan cooperation so that we \ncan stand together as a unanimous Senate against allowing a known \nterrorist into the United States who has participated in acts of war \nagainst our Nation. We should not extend the ordeal of those hostages \neven further by tolerating this most recent outrage on the part of \nIran.\n  One of the former hostages, Barry Rosen, called the possibility that \nthe United States might grant the visa application a ``disgrace,'' and \nhe said, ``It may be [setting] a precedent but if the President and \nCongress don't condemn this act by the Islamic Republic, then our \ncaptivity and suffering at the hands of Iran was for nothing.''\n  I believe it is well worth setting a precedent to show the world that \nwhatever smiling mask is on the other side of the table in Geneva, the \ntrue face of Tehran remains the terrorist who took our people hostage \n35 years ago, whom they are now attempting to send to America under the \nauspices of being an ambassador. Instead, I believe we should stand \ntogether in saying that a known terrorist who has carried out acts of \nwar against America will, in Mr. Rosen's words, ``never set foot on \nAmerican soil.'' I hope we can stand together behind this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/01/senate-section/article/S1937-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 408--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF APRIL AS \n                    ``PARKINSON'S AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Johanns, and \nMs. Isakson) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency has systematically \n     distorted the true impact of regulations promulgated by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) on job creation by using incomplete \n     analyses to assess effects on employment, primarily as a \n     result of the Environmental Protection Agency failing to take \n     into account the cascading effects of a regulatory change \n     across interconnected industries and markets nationwide;\n       (2) despite the Environmental Protection Agency finding \n     that the impact of certain air pollution regulations will \n     result in net job creation, implementation of the air \n     pollution regulations will actually require billions of \n     dollars in compliance costs, resulting in reduced business \n     profits and millions of actual job losses;\n       (3)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``National Emission \n     Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-\n     Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards \n     of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, \n     Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-\n     Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units'' (77 Fed. \n     Reg. 9304 (Feb. 16, 2012)) estimated that implementation of \n     the final rule would result in the creation of 46,000 \n     temporary construction jobs and 8,000 net new permanent jobs; \n     but\n       (B) a private study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, \n     using a ``whole economy'' model, estimated that \n     implementation of the final rule described in subparagraph \n     (A) would result in a negative impact on the income of \n     workers in an amount equivalent to 180,000 to 215,000 lost \n     jobs in 2015 and 50,000 to 85,000 lost jobs each year \n     thereafter;\n       (4)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``Federal \n     Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine \n     Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP \n     Approvals'' (76 Fed.

ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency has systematically \n     distorted the true impact of regulations promulgated by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) on job creation by using incomplete \n     analyses to assess effects on employment, primarily as a \n     result of the Environmental Protection Agency failing to take \n     into account the cascading effects of a regulatory change \n     across interconnected industries and markets nationwide;\n       (2) despite the Environmental Protection Agency finding \n     that the impact of certain air pollution regulations will \n     result in net job creation, implementation of the air \n     pollution regulations will actually require billions of \n     dollars in compliance costs, resulting in reduced business \n     profits and millions of actual job losses;\n       (3)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``National Emission \n     Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-\n     Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards \n     of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, \n     Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-\n     Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units'' (77 Fed. \n     Reg. 9304 (Feb. 16, 2012)) estimated that implementation of \n     the final rule would result in the creation of 46,000 \n     temporary construction jobs and 8,000 net new permanent jobs; \n     but\n       (B) a private study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, \n     using a ``whole economy'' model, estimated that \n     implementation of the final rule described in subparagraph \n     (A) would result in a negative impact on the income of \n     workers in an amount equivalent to 180,000 to 215,000 lost \n     jobs in 2015 and 50,000 to 85,000 lost jobs each year \n     thereafter;\n       (4)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``Federal \n     Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine \n     Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP \n     Approvals'' (76 Fed.

ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAINING.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Entrepreneurial Training Improvement Act of 2014''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Entrepreneurship represents an important part of the \n     economic recovery. According to the 2012 Kauffman Index of \n     Entrepreneurial Activity, adults in the United States created \n     an average of 543,000 new businesses each month in 2011, \n     among the highest levels of entrepreneurship in the last 16 \n     years.\n       (2) Of the estimated 27,500,000 small businesses in the \n     United States, 21,400,000 had no employees in 2008, according \n     to the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration.\n       (3) According to a January 2010 report entitled ``Think \n     Entrepreneurs: A Call to Action'' prepared by the Consortium \n     for Entrepreneurship Education for the Employment and \n     Training Administration of the Department of Labor, \n     ``Entrepreneurship is not well established in Federal and \n     statewide policy and execution strategies.'' The report \n     continues to state that Workforce Investment Board staff \n     ``lacks information and training about self-employment as a \n     career option, including accessibility to resources, \n     technical assistance, outreach efforts, available \n     partnerships, assessment processes, and coordination of \n     available funding options'' and that the Boards report that \n     ``self-employment outcomes are hard to document for \n     [Department of Labor] regulations; entrepreneurship does not \n     fit into current methods for measuring performance.''\n       (4) In Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 12-10, \n     issued November 15, 2010, the Employment and Training \n     Administration noted that ``Certain types of employment, \n     particularly self-employment, are generally not covered by \n     state [unemployment insurance] wage records, and the system \n     has noted this as a challenge in providing entrepreneurship \n     training. However, supplemental data options for some \n     performance measures, combined with performance target \n     negotiations, offer flexibility to accommodate \n     entrepreneurship training within the workforce system.''\n       (5) There are many existing supplemental data sources and \n     authorities that can be used to better measure the success of \n     an entrepreneurial training program.\n       (6) All reasonable effort should be made by the Secretary \n     of Labor to reduce regulatory barriers and disincentives that \n     discourage local workforce investment boards from offering \n     entrepreneurial training programs.\n       (c) Rulemaking.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall establish \n     alternate standards for measuring the progress of State and \n     local performance for entrepreneurial training services, as \n     authorized in section 134(d)(4)(D)(vi) of the Workforce \n     Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2864(d)(4)(D)(vi)), and \n     provide the State and local workforce investment boards with \n     specific guidance on successful approaches to collecting \n     performance information on entrepreneurial training services.\n       (2) Considerations.--In determining the alternate \n     standards, the Secretary shall consider using standards \n     based, for participants in such services, on--\n       (A) obtaining a State license, or a Federal or State tax \n     identification number, for a corresponding business;\n       (B) documenting income from a corresponding business; or\n       (C) filing a Federal or State tax return for a \n     corresponding business.\n       (3) Authorities.--In determining the alternate standards, \n     the Secretary shall consider utilizing authorities granted \n     under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801 et \n     seq.), including a State's waiver authority, as authorized in \n     section 189(i)(4) of such Act (29 U.S.C. 2939(i)(4)).\n       (4) Report.--The Secretary shall prepare a report on the \n     progress of State and local workforce investment boards in \n     implementing new programs of entrepreneurial training \n     services and any ongoing challenges to offering such \n     programs, with recommendations on how best to address those \n     challenges.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) the objective described in paragraph (1) has been \n     attained, and the Interstate System connecting all States is \n     near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the perceptions of the Federal Government on \n     what is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. _03. FUNDING LIMITATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines for any of fiscal \n     years 2015 through 2019 that the aggregate amount required to \n     carry out transportation programs and projects under this \n     title and amendments made by this title exceeds the estimated \n     aggregate amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for \n     those programs and projects for the fiscal year, each amount \n     made available for that program or project shall be reduced \n     by the pro rata percentage required to reduce the aggregate \n     amount required to carry out those programs and projects to \n     an amount equal to that available for those programs and \n     projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. _04.

PROHIBITION ON ENERGY TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) on June 25, 2013, President Obama issued a Presidential \n     memorandum directing the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to issue regulations relating to power \n     sector carbon pollution standards for existing coal fired \n     power plants;\n       (B) the issuance of that memorandum circumvents Congress \n     and the will of the people of the United States;\n       (C) any action to control emissions of greenhouse gases \n     from existing coal fired power plants in the United States by \n     mandating a national energy tax would devastate major sectors \n     of the economy, cost thousands of jobs, and increase energy \n     costs for low-income households, small businesses, and \n     seniors on fixed income;\n       (D) joblessness increases the likelihood of hospital \n     visits, illnesses, and premature deaths;\n       (E) according to testimony on June 15, 2011, before the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate by \n     Dr. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins University, ``The \n     unemployment rate is well established as a risk factor for \n     elevated illness and mortality rates in epidemiological \n     studies performed since the early 1980s. In addition to \n     influences on mental disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and \n     alcoholism, unemployment is also an important risk factor in \n     cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life \n     expectancy.'';\n       (F) according to the National Center for Health Statistics, \n     ``children in poor families\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\n     were four times as likely to be in fair or poor health as \n     children that were not poor'';\n       (G) any major decision that would cost the economy of the \n     United States millions of dollars and lead to serious \n     negative health effects for the people of the United States \n     should be debated and explicitly authorized by Congress, not \n     approved by a Presidential memorandum or regulations; and\n       (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make United \n     States energy as clean as practicable, as quickly as \n     practicable, without increasing the cost of energy for \n     struggling families, seniors, low-income households, and \n     small businesses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that--\n       (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-income households, \n     and small businesses do not experience skyrocketing \n     electricity bills and joblessness;\n       (B) to protect the people of the United States, \n     particularly families, seniors, and children, from the \n     serious negative health effects of joblessness;\n       (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to develop and \n     authorize an appropriate mechanism to address the energy \n     needs of the United States and the potential challenges posed \n     by severe weather; and\n       (D) to restore the legislative process and congressional \n     authority over the energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not \n     promulgate any regulation relating to power sector carbon \n     pollution standards or any substantially similar regulation \n     on or after June 25, 2013, unless that regulation is \n     explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n                           TITLE II--PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 2201.
