Mr. President, it is often said that actions have \nconsequences, and that is an understatement, but in the Senate inaction \nalso has consequences. My Republican colleagues are very effective at \ncreating gridlock in this body--at preventing the Senate from doing its \njob. While this type of obstruction may serve Republicans' political \npurposes, it does not serve this country's purposes generally; that is \nfor sure. It may serve the Republicans' political purposes, but it does \nnot in any way lead to something that is good for the country's \npurposes.\n  On Friday I received a letter, as did the Republican leader, from \nSecretary of State John Kerry. John Kerry is someone who understands \nthe Senate, having served here for a quarter of a century. After a year \nat the State Department, more than a third of Secretary Kerry's \nleadership team remains vacant--1 year and it remains vacant. Four of \nhis six under secretaries have yet to be confirmed, and 58 State \nDepartment nominees are pending before the Senate. In just that one \ndepartment, that one cabinet slot, we have 64 spots that are left \nfloating around out there someplace. This is unacceptable. At a time \nwhen our Nation needs a robust presence abroad, the Senate is stuck. \nThe State Department cannot afford for a third of its leadership \npositions to be vacant. It is not good for the State Department, it is \nnot good for our country, and it is not good internationally.\n  This is what Secretary Kerry said, among other things, in the letter \nhe wrote to us:\n\n       It is not an overstatement that today so many critical \n     national security positions are still awaiting confirmation \n     that it is now affecting our ability to do the nonpartisan \n     work of American foreign policy; defend the security of our \n     Nation, promote our values, protect our interests and help \n     our businesses compete overseas, which creates jobs for \n     Americans. Simply stated, the backlog in confirmation of \n     State Department nominees is impacting our national security \n     and weakening America's role in the world.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate's inaction, its failure to carry out its \nduty to advise and consent, has consequences.\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\nWhy are we not moving forward? It is because of obstruction by the \nRepublicans in the Senate.\n  Under the adept leadership of Chairman Menendez, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee is expected to report out at least 31 State \nDepartment nominees this week. Many of those nominations were made \nmonths ago and returned to the President at the end of the first \nsession of the 113th Congress. Why were they returned? Because of \nobstruction of the Republicans.\n  It is incumbent upon the Senate to promptly consider all nominees, \nand in particular the vital nominees who will protect our national \nsecurity and our role as a world leader. Unfortunately, Republicans \nhave made it difficult and time consuming to confirm any nominee no \nmatter how essential or how noncontroversial. If the Senate can't even \nfill its constitutional duties, how can we hope to engage in a robust \namendment process?\n  We waste so much time trying to get simple nominations done. They \ncomplain about not having amendments. In this last work period, Mr. \nPresident, we spent weeks eating up time that meant nothing to anyone.\n  The same Republicans who wasted months of the Senate's time last year \nare now bitterly complaining that the Senate does not spend enough time \nconsidering amendments. Every hour Republicans force us to spend \nwatching the clock, waiting to confirm nominees, to vote procedural \nmotions before even beginning debate on legislation, is an hour we \ncould have spent debating and voting on amendments.\n  We cannot have the extension of emergency unemployment insurance be \nbogged down by a raft of political amendments. Republicans are so \nobsessed with taking pot shots at the Affordable Care Act and staging \npolitical stunt votes that they are willing to derail a bill that will \nhelp 1.4 million out-of-work Americans. We can't allow that. It is \nunfair.\n  Still, the complaints of the minority have not fallen on deaf ears.\n  First my Republican colleague said they would not vote for an \nextension of unemployment benefits unless it was fully offset. I \ncompromised. It is fully paid for in the bill before this body.\n  Next my Republican colleagues said they would not vote for this \nlegislation unless it enacted real reforms for the unemployment \ninsurance program. I agreed. That is in the bill before the body.\n  Now many of my Republican colleagues say they will turn their backs \non Americans who have been out of work for months and months unless \nthey have an opportunity to vote on amendments to this bill. Although I \nwonder what Republicans will demand next, I am willing to do what it \ntakes to protect middle-class workers struggling to find jobs. So \nreasonable amendments, a reasonable number, relevant amendments, of \ncourse we would be happy to take a look at that. I would be happy to do \nthat. We have Tuesday caucuses every week. I will go over this with my \ncaucus in some detail. But my Republican colleagues can't take yes for \nan answer. If they insist on swamping this important measure with \nextraneous political amendments, it will be clear they never wanted to \nextend unemployment in the first place.\n  If Republicans are serious about offering relevant amendments to \nstrengthen and improve this bill, I am willing to sit down and talk \nabout it. I am willing to allow votes on these amendments. However, I \nam not going to allow this legislation to be bogged down, as I have \nindicated, by meaningless votes or derailed by another doomed crusade \nto strip millions of Americans of the affordable care they have now. \nAnd once Republicans get the amendment votes they want, I hope they \nwill give 1.4 million out-of-work Americans the vote they want and \nneed.\n  My Republican colleagues should remember that a final vote on this \nlegislation--a vote for middle-class men and women who desperately want \nto work and desperately need help--is the only vote that really \nmatters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S268-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend the majority leader is \ntalking about the crush of nominations. Of course, the reason we have a \ncrush of nominations is because of the decision of the majority to \nbreak the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate last \nyear, which produced the inevitable, entirely predictable consequence \nof sending an enormous number of nominations back down to the \nadministration at the end of the session.\n  So the decision of the majority to run roughshod over the minority \nhas a lot of consequences, one of which is pretty clear already: that \nit didn't streamline the nomination process as it was sold to the \nminority to do. It only made it more difficult.\n  On another matter, I would like to say a word about unemployment \ninsurance.\n  The reason for the holdup should be pretty obvious at this point. \nRepublicans have a lot of good ideas on how to pay for this extension. \nWe also have a lot of proposals for getting at the root of the problem, \nproposals that would make it easier for folks who are struggling in \nthis economy to actually find stable and fulfilling work or get \nretrained so they can find good jobs. That is a goal on which I expect \nwe could all agree.\n  Unfortunately, up until the weekend the majority leader wasn't \nterribly interested in any of these ideas. He only seemed to want to \nextend the program without really paying for it, without doing much of \nanything to help private sector job creation, and without creating \nopportunities for targeted training that would help folks who are \ncurrently receiving unemployment assistance actually find a job.\n  So I think this is unfortunate. There is clearly no shortage of \ncreative, constructive proposals out there which speak to the \nunderlying problems, which speak to the urgent need to create more \nstable, good-paying jobs, and which make sure we don't increase our \nalready out-of-control Federal debt. Some of these ideas actually come \nfrom Democrats. The Presiding Officer's senior Senator from Connecticut \nhas an idea to create a program that subsidizes employment for low-\nincome Americans so they aren't stuck in neutral while they search for \npermanent work. This is an idea which actually deserves debate and a \nvote.\n  As I have indicated in recent days, the majority leader should give \nother Senators more of a say in what we do around here, including \nmembers of his own conference. So hopefully his comments a few moments \nago and over the weekend are a sign that we may be able to work this \nout in a way that the Senate can function the way it used to, which was \nthat Members were able to actually offer amendments and get votes \nbefore we moved to final passage on important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S268-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Restoring Deliberation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator McConnell has made a very \nimportant call to restore the Senate as\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\nthe great deliberative body it was intended to be. I would like to \ncontinue to add my voice to that call. In fact, I am going to expand on \nsome observations I made previously before the Senate, I believe in the \nmonth of December last year.\n  The Senate is a unique body designed with a very unique purpose in \nmind. In the Federalist Paper 62, attributed to the father of the \nConstitution James Madison, the unique role of the Senate is explained \nthis way:\n\n       The necessity of a Senate is not less indicated by the \n     propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to \n     the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced \n     by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious \n     resolutions.\n\n  When Madison talks about ``factious leaders'' and ``intemperate and \npernicious resolutions,'' he basically means what we call partisanship \nand the ``my way or the highway'' approach to legislating all too \ncommon these days.\n  What might come as a shock to anyone who has followed the Senate \nlately is the fact that the Senate was specifically designed to check \npartisan passions and ensure that Americans of all stripes are fairly \nrepresented through a deliberative process. Clearly, the Senate is not \nfulfilling the role the Framers of the Constitution intended, in recent \nyears.\n  To find out what went wrong, we first have to examine how the Senate \nwas supposed to function. About this propensity of legislatures to be \ndominated by factious leaders acting intemperately, Madison goes on to \nsay:\n\n       Examples on this subject might be cited without number; and \n     from proceedings within the United States, as well as from \n     history of other nations.\n\n  Note that in advocating for the creation of a Senate to counter this \nnegative tendency, Madison references examples from proceedings within \nthe United States. Many State legislatures in the early days of our \nRepublic were unicameral, with frequent elections and weak executives. \nThis led to many instances where a temporary majority faction would \ngain control and quickly pass legislation that advantaged the majority \nat the expense of the minority.\n  The Senate has been called the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld because it was specifically designed to proceed at a measured \npace and to guarantee that the rights of the minority party be \nprotected.\n  James Madison wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10:\n\n       Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate \n     and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and \n     private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our \n     governments are too unstable, that the public good is \n     disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that \n     measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of \n     justice and the rights of the minority party, but by the \n     superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.\n\n  What is unique about the Senate is that the rules and traditions \nforce Senators to work together to prevent Madison's ``overbearing \nmajority'' from steamrolling the minority party. Because the rules of \nthe Senate are built around consensus, as opposed to the House of \nRepresentatives where the majority party dominates, it forces Senators \nof all parties to listen to each other and to work together. While that \nwas true most of my time in the Senate, it has changed in recent years. \nIf anyone wonders why the tone in Washington has become so heated \nrecently, the loss of the Senate as a deliberative body is certainly a \nbig factor.\n  There is an apocryphal story which may or may not be historically \naccurate but which certainly depicts how the Senate was intended to \nfunction. The story goes that when Jefferson returned from France, \nwhere he was serving during the Constitutional Convention, he asked \nGeorge Washington why the Senate had been created. Washington \nsupposedly replied by asking Jefferson, ``Why did you pour that tea \ninto your saucer?''\n  ``To cool it,'' Jefferson said.\n  Washington responded, ``Even so, we pour legislation into the \nsenatorial saucer to cool it.''\n  In the House of Representatives, the Rules Committee sets out the \nterms of debate for each bill. If you want to offer an amendment in the \nHouse, you have to go hat in hand to the Rules Committee and ask their \npermission. If the House leadership doesn't like your amendment, you \nare out of luck.\n  By contrast, the Senate has a tradition of allowing extensive debate \nand amendments by any Senator without prior approval from anybody. \nHowever, that tradition has gone out the window under the current \nmajority leadership. We have seen an unprecedented abuse of cloture \nmotions to cut off the deliberative process paired with a tactic called \nfilling the tree--blocking amendments from being considered. The Senate \nmajority leader has effectively become a one-man version of the House \nRules Committee, dictating which amendments will be debated and which \nones will never see the light of day. He has done so again on the \nunemployment bill currently before this Senate. In fact, he has been \nquite unashamed about saying he is not going to allow any amendments. \nThis strips the ability of individual Senators to effectively represent \ntheir State, regardless of political party. Blocking amendments also \nvirtually guarantees that any legislation the Senate votes on will be \nmore partisan in nature, violating the very purpose of the Senate \naccording to James Madison.\n  By empowering the majority leader at the expense of individual \nSenators, the people of the 50 States lose their voice in the Senate \nand party leaders get their way instead. The people of Iowa sent me to \nthe Senate to represent them, not to simply vote up or down on a purely \npartisan agenda dictated by the majority leader.\n  Everyone complains about the lack of bipartisanship these days, but \nthere is no opportunity for individual Senators to work together across \nthe aisle when legislation is drafted on a partisan basis and \namendments are blocked.\n  Bipartisanship requires giving individual Senators a voice, \nregardless of party. That is the only way to get things done in the \nSenate. In the last decade, when I was chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and Republicans controlled the Senate, we wanted to actually \nget things done. In order for that to happen, we knew we had to \naccommodate the minority, we had to have patience and humility and \nrespect for that minority--attributes that do not exist on the other \nside anymore. We had some major bipartisan accomplishments, from the \nlargest tax cut in history to the Medicare prescription drug program, \nto numerous trade agreements. Those kinds of major bills do not seem to \nhappen anymore.\n  The Senate rules provide that any Senator may offer an amendment \nregardless of party affiliation. Each Senator represents hundreds of \nthousands to, in the case of California, 36 million Americans, and each \nhas an individual right to offer amendments for consideration. The \nprinciple here is not about political parties having their say but duly \nelected Senators participating in the legislative process.\n  Again, as part of our duty to represent the citizens of our \nrespective States, each Senator has an individual right to offer \namendments. This right cannot be outsourced to party leaders. The \nlongstanding tradition of the Senate is that Members of the minority \nparty as well as rank-and-file Members of the majority party have an \nopportunity to offer amendments and get votes in the Senate.\n  The now-routine practice of filling the tree to block amendments has \nbeen a major factor in the destruction of the Senate as a deliberative \nbody. This is usually combined with filing cloture to cut off further \nconsideration of a bill, which has occurred to a truly unprecedented \nextent. In a deliberative body, debates and amendments are essential, \nso cloture should be rare. Abuse of cloture strikes to the very heart \nof how the Senate is intended to work.\n  It is important to note the majority leader has tried to pass off the \ncloture motions he has filed, which are attempts by the majority party \nto silence the minority party, as nothing but Republican filibusters. \nThere seems to have been a concerted attempt to confuse cloture motions \nwith filibusters. But the Washington Post fact checker has caught the \nmajority leader in this distortion, giving his claim of unprecedented \nRepublican filibusters two Pinocchios. In fact, a report by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service called ``Cloture Attempts on \nNominations: Data and Historical Development,'' written by Richard S.\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nBeth, contains an entire section entitled ``Cloture Motions Do Not \nCorrespond With Filibusters.''\n  The abuse of cloture, often combined with the blocking of amendments, \nprevents all Senators from doing what they were sent to do--not just \nMembers of the minority party. It has even gotten worse. Even where the \nmajority leader has decided he is going to be open to amendments, he \nhas created out of whole cloth new restrictions to limit Senators' \nrights.\n  First, he normally only opens the amendment process if there is an \nagreement to limit amendments. This is usually only a handful or so of \namendments. Then he has magically determined that only germane or \nrelevant amendments can be considered. Of course, nowhere do the Senate \nrules require amendments to be germane, other than postcloture. \nSenators elected in the last few years appear to be ignorant of that \nfact. We will hear some of my colleagues argue against an amendment \nsaying it is nongermane or nonrelevant. They have fallen totally for \nthe majority leader's creative rulemaking, thus giving up one of their \nrights as a Senator with which to represent their State.\n  I cannot count how many nongermane or nonrelevant amendments I had to \nallow votes on when I processed bills when Republicans were in charge. \nThey were usually tough political votes. But we took them because we \nwanted to get things done and that is the way the Senate operated. You \ndo not see that nowadays. The current majority avoids tough votes at \nall costs. If you wonder why things do not get done around here in the \nSenate, that is one of the reasons they do not get done.\n  The American people sent us to get the work done and to represent our \nconstituents and that means voting, not avoiding tough votes. We \nsometimes hear this is a question of majority rule versus minority \nobstruction. Again, that ignores that each Senator is elected to \nrepresent their State, not simply to be an agent of one of the \npolitical parties. There are policies that have majority support in the \nSenate that have been denied a vote. Understand, we have been denied \nvotes on amendments that even a majority of this Senate supports.\n  What happened during debate on a budget resolution proves my point. \nThe special rules of the budget resolution limit debate so it cannot be \nfilibustered, but it also allows for an unlimited number of amendments. \nA Republican amendment to the Senate Budget Committee in support of \nrepealing the tax on lifesaving medical devices in President Obama's \nhealth care law passed by an overwhelming 79-to-20 vote, with more than \nhalf of the Democrats voting with the Republicans rather than their \nparty leader.\n  We also had a Republican amendment in support of the approval of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline to bring oil from Canada, and that passed 62 to \n37. Votes such as these that split the Democrats and hand a win to \nRepublicans are exactly what the majority leader has been trying to \navoid by blocking those very same amendments on legislation. Of course, \nthat is probably the explanation of why we did not take up a budget \nresolution for more than 3 years prior to this year.\n  Until we put an end to the abuse of cloture and the blocking of \namendments, the Senate cannot function as James Madison and the Framers \nof the Constitution intended. We must bring back the Senate as a \ndeliberative body. Our politics today desperately need the cooling \nsaucer of the Senate, as George Washington described the Senate to \nJefferson. The action by the majority leader to make it easier to \nconsider nominations on a purely partisan basis went in the wrong \ndirection. In the face of bipartisan opposition and with no Republican \nvotes, the so-called nuclear option established a precedent, \neffectively overruling the rules on the books. A better move would be \nfor the Senate to establish the precedent that filling the tree and \nabusing cloture to block a full amendment process is illegitimate.\n  It is time to restore the Senate so it can fulfill its constitutional \nrole. Senator McConnell has made a thoughtful and well-reasoned appeal. \nI hope my colleagues will listen for the sake of this institution, for \nthe good of the country as a whole, and out of respect for the Framers \nof the Constitution who set up the Senate as a unique deliberative \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last week I said on the Senate floor \nthat serving in the Senate is becoming like being asked to join the \nGrand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing. Here is what I meant by \nthat. Take last week. The Democratic majority leader from Nevada \nbrought up unemployment compensation.\n  How do we help unemployed Americans go to work? I can't think of an \nissue more important to our country. All of us have ideas about how to \ndo this, but he brought up his idea. It hasn't been considered by a \ncommittee. When he put it on the floor, he cut off amendments, he cut \noff debate, and he cut off votes.\n  Soon we will be discussing minimum wage. How to increase family \nincomes in America is the foremost issue facing our country. We all \nhave ideas about that.\n  We were elected to deal with it. We have been in a long period of \nunemployment. We believe the economy is bad for a variety of reasons. \nWe--on this side--believe a big, wet blanket of rules and regulations \nhave been increased by the Obama administration. We want to debate \nthat. We want to talk about it. We don't believe the old idea of a \nminimum wage is the solution. We are for maximum new jobs and maximum \njob training and learning opportunities so people can get those jobs. \nWe want the economy to grow. We should be debating that. That is why we \nare here. But the Senator from Iowa, my good friend and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, said, No, we won't hear this in committee. There might be \nembarrassing amendments. So, unfortunately, insofar as the way the \nSenate functions, this year is beginning just as last year ended, and \nRepublicans objected to this.\n\n  Some of the news outlets wrote down--I read some of the stories this \nmorning--and they said, After a while, the Senate will begin to debate \ninternal procedure and process. Sometimes process is important. We have \nsomething called the U.S. Constitution. It is kind of old-fashioned. It \nhas a lot of process in it. In fact, it has a checks-and-balances \nsystem in it that is envied by the world. There are citizens all over \nthe world who would like to have a government that functions in the way \nours has for over two centuries. Process can be very important. In this \ncase, as the Republican leader often says, process and procedure are \nsubstance, because when we are not able to talk about unemployment \ncompensation, when we are not able to offer our ideas about how to help \nunemployed Americans go back to work, that is substance.\n  That is a central issue facing our country. We think we have better \nideas than the idea the majority leader put on the floor and we would \nlike to present those ideas on behalf of the people who elected us. We \nare not the important ones. We are all political accidents here--all \n100 of us. We all know that. We worked pretty hard to get here and we \nhad some luck to go along with it. What does that give us? Not just a \nchance to have our say, but to have a say on behalf of the people of \nTennessee, in my case. They want me to weigh in on the big issues \nbefore our country.\n  ObamaCare is one of the reasons so many people are unemployed. I am \nsure the other side doesn't want to talk about that. I wouldn't if I \nvoted for it. But I was in a room with the chief executive officer of a \nmajor restaurant company who told me that because of the new costs of \nObamaCare on his large company, they were going to start running their \nrestaurants with 75 employees instead of 90 employees. That doesn't \nsound like more jobs to me; that doesn't sound like help for unemployed \nAmericans.\n  This is the forum in which we debate these issues. So I suppose it \nmight be\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\nembarrassing for our friends on the other side to debate these issues, \nbut it shouldn't be. If they believe in them, they should want to stand \nup and defend the issues, just as strongly as we want to say our point \nof view. I suspect there are a good number of my Democratic friends who \nhave amendments they would like to offer on putting unemployed \nAmericans to work. They might wonder, How did I ever get to a U.S. \nSenate where I can't do that, just as someone might wonder in \nNashville, why did I join the Grand Ole Opry if they won't let me sing?\n  The majority leader's actions go to the very heart of our government. \nIt is not about internal procedure, it is not about process. It is \nabout the major issues facing our country.\n  Tennesseans didn't send me to Washington to rubberstamp the majority \nleader's ideas--not this majority leader or any majority leader. \nTennesseans sent me here to represent them and to advocate their point \nof view and to give them a say on ObamaCare, on balancing the budget, \non fixing the deficit, on helping unemployed Americans find jobs, on \ndealing with wages, on raising family incomes. That is why I am here. \nThat is my job. And they expect me to have a chance to have not my say \nbut their say on the issues that face the American people. By his \nactions, the majority leader is destroying the Senate, which was once \ndescribed as ``the one touch of authentic genius in the American \npolitical system.''\n  There is a new book out which I mentioned on the floor the other day. \nMy guess is it will become the leading history of this body. It is \nwritten by the former Senate Historian, Richard Baker, and the late \nNeil MacNeil, who wrote what many consider to be the best history of \nthe House of Representatives. They say in the book that the genius I \njust talked about--``the authentic touch of genius that is the \nSenate''--the major reason for that is the opportunity for extended \ndebate.\n  They point out, as I think any of us would, that there have been \nabuses with the filibuster, more delays than are necessary; that the \nSenate doesn't work as well as it should not just over the last few \nyears but over a long period of time. But the fact is, in this body, \nwhich is virtually unique in the world in requiring that 60 of 100 \nMembers must agree before we cut off debate, that helps forge \nconsensus. That helps forge consensus, as we did on the student loan \nagreement earlier this year. There is a good example of a good debate, \nof different opinions on both sides of the aisle, of Democrats and \nRepublicans working together. When we finally got to 60 or 65, we got a \nresult with the Republican House of Representatives and the Democratic \nPresident going along with us, and it was a victory for the students of \nthis country. We cut in half the interest rates they pay and took the \nwhole argument out of a political football.\n  The Senate was created for three reasons. The first is to encourage \nand forge consensus. We govern a complex society with consensus, not \nwith ramrodding partisan ideas through one body or the other. We have a \nbody for that; it is called the House of Representatives. Win it by one \nvote--the Rules Committee has two times as many members of the majority \nas the minority, and the majority can pass anything they want to pass. \nSend it over here, and the tradition has been to slow it down and cool \nit off. We take a second look.\n  The passions of the democracy--what de Touqueville called in his trip \nacross America in the early 1800s--the great danger he saw to our \ncountry was the tyranny of the majority. He saw that as one of the two \ngreat dangers to the American democracy. And the Senate has been, \nthrough all that period of time, the guardian--the guardian of minority \nrights, the guardian against the excesses of the Executive, which in \nour country is the President. The Founders didn't want a king, so they \nset up this elaborate system of checks and balances, and the Senate is \nthe key to that.\n  What is different about the Senate is the opportunity for extended \ndebate. But, the Majority Leader now brings up a bill--one Senator's \nidea--cuts off debate, cuts off amendments, cuts off votes, that is it. \nThat is not the way to govern our country, particularly on an issue of \nhow do we put unemployed Americans back to work.\n  The Senate is losing its capacity to do the things it was created to \ndo in the following ways: No. 1, less advice and consent. On November \n21, the Democratic majority decided 60 votes are no longer needed to \ncut off debate on most Presidential nominees. So try asking a nominee: \nWill the National Security Agency stop monitoring the Pope? Now there \nwill be no response, because the majority can ram through nominees.\n  The Senator from Nevada, the distinguished majority leader, said in \n2006--I heard him and he put it in his book--that cutting off--allowing \nthe majority to cut off debate would be the end of the Senate. The end \nof the Senate. Apparently, he changed his mind.\n\n  Operating without rules. The distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, said on November 21: ``A Senate in which a majority can \nchange the rules at any time is a Senate without rules.'' It is as if \nthe Red Sox, finding themselves behind in the ninth inning in the World \nSeries, added a couple of innings to make sure they won. When he wrote \nthe Senate rules, Thomas Jefferson said it is not so important what the \nrule is, but that there be a rule.\n  Ignoring Executive orders. While it ignores its own rules, the Senate \nmeekly watches as the Obama administration changes the health care law, \nsuspends immigration laws, and rewrites labor laws.\n  Tolerating more czars. President Obama has appointed more czars than \nthe Romanovs did. In both Russia and the United States, czars don't \nreport to elected representatives.\n  Not passing appropriations bills. Hopefully, that is going to change. \nBut the Senate's repeated failure to pass appropriations bills canceled \nthe Senate's check on the Executive's power to spend.\n  Illegal recess appointments. That is being debated today in the \nSupreme Court. The majority acquiesced when President Obama used his \nrecess appointment to appoint members to the National Labor Relations \nBoard when the Senate was not in recess. Fortunately, three appellate \ncourts disagreed with the President and the Supreme Court will decide. \nHopefully, the Supreme Court agrees with the appellate courts. \nOtherwise, the Senate might go out for lunch and return and find that \nwe have a new Supreme Court Justice.\n  There is blame to go around, and I am sure any of my friends on the \nother side who are listening would be quick to point that out. Baker \nand MacNeil pointed that out in their book. There have been abuses of \nthe filibuster. It is true that some Republicans have unduly delayed \nnominations and unduly delayed legislation. And that is not new. I have \nseen it in other years. I have pointed out on this floor how Senator \nAllen from Alabama, in the 1970s and 1980s, would tie the Senate into \nknots with his knowledge of the rules. Senator Metzenbaum from Ohio \nwould sit right down there on the front row and if a Senator wanted to \npass a bill, that Senator had to go see him, and if the Senator didn't \namend his bill to do what Senator Metzenbaum wanted done, he would use \nSenate rules to block it.\n  So this has never been an easy place to get something done, but it \nwasn't ever supposed to be. It was supposed to be a place where every \nsingle Senator is an equal, where every Senator's voice is not his or \nher voice but the voice of people that Senator represents. It is \nsupposed to be a place of extended debate where almost any amendment \ncan be discussed for almost any length of time, and usually the clock \nis all that would cut the debate off. But there has been a procedure by \nwhich a consensus can cut it off, and when we reach that consensus, we \nusually reach a result that can even pass unanimously after it has been \nmassaged and changed and worked through and considered.\n  I think of the legislation we just passed on compounding pharmacies \nand making drugs more safely; making drugs more safe, 4 billion \nprescriptions a year. It went through the committee process, through \nboth Houses, and eventually passed unanimously because we reached a \nconsensus.\n  The delays that have occurred on nominations because, so-called, of \nthe changes in rules on November 21 are hardly a crisis. Nonjudicial \nPresidential nominees have almost never\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\nbeen denied their seats by a filibuster. Before the November rules \nchange, there were two for President Obama, three for President Bush, \ntwo for President Clinton, and none before that, in history. That is \nseven. Only seven nonjudicial Presidential nominees, in the history of \nthe Senate, had ever been denied their seats by a filibuster. Maybe it \ntakes a while, but that is so we can ask questions.\n  The day before the rules were changed, I looked at the Executive \nCalendar--this calendar we have on our desks. It includes every single \nnomination that can be brought to the floor. If I have my numbers about \nright, there were not many people on the calendar. Half of them have \nbeen held up by the Senator from South Carolina who is trying to get \nsome answers on Benghazi. That has happened many times in this body. If \nSenators want an answer, they do that to make the Executive tell them \nwhat is going on. There were only 8 nominees, I believe, who had been \non the calendar for more than 9 weeks and only 16 others who have been \non for more than 3 weeks.\n  So there were not very many people on the Executive Calendar, and we \nhad changed the rules to make it easier to confirm them, anyway. There \nwere 13 district judges, so the majority leader could bring them up on \nThursday--Friday is the intervening day--and Monday there could be 2 \nhours of debate on each judge, and we could confirm four or five by \ndoing it over the weekend in that way. But, no, we had to change the \nrules in the way that it was done.\n  The Senate does not need a change of rules; it needs a change in \nbehavior. The current majority leader, I would respectfully suggest, \ncould start by following the example of Majority Leaders Robert Byrd, a \nDemocrat, and Howard Baker, a Republican, during the 1970s and 1980s. \nHere is how they would do things, and this is the way the Senate ran \nuntil 5 or 6 years ago. Baker and Byrd would bring legislation to the \nfloor. Usually they would go to a committee and say to a chairman: We \nwill put it on the floor if you and your ranking member of the other \nparty agree. So you would have two Members--a chairman and a Republican \nranking member; not the leaders--standing up there at the two desks. \nThey would put the bill on the floor that already had gotten a \nconsensus in the committee. Then, the majority leader would ask for \namendments to the bill, and sometimes he would get 300--300. Then, he \nwould ask consent to cut off the offering of amendments and to consider \nvoting on them in an orderly way, all of which was written out in the \nunanimous consent agreement. Of course, he would get the unanimous \nconsent to do that because everybody who wanted to offer an amendment \ncould.\n  Then they would go to work. They would start on Mondays, and they \nwould work into Monday night and on Tuesday and on Wednesday. They \nwould table many of the amendments. That does not take long: 10 minutes \nof debate and table it with 51 votes.\n  Senator Byrd said in his book that when the Panama Canal Treaty came \nup at a time when he was the majority leader and Baker was the \nRepublican leader, they had 192 amendments and reservations--many of \nthem killer amendments--but he allowed every one of them, and he \ndefeated every killer amendment. But he said: If we had not allowed \nthem, we never would have gotten the ratification of the Panama Canal \nTreaty. The Senators had their say on the Panama Canal Treaty.\n  So after a while, those 300 amendments that might have been offered \non Monday are whittled away. Some are accepted, some are dropped, some \nare voted on, some are tabled, and by about Thursday--the majority \nleader has said at the beginning of the week: We are going to finish \nthe bill this week--people are ready to go home. Then they begin to \nthink more carefully about whether their amendment is really that \nimportant. So they vote Thursday night, and they maybe vote Friday, and \nif they have to, they vote Saturday. But most of the time they finish \ntheir work on Friday.\n  They were not afraid, those majority leaders, to allow amendments. \nThey were not afraid to defeat amendments. I believe if the majority \nleader would allow the Senate to work in this way, he would not have \nany problem on this side of the aisle with efforts to keep bills from \ncoming to the floor. Almost all of the effort to keep bills from coming \nto the floor has to do with minority Members not being allowed to have \nthe say of the people who elected them to serve.\n  Instead, the majority leader has set records for bringing legislation \nto the floor without committee approval, cutting off amendments, and \nrecords for cutting off debate. So there are no votes on reforming \nmilitary sexual assaults, completing Yucca Mountain, sanctioning Iran, \nand other vital concerns, no votes on unemployment compensation or how \nto put unemployed America to work.\n  The Senate has become a Tuesday-Thursday club run by one Senator and \norchestrated by the White House. One reason this is tolerated is that \n43 Senators are in their first term--43 Senators are in their first \nterm--most of them in the majority. They have never served in the \nminority. They have never seen the Senate function properly, the way it \nfunctioned for most of its 200-plus year history.\n  Most importantly, those Senators in their first term may not have \nheard Senator Byrd's final address when, among other things, he said \nthat any majority leader could run the Senate under the then-existing \nrules. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, following \nmy remarks, an article from the Wall Street Journal from last Friday on \nthis subject.\n  In an important address last week, Mr. McConnell, the Senator from \nKentucky, the Republican leader, described three ways to restore the \nSenate: full committee consideration of bills; bills thoroughly \ndebated, with robust amendments on the floor; and a decent week's work. \nWe might work Monday through Friday instead of Tuesday through \nThursday.\n  The Senate could change overnight. It does not need a change of \nrules. The Senator from Kentucky did not say that it has always been \neasy to navigate the Senate. The ideal regular order never has and \nnever will be without exceptions. But what we call the regular order \nhas become the exception rather than the rule.\n  I would hope we do not wait until November or the next year to \nrestore the Senate to its proper place as the authentic piece of genius \nin the American government--the unique body, the unique senate in the \nworld because of the opportunity for extended debate. It could change \novernight by considering bills most of the time that went through \ncommittee, most of the time having a robust amendment process and \ndebate on those bills, and vote on them. If it took Monday through \nFriday to get that work done, then we should do it. Otherwise, the \ngreat issues facing our country--what kind of health care system do we \nhave? How do we help unemployed Americans go to work? How do we improve \nlearning opportunities in this new America, where so much is \ndecentralized and so much is on social media?\n  These are very exciting times. Daniel Boorstin, the former historian \nof the United States and Librarian of Congress, in his wonderful books \non America, used to talk about verges, that when America was at a \nverge--and we have been there many times in our history--that we were \nmore open to innovation, that we were more self-aware of where we were, \nthat we tended to rely on each other, and that we changed our country \nfor the better.\n  That is where we are today. We want better learning opportunities, \nbetter job training, better health care. Washington is in the way of \nmuch of that, and we need to debate how to change that.\n  So I would hope my friend, the distinguished majority leader, will \nlisten to what the Republican leader had to say and reflect on the many \nyears he has served here and realize all we are saying is we would like \nto have a say on behalf of the people who elected us on the great \nissues facing our country. Bring a bill through committee, bring it to \nthe floor, let us have debate--defeat our amendments; you should be \nable to with a tabling motion--and then let's come to a result.\n  I think the American people would gain much more confidence in the \nSenate because it would deserve more confidence if it conducted issues \nin that way. But this diminishing of the Senate is tragic for a country \nwith large problems to solve and whose system of checks and balances \nhas been envied around the world.\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 10, 2014]\n\n                      Harry Reid's Senate Shutdown\n\n                       (By Kimberley A. Strassel)\n\n       The popular judgment that Washington's dysfunction is the \n     result of ``partisanship'' misses a crucial point. Washington \n     is currently gridlocked because of the particular \n     partisanship of one man: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \n     And Republicans are warming to the power of making that case \n     to voters.\n       It's often said the 113th Congress is on track to become \n     the ``least productive'' in history--but that tagline \n     obscures crucial details. The Republican House in fact passed \n     more than 200 bills in 2013. Some were minor, and others drew \n     only GOP votes. But nearly a dozen were bipartisan pieces of \n     legislation that drew more than 250 Republicans and Democrats \n     to tackle pressing issues--jobs bills, protections against \n     cyberattack, patent reform, prioritizing funding for \n     pediatric research, and streamlining regulations for \n     pipelines.\n       These laws all went to die in Mr. Reid's Senate graveyard. \n     Not that the Senate was too busy to take them up. It passed \n     an immigration and a farm bill. Yet beyond those, and a few \n     items Mr. Reid was pressed to pass--the end-year sequester \n     accord; Hurricane Sandy relief--the Senate sat silent. It \n     passed not a single appropriations bill and not a single jobs \n     bill. Of the 72 (mostly token) bills President Obama signed \n     in 2013, 56 came from the House; 16 came from the chamber \n     held by his own party.\n       This is the norm in Mr. Reid's Senate, and for years he has \n     been vocally and cleverly blaming the chamber's uselessness \n     on Republican filibusters. This is a joke, as evidenced by \n     recent history. Mr. Reid took over the Senate in early 2007, \n     and it functioned just fine in the last two years of the Bush \n     administration. It didn't suddenly break overnight.\n       What did happen is the Senate Democrats' filibuster-proof \n     majority in the first years of the Obama administration--when \n     Mr. Reid got a taste for unfettered power--and then the GOP \n     takeover of the House in 2011. That is when the Senate broke, \n     as it was the point at which Mr. Reid chose to subvert its \n     entire glorious history to two of his own partisan aims: \n     Protecting his majority and acting as gatekeeper for the \n     White House.\n       Determined to protect his vulnerable members from tough \n     votes, the majority leader has unilaterally killed the right \n     to offer amendments. Since July, Republicans have been \n     allowed to offer . . . four. Determined to shield the \n     administration from legislation the president opposes, Mr. \n     Reid has unilaterally killed committee work, since it might \n     produce bipartisan bills. Similarly, he's refused to take up \n     bills that have bipartisan support like approving the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline, repealing ObamaCare's medical-device \n     tax, and passing new Iran sanctions.\n       Here's how the Senate ``works'' these days. Mr. Reid writes \n     the legislation himself, thereby shutting Republicans out of \n     the committee drafting. Then he outlaws amendments.\n       So yes, there are filibusters. They have become the GOP's \n     only means of protesting Mr. Reid's total control over what \n     is meant to be a democratic body. It isn't that the Senate \n     can't work; it's that Sen. Reid won't let it.\n       Pushed over the brink by Mr. Reid's November power play--\n     scrapping the filibuster for Obama nominees--Senate Minority \n     Leader Mitch McConnell began 2014 with a rip-roaring Senate-\n     floor speech. On Wednesday he set the record straight on the \n     Reid tactics that have created Senate dysfunction. He then \n     outlined how a GOP majority would restore regular order and \n     get Washington working. This is a ``debate that should be of \n     grave importance to us all,'' he said.\n       It's of growing importance to Republicans, who are taking \n     up this theme in speeches and media briefings--putting \n     greater attention on Mr. Reid's singular role in Washington \n     paralysis. Asked this week whether the GOP would be allowed \n     to amend an unemployment-benefits bill, Sen. John McCain \n     quipped: ``you'll have to go ask the dictator.'' Speaker John \n     Boehner, at a recent news conference, lamented the ``dozens'' \n     of House bills that ``await action in the Senate,'' while \n     Majority Leader Eric Cantor berated Mr. Reid for sitting on \n     ``bipartisan'' jobs legislation.\n       This brings to mind Republican Sen. John Thune's 2004 \n     defeat of South Dakota's Tom Daschle, which he did partly by \n     highlighting Mr. Daschle's obstructionist majority-leader \n     record. The comparison isn't perfect, since Mr. Daschle was \n     up for re-election (Mr. Reid is not) and since the \n     obstructionism was more noticeable at a time when the GOP ran \n     both the House and White House. Then again, the Reid theme is \n     the sort that will resonate with the GOP grass roots, \n     refocusing their efforts on a Senate victory.\n       In an election that is going to be about ObamaCare, \n     Republican Senate candidates are already reminding voters \n     that it was Mr. Reid's Senate abuse that created the law. And \n     in the wake of the shutdown and endless government-created \n     ``crises,'' more Americans are worried about the state of \n     Washington institutions, and eager for change.\n       ``Process'' arguments are hard to make to voters, but Mr. \n     Reid is a face for the process problem. Demoting Harry Reid \n     won't in itself fix Washington. But it would be a grand \n     start--and that alone makes it a potentially powerful \n     campaign theme.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are currently debating yet another \nextension to the emergency unemployment compensation program. While \nthere are differences of opinion in this Chamber about this particular \nprogram, I think we would all agree that the fact we are even having \nthis debate is unfortunate.\n  Make no mistake, our Nation continues to face difficulties when it \ncomes to job growth, labor force participation, and long-term \nunemployment, as has been the case throughout the Obama administration. \nUnder this administration, it has been harder to find a job than at any \nother point in our Nation's recent history.\n  But let's be clear about something. The plight of the long-term \nunemployed is not the major problem facing America today. It is, \ninstead, just a symptom of a much larger problem.\n  That larger problem is the fact that despite the efforts of many of \nus here in Congress, our government has not done enough to promote \neconomic growth in this country. Far too often, our government has \ninterfered in ways that have stunted growth and prevented a robust \nrecovery from taking place.\n  Five years into his Presidency, it is clear that President Obama does \nnot have a plan to address these problems. Surely, he has a list of \nways that he would like to expand the government and redistribute \nincome but nothing resembling a plan to promote private-sector job \ngrowth. Instead, he has a political plan of attack, and this debate \nover unemployment insurance is part of that attack plan.\n  Over the last 5 years we have seen a series of big-government \n``solutions'' that have all failed to produce real economic results.\n  The administration pushed through the supposed temporary stimulus, \nwhich ended up being little more than a laundry list of longtime \nDemocratic Party policy priorities that had little or nothing to do \nwith actually stimulating the economy. The administration also decided \nto devote its attention to expanding the alphabet soup of financial \nregulators, while failing to address factors that were at the heart of \nthe recent financial crisis.\n  Lacking ideas of its own, the Obama administration created and turned \nto a Jobs Council to try to understand private job creation, only to \nlater dissolve the council while not having instituted any meaningful \npolicies to create jobs.\n  The largest and most intrusive big-government edict we received from \nthe administration and its allies in Congress is, of course, ObamaCare. \nOn a daily basis, the American people continue to suffer from the \nimpact of this very misguided law.\n  People have lost their jobs or have been moved into part-time work. \nPeople have been forced off their health care plans. People have been \nforced, under fear of penalty, to purchase insurance coverage they do \nnot want or need. People have had their private and financial \ninformation put at risk thanks to the lack of security in the ObamaCare \nexchanges, and perhaps worst of all, people have seen the cost of their \nhealth care go up across the board.\n  ObamaCare is the worst in a series of bad economic policies we have \nseen since this President came into office.\n  The results speak for themselves. At the beginning of a new year, we \nsee very clearly what the President and his Democratic allies in \nCongress plan to do about all of this. The answer is nothing. Instead \nof working with us to enact projob and progrowth policies, they are \npicking fights with Republicans on issues such as unemployment \ninsurance. Instead of trying to root out the causes of our economic \nproblems, they are giving speeches vilifying anyone who might have a \ndifferent view on these issues.\n  As I said, President Obama and the Senate Democrats have no economic \nplan, only a political plan of attack. Let's consider this debate on \nunemployment compensation insurance for a moment. I think there are \nmany who would question why we did not have this debate about extending \nlong-term unemployment benefits sooner. Democrats knew that temporary \nFederal unemployment benefits for the long-term\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\nunemployed were scheduled to expire at the end of 2013. Yet they did \nnothing to try to extend them before now.\n  Contrary to what some of my colleagues on the other side seem to \nbelieve, Republicans do not run the Senate. We do not control the \ncommittees. We do not run things on the floor. As we are seeing in the \ncurrent debate over unemployment benefits, we do not even get a chance \nto offer amendments to many major pieces of legislation. Why is that? \nWhy is it that the greatest deliberative body in the world can no \nlonger offer amendments? It comes down to one thing--the Democratic \nleadership. They are afraid we might bring up amendments that are \ndifficult for Democrats to vote on. Join the crowd. That has always \nbeen the case around here before this current leadership took over.\n  Every leader has tried to protect their side, but this has gone to \nthe point of ridiculousness and the denigration of the Senate itself. \nThe Democrats could have offered an extension of Federal unemployment \nbenefits at any time before they expired in 2013. We could have debated \nthe merits of the emergency unemployment compensation program, \ndiscussed alternatives, and perhaps even come up with a bipartisan \ncompromise to help the long-term unemployed.\n  We could have even done that through regular order and using the \ncommittee process. But instead, Democrats ignored the program for an \nentire year, and in the very last days of the last congressional \nsession and after we had adjourned for the year, we finally started \nhearing about the desperate need to protect the long-term unemployed, \nabout how it was the highest priority for the President and Democrats \nin Congress to extend these benefits, and about those villainous \nRepublicans standing in the way.\n  There are only two conclusions to draw from this: Either the \nDemocrats forgot about unemployment benefits until the end of the year \nor they calculated it was better suited for their political attack plan \nto let them expire and then debate an extension afterward. I think it \nis pretty clear which conclusion is the correct one, especially since \nthey control the Senate and they control the committees. They could \nhave done just about anything they wanted.\n  So here we are debating another extension of the EUC Program, the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Program. We may as well be debating \nthe merits of using a bandaid on a broken arm because, as I said, long-\nterm unemployment is merely a symptom of the failures of the Obama \neconomy. However, since the Democrats opted to put off this matter \nuntil we were actually beyond the last minute, we have not enacted or \neven debated any serious alternatives to Federal unemployment benefits \nand we are left with just another take-it-or-leave-it proposition from \nthe majority leader.\n  That is what the majority leader seems to be saying to us. In fact, \nthat is what he is saying to us in this debate--take it or leave it. \nWhy would he do that? Apparently, no Republicans, not even the ones who \nsupported cloture on the motion to proceed, will get an opportunity to \noffer amendments. The only amendment we will be voting on is the so-\ncalled compromise amendment the majority leader offered last Thursday. \nOf course, the amendment is not a compromise at all. It is nothing of \nthe sort. Similar to the underlying bill it would add significantly to \nthe deficit. The supposed pay-fors in the amendment would not even kick \nin under the normal 10-year budget window. Indeed, the Democratic whip \nin the House was voicing concern about using so-called savings from \nextending the sequester outside of the 10-year window asking, \n``Frankly, if you adopt that logic, why don't we extend it until 2054 \nand fund everything we want to do?''\n  That is a dream some Democrats have. But fortunately there may be \nsome people on the other side who realize this is a charade. In short, \nthe amendment we will be voting on this afternoon, if we do, is a \ngimmick. It is designed solely to allow the majority to claim they are \nwilling to pay for extending unemployment benefits, nothing more, \nnothing less.\n  Once again, this is apparently the only amendment we will get a \nchance to vote on when it comes to extending the Emergency Unemployment \nInsurance Compensation Program, which is par for the course under the \ncurrent Senate majority. It is pretty clear what my colleagues in the \nmajority want to do. Contrary to their claims, passing this legislation \nand extending unemployment benefits is not their highest priority. \nTheir highest priority is to use the long-term unemployed as pawns in \ntheir political attacks on Republicans who support a different \napproach; one that is paid for, fairly paid for, honestly paid for, and \nunderstandably paid for.\n  If I am wrong and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nserious about wanting to extend this program, why would they not allow \nvotes on Republican amendments or even Democratic amendments? There are \nsome complaints on the Democratic side--even we the Democrats, they are \nsaying, do not have the privilege of bringing up amendments.\n  As we continue, the committees are a waste of time under the way the \nSenate is currently being run, because everything is run right out of \nthe leader's office. Republicans have offered a number of amendments to \nthe underlying legislation. Why not allow them to come up for a vote? \nAre they afraid we might pass some Republican amendments when they have \n55 Democrats in the Senate? If, as the majority leader has claimed, \nnone of our ideas is serious enough to warrant consideration, why not \nbring them up and let Democrats who have a majority in the Senate vote \nthem down? That could have been done.\n  The problem is they know some of these amendments are worthwhile, \nworthy amendments that might pass. It might cause some heartburn to \nsome on both sides maybe. I am certainly used to heartburn over the \nyears, I will tell you that.\n  Republicans have offered a number of amendments to the underlying \nlegislation. Why not allow them to come up for a vote? If, as the \nmajority leader has claimed, our ideas are not serious enough to \nwarrant consideration, why not allow them to be brought up, limit the \ntime for the debate, and let the Democrats, who once again have a \nmajority in the Senate, vote them down?\n  The only conclusion we can draw is that they are afraid, if we held a \nvote, some of our amendments might actually pass, which would distract \nfrom the political message they want to send with this debate on the \nfloor. The minority leader and I have offered such an amendment, one I \nbelieve would actually pass if it were to receive a vote.\n  It is something that makes a lot more sense than what is going on \nhere over the last number of days, weeks maybe. I would like to just \ntake a few minutes to talk about our amendment, the McConnell-Hatch \namendment. The McConnell-Hatch amendment would, if enacted, extend the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Program for a full year, taking \nunemployment benefits out of the 2014 political equation entirely. I \nwould think my colleagues on the other side would jump at that kind of \nopportunity. In addition to this fix on the unemployment insurance \nissue, the McConnell-Hatch amendment would fix the military pension \nproblems created under the recent budget agreement which has caused so \nmuch angst and heartburn among our military, among those who are \nserving our country in that manner.\n  There is bipartisan support for this endeavor. I believe we can fix \nit here and now. Best of all, unlike the underlying bill and the \n``compromise'' offered at the end of last week, the McConnell-Hatch \namendment is fully paid for within the normal 10-year budget window. In \nfact, it reduces the deficit by more than $1 billion over 10 years and \ndoes it in a fair, honest way.\n  One way it pays for the extension is to close the loophole in the law \nthat allows people to claim both unemployment insurance and Social \nSecurity disability insurance. The majority leader claims he wants to \ndo this. But our amendment does it in a much more efficient way, \nsomething that makes economic sense. However, the primary pay-for in \nour amendment, which once again allows us to extend unemployment \nbenefits for a full year and fix the military pensions issue is a 1-\nyear delay in the ObamaCare individual mandate--a 1-year delay. That is \nit.\n  I know some of my friends on the other side, including the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nmajority leader, have already deemed this proposal controversial. But \nit should not be. The problems with the implementation of ObamaCare \nhave been fully cataloged at length on the floor and elsewhere. No one \nin their right mind would argue that the implementation is going well--\nnobody. It is not going well.\n  This would give them a chance to amend this bill over the next year, \nalthough I do not think we can amend the bill--but at least give them a \nchance to. Sooner or later they are going to have to do it anyway. So \nwhat do they give up? Members of both parties have come out in support \nof delaying the individual mandate--of both parties, not just \nRepublicans but Democrats. They know it is a disaster.\n  Regardless of where you stand on ObamaCare, if you support it or if \nyou, as I do, want to see it repealed, delaying the mandate is a \nbipartisan idea and it makes sense. What are they afraid of? With a law \nthis unpopular and a rollout going this badly, I would think that many \nof my friends on the other side of the aisle would get on board with a \n1-year delay. Once again, such a delay would allow us to pay for a \nless-politicized extension of Federal unemployment benefits as well as \nallow us to fix our military pension problems.\n  It is a win-win proposition. It is hard for me to understand why they \nwill not do this. As I said, I know the Senate Democratic leadership \ndespises this idea. They have already come to the floor and \nmischaracterized it on a number of occasions. However, I believe that \nif this approach, the 1-year extension of unemployment benefits and the \nmilitary pension fix, paid for primarily by a 1-year delay in the \nindividual mandate, were brought to a vote in the Senate, Members of \nboth parties would support it.\n  It would be a bipartisan approach to these things that would be \nworthwhile. The same can be said for any number of amendments my \ncolleagues have offered. I may be wrong about that, but I do not think \nI am. If I am wrong, what is the harm in having a vote on the \nMcConnell-Hatch amendment? What is the harm in having a vote on any of \nthe amendments Republicans have offered? What are my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle afraid of?\n  We have been putting up with this now for too long a time. I remember \nthe Senate when both sides worked together all the time. They battled \neven though they differed. They allowed amendments to come up even \nthough sometimes it caused some heartburn to people on one side or the \nother. But we did it because this is a legislative body of freedom, \nwhich it has devolved in a way that there is not freedom. What is the \nharm in having a vote on any of the amendments? Let's have a limited \nnumber of amendments, not two, three or four. This is an important \nbill. Let's have some amendments that even Republicans can offer.\n  There are some Democratic amendments too. I suppose they may have \nsome heartburn for Republicans. So what. What are my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle afraid of? Once again, I do not think the \nSenate Democratic leadership is worried that I am wrong about some \nDemocrats supporting the McConnell-Hatch amendment. They are worried I \nmight be right. That is why my amendment will not receive a vote.\n  That is why as of right now, it appears no Republican amendments will \nreceive votes, unless it happens among the few who were willing to \nsupport the first vote. Even then, I doubt they will have any votes. As \nI said, it seems as though Democrats are far more worried about sending \na political message about unemployment insurance than they are with \nactually passing an extension. That is unfortunate. It is truly \nshameful.\n  However this debate unfolds, one issue is clear: The approach the \nPresident is taking is not working.\n  The economic approach the President is taking is not working. The tax \napproach the President is taking is not working. The so-called \n``Affordable Care Act'' approach the President is taking is fraught \nwith problems that could be solved if the Senate is allowed to truly \nwork the way the Senate always has in the past. The approach the \nPresident and the Senate Democratic leadership is taking isn't working.\n  We are not creating jobs at a time when Americans need them. \nAmericans need jobs, and we are not generating the type of growth that \nwill allow for such job creation in the near future.\n  As far as I can see, we have two choices. We can either have these \nsame fights over and over or we can work together to fix the real \nunderlying problems facing our country instead of focusing on the \nsymptoms and always playing the ridiculous game of politics.\n  I hope we will choose to work together. But if the tactics we have \nseen thus far on unemployment legislation are any indication, I think I \nam likely to end up quite disappointed.\n  I am concerned about the Senate. I am concerned about some of the \nvery power-striking poses that have been going on around here that do \nnot allow the Senate to work its will, do not allow for real \nbipartisanship, do not allow for bringing us together, and do not allow \nfor decency on both sides. These are just plain power-seeking \napproaches that do not deserve praise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act.\n  I am pleased a 3-month extension of unemployment insurance for \nmillions in Minnesota and across the country was able to clear its \nfirst hurdle in the Senate, but our work of course is not finished.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House and the Senate to pass an extension \nto renew these critical benefits so hard-pressed families in Minnesota \nand across our Nation can keep their heads above water while they \nsearch for work.\n  As I have traveled around Minnesota, I have heard from a lot of \nMinnesotans who wish to work. On Friday I had a roundtable conference. \nThere were three women and some workforce professionals. These women \nare looking hard and have been looking. They are part of the long-term \nunemployed. These are women who were working: one is in her forties \nwith two kids--one little kid, a 3-year-old child, a single mom; one \nwas in her fifties; and one was about my age, in her early sixties.\n  While they are looking for jobs--and we had a professional there who \nsaid one of the hardest jobs is looking for a job. They need the \nunemployment insurance to stay in their homes and to put food on the \ntable for their families.\n  In the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression, too \nmany people had good jobs and worked their entire lives--all of these \nwomen who had worked their entire lives had 20-, 30-, and 40-year \ncareers and now they are out of work and remain out of work.\n  Unemployment remains high, and the long-term unemployment rate among \nworkers who have been looking for work for at least 6 months has \nweighed down our economy. Today more then 4 million Americans, 37 \npercent of the unemployed, have been out of work for 6 months. This is \nthe worst long-term unemployment since the Great Recession. That is why \nwe need to extend the emergency unemployment compensation. These \nworkers, the millions throughout the country, are worried they will \nlose their ability to pay for a roof over their heads and put food on \nthe table for their families, for their children.\n  For most Americans, State-funded unemployment insurance runs out \nafter 26 weeks. Yet the average unemployment spell now lasts over 2\\1/\n2\\ months longer. Emergency unemployment benefits provide for up to an \nadditional 47 weeks of unemployment insurance for those Americans who \nneed it while they are looking for a job.\n  When I talk about high long-term employment, these women, every one \nof them I talked to, were working very hard every day. One woman \ndescribed it as saying: I am looking 24 hours a day. I have my \nsmartphone, and I am hoping 24 hours a day that I get something, a \nresponse, an interview.\n  Right now we have three people looking for every job opening, but \nthat doesn't mean that when someone applies for a job, there are only \ntwo other people looking. These women were telling me every time they \napplied for a job there were several hundred people looking. Very often \nthey will apply for a job that a company announces, and the company \nwill hire someone from\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\ninside the company, which is great for that person.\n  But this is not about people waiting for their unemployment to run \nout and then look for a job. That is not what it is about.\n  After Christmas, 1.3 million Americans lost their jobs and who are \nlooking for work, including 8,500 Minnesotans. They lost this critical \nlifeline of unemployment compensation.\n  Remember, these women I talked about paid in. I am talking about 20 \nyears of working, 30 years of working, 40 years in the workforce. If we \ndon't renew these benefits over the next year, that lifeline will run \nout for another 3.6 million people, including 65,000-plus Minnesotans.\n  While Minnesota has been fortunate to have a lower unemployment rate \nthan other States, I believe the 65,000 Minnesotans who will lose \nbenefits without an extension deserve our support as they are looking \nfor work.\n  Congress has never allowed special extended unemployment benefits to \nexpire when the long-term unemployment rate is as high as it is today. \nIn fact, at 2.5 percent, the long-term unemployment rate is nearly \ndouble the level when previous emergency benefits were allowed to \nexpire. The current unemployment rate of 6.7 percent is far above \nnearly all previous rates seen at expiration and is 1.1 percent higher \nthan when President George W. Bush signed the current round of benefits \ninto law.\n  As I said, on Friday I met with several unemployed Minnesotans. Two \nout of the three were affected by our not extending the emergency \nunemployment insurance.\n  I wish to share a little bit of their stories but also people who \nhave written in, Minnesotans who have reached out to me about how \nfailing to extend unemployment insurance will affect them.\n  John from Cushing, MN, wrote in December:\n\n       I am a 58 year old sales and marketing professional that \n     was laid off due to a force reduction and have been \n     unemployed for a year. I have not been able to find even part \n     time work. I have exhausted my severance package and most of \n     my liquid savings just to cover financial obligations and \n     essentials such as food and utilities. Additionally, I do not \n     have any health care coverage as my income has been limited \n     to unemployment compensation. Now that the Federal Extension \n     is about to expire, beginning next week I will have zero \n     income and no job offer pending. I would appreciate your \n     support in doing what you can to re-instate the Federal \n     Unemployment Extension in Minnesota as for me personally, it \n     is of extreme need and I would expect many others around the \n     country may also be in such dire straits.\n\n  Almost half--I believe it is the majority of Americans--sometime in \ntheir lives hit a hard patch and our job is to be there for them.\n  Debbie from White Bear Lake wrote:\n\n       There are many of us out here who will run out of benefits \n     next year and are still unable to find a decent job. I have \n     been out of work for over 4 months and am spending at least \n     5-6 hours a day (EVERY day) looking for a job. While this may \n     not seem that long, I am already concerned about my state \n     unemployment running out and having nothing. . . . The people \n     that actually work are the ones that spend money to help the \n     economy.\n\n  She is right. We know from CBO that if we extend unemployment \ninsurance these people spend the money and it goes immediately out in \nthe economy and actually the CBO says this will sustain about 200,000 \nadditional jobs. If we don't do this, we will create 200,000 less jobs \nover the next year.\n  On Friday I met with Ann from Eden Prairie, who wrote:\n\n       I have unfortunately been unemployed since being downsized \n     from a small consulting organization in April, 2013. . . . I \n     have been extremely active in my job search--\n\n  Boy, has she. I will say all of these women were upgrading their \nskills. Some of them had gone back to school to upgrade their skills \nand are still not being successful in finding work.\n  She continues:\n\n       --but have regrettably not found new unemployment. My \n     Minnesota Unemployment Insurance ran out last week and I \n     applied for Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation just \n     this past week. I understand it's going to expire at the end \n     of the month.\n\n  She wrote to me in December.\n\n       I ask you to please ask yourself what you would do to \n     provide for your family. I have a 9 year old daughter . . . \n     and a three year old son. I am the sole provider for my \n     family. I volunteer extensively at the school and elsewhere \n     in my community. . . .\n\n  She is a volunteer. She does that, but she also volunteers looking \nfor a job. She is networking in her volunteer work. She is volunteering \nfor her kids' school, for her 9-year-old's school.\n  She told me the 3-year-old went to preschool 5 days a week, then 4 \ndays, then 3 days, then 2 days, and now 1 day a week--and how hard is \nit to look for a job with a 3-year-old.\n  She continues: ``I am not looking for a handout, nor do I believe \nthat staying on unemployment insurance is in my best interest.''\n  But she says it ``will at least allow me to make my mortgage \npayment.''\n  Doug, from Bloomington, wrote that he and his family will lose their \nhome if we allow benefits to expire.\n  He says:\n\n       I unfortunately lost my job due to the economy last March . \n     . . each position that I apply for has at least 500 \n     candidates applying for the same position. If the Federal \n     unemployment extension is not approved, my family and I will \n     be homeless within a month! I have even tried to apply for \n     ``temporary positions,'' however, they always reply that I am \n     overly qualified!\n\n  We talked about this in the roundtable. We also had professionals \nthere who are professional workforce people and are counselors. These \npeople are working it. There was a woman in her fifties who said: They \nwill not take me at McDonald's because they figure if I get some other \njob I will leave and it costs to train them.\n  It truly troubles me that those who have worked and contributed to \nour society the longest, I am saying 20, 30, 40 years, have been \nparticularly hit hard by long-term unemployment; in other words, older \nworkers who lose their jobs have experienced longer periods of \nunemployment than younger workers. Part of that is age discrimination. \nThat age discrimination has made it more difficult for older workers to \nbounce back when they lose their jobs. According to AARP, 34 percent of \nolder workers seeking work reported they had experienced, or know \nsomeone who has experienced, age discrimination in the past 4 years. \nThis was the experience of all three of the women I talked to.\n\n  Extending unemployment insurance isn't just the right thing to do to \nhelp our fellow Americans who are out of work and searching for a job, \nit is also the smart thing to do for our economy. As I said, in 2011, \nthe Congressional Budget Office said that aid to the unemployed is \namong the policies with ``the largest effects on output and employment \nper dollar of budgetary cost.'' CBO estimates that extending benefits \nthrough 2014 will help expand the economy and contribute to the \ncreation of an additional 200,000 jobs. The Council of Economic \nAdvisers estimates without a full-year extension, the economy will \ngenerate 240,000 fewer jobs by the end of 2014.\n  We know unemployment benefits work. The Census Bureau estimates that \nunemployment benefits kept 2.5 million people who are trying to stay in \nthe workforce out of poverty in 2012 alone and have kept over 11 \nmillion unemployed workers out of poverty since 2008. Countless local \nbusinesses feel the positive effects when the unemployed are able to \nkeep buying their basic necessities--food, utilities, gas, so they can \ndrive to look for a job.\n  Unemployment insurance isn't the only thing we should be doing to \nhelp the unemployed either. There are lots of things we can and should \nbe doing. There are more than 3 million jobs in this country that could \nbe filled today if there were workers who had the right skills. With \ntoo many Americans unemployed, we have to find a way to fill those \njobs, to train those workers. We should be helping workers get the \ntraining they need to fill the high-tech jobs that are growing in \nMinnesota and across the country--in Maine, in Alabama, in the State of \nevery Senator I talk to in this Chamber when I talk about the skills \ngap and manufacturing returning to this country--but we don't have the \nskilled workers, and this at a time of such high long-term \nunemployment. We need to be training a workforce for the 21st century.\n  Sometimes these jobs are in advanced manufacturing. Sometimes this \ntraining takes 2 years, but we need to do it. We should be helping \nconnect these people to educational programs that link them with \nemployers, and that is why I have introduced the Community College to \nCareer Fund Act. Under this program, businesses and\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\ncommunity colleges would apply for grants based on how many jobs that \npartnership would create, the value of the jobs to those hired and to \nthe community, and how much skin the businesses have in the game.\n  There is a lot we should be doing to create jobs. We should be \naddressing our infrastructure deficit. You know, when you don't repair \nour infrastructure, when you don't create new infrastructure, that is a \ndeficit too, and we need to get people into work that we need to be \ndoing. But failing to extend emergency unemployment doesn't make sense. \nWe shouldn't be punishing people such as John and Debbie and Ann and \nDoug who are looking for work and can't find jobs. We shouldn't be \npulling the rug out from under them and millions of others who support \nthe small businesses and local retailers in our cities and our towns. \nExtending these benefits is something we should do now to jump-start \nand to continue this recovery.\n  But we shouldn't stop there. I will continue to press this Congress \nto work to create jobs through investments in infrastructure, in \ninnovation and education so that the unemployed can get back to work at \ngood jobs that sustain long-term economic growth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this Nation is facing a debt crisis. \nThat is fully understood by the American people and experts all over. \nOur total debt is now in excess of $17 trillion.\n  The Budget Control Act of 2011 was an important step in reining in \nsome of our spending. It reduced the growth of spending from 2012 to \n2022 by $2.1 trillion. That was the agreement. We raised the debt \nceiling by $2.1 trillion, but we promised the American people we would \nrestrain spending over the next decade by that amount.\n  The spending baseline for America, as calculated at that time by the \nCongressional Budget Office was expected to see spending increase by \n$10 trillion over the next 10 years over current levels. The Budget \nControl Act, which included the sequester, was to limit that growth to \n$8 trillion instead $10 trillion.\n  I wanted to reduce the growth of spending more than that, but the BCA \nlevels did provide a cap on spending that was approved by President \nObama, passed by both Houses of Congress, and signed into law by \nPresident Obama.\n  This year, fiscal year 2014, was the toughest year in terms of being \nable to meet the goals of the 10 years under the BCA and, therefore, we \nblinked, I would say, and there arose the Murray-Ryan bipartisan \nlegislation, written not with our Budget Committee members but by these \ntwo leaders. They agreed we would spend $64 billion more than the BCA \nallowed.\n  This was a bitter pill for me, I have to say. I warned this was the \nfirst real violation of the Budget Control Act spending limits, and \nwhen I sought some other alternatives, that didn't happen. The \nlegislation passed and it spent and agreed to spend more money. But it \nhad a good point. It reaffirmed this was all that would be spent above \nthe BCA level. It said: We have a tight time now. If you will just \nincrease spending for the next 2 years, we will stay fundamentally with \nthe BCA levels.\n  That was another promise, wasn't it? We promised in 2011 to limit our \nspending, and we come back in December 2013 and we say we can't live \nwith our promises any longer. Now we are making these alterations, but \nwe are going to stick with this. We are going to stay with this \npromise. If you will just give us this $64 billion extra to spend, we \nwill not spend any more than that over the next several years.\n  It also left the BCA caps in place for the next 7 years. Unemployment \ncompensation is a mandatory entitlement spending program that is before \nus now that Congress would like to spend more on than current law \nallows.\n  Of course, it appears that promises made in Washington are made to be \nbroken. I sometimes think our colleagues on the Democratic side of the \naisle see agreements such as Ryan-Murray as steps to advance their \nagenda--just to further the revolution--and not something that should \nbe honored. Less than 6 months after this act passed, President Obama \nproposed a budget that would spend $1 trillion more than was agreed to \nin the BCA--a breathtaking violation of the plain law he had signed 6 \nmonths earlier. His plan, fortunately, was rejected, but he filed the \nsame new budget in fiscal year 2013 with $1 trillion more in spending. \nAll our Senate Democratic colleagues voted for the budget Senator \nMurray moved out of committee, and it would spend $1 trillion more than \nthe BCA limits.\n  OK. So they said we couldn't live with that. We needed to spend more. \nThat is how the Ryan-Murray agreement came about. OK, we will spend \nsome more, and we will use this to pay for it, and we will do all this, \nand most of it--too much of it, frankly,--is gimmickry, and it passed--\nto spend more. It was to fix the financial pressure we were under. It \nwas to fix the tight year or two we have here--the toughest year or two \nin the budget.\n  But now, just 4 weeks after that passed, in December--tough \nnegotiations and secret talks concluded between Murray and Ryan and \nwith the first bill on the floor in this Congress, we have an \nunemployment insurance extension that totally busts those levels. So \nnow we are told we don't have to abide by those legal caps, just spend \nmore money now, with no corresponding cuts or reductions anywhere to \npay for it, as required. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously \nsaid once: ``There is no place left to cut.'' Well, there are places \nleft to cut.\n  We know we have a lot of people hurting and unemployed today, and \nsome sort of compensation is legitimate. But this idea we can waltz in \nhere because there is a need in the country that we believe should be \nfulfilled and we can borrow the money and spend for it is not good. It \nis why this Nation is $17 trillion in debt.\n  People are angry with Washington. I would say to my colleagues: Why \nshouldn't they be angry? Didn't we promise to stay with the BCA limits? \nDidn't we promise after the Ryan-Murray agreement to spend more but we \nwould stay there? Didn't we agree with that? And here we are, the first \nbill of this session, just a few weeks after that passed--Ryan-Murray, \nthe ink hardly dry--and we are demanding now a huge new deficit \nspending program.\n  Make no mistake, my colleagues, we are in deficit. Any new spending \nover the Budget Control Act entails more borrowing. That is the way it \nworks. Section 111 of H.J. Res. 59, the Ryan-Murray spending agreement, \nsays this:\n\n       Section 111(a)--Fiscal Year 2014. For the purpose of \n     enforcing the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for fiscal \n     year 2014, and for enforcing, in the Senate, budgetary points \n     of order . . . the allocations, aggregates, and levels \n     provided for in subsection (b) shall apply.\n\n  What are those levels, you might ask? This is what it says:\n\n       Section 111(b)(2).--. . . committee allocations for--(A) \n     fiscal year 2014; (B) fiscal years 2014 through 2018 . . .; \n     and (C) fiscal years 2014 through 2023; consistent with the \n     May 2013 baseline of the Congressional Budget Office . . .\n\n  The CBO baseline assumes extended unemployment benefits--that we have \nbeen extending beyond any historical pattern--will expire, as the law \nrequires, because that is what Congress wrote into law. The ink is \nbarely dry on the December agreement and we are already being pushed to \nviolate it. Therefore, if we extend unemployment insurance benefits, it \nwill cost us, will it not? Ryan-Murray would assume choices would be \nmade between competing expenditure values and that the net spending \nwould not increase above the baseline; that out of $3.7 trillion we \nspend a year, we can find the $26 billion necessary for Senator Reed's \nproposal or other proposals which might be less to fund unemployment \ninsurance, and we would find that somewhere or we wouldn't do it.\n\n  The Reed amendment before us includes a provision that would extend \nthe Budget Control Act sequester for 1 year, to 2024. So he proposes \nthat: Well, let's assume it continues, and then we can save money 11 \nyears or 12 years from now, and then we can pay for that spending \nprogram today. Isn't that nice?\n  I am ashamed to see the Senate's favorite budget gimmick, ``spend now \nand pay later,'' devolved into something almost financially sinister: \n``Spend now and pay way, way, way later.''\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\n  Ten years? We are not honoring the spending limits we agreed to in \nDecember, and now we are promising: If we are just allowed to spend \nthis money, we will cut spending 11 years from now. There will be 5 \ndifferent House elections, 5 different Senate elections, 10 different \nbudgets written, 10 different appropriations bills written between now \nand then.\n  The American people know better. We are not adhering to the \nagreements we made while the ink is still wet. We are going to promise \nto save money out there? It is outrageous.\n  This is a legitimate offset. Why don't we do it for 1 year? We can \nextend the budget sequester 2 years--2024, 2025--and save enough money \nso we could give every Federal employee a raise and it wouldn't cost a \ndime. It would all be paid for. Wouldn't it?\n  Or how about we extend it 3 years, to 2027, and then we can double \nthe highway bill? We would like to spend more money on highways. I \nwould. I would like to increase that. We could pretend that we are \ngoing to extend these limits 13 years, 14 years from now, and that will \npay for it.\n  This kind of gimmickry is how our Nation has gone broke. This is what \nwe have been doing year after year--violating even our own generous \nspending limits and pretending we are cutting spending when we are just \nreducing the growth from $10 trillion to $8 trillion. And we think the \ncountry is going to sink into the ocean if we reduce the growth of \nspending from $10 trillion to $8 trillion.\n  One of the most successful parts of the 1996 welfare reform law was \nthe work requirements for healthy working-age adults without children. \nThe work requirements encouraged millions of Americans to improve their \nlives by working, going to school, or engaging in job training \nprograms. However, this administration has granted States the ability \nto suspend the food stamp work requirements since 2012 as part of the \nextension of the emergency unemployment compensation program.\n  If the emergency unemployment program is extended again even for 1 \nweek, the administration will have the authority to waive the work \nrequirement for about 40 States for 2015. In other words, the food \nstamp work requirement will be suspended. He is going to do that. If \nthis bill passes, it will give him the power to do that. That is going \nto cost hundreds of millions of dollars, too. It is an unexpected, \nunappreciated thing in the bill.\n  After analyzing the Reed amendment and the underlying bill before us, \nwe have consulted with Senator Murray's staff--the Democratic chair of \nthe Budget Committee and a very honorable person--and proposed that \nthis proposal violates the Ryan-Murray law, and that several points of \norder apply against the Reed amendment:\n  It violates the Senate pay-as-you-go requirement. It increases the \ndeficit by more than $10 billion inside the 10-year budget window \nwithout offsets to pay for the entire cost. It spends way more above \nwhat the Senate Finance Committee has allowed under the spending deal \nwe enforced. And it violates the Budget Committee's own jurisdiction.\n  Finally, the amendment isn't paid for inside the budget window as the \nBudget Act requires. Instead, it tries to count savings 11 years out. \nThat is not allowed under the Budget Act.\n  When I raise these points of order, I would expect that sooner or \nlater the majority will move to waive all budget points of order \nagainst the amendment, and, perhaps, all budget points of order against \nthe bill itself. If Senator Leader Reid moves to waive, ignore, spend \nabove the budget limits, it requires 60 votes.\n  Let me be clear: Senator Murray and her staff have acknowledged this \ndoes violate the Budget Act, and that a budget point of order--if I or \nothers raise it--would be well taken, and it would take 60 votes to \nbreak it.\n  So the question will soon be on us: In the face of a pressing need we \nall believe should be addressed, will 60 of us agree that the best way \nforward is to turn our backs on the Murray-Ryan spending deal that \nCongress passed just 4 weeks ago and President Obama signed just 2 \nweeks ago?\n  Or will enough of us agree that the best way forward to help the \nunemployed and pay for that assistance is with other savings in the \nFederal budget, so we don't have to blow a hole in our budget agreement \nand our children and grandchildren will be stuck with paying the price?\n  Another point: By upholding the new spending arrangement the \ngovernment just entered into, by defending it against even more \nspending, we can also accomplish one other thing--put aside the gag \nrule on amendments enforced by the majority leader.\n  We have talked a lot about this: We need to be able to offer \namendments and have debate on how to make this bill better. If the \nmajority makes a successful motion to waive the Budget Act points of \norder, it protects the gag rule, the blocking of amendments, the \nfilling of the tree. Members need to have a chance to offer amendments \nto this legislation so improvements can be made, so we can pay for what \nis needed to be spent, and an actual bipartisan bill can emerge from \nthe Senate.\n  So this is the question before us now: Do we adhere to the spending \nlimits Congress passed and promised less than 1 month ago? Or do we \nbreak the Ryan-Murray limits like we broke the Budget Control Act \nlimits? Will we do so in the first bill that comes before Congress this \nyear?\n  This is not a vote on unemployment benefits when I am able to make \nthe budget point of order. And I plan to do so. It is not about \nunemployment benefits when we vote on the budget point of order. It is \na vote on whether we uphold the spending limits we agreed to, or \nwhether we violate those limits in the first spending bill since this \nCongress took session this year. This is about the integrity of this \ninstitution.\n  In 2011, we passed a Budget Control Act and promised to spend a \ncertain amount of money, and that amount only. But when the spending \ndiscipline proved too tough, Congress backed down and agreed to a new, \nlooser spending limit under Ryan-Murray. That was a few weeks ago, just \nbefore Christmas.\n  Now here we are, on the first spending bill of the year, and our \nDemocratic majority is proposing to bust the Ryan-Murray spending \nlimits right out of the chute. How could any voter trust the Senate if \nthis body votes today to break these new limits less than 1 month old?\n  A vote to uphold budget rules today is simply a vote to say that the \nbill should be paid for. Whatever we decide to do, pay for it. There \nare many ideas for doing so. Congress could easily offset these funds \nif the majority leader here in the Senate would allow us to propose \namendments--which he hasn't done.\n  So let's uphold the rules of our institution, enforce our budget \nrules, and find a way to pay for this legislation--pay for what we \nintend to spend above the limit. Let's keep our promises to the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope my colleagues who voted for the Ryan-Murray bill will not \nrenege now. If they break this agreement today, why should any taxpayer \ntrust our colleagues' promises in the future?\n  I hope all of us, no matter our policy disagreements, can agree to \nuphold Senate rules. I hope we can abide by the promises we made to the \nAmerican people. And I hope we can agree that financial integrity is \nmore important than partisan interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, while my colleague from Alabama is still \nhere, I want to talk about a certain national championship game which \njust occurred.\n  Before I do, I want to say that a lot of the frustration my colleague \nhas expressed is frustration which is shared by this Senator--not the \nspecifics, but the fact that the Senate is not working as it should. \nIndeed, the Congress is not working as it should.\n  But I would remind anyone who is listening to these words the old \nadage: It takes two to tango. And if anything is going to get done, \nthere is going to have to be a meeting of the minds between the \nparties, recognizing that you can't have it all one way--your way.\n  There are legitimate grievances in what has led to the dysfunction of \nthe U.S. Congress, and we can speak here today with regard to the \nSenate.\n  Authorization committees, which have been so important in the history \nof this country and the functioning of\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\nthe Congress, at times are irrelevant in that they have not only been \novertaken but the appropriations process has been overtaken as well.\n  When we cobble together these huge appropriations bills that are \nnothing but a continuation of the previous year's appropriations with \nsome tweaks, where is the input of Members? In the past, it has been \nMount Olympus which has come together at the last minute in an \nemergency situation to cobble together something to keep the government \nfunctioning.\n  That is not rational decisionmaking. It is not what we call around \nhere regular order. It certainly isn't the authorization of bills. And \nit certainly isn't appropriations of the government, according to that \nauthorization for appropriations.\n  As we get on down the line, I want to continue to work with my \ncolleague, whom I have had the pleasure and privilege of working with, \nas we have worked on very thorny issues in the past on the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee of Armed Services on national missile defense. The \nSenator from Alabama and this Senator have been able to come together \nin agreement on those thorny issues years ago.\n  But times have changed, and this place is not functioning. It is \ngoing to take an extra special effort on both sides of that aisle which \nhas become too big of a dividing line in our ability to get work done.\n  I empathize with the Senator's frustration and let him know there is \nfrustration on this Senator's part as well.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Nelson and Mr. Sessions are printed in \ntoday's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                            Haiti Earthquake\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, yesterday marks the fourth anniversary of \nthe devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010. The U.S. \nGeological Survey said that precisely at 4:53 p.m. local time, the \nCaribbean and North American plates moved, resulting in a major \nearthquake of a 7.0 magnitude, with aftershocks greater than 5.0 that \ncontinued for months afterward. It has been described as the largest \nurban disaster in modern history because in just 30 seconds more than \n10 million cubic meters of rubble were created, enough to fill dump \ntrucks parked bumper to bumper, all the way from Key West, FL, to the \nnorthern tip of the State of the Presiding Officer, Maine, and then \nback again. That is how much rubble was created.\n  We remember today 230,000 victims of the earthquake, one of the \ndeadliest in history. The earthquake also resulted in over 300,000 \ninjuries and left 1\\1/2\\ million people homeless.\n  I went to Haiti immediately after the earthquake. It was a horrifying \naftermath. During the last 4 years the path to recovery for Haiti has \nbeen very slow and arduous, particularly because that poor country has \nalso faced so many other plagues: Rainstorms, the edges of hurricanes, \na vicious outbreak of cholera, and many other tropical storms. Long-\nterm reconstruction and rehabilitation is going to take years, but the \nHaitian government, with the support of the United States and the \ninternational community, hopefully, is going to keep the country moving \nforward.\n  This past year I visited with President Martelly and his officials. \nThey are making progress. The international community has stepped up. \nBut nobody has stepped up like the United States. We have led an \nunprecedented recovery effort, $3.5 billion for initial humanitarian \nneeds and long-term assistance in health, infrastructure, rule of law, \nfood, and economic security.\n  In this last visit this past August, I saw many of those \nreconstruction efforts already completed and others that are well \nunderway, and others that are showing notable progress. But there is so \nmuch to be done.\n  The Haitian people are incredible; they are resilient; they are \nresourceful; they are a proud people; and they have utilized the \nsupport they have received from around the world, including the Haitian \nDiaspora. A lot of that Diaspora community is in Florida, and they have \nutilized that.\n  We all want Haiti to succeed and to continue to rebuild. So 4 years \nafter such unbelievable devastation, let's pause to think about Haiti \nand reaffirm our commitment to her. We also congratulate the Haitian \npeople as they celebrate their country's 210th anniversary of \nindependence that is this year. It is a tough subject. Haiti is the \npoorest country in the entire Western Hemisphere. There is a certain \nspecial responsibility that those countries, particularly in the \nWestern Hemisphere, that are more fortunate--a certain responsibility \nthat we have to help that little country rebuild.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask, since I just arrived on the \nSenate floor, is it appropriate for me to speak on the judicial nominee \nwe will be voting on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Wilkins Nomination\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are going to vote on the third of \nthree nominees to the DC Circuit. Today it will be Judge Robert \nWilkins. I will oppose the judge's nomination, just as I did when the \nSenate rejected the same nomination in November of last year.\n  This circuit, of course, is far and away the least busy in the \ncountry. This is one of the reasons why the Democrats blocked nominees \nto this very same circuit, based on the very same arguments regarding \ncaseload, during the Bush administration. There were only two \ndifferences between then and now. Back then the caseload was even \nhigher, and back then there was a Republican in the White House. Today, \nof course, there is a Democrat in the White House, and also a \nDemocratic majority here in the Senate.\n  Today, by pushing this nomination for a circuit where there are not \nmore judges needed based on caseload, I say that the Senate majority--\nmeaning the Senate Democrats--do not want to play by the same rules \nthey pioneered or by the same standards they established during the \nBush administration.\n  Even though the Senate considered and rejected this nomination just a \ncouple of months ago, today once again we will be voting on Judge \nWilkins' confirmation. We will vote on the judge's nomination today \nbecause, on November 21, last year, the majority leader and the Senate \nmajority invoked the so-called nuclear option. In one fell swoop, the \nmajority leader did more damage to the institution than I have \nwitnessed in more than 3 decades of service here in the Senate. In \nfact, when the majority leader broke the rules to change the rules last \nNovember and tossed aside two centuries of Senate history and \nprecedent, he likely did more damage to this institution than any \nleader who preceded him.\n  It was a power grab. Of course it was a power grab. But it was more \nthan that. It fundamentally has altered the way the Senate operates. It \nstripped the minority of its rights--under the rules, of course--but it \nwas more than that as well. It cheapens the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.\n  About 2 hours ago I spoke on this subject to the Senate based upon \nwhat James Madison said was the function of the Senate--to be a \ndeliberative body, to bring stability to our political system, not to \ndo things the same way the House of Representatives does.\n  As a result of the nuclear option, the Senate design has been forever \naltered, and it was done via brute force with zero buy-in from the \nminority. The result, as we have seen over the last 2 months, is less \ncooperation and more partisanship, something the people of this country \nabhor.\n  That is before you consider the current state of affairs regarding \namendments here on the Senate floor. The majority leader routinely \nblocks all Senators from offering amendments by doing what we call \n``filling the tree'' with amendments, and then sets aside his ``blocker \namendments'' for only those amendments that the leader considers \nappropriate for us to discuss.\n  When you take into consideration the inability of Senators to offer \namendments of their choosing and combine it with the leader's decision \nto strip the minority of their right to extend a debate on nominations, \nit becomes clear why today's Senate operates the way it does. There are \ntwo great rights Senators have: the right to debate and the right to \namend. That is what makes us a deliberative body. That is what makes us \nso much different from the House of Representatives. By stripping away, \non one hand, the right to extend the debate on nominations, and denying \nSenators, on the\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nother hand, the right to offer amendments, the leader has taken those \ntwo rights and shredded them. It is to a point where some Members of \nthis body don't even have a full appreciation for the way the \ninstitution used to operate.\n  Is it any wonder that it is difficult to get things done in today's \nSenate? Is it any wonder Senators don't feel compelled to work and \nconsult together?\n  Today we will vote on a nomination the Senate rejected a couple of \nmonths ago. Now--perhaps because the other side is having a bit of \nbuyer's remorse--some of my colleagues have been doing their best to \nrewrite history.\n  Senate Democrats claim that Republican opposition to the DC Circuit \nnominees was, in their words, unprecedented, but conveniently failed to \nmention that Senate Democrats set the standard during the Bush \nadministration when they blocked qualified nominees to the DC Circuit \nbased on caseload, which is the same argument I used, but in those days \nthe caseload was even heavier than it is today.\n  As I have said, back then the caseload was higher. You can't say that \ntoo often. The fact is that DC is the most underworked circuit in the \nNation.\n  I have given previous speeches on this subject, and I have given a \nlot of statistics, so I won't go through all those statistics again \ntoday, but with the most recent data released by the nonpartisan \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the numbers still show the DC \nCircuit has the fewest number of appeals filed and appeals terminated \namong all of the Federal circuit courts.\n  On a per-active-judge basis, the DC Circuit now has 111 total appeals \nfiled per active judge. The national average is over three times \nhigher, at 377. The busiest court, the Eleventh Circuit, comes in at \nover seven times higher than the DC Circuit, at 796. In other words, a \nFederal appellate judge sitting in Florida has a workload seven times \nheavier than the circuit judge sitting here in DC.\n  I hope people don't fall for the phony argument that cases in the DC \nCircuit are more complicated. There are other circuits that handle more \nof these so-called complex cases than even DC. The bottom line is the \nempirical data has shown, and continues to show, that these judges \ncould have been better used in other circuits. I have a piece of \nlegislation that would move these three judges from the DC Circuit to \nother circuits where the caseload is greater.\n  To confirm what the statistics show, early last year I decided to go \nstraight to the source, the judges who serve in DC on this circuit. \nBefore these nominations to the DC Circuit were even made, I submitted \na questionnaire to each DC Circuit judge asking them about their \nworkload. Their responses independently confirmed that the data showed \nthat the court is severely underworked.\n  One judge responded: ``If any more judges were added now, there \nwouldn't be enough work to go around.'' I hope you understand that the \nvacancies that are being filled are going to cost the taxpayers $1 \nmillion-plus a year forever as long as these seats are filled.\n  After looking carefully at the data, and, of course, confirming my \nunderstanding with the judges themselves, I opposed these nominations \nbased, in part, on the same standards established by the Democrats \nduring the Bush administration when they blocked nominees to the DC \nCircuit. Then, of course, there was a Republican President, and now we \nhave a Democratic President.\n  Of course, that wasn't the only reason for opposition to these \nnominees. For instance, gun rights supporters are opposed to Judge \nWilkins, not based on caseload but because of the Dearth v. Holder case \nwhere Judge Wilkins held that nonresident U.S. citizens don't have the \nSecond Amendment right to purchase a firearm.\n  The last nominee we confirmed to the DC Circuit was about the \nfarthest thing from a mainstream nominee as you can get. I won't repeat \neverything I said about that nominee in previous speeches or what that \nnominee has said or written, but I will give one example. Consider \nformer Professor Pillard's view on religious freedom. She argued that \nthe Supreme Court case of Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church, \nwhich challenged the so-called ``ministerial exception'' to employment \ndiscrimination represented--in her words--a ``substantial threat to the \nAmerican rule of law.''\n  The Supreme Court, on appeal, rejected her view 9-0, and the Court \nheld that ``it is impermissible for the government to contradict a \nchurch's determination of who can act as its ministers.''\n  Think about that. Former Professor Pillard argued the challenge to \nthe ministerial exception to employment law represented a ``substantial \nthreat to the American rule of law.'' Yet the Court rejected the view \n9-0, and held ``it is impermissible for the government to contradict a \nchurch's determination of who can act as its ministers.''\n  Do my colleagues honestly believe it is within the mainstream to \nargue churches shouldn't be allowed to choose their own ministers? I \ndon't believe it is in the mainstream.\n  We know these judges aren't needed. Far from it. We know these \nnominations aren't mainstream. Far from it. Then why did our Senate \nDemocrats go to such lengths to stack this court? Why go so far as to \nchange the Senate rules in order to fill these vacancies? Why go so far \nas to abuse and violate the Senate rules to change the rules? Well, \nbecause the President and his allies will do whatever it takes to get \ntheir way even if it means breaking Senate rules, silencing debate, \ncircumventing Congress, or stacking the judicial deck in their favor to \nensure that their executive actions are rubberstamped by the courts.\n\n  It is no secret the President has decided to circumvent Congress by \nrelying heavily on Executive orders and regulatory action to carry out \nan unpopular agenda. We all heard the President pledge repeatedly, ``If \nCongress won't act, I will.'' What he means, of course, is that he is \ngoing to do it all by executive action. He won't go to Congress. He \nwon't negotiate. In fact, he will go around Congress. He decided he \ndoesn't need legislators to make these changes. He will just issue an \nExecutive order or issue new agency rules.\n  As I have explained before, in effect, the President is saying: If \nthe Senate won't confirm who I want, when I want them, then I will \nrecess-appoint them when the Senate isn't even in session, or at \nanother time, the President would say: If Congress won't pass cap-and-\ntrade fee increases, then I will go around the Congress and do the same \nthing through administrative action at the Environmental Protection \nAgency or, again, if Congress won't pass gun control legislation, then \nI will issue a series of Executive orders. Quite simply, that is what \nthe President means when he says: If Congress won't act, I will.\n  But remember. Under our system, it is the courts that provide a check \non the President's powers. It is the courts that decide whether the \nPresident is acting unconstitutionally. So the only way the President's \nplan works is if he stacks the deck in his favor. The only way the \nPresident can successfully bypass Congress is if he stacks the courts \nwith ideological allies who will rubberstamp these Executive orders. \nThat is why it is so important for the President that he and his Senate \nallies stack the DC Circuit even though the DC Circuit doesn't have \nenough work, and it will be an additional $1 million for each of the \nthree judges who are now being stacked into this court.\n  As I have said, in the last few weeks the other side has attempted to \nrewrite history in an effort to justify the actions they have taken, \nbut the other side's effort to rewrite history isn't limited to the \nhistory of the DC Circuit in particular. It extends to the number of \nso-called filibusters during the past few years.\n  Several times last week the Senate majority claimed that the \nRepublicans filibustered 20 of Obama's district court nominees. \nAccording to their narrative, only 23 nominees have been filibustered \nin the history of the Senate, and 20 occurred in the past 5 years. That \nis not remotely true, and the majority knows that. As near as I can \ntell, this claim is based on the number of times a cloture motion has \nbeen filed on district court nominees. Of course, everyone knows a \ncloture motion isn't a filibuster. A filibuster is a failure to end \ndebate.\n  Nonetheless, let's look at those 20 nominees. Seventeen nominees were\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nfiled at one time back in March of 2012. That maneuver, of course, was \na transparent effort to manufacture a crisis where no crisis existed. \nEvery single one of these cloture motions was later withdrawn. As a \nresult, not 1 of those 17 nominees even had a cloture vote, let alone a \nfailed cloture vote.\n  In fact, of these 20 so-called filibusters of district court judges, \nthe Senate held only 1 cloture vote on a district court judge, and that \ncloture vote passed the Senate. Yet the Senate majority still claims we \nfilibustered 20 district court nominees. That is revisionist history if \nI have ever seen it.\n  Let's review the alleged Republican obstruction of the President's \nnominees. Since President Obama took office, the Senate has approved \n218 of the President's lower court judicial nominees. That is 99 \npercent. So we have rejected only two. If the majority leader hadn't \ninvoked the nuclear option, the number would have, in fact, been 5 \ninstead of 2, but not 20, and not 34, as I have heard some claim. It \nwould not have even been 10, which was the number the Senate majority \nblocked by the fifth year of President Bush's administration. Five \nnominees.\n  At the end of the day, the majority was willing to toss aside two \ncenturies of Senate practice and tradition over just five judicial \nnominees. So I continue to oppose this nominee, just as I did when the \nSenate rejected the nomination before the Senate Democrats broke the \nrules to change the rules.\n\n  This judgeship wasn't warranted before the majority leader and the \nDemocrats invoked the misguided nuclear option, and it certainly hasn't \nsuddenly become warranted in the weeks since that time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader and I have had a number of \nconversations today about how we should proceed on unemployment \ninsurance. I have had conversations and he has had conversations with a \nnumber of our Members, both Democrats and Republicans. Right now, \nbecause the vote is not scheduled until 5:30, it has been difficult for \nme, and I am quite certain for the Republican leader, to talk to all of \nthe necessary people involved in trying to come to some conclusion as \nto how we should proceed on this legislation. Two of the people I met \nwith today, everyone knows, are people who are trying to work something \nout, including Senator Collins and Senator Heller. Senator Heller is a \ncosponsor of the underlying bill and Senator Collins is always trying \nto make peace with everybody. They have made a proposal. I have an \noutline of their proposal and I appreciate their good work.\n  However, I can't automatically agree to it because it calls for 3 \nmonths rather than the 11 months or so we had in the underlying \nproposal that is before the Senate. As everyone knows, the President is \nnot in favor of a 3-month proposal and I am not either, but that \ndoesn't mean we can't work something out. I have made statements \nindicating I prefer a longer period in the proposal and so has the \nPresident.\n  However, my main point in saying a few words this afternoon is that \nwe need to be able to meet with Senators--I need to meet with my caucus \ntomorrow before I can determine how I would suggest--along with the two \nRepublican Senators I met with--how we will proceed on this matter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Of course; I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would observe that what I am hoping for is an open \namendment process. We have the amendment tree filled and it remains my \nhope that we will be able to, through these discussions we have had, \nget to something closer to what we have been accustomed to in the past \nwith a relatively open amendment process. So under those circumstances, \nand in the hope that by tomorrow we end up with a more fair process, I \nam happy to go along with what the majority leader has suggested.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S281-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If I understand correctly, we are on the nomination of \njudge Robert Wilkins?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Judge Robert L. Wilkins to be a circuit judge for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I was pleased to \nintroduce Judge Wilkins to the Judiciary Committee in September and the \ncommittee favorably reported his nomination in October. He was \nfilibustered in November, and I am pleased we are reconsidering his \nnomination today.\n  Judge Wilkins currently serves as a Federal District Judge in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. So he is a district \ncourt judge today, confirmed by the Senate for a lifetime appointment, \nand now has been nominated by President Obama to fill the circuit \ncourt, which is the court above the judicial court for the District of \nColumbia.\n  I am happy we are going to get a chance to vote on the merits of this \nnominee.\n  Judge Wilkins is a native of Muncie, IN. He obtained his B.S. cum \nlaude in chemical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology \nand his J.D. from Harvard Law School.\n  Following graduation, Judge Wilkins clerked for The Honorable Earl B. \nGilliam of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nCalifornia. He later served as a staff attorney and as\n\n[[Page S282]]\n\nhead of special litigation for the Public Defender Service for the \nDistrict of Columbia. He then practiced as a partner with Venable, \nspecializing in white-collar defense, intellectual property, and \ncomplex civil litigation before taking the bench as a district court \njudge.\n  Besides Judge Wilkins' professional accomplishments as an attorney, \nhe has also played a leading role as a plaintiff in a landmark civil \nrights case in Maryland involving racial profiling. During his tenure \nwith the Public Defender Service and in private practice, Judge Wilkins \nserved as the lead plaintiff in Wilkins, et al. v. State of Maryland, a \ncivil rights lawsuit against the Maryland State Police for a traffic \nstop they conducted on Judge Wilkins and his family. Let me give some \nof the circumstances of what Judge Wilkins went through.\n  In 1992 Judge Wilkins attended his grandfather's funeral in Chicago \nand then began an all-night trip home with three of his family members. \nHe was due back in Washington, DC, that coming morning for a court \nappearance as a public defender. A Maryland State Police trooper pulled \nover their car. The police detained the family and deployed a drug-\nsniffing dog to check the car, after Judge Wilkins declined to consent \nto a search of the car, stating there was no reasonable suspicion. The \nfamily stood in the rain during the search, which did not uncover any \ncontraband.\n  Judge Wilkins later wrote:\n\n       It is hard to describe the frustration and pain you feel \n     when people pressure you to be guilty for no good reason, and \n     you know that you are innocent. . . . [W]e fit the profile to \n     a tee. We were traveling on I-68, early in the morning, in a \n     Virginia rental car. And, my cousin and I, the front seat \n     passengers, were young black males. The only problem was that \n     we were not dangerous, armed drug traffickers. It should not \n     be suspicious to travel on the highway early in the morning \n     in a Virginia rental car. And it should not be suspicious to \n     be black.\n\n  After the traffic stop, Judge Wilkins began reviewing Maryland State \nPolice data and noticed that while a majority of those searched on I-95 \nwere Black, Blacks made up only a minority of the drivers traveling on \nthe highway.\n  Judge Wilkins filed a civil rights lawsuit which resulted in two \nlandmark settlements that were the first to require systematic \ncompilation and publication by a police agency of data for all highway \ndrug and weapons searches, including data recording the race of the \nmotorist involved, the justification of the search and the outcome of \nthe search. The settlements also required the State Police to hire an \nindependent consultant, install video cameras in their vehicles, \nconduct internal investigations of all citizen complaints of racial \nprofiling, and provide the Maryland NAACP with quarterly reports \ncontaining detailed information on the number, nature, location, and \ndisposition of racial profiling complaints.\n  These settlements inspired a June 1999 Executive order by President \nClinton, congressional hearings, and legislation that has been enacted \nin over half of the 50 States.\n  This was a landmark case, and the settlement provided the wherewithal \nfor many States to change their practices on traffic stops and how \ntraffic stops would be conducted. It was an important action Judge \nWilkins took as a private citizen in order to advance the rights of all \npeople. I applaud him for that courage, not only to stand for what was \nright for him but also to be active in changing those practices around \nthe country.\n  As my colleagues know, I have introduced S. 1038, the End Racial \nProfiling Act--ERPA--which would codify many of the practices now used \nby the Maryland State Police to root out the use of racial profiling by \nlaw enforcement. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on ending the \nuse of racial profiling last year, and I am hopeful that with the \nbroader discussion on racial profiling generated by the tragic death of \nTrayvon Martin, we can come together and move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  Judge Wilkins played a key role in the passage of the Federal statute \nestablishing the National Museum of African American History and \nCulture Plan for Action Presidential Commission, and he served as the \nchairman of the Site and Building Committee of that Presidential \nCommission. The work of the Presidential Commission led to the passage \nof Public Law 108-184, which authorized the creation of the National \nMuseum of African American History and Culture. This museum will be the \nnewest addition to the Smithsonian and is scheduled to open in 2015 \nbetween the National Museum of American History and the Washington \nMonument on the National Mall.\n  I mention that because Judge Wilkins has been involved in our \ncommunity. He is not only an outstanding jurist, he is a person who has \nstood for basic rights. He has taken action where things were wronged \nagainst him, and he has been very active in our community.\n  He also continues his pro bono work to this day. He currently serves \nas the court liaison to the Standing Committee on Pro Bono Legal \nServices of the Judicial Conference of the DC Circuit. He is committed \nto public service and equal justice.\n  As a U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia since 2011, \nJudge Wilkins has presided over hundreds of civil and criminal cases, \nincluding both jury and bench trials. Judge Wilkins already sits on a \nFederal bench which hears an unusual number of cases of national \nimportance to the Federal Government, including complex election law, \nvoting rights, environmental, securities, and administrative law cases.\n  Indeed, Judge Wilkins has been nominated for the appellate court that \nwould directly hear appeals from the court on which he currently sits. \nHe understands the responsibilities of the court that he has been \nnominated to by President Obama.\n  The American Bar Association gave Judge Wilkins a rating of \nunanimously ``well qualified'' to serve as a Federal appellate judge, \nwhich is the highest possible rating from the nonpartisan peer review.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is \nalso referred to as the Nation's second highest court. The Supreme \nCourt only accepts a handful of cases each year, so the DC Circuit \noften has the last word and proclaims the final law of the land in a \nrange of critical areas of the law because many of these cases are \nbrought to the DC Circuit.\n  This court handles unusually complex cases in the area of \nadministrative law, including revealing decisions and rulemaking of \nmany Federal agencies in policy areas, such as environment, labor, and \nfinancial regulations.\n  Nationally, only about 15 percent of the appeals are administrative \nin nature--15 percent. That is the national number. In the DC Circuit, \nthat figure is 43 percent. They have a much larger caseload of complex \ncases. The court also hears a variety of sensitive terrorism cases \ninvolving complicated issues, such as enemy combatants and detention \npolicies.\n  Let me quote from former Chief Judge Henry Edwards, who said:\n\n       [R]eview of large, multiparty, difficult administrative \n     appeals is the staple of judicial work in the DC Circuit. \n     This alone distinguishes the work of the DC Circuit from the \n     work of other circuits. It also explains why it is impossible \n     to compare the work of the DC Circuit with other circuits by \n     simply referring to raw data on case filings.\n\n  I mention that because there have been some here who say ``the \nworkload of the court.'' The workload of the court requires us to fill \nthis vacancy.\n  Chief Justice Roberts noted that ``about two-thirds of the cases \nbefore the DC Circuit involved the Federal Government in some civil \ncapacity, while that figure is less than twenty-five percent \nnationwide.'' He also described the ``D.C. Circuit's unique character, \nas a court with special responsibility to review legal challenges to \nthe conduct of the national government.'' He should know. Justice \nRoberts came from that circuit court.\n  We have a person who is eminently qualified for this position, and \nthat is Judge Wilkins. We have a need to fill this vacancy. The Senate \nshould carry out its responsibility, and we are going to have that \nchance very shortly.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Senate unanimously confirmed \nJudge Wilkins in 2010 for his current position, and he has a \ndistinguished lifelong record of public service. I am pleased that we \nhave moved forward to get an up-or-down vote on this nomination. I ask \nthe Senate and my colleagues to support confirmation of this eminently \nqualified judge.\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tonight we will vote on the nomination of \nJudge Robert Wilkins to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit. Late last week, we were finally able to invoke cloture on his \nnomination, after it was unjustifiably filibustered by Senate \nRepublicans for months.\n  Judge Wilkins was nominated to serve on this court last June, along \nwith two other exceptional nominees who were both confirmed late last \nyear, Judge Patricia Millett and Judge Nina Pillard. Once Judge Wilkins \nis confirmed, the DC Circuit, which is often considered to be the \nsecond most important court in the Nation, will finally be operating at \nfull strength. The American people deserve no less.\n  Judge Wilkins is an outstanding nominee. He was unanimously confirmed \nto the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia 3 years ago. He \nhas presided over hundreds of cases and issued significant decisions in \nvarious areas of the law, including in the fields of administrative and \nconstitutional law. Prior to serving on the bench, he was a partner for \nnearly 10 years in private practice and served more than 10 years as a \npublic defender in the District of Columbia.\n  During his time at the Public Defender Service, Judge Wilkins served \nas the lead plaintiff in a racial profiling case, which arose out of an \nincident in which he and three family members were stopped and detained \nwhile returning from a funeral in Chicago. This lawsuit led to landmark \nsettlements that required systematic statewide compilation and \npublication of highway traffic stop-and-search data by race. These \nsettlements inspired an Executive Order by President Clinton, \nlegislation in the House and Senate, and legislation in at least 28 \nStates prohibiting racial profiling or requiring data collection.\n  Despite the progress made in the past several decades, the struggle \nto diversify our Federal bench continues. When confirmed, Judge Wilkins \nwill be only the sixth African American to have ever served on the DC \nCircuit.\n  Judge Wilkins earned the ABA's highest possible rating of unanimously \n``well qualified.'' He also has the support of the National Bar \nAssociation, the Nation's largest professional association of African \nAmerican lawyers and judges, as well as several other prominent legal \norganizations. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nlist of letters in support of Judge Wilkins.\n  I hope my fellow Senators will join me today to confirm this good man \nto serve on this important court. Our Nation will be better off with \nJudge Robert Wilkins serving on the DC Circuit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Letters in Support of the Nomination of Judge Robert Wilkins\n\n       1.

Mr. President, there is a lot of work going on around the \nCapitol this evening, and tomorrow morning we will see if we can figure \nout a way to move forward to help 1.4 million people who are unemployed \nto extend their unemployment benefits to them. It is something we need \nvery much, and we will see if we can move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my brief remarks, Senator Lee be recognized, and then \nafter Senator Lee that Senator Harkin be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as the leader indicated, we are working to \ndevelop a response to the 1.3 million Americans who on December 28 lost \ntheir unemployment extended benefits. Since that time, the number has \nincreased. About 70,000 Americans a week are losing their unemployment \ninsurance benefits. This number is now approaching roughly 1.5 million \nAmericans and will approach a significantly\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nhigher number of Americans throughout the year.\n  This is an emergency. These people have worked. They are in a job \nmarket where typically there are more than two applicants for every \njob, and we are seeing a job market that is moving sometimes forward \nand sometimes sideways. The numbers last Friday were quite \ndisappointing. It could have been the weather or it could be other \nfactors, but it does underscore the need to move very aggressively to \naddress the issue of these unemployed Americans. The average benefit is \nabout $300 to $350 a week. The only reason they qualify for the benefit \nis they did work and they are still looking for work.\n  One of the ironies of last week's numbers is even though we had very \nmediocre job creation, the unemployment rate fell. Why? Because people \nare leaving the workforce. They are giving up. We can't let that \nhappen. One way we keep people looking for work and we keep them able \nto look for work is to provide this modest benefit each week.\n  So we are looking very hard and we have had a great deal of \ncollaboration and cooperation. I thank Senators Heller, Collins, \nPortman, Ayotte, Murkowski, and Coats. They voted to keep this process \ngoing forward, and I respect and thank them for that. I know, over this \nlast weekend, particularly Senators Heller, Collins, and Portman have \nbeen working to try to find a way to move forward. Let me say, though, \nwe on our side have moved very far.\n  Typically these benefits are not paid for. Last year's 12 month \nextension of unemployment insurance was unpaid for. It was an \nemergency. It probably created on the order of 100-plus thousand jobs, \nwhich would not have taken place without that kind of increase in \ndemand in the economy generated by these payments to individuals \nlooking for work.\n  We heard what our colleagues said, that this has to be paid for. So \nwe went ahead and proposed a pay-for. Again, many of my colleagues in \nthe Democratic caucus in both the House and the Senate would prefer to \nsee these benefits as emergency unpaid for. We have repeatedly done \nthat.\n  We have also changed the duration of the benefits. We eliminated some \nweeks in the first two tiers so we would be able to afford this benefit \nand still give people the opportunity to move forward.\n  So we have moved from what we have typically done.\n  Again, if we look back over the years, the exception is paying for \nthese benefits. Many times during the Bush administration, we provided \nunemployment benefits unpaid for. Now some of my colleagues are asking \nto pay for them. We have tried to pay for them. We tried to change the \nduration so we could afford them but still provide help for people. We \nhave done this because we have heard from the other side: One, they \nhave to be paid for; but, two, we can't use revenues.\n  A balanced approach to any public policy solution has to at least \nconsider revenues. But our colleagues have been staunch about saying: \nWe will not entertain at all any revenues to offset this payment.\n  There is a long list of egregious tax provisions which have been \nhighlighted by many of my colleagues--particularly Senator Levin in his \nwork--with respect to corporate tax loopholes which not only should be \ncorrected but could be applied to allow these Americans the opportunity \nto have some support as they go forward looking for work. But because \nour colleagues said no revenue, OK, we have looked for ways to pay for \nthis without engaging in rhetoric. So I think we have made a \nsignificant step forward.\n  In turn, my colleagues have come back and proposed variations on some \nof the things we have talked about. They have done it in good faith. \nThey have done it with great ingenuity. Again, I thank them. We haven't \nyet come to a sort of meeting of the minds, but we are working.\n  Again, let me go back to the original proposal Senator Heller and I \nmade. We said: Let's do this for 3 months without a pay-for. That will \ngive us time to do a lot of the work my colleagues have suggested. They \nhave talked about how training programs have to be changed, how skills \nhave to be matched up with jobs, very intricate programmatic changes. \nThat is not going to be done here on the floor within 24, 48, or 72 \nhours.\n  I would conclude by again saying: There are now approaching 1.5 \nmillion Americans who were abandoned on the 28th of December. Their \nbenefits were cut off. They are in some cases desperate, trying to pay \ntheir mortgages, trying to keep their homes, trying to put food on \ntheir table. They are trying to put gas in their car, natural gas to \nheat their homes in the cold weather, and I think we have to respond.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who have helped. Tomorrow we are going \nto get closer to a sort of point of reckoning, and I hope we can come \ntogether and move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S284-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S284-S285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WILKINS NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Rhode Island and \nIowa for their cooperation in establishing the speaking order this \nevening. I would like to speak for a moment about the vote we just \ncast. We just confirmed Judge Wilkins to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit. I voted against this judge. In doing that, I joined my \nRepublican colleagues for one simple reason. Several years ago, when \nPresident George W. Bush was in the White House, he nominated an \neminently qualified lawyer named Peter Keisler who had bipartisan \nsupport.\n  He was not a partisan hack; he was a true craftsman in the law. He \nwas someone whom no one had any ideological opposition to, but he was \nblocked by the Senate Democrats at that time for the simple fact, based \non the simple reason, that according to the Senate Democrats the DC \nCircuit's caseload was not sufficiently robust to justify the filling \nof this position.\n  Since that time, not very many things have changed. Since that time, \nif anything, the DC Circuit's caseload per judge has remained about the \nsame or some would argue has gone down a little, depending on which \nmetric you use. One change is that we have now a Democratic President \nin the White House instead of a Republican President in the White \nHouse. Suddenly my friends across the aisle have forgotten about the \ncaseload-based arguments they used a few years ago to keep Peter \nKeisler off the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n  We have now confirmed, just in the last few weeks, three additional \njudges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This has \nhappened against substantial Republican opposition that has been based \non the very analysis I have just outlined. This has been facilitated by \nvirtue of the fact that my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada, joined by his Democratic colleagues, chose a few weeks ago \nto exercise what has been referred to as the nuclear option. They broke \nthe rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate, and \nthey did that so they could put more people on the bench, so they could \nput more people into top-level positions in this administration while \nmore or less squelching the view of the minority party within the \nSenate.\n  This is unfortunate. The most unfortunate aspect of it is that it is \npart of a broader strategy that is not limited to the DC Circuit; in \nfact, it is not even limited to the Senate's confirmation process with \nrespect to these judges or other judges. It extends much more broadly \nthan that. It is part of the same effort that convinced the President \nof the United States, on January 4, 2012, to make four appointments, \nthree to the National Labor Relations Board and one to the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, pursuant to the President's recess \nappointment power.\n  Citing Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, the \nPresident claimed he had the power to appoint these individuals without \ngoing through the Senate advice-and-consent process because, as he \nasserted, the Senate was in recess. There was only one problem with \nthis. The Senate was not in fact in recess. Under Article I, Section 5, \nClause 2 of the Constitution, each Chamber of Congress, including the \nSenate, has the right to determine its own rules, its own procedures. \nAccording to the Senate's own rules and according to the Senate's own \nJournal, the Senate was in fact in session as of January 4, 2012, the \nmoment these supposed recess appointments were made. This was a \nproblem.\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\n  Fortunately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit--prior, I \nwould add, to the confirmation of the three recent judges we have \nconfirmed just in the last few weeks--concluded that this was a lawless \nact; that it was unconstitutional; that the President did not have the \nright to deem the Senate in recess when, according to the Senate's own \nrules, the Senate was in session. The Senate was not in recess.\n  That case today was reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. I had the privilege of sitting in the courtroom just across the \nstreet and watching those proceedings. I was pleased to see the checks \nand balances within our system were functioning--at least to the extent \nthat we have our court system reviewing this act by the President of \nthe United States. I think it is fortunate we have this kind of \njudicial system that can review it. Based on what I saw today and the \nquality of the arguments presented to the Court, I am hopeful the Court \nwill reach the same conclusion. I am hopeful the Supreme Court will \naffirm the judgment entered by the DC Circuit.\n  In a broader sense it is sad, it is disappointing that it even had to \nget that far, and it is disappointing that the President of the United \nStates was willing to engage in such a lawless act; that the President \nof the United States was willing openly to flout the plain text, \nhistory, tradition of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Ours is not a government of one. It was with good reason that the \nFounding Fathers split up the power, including the power to appoint \npeople to high Federal office such that the President could nominate \nbut the Senate got to confirm. By the President's approach, pursuant to \nwhich the President of the United States could himself deem the Senate \nin recess if he did not think the Senate was doing enough when it went \ninto brief sessions, the President himself could substantially \ncircumvent the advice-and-consent role the Founding Fathers and the \nConstitution wisely placed in the hands of the Senate.\n  The reason I said it is unfortunate it had to get to that level, it \nis unfortunate, first of all, the President felt it was OK, it was \nacceptable do this. He, of course, took an oath, not once but twice, to \nuphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  It is unfortunate, secondarily, that there was not more of an outcry \nfrom this body. Sure, there were a lot Republicans who joined me in \ncalling this action lawless, because it was. It was sad that none of \nour colleagues from the other side of the aisle--at least not \npublicly--were willing to acknowledge the lawlessness of this act. Some \nacknowledged to me in private that it was problematic. Some \nacknowledged to me that there were some implications behind this that \nthreatened the Senate as an institution. But I think we need to be more \nopen, more faithful, more forceful, and less partisan about the way we \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.\n  To me it would not matter--if this were a Republican President I \nwould be arguing with equal strength on this issue. In the future when \nwe have a Republican President, if any Republican President is lawless \nenough to try this, I will oppose it with everything within me. We \nourselves take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. \nI think that involves doing more than simply leaving it to the courts \nto iron out the details.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S285-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S285-S288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from Utah for agreeing to the way we worked this \nout so we could all have our time to speak on the Senate floor. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Extending unemployment compensation benefits is one of the most \nimportant things, vital things we should be doing right now in \nCongress, both for the people who are unemployed but also for our \neconomy. Our economy is improving--slowly. There are still 20 million \nAmericans either out of work or marginally employed who want to work. \nAlmost 4 million of those have been out of work for over 6 months. So, \nfaced with this, it is reprehensible that Congress failed to extend \nFederal unemployment benefits at the end of last year, 3 days after \nChristmas.\n  To correct this failure, last week the Senate began considering a \nbill that was intended to extend those benefits, and I wholeheartedly \nsupport this effort. As our economy makes steady improvements on the \nlong road of recovery from the great recession, we continue to support \nour fellow Americans who are out of work through no fault of their own. \nThe way to do that is to restore Federal unemployment insurance \nprograms for the long-term unemployed. But to garner the votes needed \nto pass the unemployment insurance extension, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle insisted we find a way to pay for it, through \ncuts to existing programs, cuts that one columnist for the Los Angeles \nTimes said were Swiftian in their absurdity and cruelty.\n  I refer to the January 10 issue of the Los Angeles Times by Michael \nHiltzik. It is titled ``An awful idea: hammer the disabled to pay for \nunemployment benefits.''\n  The first paragraph says:\n\n       It would take the pen of Jonathan Swift to fully describe \n     Congress's willingness to beat up on the least fortunate \n     members of society to protect the richest. The latest example \n     is a plan to pay for a one-year extension of unemployment \n     insurance by cutting Social Security benefits for the \n     disabled.\n\n  First of all, I wish to say I do not believe that an extension of \nFederal unemployment insurance benefits needs to be offset. We have \ndone it before. We did it under the Bush administration and we have \ndone it before and it has always been an emergency. It is just as if a \nhurricane hits or terrible storm; this is a terrible storm for people \nwho are unemployed for long periods of time. Frankly, the recent budget \ndeal we just passed reduced the deficit by $25 billion. I disagree with \nhaving to find extra money. But the other side--the Republicans--says \nwe have to find offsets. I guess I am reluctantly willing to do so.\n  However, the proposal before us would do so in one of the most \npernicious ways possible. I guess the most positive comment I can make \nabout it is it is comparatively less damaging than some of the \namendments that have been filed by some of my Republican colleagues. \nBut understand this. The proposal before us to extend unemployment \nbenefits and to ``pay for it,'' what it would do is it would deny \nindividuals who have a disability and who are receiving Social Security \ndisability insurance--it would say that if someone gets unemployment \ncompensation, their disability payments will be reduced, dollar for \ndollar, for every dollar they get in unemployment compensation. That is \nbad enough. I will get into that in a second. Amendments filed on the \nRepublican side would go further, and they would say if someone gets $1 \nin unemployment compensation payments, they would lose all their \ndisability rights, all their disability payments, and all their \nMedicare support that comes along with being approved for SSDI--Social \nSecurity disability insurance.\n  The proponents of these policies say that people with disabilities \nwho receive disability insurance payments and unemployment compensation \npayments are double dipping. They claim this is a loophole; that \nsomehow people who receive both are scamming the system. This is not \ntrue. This is simply not true. SSDI, Social Security disability \ninsurance, is designed to address the needs of people with \ndisabilities. Unemployment insurance is designed as a partial, \ntemporary replacement of income for people who lost jobs through no \nfault of their own. They are two separate programs with two separate \ndesigned benefits. It is possible for an individual to be eligible for \nboth.\n  How can this be? First of all, we have to disabuse ourselves of what \nwe keep hearing on the Senate floor from my friends on the Republican \nside. They keep talking about disability insurance as though, if \nsomeone gets Social Security disability insurance, then they are unable \nto work. That is not true. That is simply not true. SSDI is set up as \nsystem to give some support while looking for work--or get a job and \nsupplement that.\n  Under the law, people who qualify for SSDI, Social Security \ndisability--I will just say disability. People who qualify for \ndisability insurance can work and are encouraged to work, and they can \nmake up to $1,070 a month without losing their SSDI. Why is it? Because \nwe\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nwant people to work to the best of their ability--especially when they \nhave a disability. People with disabilities also want to work.\n  Keep in mind the SSDI Program is not a freeloader program. When you \nwork and get a paycheck, they take out FICA taxes, which is the Federal \nInsurance Contribution Act. There are three parts of it. You pay to an \ninsurance program for Social Security, old age, and survivors. It is \nindemnity insurance so when you get old, you get a check. Most people \nthink of it as Social Security. The second part is hospital insurance, \nor Medicare. The third part is disability insurance. If you don't work \nand you haven't paid your FICA taxes, you don't get SSDI.\n  Listen to this. An adult becomes eligible for disability insurance \ncompensation when they have worked at least 10 years. You have to work \nat least 10 years and at least 5 years prior to getting Social Security \ndisability, and you have to have earned at least $4,800 a year. You \nhave to earn at least $400 a month for 5 years before you even qualify.\n  So this idea that I keep hearing about, oh, someone works for 4 \nweeks, and then they go out and file for disability and are on \ndisability for the rest of their lives is nonsense. That is not true. \nYet we keep hearing these stories going around and around. You will \nhave worked at least 10 years and will have had earnings during at \nleast 5 of the previous 10 years prior to receiving it, and you have to \nhave made at least $4,800 a year before you qualify.\n  Then let's say you do become disabled and file for disability. What \nis your chance of getting it? One out of three. For every three persons \nwho file for Social Security disability insurance compensation, only \none out of three actually gets it. Why is that? You have to go through \na long evidentiary process--a medical evidentiary process--and the \nadministrative law judge is going to send you back to get further \nopinions. So it is not something you just file and you get it. Only one \nout of three qualifies for it.\n  That is why if a person works and pays taxes--your FICA taxes--and is \nthen laid off, they can get unemployment. But if they also qualify for \ndisability insurance, they should get that if they paid into the \nsystem. People with disabilities who work and pay into that system can \nalso be eligible for unemployment compensation. Why shouldn't they get \nthat?\n  Listen to this. If we deny people with disabilities their right to \nthe insurance they have paid for, we are discriminating against a group \nof people in a way that no other group is singled out. In other words, \nwe are discriminating against you just because you are disabled. How do \nyou like that? Is that what we are about? We are going to discriminate \nagainst you just because you are disabled. Because if you are not \ndisabled, you won't be discriminated against. If you are not disabled, \nyou will get your unemployment compensation. You might even be eligible \nfor some other government programs, such as section 8 housing or \nsomething like that. We don't take that away.\n  God forbid you become disabled and you are working--you are disabled, \nyou get a disability check, and you go to work. You can work and make \nup to $1,070 a month. You are providing a little bit of extra income so \nyou can live independently and maybe provide a few things for yourself. \nBut you, and only you--if you get unemployment compensation, we are \ngoing to take away your disability payments. Only you. Nobody else. \nNobody else is denied their full unemployment compensation. Under the \nbill we have, only people with disabilities will be affected.\n  Let me provide a real-life example of what this means to a real \nperson. I will call him Henry. This is a real person. Henry lives in \nthe District of Columbia. Henry has a disability. He is deaf, and he \nhas other health problems on top of being deaf. But Henry worked. He \nworked for 10 years. He worked and paid his taxes, but then in his \nthirties, because of other health reasons, he couldn't continue to work \nfull time so he went on disability and qualified for it. So now he is \nmaking $740 a month on his disability insurance--$740 a month. Well, he \ncan earn up to $1,070 a month, as I said, under the law and still get \nthat. He can't work full time, but he likes to work. He wants to work. \nHe wants to be a productive citizen, so he went out and got a part-time \njob consistent with his disabilities. He makes $950 a month.\n  If you add $950 and $740, you get $1,690 a month. Big deal. But I can \ntell you what that $1,690 does for him. It allows him to live \nindependently. It allows him to provide some payments for a support \nsystem. It allows him to sign up for cable TV. It allows him to go see \na movie once in a while and maybe even go out and have a hamburger--\n$1,690 a month. That is what Henry was doing.\n  Henry became unemployed. But now mind you, every month he worked and \nmade $950 a month, he paid his FICA taxes every month. Now he is \nunemployed. Well, what happens? He went on unemployment compensation \nand he gets $520 a month. He gets $740 for disability, $520 for \nunemployment, which adds up to $1,260 a month. It is a little over $400 \nand some less than what he was getting when he worked full time. Still, \n$1,260 a month allows him to live independently. It allows him to \nsupport himself.\n  Under the amendment that is in this bill, here is what happens: He \ngets his $520 in unemployment, but his disability is reduced to $220 a \nmonth. Now Henry is getting $740 a month. What is he going to do? He \nwon't be able to afford his apartment, let alone have cable TV. I don't \nknow if Henry has cable TV. But $740 a month?\n  No other person working in America and paying their FICA taxes is \ntreated like that--no one. And they still aren't unless this amendment \nis adopted, and then we will discriminate against you simply because \nyou are disabled. I mean, you wonder what people are thinking about.\n  Yes, I have compassion for those who are unemployed. I would like to \nsee our economy improve. We have to extend unemployment benefits but \nnot at the expense of people who are on the lowest rung of our ladder--\npeople with disabilities, who have paid into the system, and who have \nbecome unemployed. Henry wants to work. He wants to work. He wants to \nmake that $950 a month. Pernicious? Pernicious? That is just a fancy \nway of saying it is abominable that we would even consider it.\n\n  Henry is not double dipping. He is not scamming the system. He is not \na slacker. He is not defrauding anybody. He is only getting what is \nrightfully his because he paid into the program. If people with \ndisabilities are earning income, as Henry was, and paying into the \ndisability insurance program, they should be eligible for that just as \nany other citizen who paid into that program. Again, to do otherwise \nwould be to discriminate against someone just because they are \ndisabled.\n  One of my proudest moments in my history here in the Senate--indeed, \nin the entire Congress--is when I stood on this floor as a chief \nsponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. When we passed \nthat and President Bush signed it into law, the cheers went up. It was \npassed 25 years after the passage of the great Civil Rights Act of \n1965. That was sort of the emancipation proclamation for people with \ndisabilities. Because of that law, we have encouraged people with \ndisabilities to work. They want to work. Now we want to break down the \nbarriers, provide for accommodations and transportation and ramps and \nwiden doors and all the other factors that make it possible for people \nwith disabilities to get a job and go to work. It changed the system.\n  I can remember when we had the hearings. We had people come in and \ntestify. Employers said they would hire people with disabilities, but \nsometimes they don't show up for work and this and that. Well, I looked \ninto it, and I found out they couldn't get on the bus because the bus \nwasn't accessible. How are they going to get to work? They couldn't \ndrive because they were in a wheelchair and they couldn't get on the \nbus. So we changed it. We made the buses and the metro accessible. \nEverything is accessible now. People with disabilities are working, and \nthey want them to work.\n  Now we are saying to them, you can work. Like Henry, you can work, \nand you should. If you qualify for disability insurance, you can get \nyour disability insurance and make up to $1,070 a month because we \nwould like you to work if you want to work. But if you are like Henry \nand pay into the system and become unemployed, you will go\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nfrom $1,690 to $740 a month simply because we are discriminating \nagainst you. What kind of signal does that send?\n  That is why this provision is opposed by members of the entire \ndisability community, Arc, the National Disability Rights Network, the \nNational Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives, \nAmerican Association of People with Disabilities, and on and on and on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter expressing \nopposition to this proposal from these groups be printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that this article from in the L.A. Times \nbe printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  As I pointed out, you hammer the disabled to pay for unemployment \nbenefits? You sometimes wonder.\n  I want to be clear about one thing: I don't ascribe bad motives to \nanybody in this body--not in the least. As a matter of fact, I am told \nthere will be a motion to strike this provision when we vote on the \ncloture on this tomorrow, and that is good. I hope it is generally \nsupported by everyone here. So I don't ascribe bad motives, but what \nhappens sometimes is we don't think these things through. Someone \nstarts this thing, and they say these people are double dipping and \nscamming the system, and all of a sudden it sounds--oh, my gosh, yes.\n  But when you look into it and examine it, and you see these people \nhave been paying their FICA taxes--they have been paying their taxes. \nBut you say because you are disabled, you don't get it if you become \nunemployed.\n  We are busy around here, and we look at different things, so there \nare no bad motives. I take the floor to set the record straight and to \nlet everyone know just what is at stake. Do we really, truly want to \ndiscriminate against 117,000 Americans? That is what the General \nAccounting Office said in a study done a couple of years ago--that \nthere were about 117,000 Americans at any one time who are getting \ndisability insurance as well as unemployment.\n  If Henry's health improved, and he was able to get a full-time job, \nhe wouldn't get his disability. He would go back and start earning \nmoney full-time. So are we saying that somehow we are going to take \naway their incentive to work? No, I don't think so. I think it is just \none of those things that comes up and people say they are double \ndipping and they are scamming the system. But, no, that is not what is \nhappening at all. They pay into the system. It is insurance. They pay \nfor it. They ought to receive it, and they shouldn't have their \ndisability payments reduced because they are getting unemployment. They \nare two separate programs.\n  So I hope two things happen. I hope we can get cloture on the bill to \nproceed to extend Federal unemployment benefits. But I also hope all of \nmy colleagues will see the error of this part of the amendment and move \nto strike it. Fundamentally, it is the only right thing to do. So I \nhope we will do that. I hope we will begin to take a look more and more \nat disability insurance in terms of what it means, how it operates. The \nnotion that, somehow, if a person gets disability insurance they cannot \nwork--that is not true. A person can work. If a person is able to work, \nthey can earn up to $1,070 a month without losing their disability \npayments.\n  So I hope as we go forward, we will begin to shed more light and have \na more enlightened discussion on this program and how it operates and \nwhy it is so essential to ensure that people with disabilities are not \ndiscriminated against in a manner that no other part of our society \nwould be, if this provision were left in the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Consortium for Citizens\n\n\n                                            with Disabilities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2014.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators:  The undersigned members of the Consortium \n     for Citizens with Disabilities are writing to express our \n     opposition to proposals to eliminate or reduce Social \n     Security Disability Insurance (DI) benefits for individuals \n     who concurrently receive Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits \n     as a partial offset for extending the Emergency Unemployment \n     Compensation (EUC) program.\n       The DI and UI programs have been established for different \n     purposes and largely serve different populations. As \n     highlighted in a 2012 report by the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO), less than one percent of individuals served by \n     the DI and UI programs receive concurrent benefits.\n       At the same time, receiving UI and DI is not inconsistent. \n     This has been the long-standing position of the Social \n     Security Administration and of the courts. Individuals who \n     receive concurrent benefits do so because they have \n     significant disabilities that make them eligible for DI, and \n     because they have also attempted to work at a low level of \n     earnings but have lost their job through no fault of their \n     own. According to the GAO, the average quarterly concurrent \n     benefit in fiscal year 2010 was about $1,100 in DI and $2,200 \n     in UI for a quarterly average of about $3,300 in total \n     benefits.\n       These benefits can be a lifeline to workers with \n     disabilities who receive them, and their families. We are \n     concerned about any cuts to these already modest benefits, \n     and about the prospect of worsening the economic security of \n     workers with disabilities and their families at a time when \n     the economy continues to struggle.\n       Finally, we believe that changes to our nation's Social \n     Security system should be carefully considered as part of \n     discussions about how to strengthen Social Security, and that \n     benefit cuts to Social Security should not be considered as \n     part of offsets for other important benefit programs.\n       In closing, while we strongly support extending the EUC \n     program, we oppose amendments to partially offset the costs \n     by eliminating or reducing concurrent DI and UI benefits.\n           Sincerely,\n       ACCSES, The Advocacy Institute, The Arc of the United \n     States, Association of University Centers on Disabilities\n       Autism National Committee, Autistic Self-Advocacy Network \n     (ASAN), Community Legal Services, Inc., Brain Injury \n     Association of America, Disability Rights Education & Defense \n     Fund, Easter Seals, Goodwill Industries International, Health \n     and Disability Advocates, Lupus Foundation of America.\n       National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), National \n     Association of Disability Representatives, National \n     Association of County Behavioral Health & Developmental \n     Disability, Directors National Council for Community \n     Behavioral Healthcare, National Council on Independent Living \n     (NCIL), National Disability Rights Network, National Multiple \n     Sclerosis Society, National Organization on Disability, \n     National Organization of Social Security Claimants' \n     Representatives, TASH, United Cerebral Palsy, United Spinal \n     Association, World Institute on Disability.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the LA Times, Jan. 10, 2014]\n\n  An Awful Idea: Hammer the Disabled to Pay for Unemployment Benefits\n\n                          (By Michael Hiltzik)\n\n       It would take the pen of Jonathan Swift* to fully describe \n     Congress's willingness to beat up on the least fortunate \n     members of society to protect the richest. The latest example \n     is a plan to pay for a one-year extension of unemployment \n     insurance by cutting Social Security benefits for the \n     disabled.\n       This flinthearted idea has been endorsed by Senate \n     Democrats, of all people, who have written it into a proposal \n     that could reach the floor as early as Monday. Its chief \n     sponsor is Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., but it's got the support \n     of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid too.\n       Advocates for Social Security and for disabled workers are \n     in a fully justified uproar over this measure for two main \n     reasons: it uniquely burdens the disabled among all workers, \n     and it sets a terrible precedent of raiding Social Security \n     to pay for other social programs. As a coalition of disabled \n     advocacy groups put it in a letter to Sen. Tom Harkin, D-\n     Iowa, chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions, the measure would mean ``worsening the economic \n     security of workers with disabilities and their families at a \n     time when the economy continues to struggle.''\n       How crucial is this offset for the federal budget, you \n     fiscal hawks in Washington? It would save about $100 million \n     a year. That's less than three thousandths of a percent of \n     the annual federal budget. Sure, fiscal responsibility has to \n     start somewhere, but surely there are deeper pockets to mine \n     than those of disabled people struggling to make ends meet.\n       The offset, moreover, is based on the unjustified treatment \n     of disability pay and unemployment compensation as somehow \n     two sides of the same coin, so that receiving one should \n     disqualify you from the other.\n       The idea that disabled persons are ``double-dipping'' by \n     collecting wages or other compensation while also getting a \n     disability check is enshrined in conservative attacks on \n     disability. But it's untrue. The Social Security disability \n     program is designed as a bridge to full employment. Its \n     benefits aren't intended as a substitute for wages, but a \n     supplement.\n       As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities observes, \n     disabled beneficiaries can earn up to $1,070 a month in wages \n     this year without jeopardizing their benefits so they can \n     ``test their ability to return to work'' and ease their \n     transition back into the labor market.\n       The average monthly disability benefit was about $1,130 \n     last year and the average unemployment check $1,200, so no \n     one is getting\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\n     rich here. Add together the averages, and we're still talking \n     about poverty level income for a family of four.\n       The coalition of disability groups points out that the \n     unemployment and disability programs were designed for \n     different purposes and for the most part serve different \n     populations. But there is an overlap estimated at about \n     117,000 of the 8.9 million Americans receiving disability, \n     according to Rebecca Vallas of the National Organization of \n     Social Security Claimants' Representatives, a leading \n     advocacy group.\n       These are people who have passed through the very stringent \n     gauntlet necessary to qualify for disability benefits, and \n     they've also worked long enough to become eligible for \n     unemployment. There's no justification in law or logic for \n     offsetting one benefit by the other.\n       Vallas and other advocates are especially nervous that this \n     sort of proposal encourages lawmakers to view Social Security \n     benefits as a ``piggy bank'' to pay for other social \n     programs. ``It's death by a thousand paper cuts to call this \n     a pay-for'' to cover the expansion of unemployment insurance, \n     she says.\n       But the idea is becoming disturbingly common in Washington. \n     The disability-unemployment offset also appeared in President \n     Obama's 2014 budget proposal, which called it a ``smart \n     reform . . . (to) root out duplicative or wasteful \n     spending.'' (The budget hasn't been passed.)\n       It's anything but a ``smart reform'': it's a hacking away \n     at the safety net for the disabled and unemployed that only a \n     Scrooge would contemplate. The very idea that we should bill \n     the disabled to pay for benefits for the jobless suggests \n     that our national standards of fairness and civilization have \n     fallen very, very low indeed. This is a proposal that should \n     die in its crib.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

As the longtime co-chair of the Senate National Guard \nCaucus, I have the honor of advocating for the amazing men and women of \nthe National Guard and of supporting their role in protecting our \nNation, both at home and abroad. It is always a great pleasure for me \nto be able to point to the men and women of Vermont's own National \nGuard as an example of everything the National Guard does right. This \nweekend, a battalion of the Vermont National Guard was honored with the \nArmy's prestigious Valorous Unit Award for their service in \nAfghanistan. I recognized the achievements of this acclaimed unit last \nweek here in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from today's Burlington Free \nPress commemorating the award ceremony held January 12 in Norwich, Vt., \nand the amazing service that led to the award be printed the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 13, 2014]\n\nCommended for Courage: Guard Unit, Combat Medic Honored for Actions in \n                              Afghanistan\n\n                           (By Sam Hemingway)\n\n       Three years after the Vermont Army National Guard concluded \n     its largest deployment since World War II, 600 members of the \n     mountain infantry contingent were given a Valorous Unit Award \n     on Sunday for their service in Afghanistan.\n       ``You served in a very hostile area,'' Brig. Gen. Brian \n     Carpenter told the soldiers as they stood in formation during \n     a ceremony at Shapiro Field House at Norwich University in \n     Northfield. ``For a unit to be recommended, as you are, takes \n     tremendous leadership.''\n       The award, the second highest award a military unit can \n     receive, honored the combat performance of the 3rd Battalion, \n     172nd Infantry while it was carrying out its 2010 mission in \n     Paktya and three other provinces in eastern Afghanistan near \n     the Pakistani border.\n       The unit was attached to the active Army's 101st Airborne \n     Division and stationed at the Herrera and Rahman Kheyl combat \n     outposts and at the Gardez forward operating outpost. The \n     unit is largely made up of Vermonters, but includes soldiers \n     from Maine and New Hampshire.\n       Also recognized during the ceremony was combat medic Sgt. \n     Michael Mulcahy, who was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor \n     for his bravery during a platoon ambush that claimed the \n     lives of two Guard soldiers, Sgt. Tristan Southworth of \n     Walden and Sgt. Steven Deluzio of Glastonbury, Conn.\n       Mulcahy who was assigned to the small Herrera outpost in \n     Paktya province, braved enemy fire during back-to-back \n     ambushes near Mullafatee village on Aug. 22, 2010, according \n     to a narrative detailing his exploits.\n       Carpenter, reading a portion of the narrative to soldiers \n     and attendees at the ceremony, described how Mulcahy ``led \n     the way uphill through accurate heavy volumes of enemy fire'' \n     in order to reach injured soldiers.\n       At one point, according to the narrative, Mulcahy used his \n     body to shield a wounded Southworth from heavy enemy fire.\n       ``Mulcahy moved with very little cover through RPG (rocket-\n     propelled grenade) and extremely heavy machine gun fire to . \n     . . Southworth,'' the narrative said.\n       After determining Southworth had died, Mulcahy again risked \n     his life to treat another wounded soldier.\n       Mulcahy, described by a colleague at the ceremony as a \n     ``very humble guy'' went up to Southworth's parents after the \n     ceremony. The three exchanged long, tearful embraces.\n       ``We are proud to know him,'' Julie Southworth, Tristan \n     Southworth's mother, said of Mulcahy after the ceremony \n     ended. She said the family had not met Mulcahy previously. \n     Mulcahy told Guard officials he did not want to be \n     interviewed.\n       Carpenter, speaking of the unit award, said the 172nd \n     Infantry carried out 4,300 combat patrols during the \n     Afghanistan deployment. Twenty-six members were awarded \n     Purple Hearts for injuries sustained during combat, he said.\n       ``Their expertise in bringing decisive combat power to bear \n     on the enemy wherever and whenever needed set the conditions \n     for overwhelming victory and represents a phenomenal \n     effort,'' the unit award narrative said in part.\n       The unit also served in the only province where no \n     civilians were harmed or killed during parliamentary \n     elections in 2010. Paktya's turnout for the elections topped \n     94,000, a 15 percent increase over its turnout in the \n     previous election.\n       The unit also worked on various economic development and \n     governance projects, and helped train Afghan army, police and \n     medics.\n       Attending Sunday's ceremonies were U.S. Sen. Bernie \n     Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., Gov. Peter Shumlin \n     and Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, who had spent the day before as an \n     honorary Guard member. John Tracy, a veteran and Vermont \n     office director for Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., represented \n     Leahy. All but Scott spoke briefly at the ceremony.\n       ``This is a really emotional day for me,'' said Lt. Col. \n     Robert Charlesworth, who was based at Gardez and oversaw the \n     172nd Infantry's operations in Afghanistan. ``To finally see \n     these guys and gals recognized for the accomplishments that \n     they had in Afghanistan is very satisfying.''\n       Charlesworth, who now works at the Pentagon as a staff \n     planner with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the gains made \n     by the infantry unit in Paktya have mostly held up since the \n     deployment ended.\n       He said the outposts at Herrera, Rahman Kheyl and Gardez \n     where the soldiers served have been either dismantled or \n     substantially altered since the unit left Afghanistan.\n       Charlesworth said he's hopeful for the future of \n     Afghanistan as the United States continues to withdraw combat \n     troops from the country and wind down its operations there.\n       ``It's a pretty pivotal moment in history right now in \n     Afghanistan,'' he said. ``We're in the final stages of trying \n     to put together our bi-lateral security agreement with \n     Afghanistan to try to solidify all of the gains we helped the \n     Afghans build over there. I think the next year is going to \n     be critical.''\n       During the course of Sunday's ceremony, one of the soldiers \n     in the unit collapsed as the result of an apparent seizure. \n     The proceedings were halted briefly while several soldiers \n     came to his aid. The soldier, who was not identified, was \n     able to walk under his own power out of the building. Maj. \n     Chris Gookin, the Guard's spokesman, said later Sunday he did \n     not believe the soldier had to be hospitalized.\n       Two other of the 600 soldiers who stood during the hour-\n     long event also grew faint during the proceedings and were \n     assisted by their comrades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S288-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S288-S289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BERNICE JOSEPH\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life \nand achievements of Bernice Joseph, who committed her life to improving \nour State through education reform and to ensuring the success of \nAlaska Native students.\n  As the vice chancellor and executive dean of the College of Rural and \nCommunity Development at the University\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\nof Alaska Fairbanks, Ms. Joseph played an important role in advancing \nuniversity services to Alaska Native and rural students throughout 160 \ncommunities within the State of Alaska. As a member of the university's \nsenior management, she was a respected leader throughout the University \nof Alaska system and throughout the State. It has been said that if it \nhad not been for Bernice and her work to build the College of Rural and \nCommunity Development, many would not have been able to earn their \ncollege degree.\n  From 1995 to 2000 Bernice served as assistant professor at UAF in the \nDepartment of Alaska Native and Rural Development. Prior to her work at \nthe university, Bernice served as deputy commissioner of the Alaska \nDepartment of Community and Economic Development, overseeing rural \ndevelopment programs as the tribal liaison and as a key advisor to \nGovernor Tony Knowles. She worked tirelessly to strengthen rural Alaska \ncommunities and was a conduit in bringing rural Alaska concerns to the \nattention of the administration. She also served her community in many \nways, including as a trustee for the Greater Fairbanks Community \nHospital Foundation.\n  As I reflect on her short time on this earth, I realize that she \nachieved so much. Bernice advanced our State's dialogue on Native \neducation. In her 2005 keynote address to the Alaska Federation of \nNatives, during which she summarized her journey as a leader, she said:\n\n       We are all too familiar with the statistics facing Alaska \n     Natives about educational attainment, suicide, alcohol and \n     drug abuse and the number of Alaska Natives in prison. \n     Education is the key to overcoming many of the barriers \n     Alaska Natives face. Yet, it must be an education that is \n     sensitive to Native Ways of Knowing.\n\n  She was tireless in working to help our State's leaders understand \nthat a strong cultural foundation and an education system that values \nAlaska Native knowledge are vital to the success of our Native \nstudents. One of her greatest joys was attending college graduation \nceremonies across rural Alaska.\n  Living in Fairbanks, and originally from Nulato, Ms. Joseph \nmaintained her personal connections to her heritage and culture. She \nwent to fish camp every summer and enjoyed moose hunting with her \nhusband. She did it all, from the bush to the boardroom and in 2012 was \nnamed citizen of the year by the Alaska Federation of Natives.\n  She will continue to be an inspiration to leaders, both current and \nemerging, throughout Alaska. The impacts of her contributions to ensure \nthat our education system is relevant to Native students will be felt \nfor generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S289-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S289-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Development.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S289-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S289, January 13, 2014, in the middle column, under the \nheading MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE, the following language appears: At \n1:53 p.m., a message from the .  .  .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: At 2:02 p.m., a \nmessage from the .  .  .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n       H.R. 2279.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 331.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 331) congratulating the Florida State \n     University football team for winning the 2014 Bowl \n     Championship Series national championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am going to take advantage of the fact \nthat the Senator from Alabama is here, because we are bringing forth \ntoday a resolution which will pass by unanimous consent, if the \nSenators from Alabama will so agree. The fact is that it was a \nmarvelous national championship game. Whichever won, it was obvious \nthat one was going to be No. 1 and the other one, as it turned out, was \ngoing to be No. 2, as it should have been, in the entire national \ncollegiate football program.\n\n  I want to tell the Senator how much I admire his university, Auburn \nUniversity, and that it is my privilege to speak on behalf of Florida \nState University, and there is no question, I knew that whoever ended \nup with the score by the end of the game, they were the national \nchampionship team and, lo and behold, did that score go back and forth. \nWith a little over a minute left, Florida State, led by their Heisman \nTrophy winning-quarterback, took it down the entire length of the\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nfield. It was a sight to behold. I just wanted to say those words while \nthe Senator from Alabama was here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think it is a remarkable achievement. \nSome people think our young people are not willing to work, not willing \nto discipline themselves, but those two teams played their hearts out. \nThey did not get there working at it a few weeks ago. They worked all \nyear in the weight rooms and studying, preparing themselves to reach \nthis high level of excellence that delivered a thrilling game for us \nall. Florida State is a terrific team. I think everybody knew Auburn \nwas going to have to be really up to speed to be able to compete--and \nthey were able to. The Senator is right, and I am pleased to note that \nour Heisman Trophy winner this year is a native of Hueytown, AL. We \nwill claim credit for that too.\n  Mr. NELSON. I concede that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Auburn drove down the field on that last drive, having \nto score to win the game, and just pounded away and Tre Mason ran down \nthere and ran over somebody and scored the touchdown. But you are a \nHeisman Trophy-winning team, and all of you pulled together and came \nback and won with a few seconds to spare. It was spectacular. You well \ndeserve the right to recognize them by resolution. I certainly will not \nobject.\n  I will add one more thing. Had Auburn won, it would have been the \nfifth consecutive year Auburn or Alabama had won the national \nchampionship. We would have liked to have seen that happen, but \ncongratulations go to Florida State. They deserved to win, and they \nplayed well enough to win and did win.\n  Mr. NELSON. This Senator is wearing a garnet and gold tie. I noticed \nthe Senator from Alabama is wearing a crimson tie, but certainly his \nallegiance is orange and blue, I take it?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Orange and blue. I celebrate them. I did have my Auburn \ntie on the day of the game. But I love Alabama; it is a fabulous \nprogram. I spent 3 years there and remain a big fan. I am maybe one of \nthe few people in the State who really, truly had a divided allegiance \nabout whom to be for. Those are super universities.\n  I would say to Senator Nelson, as I shared with him, I am really \nimpressed with the University of Florida where my grandson had some \ngreat surgery done by the finest doctor in the world, I believe, for \nthe condition he had. He has done so well. I know both of us are proud \nof the great institutions in our State.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, this resolution awaits unanimous consent \nby the Senate, which I assume will occur today. We tried it for last \nThursday night before the Senate adjourned, but I think everything has \nbeen cleared now. The resolution will commemorate the fact that Florida \nState is now the BCS champion. Senator Rubio and I have submitted the \nresolution. It commends the university for the 34-to-31 championship \ngame, which the Senator from Alabama and I have just talked about. It \ncaps a remarkable season of 14 and 0 for the Seminoles, led by head \ncoach Jimbo Fisher and his Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis \nWinston.\n  This Senator will concede to the Senator from Alabama that he is \noriginally from Hueytown, AL--which is not too far north of the Florida \nline. So, for all the players, the coaches, the students, the staff and \nindeed the fans--all of those of Florida State have made the university \nand the entire State of Florida very proud by winning this game in such \nan exciting, hard-fought and well-fought game.\n  I am grateful to our Senate colleagues for helping to agree to this \nresolution today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 331) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/13/senate-section/article/S298-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. REID.
