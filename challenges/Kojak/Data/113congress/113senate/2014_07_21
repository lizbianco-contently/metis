Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 5:30 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes each, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform.\n  At 5:30 p.m. the Senate will proceed to executive session and vote on \nconfirmation of the following nominations: Julie E. Carnes to be U.S. \ncircuit judge for the Eleventh Circuit; Michael Lawson to be Ambassador \non the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization; and \nEunice Reddick to be Ambassador to the Republic of Niger. We expect a \nrollcall vote on the Carnes nomination and voice votes on the Lawson \nand Reddick nominations.\n  It is such a shame that we have had to go through this stalling on \nMichael Lawson for the International Civil Aviation Organization. A \nterrible tragedy has taken place in the world--the shooting down of the \nMalaysian airplane with 290 totally innocent people on board, killing \nevery one of them. That is his job. We tried to get him confirmed last \nweek. No, they could not do that. We have tried to get him confirmed \nfor months. They have held him up every step of the way. It is untoward \nthat this is happening. They are holding up these nominations out of \nspite. That is too bad. This is a perfect example.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 2631\n\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that S. 2631 is at the desk and \ndue for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are facing a humanitarian crisis on our \nsouthern border. Thousands of migrants--the vast majority of them are \nchildren--fled to our border and other countries in the region to \nescape the growing violence in Central America. Most of these boys and \ngirls come from three countries--Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala--\nwhere crime and lawlessness have resulted in chaos and anarchy. \nHonduras is the murder capital of the world, with more murders per \ncapita than any nation on the planet. El Salvador and Guatemala are \nright behind. These statistics are stunning. In fact, we know that \nvirtually all the homicides in these countries take place in the same \ncities these kids are leaving. Migration has spiked in the neighboring \ncountries, not just the United States, as people try to escape this \nuntoward violence.\n  Citizens of these three nations, though, are also imperiled by high \nrates of human trafficking, drug trafficking, sexual assaults, and \nwidespread corruption. It is an understatement to say these are not \nsafe places in which to live or to survive. Here is an article out of \nthe New York Times, written by a woman by the name of Sonia Nazario, \nJuly 11--a new article. Here are just a few of the things she said:\n\n       Cristian Reyes, an 11-year-old sixth grader in the \n     neighborhood of Neuva Suyapa, on the outskirts of [the \n     capital], tells me he has to get out of Honduras soon--``no \n     matter what.''\n\n  He is an 11-year-old boy.\n\n       In March, his father was robbed and murdered by gangs while \n     working as a security guard protecting a pastry truck. His \n     mother used the life insurance payout to hire smugglers to \n     take her to Florida. She promised to send for him quickly, \n     but she has not.\n       Three people he knows were murdered this year. Four others \n     were gunned down on a nearby corner in the span of two weeks \n     at the beginning of this year. A girl his age resisted being \n     robbed of $5. She was clubbed over the head and dragged off \n     by two men who cut a hole in her throat, stuffed her panties \n     in it, and left her body in a ravine across the street from \n     Cristian's house.\n\n  ``I'm going this year,'' he said.\n  Think about what this woman wrote. Think about what this boy said. \nAfter hearing this, can anyone blame these boys and girls and their \nfamilies for doing everything they can to stay alive? One of the \neasiest ways to stay alive, even though it is really hard, is to leave.\n  One can imagine how bad things are in these squalid homes and \nneighborhoods if these children and their families are willing to trek \nacross dangerous terrain with little food, little water, putting \nthemselves at the mercy of bandits, thieves, coyotes, and cartels.\n  These kids are so desperate that when they reach our border, they \nimmediately surrender themselves to the first person they encounter. \nThey are not sneaking over the border. They are getting there for \nsafety. They are desperate.\n  The truth is that we have taken steps to secure our border. So \nregardless of what the American people may hear from the Republicans, \nthis is not an issue about bigger walls or more barbed wire or more \ndrones or more helicopters or more personnel on the ground or National \nGuardsmen. We have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. We have \ndrones patrolling the air--I think there are six of them. We are \ncatching undocumented immigrants and drug traffickers in record \nnumbers.\n  After visiting the Rio Grande Valley, one FOX News reporter--FOX--\nsaid: ``There is some evidence that border security, as it stands now, \nis actually working pretty good, pretty well.'' This is FOX, not a \nfriend of President Obama's. They never give him the benefit of the \ndoubt. But they said it is working pretty well, pretty good.\n  But if you do not want to take FOX News's word for it, just this past \nweekend two Democratic Senators and a Republican Senator went down to \nlook around, to see the crisis firsthand. One Senator asked a senior \nBorder Patrol official, ``Is it true that border security is better \nthan ever?'' That is a quote. He responded, ``It is true.''\n  How does this assessment compare to what we have heard from the \nRepublican Congress? This morning the Republican leader disagreed with \nour border enforcement official, claiming that the current crisis \nfurther illustrates how insecure the border is.\n  I repeat: These children are not sneaking over the border. They look \nto the border for safety. So whom would one believe--our Border Patrol \nofficials out their on the frontlines, a FOX News reporter who was \nthere on the frontlines, or the Republican leader? It is pretty clear \nwhere the weight of evidence is.\n  Finally, our border security is working so much better, but our \nBorder Patrol infrastructure is not equipped to care for tens of \nthousands of children. Barbed wire does not do that. High fences do not \ndo that. Virtual fences do not do that. Drones do not do that. \nHelicopters do not do that. What we need now are resources to \ntemporarily house and feed those children, administer deportation or \nasylum proceedings, and give border agents the necessary tools to keep \nour borders secure. They need to be temporarily taken care of until a \ndecision is made on what should happen to them. It has to be done in a \nhumane fashion.\n  Our challenge is to treat these children as children should be \ntreated, consistent with American values. The White House emergency \nsupplemental request does just that. If the Departments of Homeland \nSecurity and Health and Human Services do not get these resources, they \nare going to run out of money in a few weeks--out of money.\n  All we hear from the Republican Congress is blame. It is all the \nfault of Barack Obama. It is his fault. It is his fault these kids are \ncoming. It is his fault the border, I guess, is secure. They are coming \nand turning themselves in.\n  Congressional Republicans are suggesting that the thousands of young \nmigrants have come to America as a result of President Obama's 2012 \ndeferred action plan. They are saying that is the reason for all of \nthis trouble. But that is nonsense. This article I held up--a long \narticle--does not mention a word from anybody she interviewed that they \nare coming because of deferred action. They are coming because of \nfathers being robbed and murdered by gangs while they are working as \nsecurity officers and the other vile things that are happening to human \nbeings.\n  We need the resources to temporarily house and feed these children, \nto legally administer whatever proceedings are necessary, and give \nborder agents the necessary tools to keep our borders secure. I repeat: \nIf they do not get the resources, they are going to be out of money. \nThen what are we going to do? I guess the Republicans will blame Obama. \nIt is our job--our job. He cannot do it alone.\n  We have 45 obstinate Republicans who are not letting us get anything \ndone about anything, certainly not anything dealing with immigration.\n  Cristian, the boy from this New York Times article, as I said, does \nnot mention DACA at all. He does not mention DREAMers. He talks about \nthe violence he sees as a boy--with his eyes. These kids are fleeing \nHonduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala and are heading anywhere they can \nto escape the violence. They are not just fleeing to the United States; \nthey are going anyplace they can. They are heading to Panama, \nNicaragua, Costa Rica, and Belize. In those countries I have just \nmentioned, asylum claims have spiked 712 percent over the past several \nyears. Think of all the children who don't make it.\n\n  This crisis--the humanitarian crisis on our border--has nothing to do \nwith DREAMers--children who have lived most of their lives as Americans \neven though they were brought here illegally. Yet Republicans would \nhave us believe the two are inseparably connected. This is clearly not \ntrue.\n  The junior Senator from Texas is trying so hard to link these two \ngroups of children. In fact, the junior Senator from Texas is saying \nthat before he will agree to the White House supplemental request, \nwhich would give our Border Patrol the resources it needs to\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\ncare for these refugee children, President Obama must end the deferred \naction program.\n  We just read some legislation on the floor a few moments ago. That is \nwhat it is--no money for these poor boys and girls until, I guess, you \ndeport them--hundreds of thousands of people who are here because they \ndeserve to be here.\n  Republicans, in attacks such as this, are resorting to ransoming \nchildren to get their way, and that is shameful. The assistant \nRepublican leader, the senior Senator from Texas, who has authored \nlegislation to prevent any meaningful hearing process for migrant \nchildren, appears to support the junior Senator's plan. The bill put \nforward by the senior Senator from Texas implements a process that will \nsend these children back to dangerous places without some minimal \nconcern for their health and well-being. If people were treating \nanimals the way these boys and girls are being treated, they wouldn't \nsend an animal back to this, let alone a little boy or girl.\n  Neither of the plans put forward by the junior or senior Senators \nfrom Texas address the underlying issues. And what is the real issue?\n  The Presiding Officer has lived in South America. He is one of the \nfew Senators who speaks fluent Spanish. He is a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  So what is the real issue?\n  The Presiding Officer could tell us what the real issue is if he were \nable to speak now.\n  Why are these children arriving at our southern border. As Nobel \nlaureate Oscar Arias, who was President of Costa Rica and did a good \njob in an overwhelmingly bad situation, said yesterday in the \nWashington Post: ``The root cause is the violence and poverty that make \nthese children's lives at home intolerable.''\n  We hear that from the schoolboy's message to us. Deporting DREAMers \nalready here or speeding up the process for sending children who need \nprotection back to their crime-ravaged homes does not address the root \ncause.\n  In fact, it will only break up families who are already here and \nensure that we see these migrant children again in a few months if they \nsurvive, because they are not going to stay there. Many of them won't \nsurvive, but if they do, they will try to come back again until things \nbecome tolerable. Instead of playing a game of hot potato with \nthousands of innocent children, let's address the pressing needs we \nhave now, which is to treat these kids humanely.\n  I have had the good fortune of traveling in every country in South \nAmerica except Belize and Uruguay. Cuba is sending huge numbers of \nphysicians all over South and Central America; China has a lot of money \nand projects there.\n  We--because of the stringency of what is happening with our \nappropriations bills--took months and months to get a Peace Corps \nDirector. The Peace Corps helps, but without the Director it was kind \nof wobbly. The Agency for International Development has a good program, \nbut it doesn't have much money at all. We do very little to help those \ncountries.\n  We have Venezuela. Chavez ships hundreds and hundreds of teachers and \noil to those countries, and we do nothing. For a fraction of what we \nspend on our border, we could help those countries stabilize.\n  We need to get resources to our Border Patrol agents and others who \nare caring for these children from Central America. We need judges to \nhear these kids' cases and decide whether they need protection or need \nto be sent back home.\n  The world is watching how this great democracy of ours responds to \nthis crisis. Congress must act now and give the administration the \nfunding it needs to temporarily house and feed these boys and girls and \nreinforce the infrastructure to process thousands of asylum deportation \nclaims.\n  We had a big show not long ago where we provided $35 billion to help \nveterans. We have spent trillions of dollars in two wars--unpaid for, \nby the way. That is what President Bush wanted, and that is what he \ngot. He squandered the surplus we had--a surplus of over 10 years when \nhe took office that was trillions of dollars. But now we are being \nasked to spend a few dollars to take care of these people who have come \nback in need--as our veterans. Senator Sanders has been working for \nwell more than 1 month to get them to try to agree to something, and it \nlooks to me as if they are going to come back with nothing.\n  The conference has not been completed. Why? Because they have to \nspend money on these people on whom they were glad to spend money to \ntake them to war. But now they are back. They are missing limbs. They \nhave many post-traumatic stress problems, a lot of medical issues, and \nno money is there.\n  I am afraid that is where we are headed with this other situation. I \nam afraid we are headed to the place where either Republicans get to \ndeport all these DREAMers--what the Texas Senators obviously want--or \njust give these kids no hearings at all and just shove them back. It is \nnot fair.\n  The American people want these kids to be treated fairly. If the kids \ndon't belong here, let's have somebody decide they don't belong here \nand have somebody do what needs to be done. But to just ignore the \nissue and run out of money--what do we do?\n\n  What we should do is legislate. We are not doing that.\n  I have said on the floor a number of times--I repeat--for 5\\1/2\\ \nyears Republicans have opposed everything that President Obama has \nwanted--everything. That is what they set out to do 3 days after he was \nelected, and they have stuck by that. Scores of ambassadors' positions \nare not filled, and legislation has gone wanting.\n  They want to be able to show there is a Democrat in the White House \nand Democrats control the Senate, but the American people are not \nrealizing a small minority can stop us from doing everything--and that \nis what they have done with the so-called filibuster, hundreds of them. \nI only hope this November people will respond, as I believe they will, \nand say: This is enough.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 45 years ago yesterday the entire world \nwas riveted to their television sets--often a television image that was \ngrainy, black and white, and flickering--as we heard the report, ``The \neagle has landed.'' Then we saw Neil Armstrong come down the ladder of \nthe lunar lander, and that is when he made the famous statement, \n``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''\n  In the context of that day 45 years ago, unless one was of sufficient \nyouth to not have a memory, anyone will remember exactly where they \nwere and what they were doing, because that was an extraordinary time \nfor the entire planet. This Senator at the time was an Army lieutenant. \nAt the lift-off 4 days earlier, I had been in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and \nhad gone to the embassy asking if they had a television so I could \nwatch the lift-off in my hometown area of Brevard County where, from \nthis launch pad, my family had homesteaded under the old Homestead Act \nin 1913, working the land for years, eking out a living which, under \nthe Homestead Act, was a way of populating the country--particularly \nthe westward expansion but that was also the southward expansion, into \nunsettled lands like Florida. I have a\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\ncopy of that deed of 160 acres of land, signed by Woodrow Wilson to my \ngrandparents in 1917. That land sits today at the north end of the \nspace shuttle runway at the Kennedy Space Center. It is only a few \nmiles from the launch pad where Apollo 11 launched, and years later in \nthe early part of the Space Shuttle Program I had the privilege of \nlaunching with the crew of STS-61C.\n  But at that moment 45 years ago, I had gone into the embassy in \nBelgrade, and they did not have a television set that would show the \nlift-off. I asked if there was any way of getting a communication. They \nsaid: Go outside of the city on those high hills and stick up your \nshortwave radio antenna and get the BBC from London. My friends and I \ndid exactly that. When that rocket, the Saturn V, lifted off, there \nwere three young Americans screaming at the top of our lungs: ``Go, \nbaby, go.''\n  Four days later, I was on my way back to the United States and was \nstaying overnight in a London hotel. I got the desk to call me in the \nmiddle of the night, somewhere around 3:00, and turned on that \nflickering black-and-white television set to see Neil Armstrong come \ndown the ladder and issue that famous statement.\n  Today at the Kennedy Space Center is a ceremony commemorating that \nevent 45 years ago yesterday. I happened to bump into Buzz Aldrin \nyesterday at the Orlando airport as he was on his way to join with Mike \nCollins, who was the third of the three Apollo astronauts. They are \nthere today to dedicate the operations and checkout building at the \nKennedy Space Center to be named for the commander of that mission and \nthe first one to set foot on the Moon--Neil Armstrong. It is that very \nsame building where those astronauts were in quarantine before they \nwent to the launch pad, it is that very same building where so many of \nthe space missions have been prepared, and it is that very same \nbuilding, now named for Neil Armstrong, which is preparing the \nspacecraft that will be the forerunner of taking us in our next journey \nto another celestial body--this time the planet Mars.\n\n  That spacecraft, Orion, will be tested at the end of this year in a \nballistic reentry, going out some 30,000 miles, to come back in at a \nvery steep descent to test the new protective materials on the heat \nshield. In the old days we had an ablative material on the blunt end of \nthe capsule that would burn up on reentry coming through the fiery heat \nof reentry, 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Part of the heat shield would \nburn up. Today, they have much more high-technology techniques that \nwill repel the heat in order to save the crew, and that test will come \nat the end of the year.\n  When we shut down the Space Shuttle Program, most Americans felt as \nthough the human space program was shut down. That is not the case. We \nhave an orbiting national laboratory that is part of the International \nSpace Station, with two American astronauts and an international crew--\na total of six astronauts onboard, doing research right now, as they \nhave been.\n  As a matter of fact, to give a visual mind's-eye idea of how big this \nInternational Space Station is, it is 120 yards long. Visualize from \none goalpost and one end zone to the other goalpost, and that is how \nbig the International Space Station is, and six humans are on board \nright now.\n  We are already developing the rockets that are delivering cargo--\nAmerican rockets--and those rockets are now in a competition in NASA as \nto which ones will be selected to carry humans, and then all of the \nredesign, the redundancies of systems, the escape mechanisms, will be \nincorporated in order to make it safe for humans. We are expecting that \nfirst American launch of Americans onboard American rockets to be in \n2017. Then the American people will realize that we have been in space \nall along.\n  We can speak of the wonders of our space program--the Hubble space \ntelescope that has been on orbit carried by a human crew that has now \nunlocked the secrets of the universe. The follow-on telescope named \nafter the first NASA Administrator James Webb will peer back in time to \nthe very beginning of the universe and will bring us additional \nknowledge about how we got here and how it all started in this \nincredibly infinite thing called the universe, of which the cosmos as \nwe look out is so large we can't comprehend it.\n  Our space program is vigorous, and now we will move into a new era \nstarting right there in the building that is being dedicated today in \nmemory of Neil Armstrong, a building that will assemble the spacecraft \ncalled Orion which will launch with Americans in 2021 for the beginning \nof a mission that will capture a distant object--an asteroid--fly to \nit, rendezvous, explore it, as we start the systems, the methods, \nbuilding and creating the new technologies that will then allow us to \ntake a human crew all the way to the planet Mars, land them, and bring \nthem back safely to planet Earth.\n  So this is a day that we remember, and we remember an astronaut who \nwas taken way too early from us, because Neil was only 82 years old.\n  Although of the original seven, which Neil was not a part of, we only \nhave one left; that is, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the \nEarth, a former Senator of this body in his nineties. He looks \nterrific.\n  After the Mercury Program came the Gemini Program and then came the \nApollo Program, and that is the celebration that has just occurred, \ncelebrating 45 years. It is hard to believe it has been that long. Yet \nthat was a day the world stopped as they gazed, fixed on their \ntelevision sets, as a human from planet Earth set foot on another \ncelestial body. That was quite an accomplishment, but there is a lot \nmore to come.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join with \nSenator Walsh from Montana as he is leading us in the effort to pass \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act, which is pretty basic in terms of where our \nvalues and priorities are in terms of our tax policy.\n  I know we are in the process of determining whether to bring that up. \nHopefully we will do that. The American people say it is a no-brainer \nto bring up this bill and pass it. The reason, first of all, would be \nthe fact that people understand that we need a middle class. We \nessentially started the middle class 100 years ago. We started it with \nsome pretty basic policies in my State in 1914 when Henry Ford decided \nto invest in Detroit and Michigan and America and double the salary of \nhis employees so that they could afford to buy his automobiles. He was \nreally doubling down on America and on manufacturing in America. We \nhave seen multiple ways in which that took off and literally created \nthe middle class of our country.\n  Today we see the middle class under assault, folks working hard \ntrying to hold on. People who felt in the past that if they worked \nreally hard they could get into the middle class now feel as if the \nsystem is rigged against them.\n  We are really in a fight as to whether we are going to move forward \nand have a strong middle class. Every other country wants what we have. \nToo many countries have a few very wealthy people and a lot of \nextremely poor people, and they envy the middle-class economic engine \nwe have had in this country.\n  As we look at how we move forward to keep and expand the middle \nclass, we have to look for ways in which we can support our workers and \nour businesses that are investing in America. I believe our workers can \noutcompete anybody as long as the rules are fair.\n  There are a lot of ways we need to deal with the rules, but right now \nwe have a tax code that really puts a thumb on the scales against our \nworkers. At this point in time, after the last 10 years where we have \nactually seen 2.4 million jobs shipped overseas, we still have a tax \ncode where American taxpayers are footing the bill for this movement, \nwhich is stunning. I think every time I have talked to people about the \nfact that when a company packs up and moves, the workers, the\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\ncommunity, the taxpayers pay for that through write offs in the Tax \nCode, people say: You have got to be kidding. Why did we let that \nhappen?\n  Well, the Bring Jobs Home Act is a way to address that and to stop it \nfrom happening. Let me talk about the very specific and very simple \nways we do that. We would stop the taxpayer subsidies that pay for \nmoving costs. We instead would say to companies: If you are coming \nback, you can write off those costs. If you want to move back, you can \nwrite off those costs, and we will add an additional 20 percent tax \ncredit for the cost of moving, so you get an additional tax cut. So if \nyou want to come home, we are all for it. You can write off those \ncosts. You will get an additional tax cut. But if you want to leave \nthis country, you are on your own.\n  It is very simple. That is what this does.\n  Are there other things we need to do in the Tax Code? You bet. We \nhave very serious issues. More and more of our companies are using this \nprocess called inversion. It seems to me that a good place to start a \nfull discussion about how we have a tax code for America, that invests \nin America, that rewards American business and American workers, \nfamilies, communities, is to start with the Bring Jobs Home Act. Surely \neverybody on both sides of the aisle ought to be able to agree that we \nwould not pay for the cost of shipping jobs overseas through the Tax \nCode.\n  I also wish to commend a lot of companies right now that are actually \nbringing jobs home. It is exciting for me, being from a major \nmanufacturing State, to see that we are having a resurgence in \nmanufacturing. For a number of reasons--including lower energy costs, \ntransportation costs, and a resurgence in manufacturing--we are seeing \njobs come home. We are seeing manufacturers such as Ford and \nCaterpillar and GE, which have announced major investments in the \nUnited States, bringing jobs back from Japan and Mexico and China. This \nis good. We want that. There are smaller manufacturers that are taking \nadvantage of our skilled and ready workforce. Over 80 percent of the \ncompanies actually bringing jobs back are companies with less than $200 \nmillion in sales.\n\n  Companies are taking a look and they are coming back. We want to \nreward that. When they look at the Tax Code, we want them to see the \nright message. We want folks to see that, hey, you know what, if you \nare one of the good guys and you are bringing jobs home, we want to \ngive you some extra help--to pay for that with an extra tax credit. But \nwe also want to send a message to those who are thinking about leaving: \nOur Tax Code will no longer reward your leaving America.\n  I do not know how many times I have heard from workers saying they \nnot only are insulted by paying for the cost of the move through the \nTax Code, but oftentimes they are training their replacements from \nother countries. The replacements come over and they train them. I \nmean, this is craziness.\n  At a time when too many people have lost their jobs and are looking \nfor that fair shot--what is the next job, what is the next opportunity \nfor them--how do we make sure the Tax Code, our laws, and our \ninvestments work for Americans and give everybody a fair shot? That is \nwhat this is about. It is very much about making sure we have a fair \nshot for every American. Part of that is making sure that we have good-\npaying jobs in America and that our Tax Code is rewarding the creation \nof those good jobs and rewarding the companies that are bringing jobs \nhome.\n  I again thank Senator Walsh for his leadership. He has been very \nclear about how this affects his State of Montana and his concerns \nabout this issue. I thank all of those who are cosponsors and working \nwith us on this bill. I hope it will be brought up as soon as possible. \nThis is really an opportunity for all of us to show the American people \nthat we get it, that we are willing to work together on a bipartisan \nbasis to do something that is very simple and very straightforward and \nsay: As an American we are no longer going to pay for the move, and \nwhen you move jobs overseas, the Tax Code is not going to pay for that. \nBut we will stand together in supporting those efforts that help \ncompanies bring jobs home.\n  I hope when we do have the vote on this issue we will see a \nresounding yes from everyone. I know the American people would love to \nsee a strong bipartisan vote right now that would actually address \nsomething they care about deeply, which is the ability to have a good-\npaying job, to work hard, play by the rules, and have a fair shot to \nget ahead, which is what America has been all about. That is who we are \nas opposed to other places--the ability to have the opportunity to work \nhard and get ahead. Everybody needs to know that fair shot is still \navailable to them. The Bring Jobs Home Act is part of letting people \nknow it is.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4641-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4641-S4643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE ACTIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I wrote my colleagues a \nletter that had a serious front line about policies being executed, we \nare told, by the President that would seriously undermine the \nconstitutional structure of our Republic and give to the President \npowers that would allow him to take powers he had never been given.\n  Subsequent to that, a George Washington law professor, Mr. Jonathan \nTurley, remarked during recent congressional testimony:\n\n       When President Obama pledged to circumvent Congress [he was \n     referring to his State of the Union Address] he received \n     rapturous applause from the very body that he was proposing \n     to make practically irrelevant.\n\n  Professor Turley emphasized that the ``most serious violations, in my \nview, are various cases where he went to Congress, as in the \nimmigration field, as in the health care field, asked for very specific \nthings and was rejected and then decided just to order those on his \nown.''\n  He testified before a House committee. Professor Turley I think has \nbeen known as a Democrat. I think he said he supported President \nObama's election. He is not a partisan person. He is an observer who \nhas testified before Congress many times and is well respected, and \nthat statement should cause concern on the part of every Member of \nCongress.\n  Is it so? Is it so that he asked for the very specific things that \nwere rejected by Congress and he decided to just order them with his \npen on his own?\n  The primary immigration action Professor Turley was referring to was \nthe President's decision to implement the DREAM Act by fiat, providing \nadministrative amnesty and work permits to an entire class of illegal \nimmigrants.\n  Professor Turley described it as `` . . . the clear circumvention of \nCongress. And for Congress not to act in my view borders on self-\nloathing.''\n  Is that a serious comment? I think it is exactly right. He is exactly \nright on this. Has Congress no gumption at all?\n  Multiple news reports have now made it clear that the President is \nnow considering an Executive immigration action on a scale so far and \nindeed beyond our own imagination. Here is how that action was \ndescribed by the National Journal, a prestigious publication in our \ncountry. This is the poster. This is what the National Journal \nreported: ``President Plans To Expand Unilateral Executive Amnesty.''\n  Executive amnesty means the Chief Executive, the President, expanding \nExecutive amnesty including work permits for illegal immigrants and \nvisa overstays.\n\n       Obama made it clear he would press his executive powers to \n     the limit.\n\n  I would say well beyond the limit, according to Professor Turley. The \narticle continues:\n\n       He gave quiet credence to recommendations from La Raza and \n     other immigration groups that between 5 million to 6 million \n     adult illegal immigrants could be spared deportation under a \n     similar form of deferred adjudication he ordered for the so-\n     called Dreamers in June 2012.\n\n  The article is referring to the DREAM Act that the President \nexecuted. One of the things that I think is extremely important, \ncolleagues, is that what they are suggesting is that 5\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nmillion to 6 million people will be given a document that basically \nprovides them legal status in America. The article continues:\n\n       Obama has now ordered the Homeland Security and Justice \n     departments to find--\n\n  Ordered them to find--\n\n     Executive authorities that could enlarge that non-\n     prosecutorial umbrella by a factor of 10.\n\n  That is all with the DREAM Act. 10 times that which was done. \nContinuing:\n\n       Senior officials also tell me Obama wants to see what he \n     can do with executive power to provide temporary legal status \n     to undocumented adults.\n\n  This is 5 million to 6 million. That is what a factor of 10 means. \nThat is maybe more than half of the people who are illegally in the \ncountry today. Congress has considered these matters at great length \nand Congress set the law as to how someone enters the country lawfully \nand how someone enters the country, in effect, unlawfully and what is \nacceptable and what is not acceptable.\n  The President is the chief law enforcement officer in America. The \nFBI, DEA, Border Patrol officers, ICE officers, Attorney General all \nwork for him, and the leaders of those organizations serve at his \npleasure. He can remove them at will if they don't carry out his \npolicies.\n  He has ordered the Homeland Security and Justice Departments, to find \nExecutive authorities--not to see if they could find them but to find \nthem--because he has a policy he wants to carry out and Congress \ndoesn't agree with him.\n  I will read another poster quoting Professor Turley. He talks about \nthe danger, colleagues. This is dangerous.\n  Does anybody not respect this institution? Do we not respect the \nHouse of Representatives, the Senate? Have we become so partisan that \nwe don't care what the President does to diminish Congress? Don't we \nhave an institutional responsibility, a constitutional responsibility \nto defend the legitimate powers of Congress?\n\n  Sure, we can disagree sometimes, but this one is not a matter of \ndisagreement, it seems to me. This is an overreach of dramatic \nproportions.\n  Professor Turley said:\n\n       The President's pledge to effectively govern alone is \n     alarming, and what is most alarming is his ability to fulfill \n     that pledge. When a president can govern alone, he can become \n     a government unto himself, which is precisely the danger the \n     framers sought to avoid.\n\n  Certainly they sought to avoid that. They were very suspicious and \naware that the tendency of chief executive officers is to assume more \npower than they are given. So they created a strong Congress and they \ngave certain powers to Congress that could not be delegated to the \nexecutive branch.\n  Professor Turley, in his most recent testimony before the House Rules \nCommittee--I believe last week--said:\n\n       What we're witnessing today is one of the greatest crises \n     that members of this body will face . . . It has reached a \n     constitutional tipping point that threatens a fundamental \n     change in how our country is governed.\n\n  No matter what somebody thinks about immigration issues or health \ncare issues, there are limits on what the President can do without \nCongress.\n  So the President says: Congress will not act; therefore, I have to \nact.\n  Have you ever heard that? They used to say Federal judges would say \nthat. They would say: The legislature will not act. Governor King will \nnot act. The court has to act.\n  That is not so. That is so bogus. If a Governor decides not to act, \nif a Congress decides not to act, if a State legislature decides not to \nact and do what some President would like to see done, that is a \ndecision. It is every bit as real and firm a decision as if they had \npassed a law. If they are asked to pass a law and they say no, that is \na decision reached through the legislative branch by people duly \nelected from all over this country who come to this Congress to pass \nlaws.\n  I am very frustrated that my Democratic colleagues are not \nsufficiently concerned about it, and we certainly need more discussion \nfrom the loyal opposition, the Republicans on this question.\n  Do my Democratic colleagues express concern about it? Not that I have \nseen. They seem to celebrate it.\n  The newspaper, El Diario, quotes New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, \nsaying:\n\n       Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said Friday that he has ``no \n     doubt'' that President Barack Obama will deliver on his \n     promise to take executive action on immigration despite the \n     current attention on the unaccompanied minors crisis.\n\n  It goes on to be quoted there as saying:\n\n       One executive action that Senator Menendez and other \n     Democrats are pushing for is the expansion of Deferred Action \n     for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides deportation \n     reprieve and work permits to undocumented youth.\n\n  Colleagues, it is one thing to be less than vigorous in carrying out \ndeportations as the law requires; it is quite another class of action \nto give people who are unlawfully in the country a document from the \nPresident that says you can work and stay in the country--to give them \nlegal status when Congress has considered this and rejected it. It is \nbeyond the power of the President.\n  I wrote a letter to my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, before \nthis testimony about these planned executive actions that I had been \nreading about. I said they would amount to an--\n\n       . . . executive nullification of our borders as an \n     enforceable national boundary, [guaranteeing] that the \n     current illegal immigration disaster would only further \n     worsen and destabilize.\n\n  We cannot provide continuous amnesty on a regular basis and ever \nexpect everybody not to attempt to come to the country if they believe \nthey, too, in a manner of years--maybe now even fewer years--will be \nrewarded for their unlawful act by being put on a path to citizenship \nor permanent status.\n  So I therefore make two requests today:\n  I believe any border legislation that is sent to the Senate by the \nHouse of Representatives should include specific language denying the \nPresident any funds to execute his planned work permits. Congress \nclearly has that power. We can appropriate or not appropriate money. We \ncan say that money cannot be spent for this or that thing. So we have \nevery right to say the President should not spend money delivering work \npermits to people whom Congress has declared to not be lawfully able to \nwork in America. I believe the President's actions are in clear \ncontravention of the law, and I feel strongly about that.\n  Second, I am calling on every Senate Democratic colleague to stand up \nand be counted. Senator Cruz has a bill that would stop this \nPresidential overreach. It is very simple. It lays out that we won't \nspend money providing legal documents to people unlawfully in the \ncountry as defined by the law of America and as defined by the Congress \nof the United States.\n  So I ask: Will you cosponsor Senator Cruz's bill, and let us defend \nour constituents? Or, will our congressional colleagues remain \ncomplicit in the nullification of our laws and basically the \nnullification of border enforcement?\n  I would make a final note on what we owe to the citizens of this \ncountry. President Obama's illegal work permits add to the already huge \nflow of lawful work permits issued by the Federal Government. Between \n2000 and 2013, we lawfully issued almost 30 million work and \nimmigration visas. To put that number in perspective, 30 million is \nabout the entire population of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala \ncombined.\n  This matter and our situation today are in disarray as a result of \nconfused and politically driven thinking by this administration. It \njust is. I wish it weren't so, but it is. Obama administration \nofficials have gone so far as to describe amnesty as a civil right. \nThat is an argument against the very idea of a nation-state and the \nidea of a nation's borders. Of course there is, and can be, no civil \nright to enter a country unlawfully and then to demand lawful status \nand even citizenship. Of course there is not. How could this possibly \nbe, that the Attorney General of the United States of America would \nassert that people have a constitutional right to enter unlawfully and \nbe given amnesty? That is the kind of thinking which has got us into \nthis fix, and it has encouraged the flow of unlawful immigration.\n  The actual legal rights that are being violated here today I suggest \nare the rights of the American citizens.\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\n  As Civil Rights Commission Member Peter Kirsanow warned, our African-\nAmerican citizens often are the ones who are hurt the most, as well as \nrecent immigrant arrivals and working Americans. What about their \nrights? They have sweat and bled and died for this country, been called \non to serve and responded, paid their taxes, raised their children, \ntried to do the right thing day after day. What about their rights? \nWhat about the right of every citizen to the protections our \nimmigration laws afford? Will no one rise to their defense?\n  We need an immigration policy that helps all residents--including \nmillions of immigrants who have come to America. We want to help them \nrise into the middle class and above. We need rising wages, not falling \nwages. We can't help those living here today if we keep bringing in \nrecord numbers of new workers to compete for their jobs, to drive up \nunemployment, and then pull down wages. That is just a fact.\n  After decades of large-scale immigration, and with large illegal \nimmigration flows in addition, we need to get serious and establish a \nprincipled policy of immigration and consistently enforce it, a policy \nthat is honorable, that we can be proud of, and that serves the \ninterests of all Americans--especially working Americans. These are the \npeople who have made our country great. They deserve our attention and \ncompassion, too. Middle America has been decent and right on this issue \nfrom the beginning.\n  For 40 years American people have called on Congress and called on \ntheir Presidents to create a lawful immigration system they can be \nproud of that serves the national interests and serves their interests. \nBut what have they gotten? Nothing but more illegality and more demands \nfor amnesty. The leaders of their country have not listened to them, \nand they aren't listening now. It appears to me the leaders of this \ncountry are not very interested in what the American people think.\n  The President plans to dramatically exceed his powers. It is the \nlatest example of rejecting what the American people have asked for and \nit is a breathtaking violation of congressional power. It cannot be \nallowed to happen. We need to defend our Constitution, we need to \ndefend the rule of law, and we need to defend the powers of Congress--\nand, at bottom, to defend legitimate rights, interests, and desires of \nthe people who sent us here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know the Chair serves as a member of \nthe Budget Committee, as I am the ranking Republican on that committee. \nWe have gotten a CBO, Congressional Budget Office, analysis--our \nofficial scorekeeper of spending--on the part of the proposal the \nPresident has presented to spend $4.346 billion to deal with the \nSouthwest border crisis. What CBO has done is provided its cost \nestimates of the President's recent supplemental request for the \nSouthwest border.\n  Significantly, CBO's analysis suggests that only $25 million of the \n$4.346 billion request will be spent this year. This indicates clearly \nthat the agencies are not in dire need of supplemental funding from \nthis Congress, certainly not in the degree asked for.\n  Again, CBO's analysis suggests that only $25 million out of the $4.3 \nbillion request will be spent this year. What does that mean? It means \nwe ought to slow down. There is no basis to demand a $4.3 billion \nincrease in emergency spending. Every dollar borrowed--because we are \nalready in debt. To spend $4 billion more is to borrow every penny of \nit. We should not do that until we find out more about what is \nhappening at our border.\n  Twenty-five million dollars is a lot of money in itself. The Homeland \nSecurity and other agencies, Health and Human Services, have monies \nthey can apply to these problems.\n  I am not saying no money is needed now, because we want to treat \nchildren and be helpful and treat them in a humanitarian way and a \ncompassionate way. But we don't need $4 billion. That is clear. And we \nare not to be doing that. Thank goodness, the House of Representatives \nis looking at it carefully. They need to reject this request out of \nhand.\n  Colleagues, the fundamental problem here is that when the President \nof the United States did his DACA bill, when he did his DREAM Act \nExecutive order, what did he do? He basically said: We are not going to \ndeport young people. Then we began to see this surge of young people \ncoming to America, and we are not deporting them effectively. They are \nbeing taken in, turned over to HHS, found housing, turned over to \nwhoever comes and picks them up even if they are not citizens and not \nlawfully here. They are not being deported. So more have come in record \nnumbers.\n\n  I guess, first of all, the very idea that we would spend--I guess for \nthat project--$3.7 billion is a stunning amount of money. It is a huge \namount of money at a time when we don't need to be borrowing money more \nthan we have to. So I believe and would say to our colleagues, this \nplan does not call for the expenditure of money this year except for \n$25 million, and therefore we are not in a crisis that demands us to \nproduce billions of dollars in revenue for this President to continue \nto carry out policies that only encourage more people to come to \nAmerica and cost us even more in the time to come.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4643-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4643-S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, from the beginning of our Nation we have \nhad our challenges. We have had big challenges and little challenges, \nand somehow, some way, America has always risen to those challenges and \naddressed those in a way that was in the best interest not only of the \npresent generation but future generations as well.\n  During those times, it was not true that our leaders always saw \nthings the same way or agreed with each other 100 percent, but they saw \ngreater value in trying to solve the Nation's problems rather than just \nsaying: This is too hard; we can't agree, so we quit. That is not our \ntradition. That is not our heritage.\n  But looking at the present situation here in Washington, DC--and in \nparticular the Senate--I find myself sometimes wondering whether those \ndays have passed us by. I hope not, but I sometimes wonder whether the \nyouth of America will witness in their lives some of the great attempts \nto address our Nation's challenges they read about in their history \nbooks.\n\n  Right now we know we have an urgent humanitarian crisis on the U.S.-\nMexico border, more specifically in the State of Texas. I was back in \nMcAllen, TX, on Friday, and I was grateful to see a number of our \ncolleagues who were there: Senator Hirono, Senator Blumenthal, Senator \nMurkowski, as well as a number of House Members, seeing for themselves \nwhat the crisis consists of and exploring what might be some of the \npossible solutions.\n  I was meeting with Congressman Cuellar, who is from Laredo, TX, and \nwith a number of local officials in the Rio Grande Valley. Many of them \nhave expressed the same wish that I had expressed and Congressman \nCuellar had expressed. They wished the President would come down to the \nRio Grande Valley and see for himself what we have seen. We know he had \nan opportunity to do that a couple weeks ago and chose not to do so, \nbut they said the invitation is still outstanding. They would love to \nsee him. The least you think the President might consider doing is \ncongratulating the professional efforts of our Border Patrol and other \nlaw enforcement specialists who were down there doing an amazing job. \nOf course, FEMA and other Federal agencies are on the ground as well. \nThat invitation is still outstanding, and I think the President would \nbenefit from seeing this crisis for himself.\n  What I saw were children packed into detention facilities that were \nfilled to overflowing, some with only a single toilet in the room, and \nconditions you would not want your children to be in. We learned even \nmore about the horrific journey from Central America\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nthrough Mexico up to South Texas that many of these children had \nendured, and the truth is some of them didn't make it. Some of them who \nstarted this horrific journey from Central America simply died in the \nprocess. Those who did not die were subjected to horrific abuse, \nkidnapped, being held for ransom, women and girls being sexually \nassaulted enroute, because these corridors are controlled by \ntransnational criminal organizations is what we call them--in other \nwords, gangs, cartels--that view these children and migrants as \ncommodities.\n  For a long time they have been selling drugs because drugs make them \na lot of money. Now they realize they can transport children and adults \nbecause they make them a lot of money too. And if you just figure it \nout, if they can figure a way to move tens of thousands--or so far \n57,000 children since October of last year--at $5,000 each, that is a \nlot of money. So these criminal organizations are reaping riches as a \nresult of this sordid trafficking of human beings, and communities are \nbeing overrun and government resources are being strained.\n  The administration has said there is a humanitarian crisis, and I \nagree. They have also said--and this is Secretary Johnson among \nothers--that a loophole in a law passed in 2008 is one source of the \nproblem. Is it the only source of the problem? No, I don't think that \nis true. I think there is also an impression that somehow the United \nStates and this administration are less than fully committed to \nenforcing our immigration laws.\n  If you read the intelligence gathered by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity from many of the migrants, including children who have been \ndetained, many of them report being told there would be a permiso or \nbasically a permission slip or visa issued to them if they were able to \nmake it to the United States. So there is the combination of lack of \ndetention facilities and the requirement of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to turn these children and others over to Health and Human \nServices, but then they would be released based upon their promise to \nreturn at a future court date. This is what has been interpreted as \npermission to enter the country and stay.\n  So I know Secretary Johnson of the Department of Homeland Security \nunderstands the problem, although the President has a political \nproblem. Many of the President's most ardent supporters are saying: We \nhope the President will just request money, but in the end we hope he \nwill go even further with the deferred action Executive order that he \nissued in 2012 for the so-called DREAMers. Those are kids who obviously \ncame into the United States at a young age with their parents but are \nboxed in; while they can get an education, they cannot get a job.\n  Rather than asking for a solution to this problem, the President has \nindeed asked for a blank check, and I for one am not for giving it to \nhim. I am for doing what is compassionate. I am for treating these \nchildren and all immigrants and all human beings, for that matter, with \nthe dignity and respect they deserve by virtue of their status as human \nbeings. But we also need to realize that America cannot endlessly \naccept a flood of humanity from countries around the world who want to \ncome to the United States, especially through an illegal smuggling \nsystem that does not respect their dignity as human beings or our laws. \nWe simply cannot absorb or assimilate into America an uncontrolled flow \nof people from around the world.\n  Americans are the most generous people in the world when it comes to \nour immigration policies. We naturalize about 800,000 people a year, \naccept them into this great country and accept them as American \ncitizens. But we simply cannot allow this sort of uncontrolled wave of \nhumanity and expect to be able to deal with them in a dignified and \nappropriate way. We simply cannot continue to feed this business model \nof transnational criminal organizations and cartels that profit from \ntheir own criminality and for exploiting these children and other \nmigrants.\n  I know in this political environment putting forth a solution is \ntough because usually what happens is you get attacked from the right \nand the left, which usually tells you that you are probably doing the \nright thing. But it is worth the effort to try to find a solution to \nthis problem. It requires all of us to take our responsibilities when \nit comes to serving the public seriously; and it requires us to put \nforward solutions knowing that we are not going to come up with a \nperfect solution, but if we can come up with one that moves the ball 80 \npercent down the field, that is not bad. That is not a bad day's work. \nCertainly if we can help make somebody's life a little bit better or \nprotect them from some of the horrific consequences of inaction, it is \nworth it.\n  I have--as the Presiding Officer knows--partnered with one of my \ncolleagues in the House who happens to be a Democrat, Henry Cuellar, in \na bipartisan, bicameral solution to this human crisis. If somebody has \na better idea, we are all ears. But all I can hear is crickets. I don't \nhear a lot of other ideas. There are some and we ought to consider \nthose, but mainly I haven't heard anybody come up with another solution \nto this loophole that is being exploited by these transnational \ncriminal cartels other than the one that Congressman Cuellar and I have \nproposed.\n  There have been some who have expressed concerns about the \nlegislation. On the right there are some who have said this bill would \nmake it easier for unaccompanied minors to achieve legal and asylum \nstatus. That is wrong. The HUMANE Act, which is what we call this \nlegislation, would not change current law at all with regard to either \na claim for asylum or achieving legal status. It would, however, make \nsure that current law is actually enforced by speeding up court dates \nand the removal process for unaccompanied children who don't satisfy \nsome of these exceptions.\n  It is also worth reminding the American people that there are a \nnumber of fraud prevention measures in our current asylum laws that the \nHUMANE Act would not change, and--and this is important--more than 70 \npercent of those seeking asylum in the United States last year--more \nthan 70 percent of those seeking asylum last year in the United States \nwere ultimately not awarded that status. In other words, this is a \nrather narrow provision.\n\n  Some have also argued that the HUMANE Act would somehow expunge the \nremoval orders that were issued to minors who came to the country \nillegally during the current surge and have already been released to \nState-based family members or sponsors. What our bill would actually do \nis allow the U.S. Government to replace those removal orders with new \nnonappealable orders that would allow for an expedited repatriation \nprocess for the children who were not qualified for asylum status or \nwere not a victim of human trafficking.\n  On the left we have heard the claim that many of these children will \nnot obtain the necessary legal representation they need. Wrong again. \nThe HUMANE Act would not change current law which requires Health and \nHuman Services to ensure to the greatest extent practicable that legal \nrepresentation is provided for unaccompanied children.\n  I have not heard many of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwho actually supported the 2008 law unanimously complain about this \naspect; in other words, what they are complaining about now in terms of \ninadequate legal representation they actually voted for in 2008.\n  Some worry that this bill would be a vehicle for comprehensive \nimmigration reform, to which I would ask: Have you witnessed the \ndysfunction in the U.S. Senate? Do you actually think there is any real \nchance we will pass comprehensive immigration reform through both \nHouses of Congress this year?\n  Well, some have said there is also concern there are not enough \nprotections in the bill for children. Yet we have added protections \nthat don't already exist under current law, such as an expedited court \nhearing before a judge and for those credible claims, stronger \nsafeguards to ensure children are not released in the hands of \ndangerous criminals or those who would abuse them. So after identifying \na problem and a cause, one would think it would be easy for Republicans \nand Democrats, Congress and the White House, to come together on a \nsolution. You would think that would be something we would do at a \nminimum in\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\nfulfilling our job description. Sadly, the President has not seen fit \nto come forward to embrace the solution that is in front of him. \nIndeed, from press accounts we have learned that while he understands \nthe nature of the problem, as does Secretary Johnson, and what would be \nnecessary to fix it, the President simply does not want to disappoint \nsome of the more radical activists who essentially say we ought to open \nthe floodgates to people from anywhere around the world and let them \ncome in at their will.\n  Well, I am discouraged to hear the remarks of the majority leader \nwhere he said he is not optimistic that we will be able to address this \nissue constructively and find a solution before we recess in August. I \nwould think that would be a matter of some urgency because as we have \nseen since 2011, these numbers seem to double every year. In other \nwords, they start out relatively low. They doubled from 2011 to 2012, \nfrom 2012 to 2013, and from 2013 to 2014. It is estimated there could \nbe as many as 90,000 unaccompanied children detained at our southern \nborder this year. So if it is 90,000 this year and we don't do anything \nabout it, what will it be next year--180,000?\n  This is a bad situation that we have within our capacity to address \nif we can find a way somehow to do so, but it is going to take a \nPresident, it is going to take a majority leader, and it is going to \ntake all of us who choose not to just take the easy way but to take the \nhard way, one that will lead to a solution to this humanitarian crisis. \nIt won't happen just by throwing money at it without offering any real \nreforms that will actually fix what is broken in the 2008 law.\n  I close on this note, again, to plead with my colleagues: If you have \na better idea, please come and tell us about it. We may want to embrace \nit. Is this perfect? No. Does this solve all that is broken in our \nimmigration laws? No, it does not. This is a narrowly targeted solution \nto a national crisis and one that will, hopefully, positively impact \nthousands of children.\n  For those who want to see more, I would say this is a moment to do \nwhat we can, when we can and to show we are serious about the job of \ngoverning and coming up with responsible solutions.\n  If we can demonstrate to the American people we can actually do that \non a bipartisan basis and fix this, relatively speaking, smaller but \nnevertheless urgent problem, maybe we can earn their trust enough to \ntackle some bigger problems in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4645-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4645-S4646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate begins debate on \ntransportation funding this week, it is clear to me that all sides--\nDemocrats and Republicans--agree that what is needed most is a long-\nterm plan for rebuilding our country's infrastructure.\n  The reality is we simply cannot have big league economic growth with \nlittle league infrastructure. Unfortunately, all over our country, we \nhave potholes and sinkholes, and one of the reasons we are not seeing \nthem filled is because there is no long-term plan or a plan that \nprovides certainty and predictability for all sides--local government \nand businesses and developers and others--to know the funding will be \nthere.\n  As we start the discussion that is going to go through the week about \na bipartisan plan to go forward on transportation funding--as Senator \nHatch and I and the Finance Committee have brought before the Senate \ntoday--I want all sides to know it is our view that to get to the long-\nterm road, you have to have a short-term path, and that short-term path \nis what Senator Hatch and I have pulled together on a bipartisan basis \nwhich we hope our colleagues will support before the week is out.\n  I think all of the Senators understand what is at stake here. \nAllowing the highway trust fund to run dry would slam the brakes on \ncritical infrastructure projects across the land. Let's be clear: It is \nnonnegotiable that Congress will prevent that from happening. No \nSenator wants State and local governments to have to pick and choose \nwhich projects move forward and which ones are to be set apart because \nCongress didn't do its job before the August break.\n  The reality is a transportation shutdown would be horrendous news for \ntens of thousands of construction workers facing layoffs. The damages \nwould ripple throughout our economy. Businesses would have a tougher \ntime getting products to market and customers through their doors. \nCommuters would spend more time sitting in traffic and burning through \ngas. Car owners would have to fork over more cash to replace their \ntires and fix their broken suspensions.\n  With all Americans having something at stake, Congress must act, and \nthat is why it is so important, in my view, to pass the bipartisan PATH \nAct--Preserving America's Transit and Highways Act--this week.\n  As I have indicated, the Finance Committee came together on a \nbipartisan basis to advance this legislation to the Senate floor. \nSenator Hatch and I met regularly on this matter throughout the spring \nto reach a solution. When I first proposed a draft of a chairman's mark \nand announced a committee markup, Senator Hatch and the Finance \nCommittee's Republicans asked for more time to reach a bipartisan \nconsensus, and I agreed. We continued to talk almost each day, with our \nstaffs in constant contact. Every member of the committee pitched in. \nWhen the committee reconvened to consider the modified legislation, it \npassed with virtual unanimity. This is a truly bipartisan plan.\n  Our colleagues in the other body have offered their own legislation. \nI wish to take a brief moment to highlight some of the differences \nbetween the two bills that, in my view, are quite important. As part of \nour effort to reach a bipartisan agreement, the Finance Committee \nagreed to adopt several of the funding sources proposed by the Ways and \nMeans Committee. Those sources included customs user fees and pension \nsmoothing. The Finance Committee's bill leaves room for customs user \nfees to continue to support vital trade programs. In the committee's \nview, that is an important tradition to protect.\n  The Finance Committee's legislation also leaves room for revenue from \nthe pension smoothing provision to help secure multi-employer pension \nplans that face insolvency.\n  Finally, the Finance Committee's legislation draws some revenue by \nimproving the enforcement of tax laws that are now on the books. I \nbring this up because I have seen some inaccurate accusations about \nwhat these enforcement provisions would do. Let's be clear: These are \nnot new taxes. They are not tax increases. In fact, the Finance \nCommittee even received a letter from Grover Norquist and the group \nAmericans for Tax Reform saying so. Mr. Norquist is not soft on the \nquestion of tax increases, and he has indicated that these provisions \nare not tax hikes. What these provisions do is crack down on tax cheats \nand ensure that mortgage lenders provide homeowners with more tax \ninformation than they are usually getting today.\n  By contrast, it is my view that the other body not only missed an \nopportunity to strengthen tax compliance, but also weakened the \nsolvency of pension plans and leaves no funds in reserve to address \nthat problem down the road. The House approach for paying for \ntransportation funding creates another funding problem for pension \nplans that Congress will have to solve in the future. In effect, as one \ncolleague indicated to me, we have one challenge on our hands in terms \nof transportation, and if we now take the House approach, we will have \ntwo challenges on our hands: transportation and pension.\n  The Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, decided through the \nPATH Act to come to the Senate floor as the transportation shutdown \napproaches with tens of thousands of jobs on the line and advance a \nbipartisan proposal.\n  What is needed next after this legislation has passed and is safely \nin the rearview mirror is what I touched on at the outset: a long-term \nplan that would rebuild America's infrastructure and end the cycle of \nstopgap funding. That will require more than the bare minimum of fixing \nthe highway trust fund. Even in the best of times when there is no \nthreat of a transportation shutdown--we are making a little league \ninfrastructure investment of less than 2 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct.\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\n  Our big league competitors are going a different route. In parts of \nCanada they put 10 percent of GDP into infrastructure projects, and \nChina invests almost as much.\n  With such a small investment, it is getting harder for our country to \nmaintain the transportation system it has, much less take up new \nprojects that would help America compete with the world's other \nheavyweight economies.\n  For example, in our State the poor condition of many roads costs the \naverage driver almost $175 per year. There are more than 1,300 bridges \nfunctionally obsolete, and more than 400 bridges are structurally \ndeficient. The bill for repairs will only grow and grow as Congress \nwaits to get serious about infrastructure.\n  We ought to look at managing the transportation system like owning a \ncar. Responsible car owners don't let them fall into disrepair. They \nchange the oil, rotate the tires, and fix the transmission when it is \nneeded. It is all part of responsible ownership. Some day, if you want \nto resell the car or give it to your child, the car will be in good \nshape. It is time for this generation to be responsible owners of \nAmerica's transportation system.\n  The challenge in the weeks and months ahead will be to find policies \nthat can sustain the highway trust fund for good while finding new ways \nto draw investment dollars into American infrastructure. Priority one, \nin my view, ought to be to bring private capital off the sidelines and \ninto the game on transportation. With interest rates as low as they are \ntoday, now is the time to act.\n  In that regard, I wish to commend my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Hoeven, who has joined me in just such an effort. We call them \nTRIP bonds, transportation and regional infrastructure projects, to get \nmore private capital into infrastructure. Senators Warner, Blunt, and \nBennet have tried another approach.\n  As Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, I say to colleagues that \nall of the long-term approaches will be on the table when we get over \nthis short-term challenge this week.\n  Our colleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul, has a very important idea \nwith respect to transportation, which is to look at repatriation. \nSenator Schumer, my seatmate on the Finance Committee, has another \napproach. The point is that all of these promising ideas--each of which \nhas the opportunity for bipartisan support--deserves consideration, and \nas Chair of the Finance Committee, I commit this afternoon to do that.\n  When the Committee approved the PATH Act, there was unanimous \nagreement to work together on a long-term solution to our \ninfrastructure challenge. I have talked with a number of Senators on \nboth sides, and the message is clear: The Senate is ready to act. This \nwill not become another extender issue with Congress kicking the can \ndown a crumbling road again and again.\n  I will close with this. We have an important job to do this week. I \nhope we will continue the Finance Committee's bipartisan work and pass \nthe PATH Act so we can protect thousands of construction jobs and end \nthe threat of a transportation shutdown.\n  Some people have said there is no time and no room for compromise \nwith our colleagues in the House--that the House is saying, it's our \nway or no highway. I disagree. By working together, our colleagues in \nthe House and the Senate can reach a bipartisan agreement very quickly, \nand then we will move on to the next challenge and solve our \ninfrastructure crisis for the long term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to start with my support of the \ncomments of the Senator from Oregon. We need to get a highway bill done \nthis week, and I look forward to working with him, particularly on a \nlong-term plan with some of the concepts he has put forward. We need it \nfor our infrastructure across this great Nation. Again, I look forward \nto working with the Senator in that endeavor and express my thanks.\n  I rise to speak on the issue of Ukraine and the need to address that \nsituation and address it with a long-term strategy.\n  Last week Russian separatists shot down a Malaysian airliner with 298 \nsouls on board. Innocent people were killed because Russia wants to \ncontrol Ukraine--if not all of Ukraine, certainly Eastern Ukraine.\n  The Obama administration is struggling to respond. President Obama \ntalks about the need for Vladimir Putin and Russia to be accountable. \nMeanwhile, Russia continues to deny what is going on. Putin continues \nto arm Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine, separatists led by \nRussian special forces, military operatives armed and directed by \nMoscow.\n  We need to respond. Our country needs to respond, and we need to \nrespond with a long-term strategy and not just talk and not a short-\nterm strategy, and that is something we can do. We can respond, and we \nneed to respond with a long-term strategy.\n  We can lead with strong sanctions against Russia--sanctions that \nwould truly affect the banking sector and other sectors of their \neconomy in a meaningful way. We can help Europe follow us with these \nsame sanctions. We can help them by providing energy to the European \nUnion.\n  Europe is dependent on Russia for its energy. I brought some charts \nto depict the situation. The first chart shows countries in Europe and \nhow many of them get all or a very large share of their natural gas \nfrom Russia. So they are dependent on Russia for their energy, and that \nis an incredible source of strength for the Putin regime.\n\n  Here we see--I know it is somewhat difficult--all of these pipelines \ncoming out of Russia through Ukraine and into the European Union, \nsupplying all of that energy to these European countries. Because of \nthat, we see all of these countries that are dependent on Russia. That \nis an incredible source of strength and power for Russia, and it is \nholding up Europe from engaging in the kinds of sanctions that could \nreally stop Russia--stop the Russian economy and stop President Putin \nin his tracks.\n  We can break that trend and we can break that stranglehold by \nallowing more LNG--liquefied natural gas--exports from our country. We \nhave the companies right now, today, that want to build LNG export \nfacilities, but they are being held up from doing so.\n  I wish to go to my third chart. This isn't all of them, but right \nhere there are 16 companies--13 on our coast, 3 in Canada--and 1 of \nthese actually has received conditional approval. But here are 13 \napplications for companies that want to build LNG facilities to export \nnatural gas, and they are being held up. All of these have been held up \nsomewhere between 1 and 2 years. They can't even get permitted or \napproved by the Department of Energy to build those facilities.\n  What are we talking about? Let me give a specific example of one of \nthem--a company my colleagues have probably heard of--ExxonMobil. They \nwant to build a $10 billion facility at Sabine Pass in Texas. I just \npointed this one out on this chart right here, in this area on the \ngulf. They are ready to go right now. They have been in the application \nprocess for maybe 1 or 2 years, and they think they are maybe halfway \nthrough it. So they have another year or 2 years before they can build \na $10 billion facility that will move natural gas. They will bring it \nright into the UK, right into Europe. Why aren't we green-lighting this \nright now, today? Why do we continue to hold this up?\n  Some critics say it is going to take them some time to build it. \nWell, of course it is going to take some time to build, but the faster \nwe get these projects permitted, the sooner they are going to get \nbuilt. The reality is they will not only have an impact as they are \nable to move gas into the market, they will have an impact today \nbecause those European countries will know these other sources of \nsupply are coming.\n  Also, Vladimir Putin knows we are serious about providing alternative \nenergy to Europe, and I think that will make a big difference in terms \nof strengthening the European countries' readiness to join us with the \nkinds of sanctions we need to truly make a difference.\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\n  Two weeks ago I introduced legislation to do exactly what I am \ntalking about--the North Atlantic Energy Security Act. The cosponsors \ninclude Senator McCain, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Murkowski, who is \nthe ranking member on the energy committee. Senator Barrasso worked to \nput a lot of the legislation together. Senator McCain has always been \nvery active in the Ukrainian situation. Together we put together this \nbill with a lot of pieces of this legislation that have already been \npassed in the House--already passed the House. Quite simply, it will \nenable us to produce more natural gas, move it to market, and export it \nto our allies. It increases onshore production of natural gas. It \nallows us to gather it and move it to market, and it allows it to be \nexported.\n  Quite simply, what does that enable us to do? Well, States such as \nmine today are flaring off, burning off $1.5 million a day of natural \ngas because we don't have a market for it. So we just burn it. We just \nburn it because we can't get the kind of legislation we have developed \npassed. We can't get it to the floor for a vote. So instead of taking \nthat natural gas--millions of dollars a day--that is going up in smoke \nand moving it down to these facilities and over to our allies, we are \nburning it.\n  It would be better for our economy. It would create jobs. It would be \nbetter for our environment. It would create jobs. It would certainly be \nbetter for our economic growth. It would create revenues to deal with \nthe debt and deficit without raising taxes--just through economic \ngrowth. It would make a big difference for the national security of our \ncountry and our allies. It is common sense. What are we waiting for? \nLet's get beyond just talking about what needs to be done in Ukraine \nand let's get going. Let's get going with a long-term strategy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER.

Mr. President, I wish to subscribe to the views of my \ncolleague from North Dakota on the importance of developing our great \nresource of natural gas and turning it into a liquefied form and \nsolving a lot of the problems we face around the world. I also commend \nSenator Hoeven and Senator Wyden for the exchange they had briefly a \nfew moments ago on a bipartisan approach to funding our infrastructure \nproblems in the immediate and in the long-term sense.\n  I note, as I move to the topic of ObamaCare, the absence of any such \nbipartisan accord during 2009 when the Affordable Care Act was being \ndebated in the Senate. Thus, we have what in April of 2003 Senate \nFinance Committee Chairman Baucus called a huge train wreck. He was \nright in seeing the train wreck coming on the rollout of the Web site, \nbut it also has turned out to be a train wreck in far more ways than \nthe Web site glitches and the ultimate fiasco.\n  The train wreck of the affordable health care act continues in the \nway the law is affecting health care coverage and the way it is \naffecting the pocketbooks of American families. These families were \nflatly told their health care premiums would go down. They were not \ntold their health care premiums would moderate; they were told their \nhealth care premiums would go down. Instead, we have all of the \nproblems we are facing with regard to ObamaCare in the way it affects \nwomen, in the way it affects wage-earners, and in the way it affects \npeople who are looking for full-time employment. Frankly, the ObamaCare \nlaw continues to drag down our economy and our chances for economic \ngrowth.\n  Instead of seeing premiums drop by $2,500 on average each year as \nPresident Obama promised, families and individuals are spending more of \ntheir hard-earned dollars on health care costs under this so-called \nAffordable Care Act. The sticker shock will only worsen, and it is \ngoing to happen right around the corner.\n  In recent weeks several States have announced preliminary estimates \nfor next year's premiums. The Wall Street Journal reports that many of \nthese States' largest health insurers plan to increase premiums by \nbetween 8.5 percent and 22.8 percent. These are annual increases coming \nup right around the corner of 8.5 percent up to 22.8 percent. For many \nAmericans, this means either paying a lot more or simply not being able \nto have coverage at all. The administration is trying to downplay the \ncosts, but it is clear that once again ObamaCare is failing to live up \nto its billing.\n  Some States are particularly vulnerable to higher rates next year \nbecause of low enrollment among young adults or because few insurers \nhave joined the exchanges. For example, in my home State of Mississippi \n94 percent of enrollees are eligible for Federal subsidies, which means \nwe have little competition to drive down rates. According to this \nyear's numbers, my home State of Mississippi already has the third \nhighest premiums in the Nation, and we can't afford them. Competition \ncannot flourish when the government is involved in setting mandates for \nbenefits and controlling rates. Without a market-based approach, which \nI advocated in 2009, consumers lose out on choice and cost.\n  Particularly hardhit by the President's health care law are women and \nyounger wage earners. With regard to women, for example, they are more \nlikely to pay higher out-of-pocket costs under ObamaCare with plans \nwith high deductibles because they typically visit the doctor more. As \n57 percent of the part-time workforce, women are also more likely to \nhave their hours cut because of the employer mandate.\n  I note that the employer mandate is increasingly unpopular among \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  Additionally, the law's limited physician networks have forced many \nwomen to choose different specialists for themselves and their \nchildren, thus making it less convenient for these women to get care \nfor themselves and their children.\n\n  Stories from women across the country underscore these difficult \nrealities. Last year a woman from Columbus, MS, wrote to tell me that \nher original health care plan was $500 per month before it jumped to \n$1,500 a month because of the ACA.\n  One woman from North Carolina gave this reaction to unaffordable \npremiums. She said:\n\n       I've never worked this hard in my life. But I'm gonna \n     continue working every day and keep hitting the books at \n     night. I'm just trying to keep my head above water.\n\n  Another woman from Texas who could not find an obstetrician who would \naccept her insurance said this:\n\n       It was mind-numbing, because I was just sitting there \n     thinking, I'm paying close to $400 just for me to have \n     insurance that doesn't work. So what am I paying for?\n\n  Women make approximately 80 percent of the health care decisions in \nAmerica. More choices and lower costs would give them the flexibility \nthey need to get the right insurance plan.\n  With regard to younger workers, they are generally healthier but earn \nless, and they are faced with daunting realities because of the health \ncare law. Specifically, younger workers are forced to pay higher \npremiums to subsidize coverage for older Americans.\n  I was contacted by a constituent from Greenville, MS, whose healthy \n27-year-old son lost his health insurance because of ObamaCare. The \ncost of his coverage went from $70 per month to nearly $350 per month \neven though the benefits improved only slightly. Although this young \nman had health insurance for 7 years, since he was 20 years of age, he \nis now questioning whether he can afford it.\n  Finally, all Americans are affected by a health care law that \ndestroys jobs. Last month the economy added 288,000 jobs, but only a \nfraction of them were full time, as we know. The Obama economy is a \npart-time economy. Millions of Americans want full-time work.\n  The President's health care law was pushed through with no bipartisan \ninput and in defiance of public opinion. After the Massachusetts \nspecial election, this Senate should have gotten the message that we \nneeded to regroup and rethink this disastrous law, but the majority \nparty pushed forward regardless. So it is no surprise that the law \nremains deeply unpopular today. According to a recent poll, 55 percent\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nof Americans wish it had never passed and 44 percent said America is \nnow worse off because of the ACA.\n  In summary, under the affordable health care act women are worse off, \nyounger workers are worse off, and people seeking full-time jobs are \nworse off.\n  Elections have consequences, and November will be no different. The \nAmerican people have an opportunity to change the course of this \ndisastrous law in 106 days.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the honor to chair the U.S. \nHelsinki Commission, which is well known for its commitment to human \nrights. It is also our participating arm in the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE.\n  Starting when I first joined the Helsinki Commission almost 20 years \nago, I worked on the issues of antisemitism and trying to deal with \ncombating antisemitism. This is overt actions against Jews and Jewish \ninstitutions, which were on the rise. We tried to do something about \nit. In the early 2000s, working with Congressman Hoyer and Congressman \nHastings and Congressman Smith and others, we made a commitment in the \nHelsinki Commission to bring up the increasing episodes of antisemitism \nand what we needed to do about it.\n  We saw increased episodes of violence against Jews and Jewish \ninstitutions. We saw that world events were used to try to justify \nantisemitic activities. As a result of the work of the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission, the OSCE determined that it was important enough to do a \nspecial conference on antisemitism. In 2004, we had the Berlin \nconference on antisemitism under the leadership of the United States \nand Germany.\n  I was proud to be a member of the U.S. delegation to the Berlin \nconference. Good work was done in that conference. We developed best \npractices, from dealing with Holocaust education, to police training to \ndeal with identifying hate crimes. We had the first uniform collection \nof hate crimes statistics in the OSCE region, the responsibility of \nleaders to speak up against antisemitic activities. We provided \ntechnical assistance to countries to deal with antisemitism and to \nshare their best practices. We also recommended a special \nrepresentative to the chair in office, to put a spotlight on \nantisemitism and ways to combat it.\n  Today Rabbi Andrew Baker is that special representative to the chair \nin office. The chair in office this year is the Swiss chair in office.\n  Tomorrow, I will chair a Helsinki Commission hearing that deals with \nantisemitism, racism, and discrimination in the OSCE region. There are \nnow three special representatives, one to combat antisemitism, one to \ndeal with discrimination against Muslims, and one to deal with racism, \nxenophobia, and other forms of religious intolerance. They are all \nrelated. We find that hate crimes are hate crimes; that if a community \nis susceptible to antisemitic activities, it is also susceptible to \nanti-Muslim activities or activities against a person because of their \nrace.\n  There is reason to be concerned. There is reason to be concerned \nabout the rise of antisemitism today. This is 10 years after the Berlin \nconference. Last year the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency surveyed all \nof the EU countries. The results were alarming. Forty to forty-eight \npercent of the Jewish respondents felt it was not safe for them to \nremain in their country. We are talking about in Hungary, France, and \nBelgium. In those three countries, ranging between 40 and 48 percent, \nthey were considering emigrating to Israel because they did not feel \nsafe in their own country.\n  These fears are not without justification. The Anti-Defamation League \nsurveyed over 100 countries and documented persistent antisemitic \nprejudice. In the EU elections extremist parties espousing antisemitic \nactivities made remarkable progress. In Hungary and Greece extremist \nparliamentary parties associated with street militias were successful \nin elections.\n  In Hungary the extremist party Jobbik is the second most significant \nparty and had erected a monument to a wartime leader and a self-\ndeclared antisemite. We also found laws passed in Europe that make it \nmore difficult for Jews to practice their religion because of \nrestrictions on being able to make kosher foods and making it difficult \nto wear head coverings.\n  We have seen, unfortunately, violent acts. In Kansas, in the United \nStates, three people were murdered outside of a JCC. In May, in \nBrussels, three people were murdered at a Jewish museum. I mention this \nbecause even as we visit Europe today, we see signs of antisemitism. It \nis troubling to all of us.\n  This is the 10th anniversary of the Berlin conference coming up this \nyear. We will be reconvening the OSCE states in order to evaluate the \nprogress we have made over the last 10 years and additional progress \nthat needs to be made. The Helsinki hearing tomorrow will give us an \nopportunity to concentrate on how the United States can continue to be \na leader on this very important issue.\n  I wanted to share those comments with my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate will be \ncalled upon to confirm the nomination of the Honorable Julie Carnes to \nthe 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Georgia. I stand, along with \nmy colleague Senator Saxby Chambliss, the senior Senator from Georgia, \nto commend Ms. Carnes to the entire body as an outstanding appointment.\n  I thank the President. Senator Chambliss and I recommended Ms. Carnes \nwhen the openings took place on the 11th Circuit Court. He, with the \nadvice of Kathy Ruemmler, his able assistant in the judicial part of \nhis advisory board, brought the nomination forward to the Judiciary \nCommittee of the Senate. I thank Pat Leahy, the Senator from Vermont, \nthe chairman of that committee, and Chuck Grassley from Iowa, the \nranking member of that committee, for doing a judicious hearing, for \ngiving all sides a chance to be heard, and for commending unanimously, \non a voice vote, Julie Carnes to the Senate.\n  I am not going to talk for a long time, but I want to make a couple \nof very special points. Julie Carnes is a very special lady. For 22 \nyears she has been a judge for the Northern District of Georgia, and \nthe last 5 years she has been the senior judge. Before that she was on \nadvisory panels for judicial sentencing and many other technical and \njudicial issues.\n  Her nomination is the nomination of someone with immense capacity, \noutstanding integrity, and outstanding ability. She is just the type of \nperson the Presiding Officer and I would want to go to the bench. She \nis, as we call them in Georgia, a ``double dog.'' She graduated from \nthe University of Georgia with her undergraduate degree and got her \njuris doctor degree from University of Georgia Law School, whose emblem \nis a bulldog. We call her a ``Double dog.'' She is an outstanding \nindividual and will be an outstanding judge on the bench.\n  But there is a point of personal privilege I want to take for a \nminute. Up in heaven right now, at a sunset, Charlie Carnes is looking \ndown, about to see his daughter Julie confirmed to the United States \n11th Circuit Court.\n  Charlie Carnes was my mentor in the Georgia General Assembly for 12 \nyears before he was appointed to be a State court judge in Fulton \nCounty, the largest county in the State of Georgia. Charlie is looking \ndown on the daughter he is so proud of, and he is so proud that she is \ngoing to be confirmed by the Senate to one of the highest court \nappointments she could possibly achieve.\n  She is a chip off the old block. She is proof that an apple does not \nfall far\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nfrom the tree. Charlie was an outstanding Georgian, an outstanding \nAmerican, an outstanding member of our State and our bar and our bench. \nI am so proud to be a part of those who recommended this nominee to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I yield for my colleague, Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator \nIsakson today in support of Judge Julie Carnes, who has been nominated \nby the President to serve as a circuit court judge for the 11th \nJudicial Circuit.\n  Judge Carnes has been a Federal district court judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia since 1992. She has been the court's chief judge \nsince 2009. Her time on the district court has prepared her well for \ngoing to the 11th Circuit.\n  However, her preparation started long before she was confirmed to her \ncurrent seat on the Northern District bench. For starters, being a \njudge is in her blood. As Senator Isakson referenced, her father \nCharlie Carnes was many things to many people. He was a Navy veteran, a \nState legislator, and a loving father. But for those of us in the \nGeorgia legal community, from whence I came, we remember him best for \nhis 20 years of service as a Fulton County State court judge, the last \n17 years of which he served as chief judge.\n  After growing up in Atlanta, Judge Julie Carnes attended the \nUniversity of Georgia where she earned both her bachelor and her law \ndegrees. She then went on to clerk for Judge Lewis Morgan on the old \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once she finished her clerkship, she \nserved as an assistant U.S. attorney for more than a decade before \nassuming her position on the Northern District court bench. It is \ndifficult to imagine a more qualified circuit court nominee than Julie \nCarnes.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee appears to share my confidence. She \nwas reported out by voice vote without a single objection to her \nnomination.\n  Moreover, this is a seat that needs to be filled, and it needs to be \nfilled quickly. The 11th Circuit is the third busiest circuit in the \ncountry. Senator Isakson and I have been working very closely with the \nWhite House to address this vacancy since it came on 2 years ago.\n  Julie Carnes is my dear friend. I have known her for many years. She \nis the consummate trial court judge, receiving accolades from every \nsingle sector of the bar that regularly appears before her. Senator \nIsakson and I worked very closely with the President, as he indicated. \nWe also worked with Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley and Kathy \nRuemmler, the White House counsel, whom I particularly commend, someone \nwho was very persistent. She was very professional in all of her \ndealings with us. It was a real pleasure to work with the White House \nsecuring a number of nominees, the first of which to come to this floor \nfor confirmation is Judge Julie Carnes. This has been a long and \narduous process, but there is no questioning its results.\n  I am pleased to recommend this highly qualified nominee. I urge my \ncolleagues to support her confirmation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4649-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                             Infrastructure\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very proud to be on the floor this \nevening with colleagues for whom I have a great deal of respect. We \nhave been working so hard across party lines to call the Nation's \nattention to the problems we are facing funding our transportation \nsystem. We all know there are many things in the world we cannot \ncontrol and many things that are causing tremendous frustration.\n  I went home this weekend and my constituents came up to me and said: \nSenator, we cannot even look at our television sets with the tragedies \nthat are unfolding. They feel, as I do and I know our President does, \nthat the tragedies we are witnessing have been born out of historic \nanimosities, and it is very difficult. If we could wave our wand and \nmake things better in all of these areas, we would do so. We will try, \nand we will push. We are having a meeting with the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and we are going to move to speak sanity to the world. There \nis a crisis we can avert and there is a problem we can solve, and that \nis fixing the highway trust fund shortfall.\n  For those who don't know, the highway trust fund was created by \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. He created the trust fund, and it \nwas a brilliant move because he realized and said that we are \ndeveloping an Interstate Highway System. He said, this is one country, \nand we have to be united, a physically united country, so we can move \ngoods and people and make this country work. Since then, we have always \nhad bipartisan support for the trust fund.\n  Why is it in trouble? The trust fund is in trouble because the \nFederal tax gas receipts have not kept pace with inflation and the \nrising cost of keeping highways and bridges safe. Some of our bridges \nare well over 50 years old. I have lived a while, and I can tell you \nthat when you get a little older, you need a little attention, and the \nfact is our infrastructure is aging and we have to pay attention to it. \nThis is not the time to walk away from this crisis.\n  Some may wonder why Senator Boxer is showing a photo of a football \nstadium. This is actually a picture of one of the Super Bowls. There \nare 100,000 people in this photograph. Do you know there are 700,000 \nunemployed construction workers? They would fill seven of these \nstadiums. The good news is there used to be 2 million unemployed \nconstruction workers at the height of the recession. We have gotten it \ndown to 700,000, but we still cannot afford this.\n  What is the economic impact of the failure to act? It is pretty \nsimple--millions of jobs. Because you have the construction jobs, and \nthen you have all the benefits to communities when we have the workers \naround there--whether it is our cities, being able to have restaurants \nthat are filled, and all the kinds of things which happen when you put \npeople to work in a community.\n  Millions of jobs and thousands of businesses depend on the highway \ntrust fund and those businesses and those workers are counting on us. \nYou may say: Is there really a problem? Well, 70,000 of our bridges are \nstructurally deficient. Keep these numbers in mind in case you are \nasked about it at a party--70,000 bridges are deficient and 700,000 \nconstruction workers are unemployed and 50 percent of our highways are \nin less than good condition.\n  Is this a frivolous issue we are talking about here? The 2012 Urban \nMobility Report from Texas A said the financial cost of traffic \ncongestion in 2011 was $121 billion, or about $818 per commuter. Of \nthat total, about $27 billion was wasted time and diesel fuel from \ntrucks moving goods on the system.\n\n  A 2013 survey by the National Association of Manufacturers says 65 \npercent answered that our infrastructure is insufficient.\n  I will tell you some of the ideas to fix it. I am not just out here \nsaying words. I have ideas on how to fix it. One of the ideas was put \nforth by Senators Murphy and Corker. We will hear from Senator Corker \nin a moment.\n  One of their suggestions was to modify the gas tax to meet current \nneeds, and that is pretty straightforward. We have been doing this \nforever. It is very simple and supported by the Chamber of Commerce and \nsupported by just about everybody.\n  There is another way to do it that was thought of by the Republican \nGovernor of Virginia. I support this. Let me be clear, I will support \nall of these measures.\n  The second suggestion is to replace the existing cents-per-gallon gas \ntax with a fee on the wholesale price of gasoline from the refinery. I \nlike that because it is a broader way to pay for it.\n  I drive an electric hybrid, and as a result, I don't fill my car very \noften. In 2 years we filled it up 4 times. I am not paying my fair \nshare. This would be a more broad-based fee.\n  The third suggestion is repatriation, which is a very interesting \nconcept, and I know Senator Paul supports it. It is complicated in \nterms of the way it scores, but the fact is it would bring in $23 \nbillion over the first couple of years, and it would give a break to \nsome of our businesses.\n  So many of my colleagues spent so much time on this. I will not go on \nexcept to read the names of the supporters of this legislation.\n  The supporters of the proposal that Senators Murphy and Corker have\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\nproposed are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AAA, the American Trucking \nAssociation. This is huge.\n  Also, we have received letters from so many people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter I received \ntoday from Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and 11 of his \npredecessors who served 7 Republican and Democratic Presidents--\nJohnson, Ford, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and \nObama--printed in the Record. They all wrote an open letter saying that \nwe need to pass a long-term transportation bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Public Affairs, \n                             July 21, 2014]\n\n Open Letter From Secretary Foxx and 11 Former DOT Secretaries Urging \n           Congress To Address Long-Term Transportation Needs\n\n                           (By Ryan Daniels)\n\n       Washington.--As Congress considers legislation to avoid a \n     shortfall of the Highway Trust Fund, Transportation Secretary \n     Anthony Foxx and 11 of his predecessors offered the following \n     open letter to Congress. In addition to Secretary Foxx, \n     Secretaries Ray LaHood, Mary Peters, Norman Mineta, Rodney \n     Slater, Frederico Pena, Samuel Skinner, Andrew Card, James \n     Burnley, Elizabeth Dole, William Coleman and Alan Boyd all \n     signed the letter. Their message: Congress' work doesn't end \n     with the bill under consideration. Transportation in America \n     still needs a much larger, longer-term investment. The text \n     of the letter is below:\n       This week, it appears that Congress will act to stave off \n     the looming insolvency of the Highway Trust Fund The bill, if \n     passed, should extend surface transportation funding until \n     next May.\n       We are hopeful that Congress appears willing to avert the \n     immediate crisis. But we want to be clear: This bill will not \n     ``fix'' America's transportation system. For that, we need a \n     much larger and longer-term investment. On this, all twelve \n     of us agree.\n       Taken together, we have led the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation for over 35 years. One of us was there on day \n     one, at its founding. We've served seven presidents, both \n     Republicans and Democrats, including Lyndon Johnson, Gerald \n     Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George \n     W. Bush, and Barack Obama.\n       Suffice it to say, we've been around the block. We probably \n     helped pave it. So it is with some knowledge and experience \n     that we can write: Never in our nation's history has \n     America's transportation system been on a more unsustainable \n     course.\n       In recent years, Congress has largely funded transportation \n     in fits and starts. Federal funding bills once sustained our \n     transportation system for up to six years, but over the past \n     five years, Congress has passed 27 short-term measures. \n     Today, we are more than a decade past the last six-year \n     funding measure.\n       This is no way to run a railroad, fill a pothole, or repair \n     a bridge. In fact, the unpredictability about when, or if, \n     funding will come has caused states to delay or cancel \n     projects altogether.\n       The result has been an enormous infrastructure deficit--a \n     nationwide backlog of repairing and rebuilding. Right now, \n     there are so many structurally deficient bridges in America \n     that, if you lined them up end-to-end, they'd stretch from \n     Boston to Miami. What's worse, the American people are paying \n     for this inaction in a number of ways.\n       Bad roads, for example, are costing individual drivers \n     hundreds of dollars a year due to side effects like extra \n     wear-and-tear on their vehicles and time spent in traffic.\n       Simply put, the United States of America is in a united \n     state of disrepair, a crisis made worse by the fact that, \n     over the next generation, more will be demanded of our \n     transportation system than ever before. By 2050, this country \n     will be home to up to 100 million new people. And we'll have \n     to move 14 billion additional tons of freight, almost twice \n     what we move now.\n       Without increasing investment in transportation, we won't \n     be able to meet these challenges. According to the American \n     Society of Civil Engineers, we need to invest $1.8 trillion \n     by 2020 just to bring our surface transportation \n     infrastructure to an adequate level.\n       So, what America needs is to break this cycle of governing \n     crisis-to-crisis, only to enact a stopgap measure at the last \n     moment. We need to make a commitment to the American people \n     and the American economy.\n       There is hope on this front. Some leaders in Washington, \n     including those at the U.S. Department of Transportation, are \n     stepping forward with ideas for paying for our roads, rails, \n     and transit systems for the long-term.\n       While we--the twelve transportation secretaries--may differ \n     on the details of these proposals, there is one essential \n     goal with which all twelve of us agree: We cannot continue \n     funding our transportation with measures that are short-term \n     and short of the funding we need.\n       On this, we are of one mind. And Congress should be, too.\n       Adequately funding our transportation system won't be an \n     easy task for our nation's lawmakers. But that doesn't mean \n     it's impossible. Consensus has been brokered before.\n       Until recently, Congress understood that, as America grows, \n     so must our investments in transportation. And for more than \n     half a century, they voted for that principle--and increased \n     funding--with broad, bipartisan majorities in both houses.\n       We believe they can, and should, do so again.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We did it in the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nSenator Carper and I led the charge with Senators Vitter and Barrasso. \nWe did our job. We were able to come together with Senator Sessions, \nSenator Vitter, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Sanders--left to \nright--in our committee. They came together to agree on a 6-year bill.\n  So what is the problem? It is ridiculous. Unfortunately, the House--\nand this is not good--decided to kick the can down the road--I know it \nis a cliche, but it is true--until the end of May. Do you know what it \nmeans? It means we will not do anything until then, and it will be \nright up against the new construction season. Nobody will enter into a \nlong-term contract between now and then. And so we are hoping we can \nchange the way the House and the Finance Committee thought about it, \nand my colleagues have been leading on this issue.\n  I am on the Carper-Corker-Boxer amendment that would say: Instead of \nfunding this highway bill through next year, get our work done this \nyear. Who is supporting getting it done this year? The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, \nNational Association of Manufacturers, Associated General Contractors, \nAmerican Trucking Associations, International Union of Operating \nEngineers, and LiUNA.\n  If anybody knows politics, they know these groups hardly ever agree \non a darn thing, and they agree we should act this year.\n  I am proud of my friend here, for whom I will yield shortly.\n  I support their efforts wholeheartedly and will do everything I can \nto ensure we don't just do smoke-and-mirrors. Explain to me when you do \nthe smoke-and-mirrors--taking the pension and controlling how people \nget coverage through their pensions--how that has anything to do with \ntransportation.\n  The gas tax? Yes. A tax on oil? Yes.\n  Let's think about this. Let's step to the plate and do what is right.\n  I am very proud to be in concert with my friend, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for her comments and \nher ability to build consensus around the reauthorization as she did in \nthe committee.\n  This is the fifth time since 2008--I have been here since January of \n2007--that we have done a temporary extension. It is an absolute \nembarrassment. Not only do we not get the benefit of the economic \ngrowth that would come from people knowing there is a program in place \nwhere they can enter into long-term contracts and they can buy \nconstruction equipment, in addition to that, this is a tremendous \nproblem of absolutely being generational theft.\n  I will get to those comments, and I thank the Senator from Delaware \nfor his leadership and for being here on the floor. I will be fairly \nbrief and will yield the floor for him.\n  I think if every Senator were asked if they were opposed to using \nbudget gimmicks, they would say yes. I am sure the Presiding Officer \nwould say the same. They say the budget should not be used as an offset \nto pay for spending. Time and time again, Congress avoids the tough \ndecision and instead throws our kids under the bus so we can tell \npeople back home that the legislation was passed and paid for. I have \nlong been against the disgraceful practice of spending money today and \npaying for it in the future. It is shameful, it is irresponsible, and \nit is generational theft. Yet here we are this week looking for a way \nto pass a bill that would pay for spending that is already happening by \nusing a blatant budget scheme called pension smoothing.\n\n  Pension smoothing is one of the worst kinds of budget gimmicks. Not\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nonly does it allow Congress to spend money today and pay through \nsavings accrued in the future, but the gimmick actually loses money. \nLet me say that one more time. The gimmick actually loses money and \ndrives our Nation deeper into debt.\n  Pension smoothing is Congress cooking the books. It shifts tax \nrevenue that Treasury would collect in the future to the present. It \nstarts losing money when the smoothing ends and continues beyond the \n10-year window--combining a highway trust fund bailout that spends 10 \nyears of revenue in 10 months. Let me say that one more time. What we \nare going to be voting on this week spends 10 years' worth of revenue \nin 10 months.\n  I just want to say that my friends, my Republican friends--all of \nus--had problems when the President was trying to pass this health care \nbill because he used 6 years' worth of costs and 10 years' worth of \nrevenues, which is orders of magnitude better than what is getting \nready to happen in this bill this week--again, 10 months' worth of \nspending, 10 years' worth of revenues.\n  Pension smoothing also increases the chances that taxpayers will be \non the hook for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation bailout \nsometime in the future because it weakens the corporate pension system. \nSo here we are weakening our balance sheet and simultaneously weakening \nthe PBGC. The PBGC deficit already exceeds $30 billion. At the expense \nof taxpayers and workers who rely on pension plans, this budget scheme \nbenefits big businesses while allowing Congress to avoid real spending \ndecisions.\n  I understand the conventional wisdom is that in the haste to leave \ntown this August, enough Senators will be here to support the House \nbill with the pension smoothing gimmick included and not even try to do \nbetter. That is the conventional wisdom. I also understand that some \nwill try to scare Members into voting for the House bill by claiming \nthe House cannot pass anything except this short-term patch endorsed by \nthe President with $11 billion in gimmicks to extend the highway \nfunding until June. Although 367 House Members voted for this rushed \npackage, it is the responsibility of the Senate to weigh in and offer \nan alternative.\n  As I have done in previous years, I will continue to oppose these \nshort-term patches to the highway trust fund that allow Congress to \navoid doing its job in passing a long-term, sustainable solution to \nreform and pay for the program. At the very least we should cut the \ngimmicks in this bill by $3 billion and do away with pension smoothing.\n  I rarely use exhibits, but this is the gimmick of all gimmicks. Look \nat what happens when we use it to pay for a short-term bill: We collect \nthe money during the window that it is counted, and then from then on \nwe are losing money. This is a double loser.\n  It is amazing that we could even come up with these kinds of schemes \nto pay for an already insolvent program, and we do it by putting our \ncountry further in debt in the future and, candidly, weakening our \ncorporate pension system.\n  I am pleased there is bipartisan momentum to change this. I hope my \ncolleagues will support the amendment Senators Carper, Boxer, and I are \noffering that would reject the budget gimmicks in this bill and force \nCongress to stop shirking its responsibility so we can work toward \npassing a long-term transportation bill.\n  There is going to be a push by some to say that we shouldn't take up \nanything the rest of this year. I would think every Member of this \nCongress who realizes we have allowed ourselves to get into the jam we \nare in would want to show the responsibility of actually dealing with \nthis this year. We have a number of Members who are retiring. Many of \nthem spent a lot of time on issues such as this. I would like to see \nthem have the opportunity to come up with a long-term solution. I would \nimagine that if we did that, the House would want to support a more \nfiscally conservative alternative, which is what our amendment \nachieves.\n  I hope we will all back our words with actions and reject this \nirresponsible pay-for once and for all and do something far more \nresponsible.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to say I really appreciate Senator \nCarper's continual effort as a former Governor to try to do those \nthings that are common sense, that are pragmatic, and that make our \ncountry stronger along the way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Tennessee leaves, \nI wish to thank him very much for joining Senator Boxer and me in this \nSenate to create a dynamic that will enable us to do our job. He shows \ntime and again the courage to keep out of step when everybody else is \nmarching to the wrong tune. So does Barbara Boxer. She has shown \nextraordinary leadership in the Environment and Public Works Committee, \non which I serve. I serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure. She and Senator Vitter and Senator \nBarrasso, with a little help from me, were able to guide through \ncommittee and report a secure transportation bill--a plan for the \ntransportation for our country, including roads, highways, bridges, \ntransit systems--and report it out of committee without amendment, \nwithout a dissenting vote, and bring it to the floor of the Senate.\n  If it were that easy, we wouldn't all be here tonight. There is other \nlegislation, companion legislation that came out of the commerce \ncommittee for, among other things, freight railroads, passenger \nrailroads. They have jurisdiction over aviation as well. The banking \ncommittee has jurisdiction over transit systems. So there is a shared \nresponsibility here, and there is a shared responsibility to figure out \nhow to pay for all of this. How do we pay for this?\n  We are spending somewhere around $17 billion, $18 billion a year for \nthe Federal share for transportation projects. That is roughly about \nhalf of what we are spending if we add in State and local monies during \nthe course of the year. We have run out of money. We literally run out \nof money next month for the Federal Government to do its share.\n  So what do we do? Well, I will tell my colleagues what we do. We are \nnot going to continue to put it on our credit card, and we are not \ngoing to keep turning to countries such as China and saying: How about \nloaning us some more money so we can replenish the general fund, which \nwill replenish the transportation trust fund.\n  Why do we want to be beholden to China? I don't think we want to be \nin that situation.\n  What we need to do is summon the courage to do what people sent us to \ndo, and that is to make tough decisions.\n  Senator Corker is--I call him a recovering mayor from Chattanooga. I \nwas the Governor for some years in Delaware. We are a bunch of former \nGovernors and mayors here and some county executives, and we bring \nthose experiences with us. When we are in our State or our city or our \ncounty and we are trying to plan and fund and permit contracts for \nroads, highways, and bridges or transit projects, it takes a long time. \nPeople are watching and wondering, why do we need a 6-year bill or why \ndo we need predictability and certainty that the money is going to be \nthere for these projects? It is because they take a long time. It is \nnot uncommon to spend years planning a project.\n  The problem is, as the Senator from Tennessee said, five times we \nhave done stop-and-go. I think it has actually been 11 times in the \nlast 5 years that we have done stop-and-go funding and we haven't \nprovided the certainty and predictability that State and local \ngovernments are begging for and that transportation authorities around \nthe country are pleading for. The road contractors and folks who build \nthese systems and transit systems, the folks who work on them, the \nlabor unions--everybody is pleading with us to do our job. And what we \nhave done--the House, God bless them, reported out a bill that was, \nunfortunately, a straight party-line vote. They reported out a bill \nthat funds the transportation trust fund to allow projects to be built \nthrough May 31 of next year.\n\n  Some people say: Well, that is fine.\n  That is not fine. It is not 6 years, and, frankly, Senator Boxer \ncalled it kicking the can down the road. We have done that again and \nagain--11 times over the last 5 years. There is a good chance that when \nwe get to next\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nMay 31, we will say: Well, it is too hard to make these tough decisions \nas to how we are going to pay for this stuff, and we will kick the can \ndown the road again, providing more uncertainty, more unpredictability.\n  It is wasteful. It is inefficient. It is foolish. We look impotent. \nIt is not the way for us to do business.\n  What Senator Corker and I and a number of others who are going to be \njoining us in this cause will call for doing is pretty simple. Instead \nof providing $11 billion for the transportation trust fund from what I \nwill call a bunch of different sources of revenue--some of them more \nequal than others but some of them pretty questionable; but in some \ncases we are stealing revenues over the next 10 years for stuff that \nhas nothing to do with transportation projects and using that money to \nfund transportation projects for, I don't know, 7, 8, 9, 10 months \ninstead of actually doing what we have done for years--have a user-pay \nsystem where those who use our roads, highways, and transit systems pay \nfor them. That is what we ought to be doing. But the problem with what \nthe House has suggested we do is we will never--maybe never--get back \nto providing the certainty and predictability we need. We continue to \ndrive up costs and say to all of the folks who are ordering us to do \nour job: Well, we don't have the courage to do it now. Maybe we will \nhave it next year.\n  I think that will be a huge mistake.\n  I like to think of our Nation's economy as a car at the bottom of a \nsteep hill, and 5 years ago our Nation's economy was at the bottom of \nthe steep hill. We could have literally dropped off a cliff. Between \nJuly 1 and December 31, 2008, we lost 2.5 million jobs. In the first 6 \nmonths of 2009 we lost 2.5 million jobs. Literally the week Barack \nObama and Joe Biden were sworn in as President and Vice President, we \nhad 628,000 people file for unemployment insurance. In 1 week 628,000 \nfiled for unemployment insurance. We know that anytime that number is \nover 400,000 people filing for unemployment insurance in a week, we are \nlosing jobs in the economy. And that number stayed over 600,000 for too \nlong. But it started to drop, and it dropped down to 550,000, then \n500,000, eventually 450,000, and then 400,000, and a year or so ago we \ngot under 400,000, and that number now is about 300,000. We are adding \njobs.\n  Some would say: Well, they are not the kinds of jobs we want or need. \nBut some are--a lot of them. Almost any job is better than nothing. And \nsome of these jobs are very good and pay a fair amount of money. Here \nis where we were.\n  We were that car at the bottom of a very steep hill 5 years ago and \ntrying to climb up the hill. It was slow going. We kept going. We kept \ngoing. We have added jobs; sometimes, some months, 50,000, some months \n100,000. Now we are up to over 250,000 new jobs a month. But that car--\nif you will, we are that car--is climbing that hill. We are making it \nto the top. We are at the crest of the hill. As we look at it we can \nsay it is downhill now.\n  As we add more and more jobs every month, we have the option of doing \ntwo things: One, we can mash down on the accelerator, kick it into high \ngear, kick this economy into high gear, where it needs to go or we can \nstart tapping on the brakes--start tapping on the brakes, slow things \ndown, introduce uncertainty, lack of predictability. What we offer in \nour amendment, Senator Corker and Senator Boxer and myself and others, \nis a better likelihood that we are going to be pushing down on the \naccelerator next year.\n  We are not going to just put hundreds of thousands of people to work \nacross our country building roads, highways, bridges and transit \ncenters, but we are actually going to make our transportation system \nmore efficient, which in the long haul is most important, to move \nproduct, whether it is from one coast to the other, north to south or \njust around our States. That is the key. How do we do this in a more \nefficient way? How do we make our economy work better? So this works at \ncouple of different levels.\n  If we say we are going to kick the can down the road into next year \nand we will fund these programs until May 31, I do not know what is \ngoing to give us the courage next May 31 to fund a 6-year \ntransportation program. As Senator Corker said, we have seven or eight \npeople who are leaving at the end of this year. They are not running \nfor reelection. They are retiring. They want to leave, saying: We did \nthis on our watch. It was our job to get this done and we did. That is \nexactly why people send us in the first place, to make those kinds of \ndecisions.\n  This is not something Democrats can do by ourselves. This is not \nsomething Republicans can do by themselves. What I am very proud of, in \nboth committees, is that the Democrats and Republicans voted for it--\nthe Finance Committee voted for a similar proposal, not quite a \nmajority but a very respectable showing. We have been working and \ngaining support literally by the day for what we are going to do.\n  Senator Boxer ran through some of the folks, some of the \norganizations that are supporting this, a lot of State and local \ngovernments, State departments of transportation, folks who build \nroads, folks who run the roadbuilding companies, folks who do the \nactual labor for these projects, the American Trucking Associations, \nAAA, you name it. There is a huge bunch of people out there who want us \nto do our job. They do not want us to wait until some other time. They \nwant us to do it now. We can do that.\n  We are not here tonight to say this is how we are going to fund a 6-\nyear plan. There are a lot of good ideas, and Senator Boxer ran through \nsome of those. The idea is to create a situation where we are going to \nbe compelled and we will actually figure out, of all those options--and \nthere may be some other ones--how do we get this done. The idea that we \ncontinue to borrow money, to borrow money over the next 10 years--\nrevenue streams have nothing to do with transportation, nothing to do \nwith transportation. If we pretend that is going to fund our \ntransportation budget for 5 or 6 months, that is just laughing stock. \nWe look so foolish doing that. It is also highly inefficient, as I \nsaid.\n  I wish I could remember exactly what Mark Twain once said--maybe the \nPresiding Officer can help me on this later--but he once said something \nlike this: Do the right thing. You will please your friends and amaze \nyour enemies--something along those lines. For the record we will \ncorrect it. But please your friends and amaze or confound your enemies. \nWhy do we not try that for a change. That would be a great way to \nfinish this year.\n  I again thank Senator Boxer. I thank Senator Corker for joining me in \nwhat I think is a noble mission. I never take anything for granted, but \nI think if we work it hard enough, we may surprise some people in a \ngood way.\n  I see my friend from Texas--whose mother was born in Wilmington, DE, \n1 of 17 children--is rising for recognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                               Venezuela\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the ongoing crisis in \nVenezuela. With so many crises happening around the globe these days, \npolitical turmoil in Venezuela has slipped from the headlines and \nsometimes seems easy to forget. The situation commands our attention. \nIn Venezuela the protests against oppression go on, with 6,369 recorded \nrallies this year, the most in over a decade.\n  When Hugo Chavez's death was confirmed 15 months ago, there were \nhopes that his hand-picked successor Nicolas Maduro would prove more \nmoderate and friendly to the United States. These hopes quickly proved \ngroundless, as Maduro doubled down on his predecessor's disastrous \nsocialist economic policies and his close partnership with Castro's \nCuba, not to mention Khamenei's Iran.\n  Earlier this year, as Venezuela endured shortages of basic goods from \nbaby formula to caskets, from beginning of life to end and everything \nin between, while an increasingly authoritarian regime trampled their \nconstitutional rights, the people finally took to the streets to \nprotest Maduro's corrupt and unjust rule. Demanding freedom, they \nmarched peaceably while Maduro's Cuban-trained militia tried to incite \nviolence.\n  Following the wide-ranging protests of February 12, 2014, Maduro's \nregime claimed that opposition leaders were\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\npersonally responsible for the violence that Maduro's regime had \ndeliberately provoked. Six days later, the leader of the Voluntad \nPopular Party Leopoldo Lopez demonstrated his respect for rule of law \nwhen he voluntarily surrendered to the authorities.\n  He could have stayed in hiding, he could have gone into exile, but he \nbelieves it is only through taking action that change can come to \nVenezuela. Here is Mr. Lopez. As he surrendered to the authorities to \nbe thrown in prison, hundreds of thousands of supporters accompanied \nhim to the police van. Mr. Lopez has been held in the Ramo Verde \nmilitary prison ever since. In early June a judge ordered him held for \ntrial, which will begin this week.\n  His wife Lilian Tintori is in Washington today to draw attention to \nhis case. She spoke powerfully at the National Press Club about how she \nand her children have missed their dad, have missed Leopoldo while he \nhas been in prison, but they know their daddy is doing what he must to \nfight for the men and women of Venezuela.\n  Maduro's so-called evidence against Mr. Lopez includes the claim that \nhe was somehow sending secret subliminal messages inciting violence, \nwhen he in fact explicitly called on his followers to protest \npeacefully. Let me repeat that. Mr. Lopez explicitly asked his \nfollowers to protest peacefully against the oppressive regime of \nMaduro. What does Maduro say? That apparently Leopoldo has the power to \nsubliminally suggest violence when his words say, ``Don't engage in \nviolence.''\n  This would be comical and absurd were it not the basis for an \nindictment that Maduro is seeking to lock Leopoldo up for 10 years in \nprison for daring to speak out against oppression. It is important to \nunderstand the trial scheduled this week is no trial in the ordinary \nterm. There will be no jury. There will be no evidence for the \ndefense--not for lack of trying. Mr. Lopez is denied any opportunity to \nrefute these bogus charges about his supposed subliminal powers because \nMr. Lopez's defense team asked to submit the testimony of 60 witnesses.\n  The trial court denied all 60, said no witnesses will be allowed for \nthe defense. Mr. Lopez's team asked to submit 13 videos. The trial \ncourt denied all 13. Mr. Lopez's defense team asked to submit the \ntestimony of 12 experts. The trial court denied all 12. So in this so-\ncalled trial, which is nothing but a sham, the defense will have no \nevidence because the trial court has already decided they will allow no \nevidence in support of someone speaking for freedom, someone speaking \nfor the people. The evidence will be kept out of this show trial.\n\n  That is not an unusual path. Dictators, totalitarian regimes from \nStalin to Castro throughout the ages have engaged in the same show \ntrials that they use to brutally silence any who would dare to speak \nout against them. The undeniable fact is that Nicolas Maduro has no \ninterest in justice in this case or in the nation of Venezuela.\n  The official charges are public incitement, property damage, and \ncriminal conspiracy, but Mr. Lopez's real crime is quite simply the \nexercise of his rights provided by article 57 of the Constitution of \nVenezuela, which states:\n\n       Everyone has the right to express freely his or her \n     thoughts, ideas or opinions orally, in writing or by any \n     other form of expression, and to use for such purpose any \n     means of communication and diffusion, and no censorship shall \n     be established.\n\n  That is what the Constitution of Venezuela says, but Nicolas Maduro \nsays Leopoldo Lopez goes to prison and wants him to stay there for 10 \nyears because he spoke out and spoke the truth. Mr. Lopez freely \nexpressed his criticism of Maduro's failed leadership, and for that he \nhas been unceremoniously thrown in jail and faces a sham trial that \ncould rob his 4-year-old daughter and his 1-year-old son of having a \ndaddy for the next 10 years.\n  As his wife Lilian wrote today in the Washington Post:\n\n       No one should doubt why Leopoldo is in prison: Venezuelan \n     President Nicolas Maduro is afraid of him, and he has great \n     reason to be. Chavez did not deliver and Maduro has not \n     delivered on their promises, and they have systematically \n     dismantled our fundamental freedoms--free speech, freedom of \n     association, freedom of the press and freedom to vote for \n     candidates of our choosing.\n\n  The most basic foundational human rights, and for advocating for \nthose Leopoldo Lopez is in prison.\n  Every American should take an interest in Mr. Lopez's fate. Not only \nis he a good friend to our country, having attended both Kenyon College \nand Harvard, he also advocates the sort of political and economic \nreforms that would return Venezuela to its historic place as a close \npartner to the United States, a development that would be of great \nadvantage in our hemisphere.\n  Mr. Lopez's case also reminds us of the precious freedoms we enjoy in \nthe United States that can all too quickly be taken away.\n  Article 57 should have particular resonance for us as our right to \nfree speech is enshrined in the First Amendment of our Constitution:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \n     the government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  There is a reason the Framers chose this subject for the First \nAmendment in the Bill of Rights, because upon these rights all of our \nliberties are built. No freedom is more vital to true democracy than \nthe freedom to worship God according to the dictates of our conscience \nand the freedom to speak as we choose without government censors, for \nwhen these freedoms are restricted citizens lose their ability to \nexpress their opposition to the government.\n  As Venezuela shows us, this process can take place slowly, over time, \nbut the eventual result is that a citizen who speaks out is silenced \nand punished.\n  I have to say Leopoldo Lopez's situation is one that has resonance in \nmy family. Fifty-seven years ago my father was in a prison in another \nLatin American country, the country of Cuba. My dad was 17 when he was \nimprisoned and tortured in a Cuban jail. Leopoldo is 43, the very same \nage I am today.\n  Leopoldo Lopez's case is, unfortunately, not an isolated case in \nMaduro's Venezuela. Forty-six people have been killed, thousands have \nbeen detained, and more than 100 are still in prison.\n  His fellow opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, recently \ndiscovered that she too had been charged last month with incitement to \nviolence related to the February protests. She had never been informed \nthere was a criminal case against her and now she faces potentially 6 \nyears in prison as well.\n  Maduro's actions are those of a dictator who knows he is deeply \nunpopular, that his policies are a dismal failure, and that to survive \nhe has to silence the voices of those who oppose him and offer a viable \nalternative, who oppose him and offer freedom.\n  The people of Venezuela showed in February that they are ready for a \nchange from the long slog into totalitarian socialism that was begun by \nChavez and is being continued by Maduro. Now Maduro is trying to use a \ncloud of censorship to isolate Venezuelans from each other and from the \nrest of the world. We should not look the other way.\n  Again, from Lillian's Washington Post op-ed today:\n\n       We need to send a message to the government that it cannot \n     trample on the rights of its people with impunity. \n     Accordingly, I call on President Maduro to release my husband \n     and the more than 100 political prisoners being held in \n     Venezuela. But my actions alone are not enough. My husband \n     needs the support of all countries that stand for freedom.\n\n  In this, the United States should lead the way. America should speak \nwith a clarion voice: Free Leopoldo Lopez. As the hashtag #SOSVenezuela \nhas rocketed around the globe, it shows the power of speaking the \ntruth: Free Leopoldo Lopez.\n  The United States should do everything it can to shine the bright \nlight of truth and freedom on this repression by highlighting Leopoldo \nLopez's case.\n  President Obama should stand and lead, demanding the freedom of \nLeopoldo Lopez.\n  Secretary Kerry should stand and lead, demanding the freedom of \nLeopoldo Lopez.\n  Every Member of this body should join in bipartisan unison demanding \nthe freedom of Leopoldo Lopez.\n  We should not and cannot let this unjust persecution pass unnoticed \nbut, rather, we should help the people of\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\nVenezuela choose a different path, a path of freedom, a path of \nprosperity, and a path of friendship that will return this one-time \nenemy, the nation of Venezuela, to its traditional role of America's \npartner and friend. All of us should join in demanding and working for \nthe freedom of Leopoldo Lopez.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tragedy in Eastern Ukraine\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the horrific series of \nevents which have occurred in Eastern Ukraine within the last week. The \nshooting down of a civilian Malaysian airliner and the killing of 298 \ninnocent people is an unspeakable tragedy and one that, frankly, speaks \nout for us to address in terms of the responsibility.\n  In this situation in Eastern Ukraine there are armed thugs who are in \ncontrol of the territory where this plane was shot down. They have been \narmed, financed, and inspired by Vladimir Putin and the Russians. That \nis the grim reality. All signs point to the fact that Putin, the \nRussians, and their supporters in Eastern Ukraine are responsible for \nthis terrible tragedy--the loss of 298 lives.\n  I was in Ukraine a few weeks ago with Senator McCain and others, and \nit was at a time when Crimea was about to fall. It was clear then the \nUkrainians did not have the capacity to stop this effort by Putin to \ntake over territory--and he did. Then that wasn't enough. He had to \nreach into Eastern Ukraine for even more territory, stirring up \nproblems, creating havoc, and, sadly, bloodshed in the process.\n  It is bad enough the Ukrainian citizens themselves were victims, but \nnow 298 innocent people on a civilian airliner were shot down over this \nterritory. As I have said, the evidence points directly to Moscow and \nits complicity in this horrible event.\n  This is a photo which has been distributed showing pro-Russian \nseparatists holding up some of the personal effects of the victims of \nthe Malaysian airline flight that was shot down. What is happening \nthere since the crash is also nothing short of horrific.\n  At this moment in time in virtually any other place in the world, \nsave perhaps North Korea, international inspectors would be on the \nscene determining the cause of that plane's crash and, of equal or even \ngreater importance, making certain the recovery effort of the victims \nof this crash was done by the standards of civilized nations. But the \nEastern Ukrainian separatists, inspired by Putin and Moscow, have \nrefused to allow these people in.\n  What we are hearing in reports is horrible. The corpses of these \nvictims are being taken and placed in refrigerator cars on trains. \nImagine the anguish of the families associated with those victims as \nthey hear this--a loved one shot out of the sky in a civilian airliner \napparently because of some folly by Eastern Ukrainian, Russian-inspired \nthugs and now they cannot even recover the remains of the people they \nlove--let alone a serious objective investigation about the cause of \nthat crash.\n  It is hard to imagine that Vladimir Putin could let it reach this \npoint and harder still to imagine that he doesn't own up to his \nresponsibility. It is horrifying that we have reached this point where \nthis terribly tragic scene goes from bad to worse as Putin's thugs go \nthrough the personal effects of the people who were shot down.\n  There is a list of those who were lost. I know the Presiding Officer \nfrom the State of Indiana has a particular attachment to one of the \nvictims--this one--Karlijn Keijzer, a student at Indiana University. \nThis was well publicized in the Midwest--that we lost this beautiful \nwoman, a victim of this tragic crash.\n  There were more--297 more--who died. They included Quinn Lucas \nSchansman, a 19-year-old U.S.-Dutch citizen who was born in the United \nStates but whose family moved back to the Netherlands when he was \nyoung. He was on his way to visit his grandfather in Indonesia.\n  This is Joep Lange, a renowned Dutch AIDS researcher traveling with \nhis partner to the International AIDS conference in Australia.\n  I mentioned Karlijn Keijzer, doctoral student at Indiana University \nin Bloomington. She was going on vacation with her boyfriend when this \nplane was shot down.\n  Sister Philomene Tiernan was a 77-year-old Roman Catholic nun who was \nreturning to her school in Australia where she had taught thousands of \nstudents over her 30-year vocation.\n  Andrei Anghel, 24, was a Canadian medical student going on vacation \nwith his girlfriend.\n  Sri Siti Amirah, an 83-year-old, was step-grandmother of Malaysia's \nprime minister. She was heading to Indonesia to celebrate the end of \nRamadan.\n  Shazana Salleh, 31 years old, was a flight attendant on the plane. \nHer father told the media this was her dream, to be a flight attendant.\n  And this heartbreaking photo is of Shuba Jaya, 38 years old, Paul \nGoes, and their 1-year-old daughter Kaela. Shuba was a Malaysian \nactress, her husband a Dutch businessman. They were returning to \nMalaysia from Holland after showing their daughter to her husband's \nparents.\n  These victims of Mr. Putin's recklessness and their grieving families \ndeserve more than the tragic and revolting actions occurring now in \nEastern Ukraine. The Russian people--not the leadership but the people \nof Russia--deserve better.\n  The Russian people have a proud history of accomplishment in so many \ndifferent fields. But President Putin has created a climate of fear in \nhis country, where those who dissent to his policies will be punished. \nHis use of Soviet-style propaganda and intimidation, shutting down of \nindependent media and voices, and his strong-arming of other peaceful \nnations are, sadly, an insult to the great achievements and legacy of \nthe Russian people.\n  I hope Mr. Putin still sees the importance of being a responsible \nworld leader. There is little evidence of it in recent weeks. He can \nstart almost immediately by calling off his shameful proxies who are so \ndisrespecting the victims and their families at this crash site--the \nsite for which he is most certainly responsible.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.\n  To our Dutch friends who suffered such an overwhelming loss of life \nin this crash, I express my deepest condolences. And to the people of \nUkraine, the Baltics, Poland, and everywhere else facing Russian \nbullying, we stand with you in your desire for democracy and peaceful \nrelations with the West and Russia.\n  Earlier this evening we considered three nominations and two passed \nby voice vote. One of those passed by voice vote was Michael Lawson of \nCalifornia for the rank of Ambassador during his tenure of service as \nrepresentative of the United States of America on the Council of the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization.\n  The reason I bring that to the attention of the Senate is he was \nnominated last September and reported out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in May. Mr. Lawson has been sitting on the calendar. There \nwas no objection to him. No one had any objection to him, but he was \nsitting on the calendar because of objection on the Republican side of \nthe aisle. Why was his name called today? Because of this tragedy--\nbecause this tragedy pointed out the fact that the United States would \nnot have its representative before this important organization which \ninvestigates these airline crashes.\n  It has reached a point where almost 30 Ambassadors to organizations \nand nations are being held up on the floor of the Senate over and over \nuntil something happens--an upheaval, a tragedy--and then they are \nbrought for a vote.\n  The United States of America is a better nation than that. We \nshouldn't be holding up in the Senate these fine men and women who are \nwilling to serve our Nation. I urge my colleagues to reconsider this \napproach. Let us release these ambassadorial appointments by President \nObama. For those that are controversial, so be it; let's hold them. But \nthe vast majority of these are not controversial. Let's give them a \nchance to serve our Nation.\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4656-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, during the past few years, Marcelle and I \nhave come to know Christopher Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas, both of \nwhom are extraordinarily talented and have made breakthrough movies.\n  One of the things that we have enjoyed talking about with both of \nthem is the concept of what movies can be as real entertainment, and \nthat movie theaters provide an audience an experience they would not \nhave otherwise. Recently, Chris wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street \nJournal explaining just how movie theaters will survive. That was music \nto my ears, as I too want them to survive. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Christopher Nolan: Films of the Future Will Still Draw People to \n                                Theaters\n\n       When Movies Can Look or Sound Like Anything, Says the `Dark \n     Knight' Director, Extraordinary Work Will Emerge.\n       In the '90s, newly accessible video technology gave \n     adventurous filmmakers (such as Lars von Trier and his \n     colleagues in the filmmaking movement Dogme 95) an \n     unprecedented wedge for questioning the form of motion \n     pictures. The resulting 20-year process of radical technical \n     and aesthetic change has now been co-opted by the very \n     establishment it sought to challenge.\n       Hungry for savings, studios are ditching film prints (under \n     $600 each), while already bridling at the mere $80 per screen \n     for digital drives. They want satellite distribution up and \n     running within 10 years. Quentin Tarantino's recent \n     observation that digital projection is the ``death of \n     cinema'' identifies this fork in the road: For a century, \n     movies have been defined by the physical medium (even Dogme \n     95 insisted on 35mm film as the presentation format).\n       Savings will be trivial. The real prize the corporations \n     see is the flexibility of a nonphysical medium.\n\n\n                           Movies as Content\n\n       As streams of data, movies would be thrown in with other \n     endeavors under the reductive term ``content,'' jargon that \n     pretends to elevate the creative, but actually trivializes \n     differences of form that have been important to creators and \n     audiences alike. ``Content'' can be ported across phones, \n     watches, gas-station pumps or any other screen, and the idea \n     would be that movie theaters should acknowledge their place \n     as just another of these ``platforms,'' albeit with bigger \n     screens and cupholders.\n       This is a future in which the theater becomes what \n     Tarantino pinpointed as ``television in public.'' The \n     channel-changing part is key. The distributor or theater \n     owner (depending on the vital question of who controls the \n     remote) would be able to change the content being played, \n     instantly. A movie's Friday matinees would determine whether \n     it even gets an evening screening, or whether the projector \n     switches back to last week's blockbuster. This process could \n     even be automated based on ticket sales in the interests of \n     ``fairness.''\n       Instant reactivity always favors the familiar. New \n     approaches need time to gather support from audiences. \n     Smaller, more unusual films would be shut out. Innovation \n     would shift entirely to home-based entertainment, with the \n     remaining theaters serving exclusively as gathering places \n     for fan-based or branded-event titles.\n       This bleak future is the direction the industry is pointed \n     in, but even if it arrives it will not last. Once movies can \n     no longer be defined by technology, you unmask powerful \n     fundamentals--the timelessness, the otherworldliness, the \n     shared experience of these narratives. We moan about \n     intrusive moviegoers, but most of us feel a pang of \n     disappointment when we find ourselves in an empty theater.\n       The audience experience is distinct from home \n     entertainment, but not so much that people seek it out for \n     its own sake. The experience must distinguish itself in other \n     ways. And it will. The public will lay down their money to \n     those studios, theaters and filmmakers who value the \n     theatrical experience and create a new distinction from home \n     entertainment that will enthrall--just as movies fought back \n     with widescreen and multitrack sound when television first \n     nipped at its heels.\n       These developments will require innovation, experimentation \n     and expense, not cost-cutting exercises disguised as digital \n     ``upgrades'' or gimmickry aimed at justifying variable ticket \n     pricing. The theatrical window is to the movie business what \n     live concerts are to the music business--and no one goes to a \n     concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage.\n\n\n                           Back to the Future\n\n       The theaters of the future will be bigger and more \n     beautiful than ever before. They will employ expensive \n     presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in \n     the home (such as, ironically, film prints). And they will \n     still enjoy exclusivity, as studios relearn the tremendous \n     economic value of the staggered release of their products.\n       The projects that most obviously lend themselves to such \n     distinctions are spectacles. But if history is any guide, all \n     genres, all budgets will follow. Because the cinema of the \n     future will depend not just on grander presentation, but on \n     the emergence of filmmakers inventive enough to command the \n     focused attention of a crowd for hours.\n       These new voices will emerge just as we despair that there \n     is nothing left to be discovered. As in the early '90s, when \n     years of bad multiplexing had soured the public on movies, \n     and a young director named Quentin Tarantino ripped through \n     theaters with a profound sense of cinema's past and an \n     instinct for reclaiming cinema's rightful place at the head \n     of popular culture.\n       Never before has a system so willingly embraced the radical \n     teardown of its own formal standards. But no standards means \n     no rules. Whether photochemical or video-based, a film can \n     now look or sound like anything.\n       It's unthinkable that extraordinary new work won't emerge \n     from such an open structure. That's the part I can't wait \n     for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4656-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4656-S4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CHARLEY GREENE DIXON, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am saddened to report to my Senate \ncolleagues the passing of a fellow Kentuckian, Mr. Charley Greene \nDixon, Jr., who lost his battle with cancer on June 23 of this year. \nCharley was a consummate public servant who spent his life working to \nbetter his community. Knox County, and the entirety of the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky, is poorer for his loss.\n  The overriding ambition in Charley's life was to help others. His \nwife Marcia Dixon said, ``He believed that if he could make one life \nbetter he was a success.'' This is a bar for success that Charley \ncleared time and time again.\n  Born in Barbourville on November 19, 1964, Charley lived in Kentucky \nhis whole life, mostly in his hometown in Knox County. He attended \nUnion College in Barbourville and earned his juris doctorate from \nNorthern Kentucky's Salmon P. Chase College of Law.\n  Charley started his career working as the Barbourville city attorney, \nlater becoming the Knox County school board and Barbourville city \nschool board attorney.\n  His most recent position was of Knox County attorney, one that he had \nheld since 2003. In that capacity he played a leading role in creating \njuvenile, family and adult drug courts in Knox County. Through these \ncourts, Charley helped countless individuals reclaim their lives from \nthe clutches of drug addiction.\n  Outside of his official duties, Charley continued to work tirelessly \nto better Knox County. He chaired the Knox County UNITE Coalition an \norganization that combated illicit drug use through education, law \nenforcement, and rehabilitation. As chairman he spearheaded events, \nsuch as ``Hooked on Fishing Not on Drugs,'' where kids and their \nfamilies could enjoy themselves in a drug-free environment.\n  For his selfless work in the community, Charley was named the 2013 \nMan of the Year by the Knox County Chamber of Commerce a fitting award \nfor a man who helped so many.\n  Charley is survived by his wife Marcia, his daughter Callie Ann, and \nhis son Charleston Arthur. Knox County was undoubtedly bettered by his \nlife's work, and he will be sorely missed by all who loved and knew \nhim.\n  I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring the life of \nCharley Greene Dixon, Jr.\n  The Mountain Advocate recently published an article chronicling \nDixon's life. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n              [From the Mountain Advocate, June 26, 2014]\n\n               ``Hometown Hero'' Loses Battle With Cancer\n\n                          (By Melissa Newman)\n\n       John Ray Gray sat quietly in the waiting area at the Knox \n     County Attorney's Office Monday morning. He wasn't there \n     because he needed help--at least not this time.\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\n       A confessed recovered drug addict, Gray, now 27, first met \n     former Knox County Attorney Charley Greene Dixon six years \n     ago in drug court.\n       Gray said without Dixon and the drug court program, he'd \n     ``probably be dead.''\n       ``He was good to me,'' Gray's voice quivered as he spoke. \n     ``He went beyond his job to help me.''\n       Gray came to ``check on'' staff members and offer tight \n     hugs, his tears contagious and shared among the group. His \n     story is only one of the many dozen that include some \n     selfless act or shattered belief that work should end at 5 \n     p.m. Dixon, as most have said, was different.\n       Dixon, who helped hundreds, like Gray, win battles against \n     drugs, poverty, and domestic violence, lost his own battle to \n     colon cancer early Monday morning.\n       The former county attorney first learned he was ill while \n     on vacation in May 2013. Not long after, on June 30, he \n     resigned his position to then assistant county attorney \n     Gilbert Holland, to focus on getting better. The community he \n     had served so valiantly came together in prayer vigils around \n     the courthouse square, hoping for a miracle.\n       ``The loss will be felt by this community for a long \n     time,'' Holland said. ``Charley dedicated his life to \n     bettering the lives of the people of Knox County. His efforts \n     were never contained by the traditional role of his office. \n     He invented ways to reach out to the community.''\n       Along with Dixon's successful drug court program that has \n     graduated thousands, he was well-known for a long list of \n     community-minded projects--many of which he initiated. \n     Reaching youth was at the forefront of his vision for a \n     successful Knox County--Hooked on Fishing Not on Drugs, \n     Faith-Based Basketball Cheerleading, Anti-Drug Abuse Poster \n     Contest, a Car/Bike Show for Youth, and a Prevention Camp.\n       A new youth-related program will take place next fall one \n     of the last requests Dixon made of long-time friend and \n     colleague Claudia Greenwood, who worked with Dixon on grants \n     and public relations.\n       ``He's already told me that next year he would like for us \n     to do a pumpkin patch event and have a pumpkin decorating \n     contest and display the pumpkins in the banks,'' Greenwood \n     said. ``He was always so creative, coming up with things to \n     do with the kids and the community,'' Greenwood said. ``He \n     thought of that while he was sick and wanted to make sure he \n     told us about it.''\n       Finding time to grieve in a busy office hasn't been easy \n     for Dixon's staff. The phone calls keep coming--clients and \n     the public are priority as usual. Among the foot traffic, \n     phone calls, and full email boxes, ``it hits'' them that \n     Dixon's guidance is gone. And though the quiet moments are \n     few, that's when the staff members feel the waves of emotion \n     and loss wash over them.\n       ``Yesterday, when the media wanted statements, it hit me \n     hard,'' Greenwood said. ``My first thought was that I needed \n     to ask Charley what to say.''\n       Dixon, expected to do great things for his community, \n     succeeded in filling the large shoes of his grandfather John \n     Dixon who served as Knox County attorney for several decades. \n     When elected, the younger Dixon brought his grandfather's \n     legacy and one of his employees into office with him.\n       ``I've worked for Charley this October will be 19 years,'' \n     Sherry Vaughn said. ``I worked for his grandfather five and a \n     half years before that until he passed away. I went to school \n     with Charley; he's been just like a brother to me.''\n       ``He loved kids,'' Vaughn said. ``He did everything he \n     could for the children in Knox County. His own children were \n     his whole world. Words can't describe how we feel about the \n     situation. He has struggled for a year and now he's a lot \n     better off. He's up there now looking down at us.''\n       Dixon's wife, Marcia, like her husband, is active in \n     community service. Often, the couple worked together and at \n     times involved the entire family--the children, Callie Ann \n     and Charleston Arthur, included. The late Dixon's wife knows \n     her community, their hometown, is better off for having had \n     her husband as a leader.\n       ``Charley was very dedicated not only to our family but to \n     our Knox County community as well,'' Marcia Dixon said. ``His \n     goal was to help others, and he believed that if he could \n     make one life better he was a success. I feel blessed to have \n     shared many joyful years with him and want everyone to be \n     able to say as an old Hebrew proverb says, ``Say not in \n     grief: He is no more,' but live in thankfulness that he \n     was.''\n       Knox County's Chamber of Commerce members named Dixon Knox \n     County's Man of the Year last fall and tagged him a \n     ``hometown hero.''\n       Dixon's introduction as Man of the Year heralded a long \n     list of community-minded projects that he participated in, \n     implemented, or, in some cases, created.\n       Dixon served as the chair of the Knox County UNITE \n     (Unlawful Narcotics Investigation, Treatment, and Education) \n     Coalition since May 2005. The former county attorney was also \n     instrumental in securing grant funding through the Foundation \n     for a Healthy Kentucky; a grant from PRIDE; a Coal Severance \n     Grant; a Fatherhood Grant and a EUDL Grant to fund programs \n     for young people that promoted prevention for underage \n     drinking.\n       Dixon made sure his office staff actively participated in \n     Back to School Expos, PRIDE Pick-Up, Relay for Life, the \n     Child Identification Program, the Knox County Reading \n     Celebration, the local August Arts Adventure, and the annual \n     Redbud festival.\n       Dixon was an active military advocate--photos of local \n     service men and women lined the hallways leading to his \n     office. He called it ``Faces of Freedom.''\n       Funeral services for Dixon are at Barbourville First \n     Baptist Church, Friday, June 27 at 2 p.m. Burial will follow \n     in the Barbourville Cemetery.\n       Visitation is at Barbourville First Baptist Church, \n     Thursday from 5 to 9 p.m. and Friday after 10 a.m. until the \n     funeral hour at 2 p.m. Hopper Funeral Home is in charge of \n     arrangements.\n       Dixon's family requests contributions be made to the Knox \n     County Chapter of the American Cancer Society in loving \n     memory of Charley Greene Dixon, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4657-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM SHARPE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to honor the long and \ndistinguished career of Jim Sharpe. Now retired, Mr. Sharpe opened his \nfirst business in Somerset, KY, in 1947. Since that time he has opened \nseveral more, pioneered the houseboat business, and has become an \nirreplaceable fixture in his community.\n  Lake Cumberland is known by many as the ``houseboat capital of the \nworld''--a designation that is owed in no small part to Jim Sharpe. Jim \nwas one of the first to pioneer the industry--building his first \nhouseboat in 1953. Much has changed since he sold that first 10-by-24-\nfoot steel boat, and Jim has been there for it all, often leading the \nway. Houseboats are now much bigger--up to 20 by 100 feet--and are made \nof aluminum and have onboard heating and cooling systems. One thing \nthat never changed, though, is Jim's passion for building his \ncustomer's dream boat.\n  Despite being one of the founding fathers of the industry, houseboats \ndo not constitute the totality of his life's work. Jim has owned and \noperated several other businesses in Somerset in addition to Sumerset \nMarine. In 1966, he developed Food Fair groceries, which he grew into a \nchain of 13 stores. Two year later, he opened up Somerset's first fried \nchicken restaurant, Kettle Fried Chicken, and in 1974 he bought a car \ndealership, Pulaski Motor Company.\n  Although he's now retired, Jim still has plenty to keep him busy. Jim \nhas four children and nine grandchildren, and he has also found time to \npick up golf and travel the country. Jim's family is all the stronger \nfor the influence of Jim's dear departed wife, Mary Jo, who left us in \n2008. Married in 1950, they were one of the most thriving and generous \nentrepreneurial couples that Kentucky has ever seen, with distinguished \ncareers in the grocery and food retail business, automobile \ndealerships, marinas, restaurants, and most notably the houseboat \nindustry which I have already mentioned.\n  Jim Sharpe's drive and determination in his business, his commitment \nto his community, and his love of his family can serve as an example to \nus all. Jim is also a proud veteran of the U.S. Navy, and we are \ngrateful for his service. I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me \nin honoring this upstanding and patriotic Kentucky citizen and veteran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4657-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRUCE BLACKWOOD\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate MooreMart, \na New Hampshire nonprofit organization that sends care packages to \nservicemembers and children overseas, as it celebrates its 10th \nanniversary.\n  MooreMart was born from Moore family members Paul, Carole, and \nBeverly's desire to send supplies to Brian Moore and his fellow \nsoldiers stationed in Iraq. In the early years of their effort, they \nstrove to send 10 packages a month to U.S. troops overseas. Today, \nMooreMart ships more than 1,000 packages every 10 weeks. Its mission \nhas grown over the years, and now MooreMart also sends school supplies, \ntoys, and clothing to local children in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Over the last decade, MooreMart has built and shipped more than \n61,000 care packages and nearly 8 tons of relief supplies to troops in \nconflict zones, including to every Armed Forces unit deployed from New \nHampshire. Each package includes toiletries, food items like s'mores \nand Girl Scout cookies difficult to find overseas, and letters and \ncards from schoolchildren and volunteers. All of the packages are \nassembled by volunteers and individually addressed to a servicemember.\n  MooreMart has successfully reached out to organizations both public \nand private, involving State and local agencies, faith communities, and \nbusinesses in its work. More than 11,000 volunteers have helped build \nthe care packages, among them veterans, families of active \nservicemembers, and families who have lost loved ones in service to our \ncountry.\n  MooreMart represents the very best of New Hampshire, bringing comfort \nto those who selflessly defend our Nation. I am proud to congratulate \nthis organization and the volunteers who carry out its mission on their \n10th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4658-6", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING VANCE HOME GUN\n\n Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I wish to honor Vance Home Gun, an \nemerging leader in Montana and member of the Confederated Salish and \nKootenai Tribes.\n  As I travel around Indian Country in Montana, I see a lot of \nchallenges that still need to be addressed, but I also see a lot of \ncause for hope. Vance Home Gun embodies that hope.\n  Vance was first introduced to a Salish language camp at the age of \n11. Inspired by elders and other community members, Vance resolved \nhimself to become a fluent Salish speaker and to encourage his peers to \nget involved in the preservation of the Salish language.\n  Vance has taken a leadership role within his tribe to revitalize \nNative languages through his organization called Yoyoot Skwkwimlt, or \nStrong Young People, that utilizes peer-to-peer methods to teach \nlanguage and culture.\n  I also want to congratulate Vance on receiving a scholarship to \nattend the University of Oregon this coming fall. On behalf of all \nMontanans, I wish him luck and look forward to his return home when he \nfinishes his studies to continue making a difference for Montana and \nhis tribe.\n  Since joining the Senate 5 months ago, I have cosponsored two \nimportant pieces of legislation that promote and preserve Native \nlanguages for generations to come.\n  I know that support for comprehensive and culturally-relevant \nlanguage programs will set our Native children on a path for success in \nschool and life and allows them to reach their full potential.\n  Vance encapsulated the urgency behind Native language preservation \nwhen he stated, ``Time is of the essence, and our young Native people \nare the key to revitalizing our language. Helping them is revitalizing \nour identity.''\n  It will take leaders like Vance to implement these vital language \nprograms for the benefit of cultural preservation and revitalization.\n  I stand with Vance to help preserve the Native languages and \ntraditions for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4658-7", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4658-8", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4658-9", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4658-S4659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2631.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the Congress of the United \n     States to support legislation reauthorizing the Export-Import \n     Bank of the United States; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 37\n\n       Whereas, The Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-\n     Im) is the official export credit agency of the United States \n     and exists for the purposes of financing and insuring foreign \n     purchases of United States goods for customers unable or \n     unwilling to accept the credit risk; and\n       Whereas, The mission of the Ex-Im is to create and sustain \n     United States jobs by financing sales of United States \n     exports to international buyers; and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im is the principal government agency \n     responsible for aiding the export of American goods and \n     services, and thereby creating and sustaining United States \n     jobs, through a variety of loan, guarantee, and insurance \n     programs for small and large businesses; and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im has supported more than $400 billion in \n     United States exports in the past 70 years and helps to cover \n     critical trade finance gaps by providing loan guarantees, \n     export credit insurance, and direct loans for United States \n     exports in developing markets where commercial bank financing \n     is unavailable or insufficient. In Fiscal Year 2012, Ex-Im \n     financing of United States exports exceeded $35 billion, \n     assisting more than 3,400 United States companies and \n     supporting approximately 255,000 export-related American \n     jobs; and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im is a self-sustaining agency, which \n     operates at no cost to the taxpayer and, between the 2008-09 \n     to 2011-12 fiscal years, inclusive, the Ex-Im has generated \n     $1.6 billion in excess revenue for United States taxpayers; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im enables United States companies large \n     and small to turn export opportunities into sales that help \n     to maintain and create in the United States jobs and \n     contribute to a stronger national economy. On average, more \n     than 85 percent of the Ex-Im's transactions support United \n     States small businesses; and\n       Whereas, Exports are particularly important to the \n     California economy as California is currently ranked second \n     in exports among all states. If California's manufacturing \n     base is to grow, we must continue to expand our ability to \n     export goods from California facilities. Given the key role \n     the Ex-Im plays in facilitating export sales, failure to \n     reauthorize it would be devastating to existing industry and \n     to those that we hope to create in the future; and\n       Whereas, Over the past five years, the Ex-Im has assisted \n     more than 900 California companies to export their products. \n     Nearly 200 of those companies are women or minority owned and \n     668 are small businesses. These companies export their \n     products and services around the globe totaling more than $19 \n     billion in sales. Fifty-two of the 53 congressional districts \n     in California had companies benefit from the Ex-Im loans; and\n       Whereas, A reauthorization of the Ex-Im is critical to the \n     ability of many United States exporters to compete on a level \n     playing field in a commercial market where current and future \n     competitors continue to enjoy aggressive support from their \n     countries' export credit agencies; and\n       Whereas, A failure to reauthorize the Ex-Im would amount to \n     unilateral disarmament in the face of other nations' \n     aggressive trade finance programs that favor their domestic \n     companies over American companies; and\n       Whereas, Economic growth depends on increasing exports from \n     both small and large\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\n     manufacturers and service providers in California and \n     reauthorization means support for California exports and \n     California jobs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges Congress to \n     support legislation reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-313. A resolution adopted by the California State Lands \n     Commission opposing S. 2094, the Vessel Incidental Discharge \n     Act; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-314. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Rhode Island urging the United States Congress to support a \n     peaceful unification of Ireland using all possible diplomatic \n     means; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 3124\n\n       Whereas, Ireland and the Irish people are an ancient nation \n     that have contributed much to western culture, particularly \n     within the spheres of literature, art, music, dance, theater, \n     theology and philosophy: and\n       Whereas, Ireland is an island nation that eventually \n     evolved into 32 counties. Tragically, in 1922 it was divided \n     against the wishes of a majority of the Irish people who \n     desired a united nation, into the Irish Republic, consisting \n     of 26 counties, and Northern Ireland, composed of the \n     remaining six counties, and\n       Whereas, A peacefully united and independent Ireland would \n     be the most effective way to grow the economy and would lead \n     to a wealthier nation, with more influence in regional and \n     world affairs. It would also be the best way to ensure that \n     all citizens of Ireland have a just and equal chance at \n     happiness and prosperity; and\n       Whereas, A united and independent Ireland, with a unified \n     and independent police force and justice system, is more \n     likely to dispense justice in an impartial and fair way, and \n     it would be far more likely to have the trust and respect of \n     its citizenry, including citizens from all socio-economic \n     spheres of life: and\n       Whereas, The Good Friday Agreement of 1998, negotiated with \n     strong American support, ratified by the British and Irish \n     governments and approved by a vote with the overwhelming \n     support of the entire island of Ireland, provides a framework \n     by which a united Ireland might he achieved through peaceful \n     and democratic means. It also provided for the development \n     and strengthening of North/South institutions and for there \n     to be cross border cooperation amongst the two entities; and\n       Whereas, The United States and the State of Rhode Island \n     have benefited enormously from the rich contributions Irish \n     immigrants have made to our nation and state; Now, therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island and \n     Providence Plantations hereby respectfully requests that the \n     United States Congress strongly supports a peaceful \n     unification of Ireland using all possible diplomatic means; \n     and be it further,\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit duly certified copies of \n     this resolution to the Rhode Island Congressional Delegation, \n     the President and Vice President of the United States, the \n     United States Secretary of State, and the Taoiseach (Prime \n     Minister) of Ireland, Enda Kenny.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-315. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Rhode Island requesting that the United States Congress and \n     the United Nations work together towards finding a peaceful \n     solution to the problems in Cyprus; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                         Senate Resolution 3118\n\n       Whereas, This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the \n     illegal Turkish invasion and continued occupation of Cyprus: \n     and\n       Whereas, The Republic of Cyprus has been divided and \n     occupied by foreign forces since 1974, in violation of \n     numerous United Nations' Resolutions; and\n       Whereas, The Republic of Cyprus is the only internationally \n     recognized and legal entity on the Island of Cyprus and is a \n     member of the United Nations and the European Union. United \n     States Vice President Joseph Biden re-affirmed these facts \n     and the United States' support for the Republic of Cyprus on \n     his recent visit to the Island of Cyprus; and\n       Whereas, The international community, with the support of \n     the United States, has repeatedly supported the Republic of \n     Cyprus in this dispute. It has called for the removal of the \n     43,000 Turkish troops from the Island, the return of all \n     illegal settlers, and has continuously urged the government \n     of Turkey to engage in good faith negotiations to achieve \n     these ends; and\n       Whereas, A peaceful, just and lasting solution to the \n     Cyprus problem would greatly benefit the security and the \n     political, economic and social well-being of all Cypriots, as \n     well as contribute to improved relations between Greece, \n     Turkey and the European Union: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island and \n     Providence Plantations hereby marks the fortieth anniversary \n     of the unlawful Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus. We \n     furthermore respectfully request that the President of the \n     United States and the United States Congress fully support \n     all United Nations efforts to create a peaceful and \n     democratic solution that will be based on European law and \n     will guarantee all Cypriot citizens equal human rights; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit duly certified copies of \n     this resolution to President Barack Obama, Vice President \n     Joseph Biden, Jr., Secretary of State John Kerry, the Rhode \n     Island Delegation to the United States Congress, Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives John Boehner, House Minority \n     Leader Nancy Pelosi, United States Senate Majority Leader \n     Harry Reid, United States Senate Minority Leader Mitch \n     McConnell, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-316. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California calling upon the United States \n     Congress to enact legislation that would establish reasonable \n     deadlines for the prohibition of the testing and marketing of \n     cosmetic products that have been tested on animals, and \n     urging the federal government to mandate alternative methods \n     to animal testing of cosmetic products; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, For more than 50 years, animals have been used in \n     painful tests to assess the safety of certain chemicals used \n     in cosmetic products; and\n       Whereas, Modern alternatives to harmful animal testing are \n     increasingly less expensive, faster, and more accurate at \n     predicting human reactions; and\n       Whereas, Mandating and promoting the use of accepted \n     alternative methods to animal testing has, and will continue \n     to have, a huge positive impact on animal welfare; and\n       Whereas, Careful evaluation of alternative methods to \n     animal tests ensures that their proper use supports the equal \n     or better protection of people, animals, and the environment; \n     and\n       Whereas, In 2000, California became the first state in the \n     nation to pass a law restricting the use of animals in \n     product testing by making it unlawful to use animals for \n     testing when an appropriate, validated, alternative method is \n     available; and\n       Whereas, Our nation's largest trading partner, the European \n     Union, which accounts for nearly half of the global cosmetics \n     market worth an estimated $90 billion a year, prohibits the \n     importation and sale of cosmetics that have been tested on \n     animals as of March 2013; and\n       Whereas, Norway, India, Israel, and the state of Sao Paulo, \n     Brazil have also banned all animal testing for cosmetics; and\n       Whereas, Harmonizing international laws that encourage \n     modern science and respond to consumer expectations benefits \n     businesses and consumers in today's global marketplace; and\n       Whereas, Polls show that the American public overwhelmingly \n     supports alternatives to testing cosmetics on animals. A \n     recent poll conducted by ORC International, a leading global \n     market research firm, found that 72 percent of American \n     adults surveyed believe that testing cosmetics on animals is \n     unethical: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges the United \n     States Congress to enact legislation that would establish \n     reasonable deadlines for the prohibition of the testing and \n     marketing of cosmetic products that have been tested on \n     animals; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the federal government \n     to mandate alternative methods to animal testing of cosmetic \n     products, whenever those scientifically satisfactory methods \n     are available, and to prioritize the validation and \n     acceptance of additional nonanimal tests; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States, to the Governor of California, and to the author for \n     appropriate distribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/21/senate-section/article/S4661-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MENENDEZ, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 2577.
