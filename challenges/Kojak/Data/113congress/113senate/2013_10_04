Mr. President, following the suggestion in the prayer of \nAdmiral Black, I want to take a few minutes to talk about Senate \ndecorum, Senate procedure. This is constructive criticism for the \nentire Senate and self-criticism for me.\n  I think we have all here in the Senate kind of lost the aura of \nRobert Byrd, who was such a stickler for Senate procedure. I think we \nhave all let things get away from us a little bit. The Senate is a very \nspecial place with very particular rules. These rules help to keep \ndebate among Senators civil, even when we are discussing matters in \nwhich Senators completely disagree.\n  One of those rules concerns how we address each other here in the \nSenate. The practice we observe is that when Senators speak, they \naddress themselves only to the Presiding Officer, through the Chair to \nthe Senator from Missouri, or whatever the case might be.\n  When Senators refer to other Senators--this is something we all have \nto listen to--whether those other Senators are in the Chamber or not, \nSenators must address and refer to each other in the third person and \nthrough the Chair. Thus, Senators should refer to the Senator from \nVermont or the Senator from Illinois or the Senator from Nevada or the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee or the President pro tempore \nor the manager of the bill.\n  Senators should avoid using other Senators' first names. Senators \nshould avoid addressing other Senators directly as ``you.'' These rules \nare a little unusual, but they have been in place here for a couple of \ncenturies. As people would generally talk directly to other people if \nthey are in the same room with each other, they are a little unusual, \nbecause that is how we address one another.\n  But the Senate rules preserve distance--a little distance, not a lot \nof distance, but distance. So Senators are more likely to debate ideas \nand less likely to talk about personalities. I think all of us--that is \nwhy I said I am directing a little self-criticism here. I think we all \nhave to understand that these rules create a little bit of distance so \nSenators are more likely to debate ideas and less likely talk about \npersonalities. If we do that, we maintain more civil decorum as a \nresult. So I bring this matter to the attention of Senators, because we \nhave fallen out of this habit. It has gotten worse the last month or \nso. I will work harder. I hope my Senators will work their best to \nmaintain these habits of civility and decorum going forward.\n  The Parliamentarians and Presiding Officers have all been directed to \nmake sure we do a better job of following the basic rules of the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7171-7", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7171-S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every day Members of Congress come to work \nat the U.S. Capitol. I said some of this yesterday afternoon, but \nbecause of the melee, the death and destruction outside the Capitol, \nthe sound system did not work, so I want to make sure that people \nunderstand a few things about how I feel about the Capitol Police \nforce.\n  Members of Congress come to work here, and we come with 16,000 staff \npeople. We are here with millions of tourists every year. These good \nmen and women, most of whom are in uniform, but not all of them are, \nare here to keep us, members of our staff, and the public safe from \nharm.\n  Yesterday's events were a sobering reminder of that fact. I spoke \nyesterday afternoon, shortly after the incident, to Brian Carter, a 23-\nyear veteran of the Capitol Police force who was hurt during \nyesterday's incident. I talked to police officers whom I came in \ncontact with over the last 16 hours\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\nor so. I said: Do you know Brian? Almost everyone knows him. Almost \neveryone said the same exact thing: What a fine man.\n  As I spoke to him yesterday--he is expected to make a recovery--I \nwished him and his family the best during this difficult time for him \nand for all of us. I wish a speedy recovery to the Secret Service agent \nwho was also injured yesterday.\n  But I thought the most memorable thing we had in our short telephone \nconversation was, he said: My job is to keep you safe. He was not \nreferring to me, even though he and I were on the phone. He meant his \njob was to make sure everyone is safe. That was something I will always \nremember.\n  These brave men and women put their lives on the line every day, \nCapitol Police, other law enforcement agencies who work here in the \nCapitol. Why do they do that? Because that is their job.\n  So my thanks go out to every Capitol Police officer. We owe them a \ndebt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7172-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. I want to remind everyone listening that yesterday and \ntoday, the Capitol remains closed to most business. The Federal \nGovernment remains closed. In the newspaper today, it lists all of the \nlayoffs. Today it has a graph of those in the administration area--not \nthe legislative or judicial but in the administration. We have tens of \nthousands of public servants who are not furloughed, but they are \nworking, including law enforcement officials, without pay. A number of \npeople yesterday were out there risking their lives without pay. There \nare hundreds of thousands more, such as intelligence officers, to keep \nthe Nation safe, who have been forced to leave their jobs, forgo their \npaychecks altogether.\n  Because of these furloughs, the Capitol Police, the FBI, and other \nFederal law enforcement agencies face additional risk, as they are \nasked to do their jobs with limited manpower and without the support \nthey can typically depend on.\n  Congress owes it to them and to every American family to get past our \ndifferences, work through our disagreements, and work toward reopening \nthe Federal Government. It is hard to comprehend what is going on. This \nis all because of President Obama's signature legislative issue that we \nwere so fortunate to pass, to allow all Americans to have health care, \nas is the case in every industrialized nation in the world except our \nNation.\n  We have as many as 45 million or 50 million people with no health \ninsurance. I would hope my Republican colleagues understand the bill is \n4 years old, it has been declared constitutional by the Supreme Court, \nit is in effect. Millions of people have gone on line this week to find \nout what they can do to have health insurance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  (Ms. HIRONO assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the leader has noted a number of times \nthat a small group in the House of Representatives has held up and \nclosed the government because they want to do away with what they call \nObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. So my question to the Senator is, \nin all of these discussions they have had, the 40 times they voted, \nhave they ever once come up with an alternative piece of legislation \nthat would provide for your children, if they are in college, to be on \nyour health care policy, or if you have a member of your familiy with a \npreexisting condition such as diabetes or has gone through cancer, have \nthey come up with any alternative or is it just: We want nothing?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, to my friend, the most senior Member of \nthe Senate, in today's newspapers and in commentary on television and \nradio, even Republicans, prominent Republicans, former chairs--I have \nin my mind, which I read today, two former chairs of the National \nRepublican Party--said: We have got to be for something, not just \nagainst everything.\n  That is the problem we have. They are against everything. Against \neverything. As the distinguished Senator from Vermont said, what are \nthey for? We know what they are against, but what are they for?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished leader, because \nI know in my State of Vermont, people are happy, if they have children \ngoing to college, that they can keep them on their health insurance. Or \nif they have a spouse who had breast cancer, for example, they can \nstill get health care, or whatever--diabetes and so on.\n  I think the distinguished leader has answered, no, they want to do \naway with all of this, and nothing in return. That is a nihilistic \napproach that makes no sense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7172-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will be \nin a period of morning business for debate only until 2 p.m., with \nSenators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, several people have spoken. I was touched \nso much by the Chaplain's prayer and by the words of the leader about \nour Capitol Police. The leader, in his young days as a student, served \nas one of the Capitol Police.\n  Because I am President pro tempore, I do have a security detail. But \nlong before I had that, I made it a point to go--every time I would see \na police officer on this campus, I would say: You keep us all safe. \nKeep yourself safe. We worry about you.\n  I am wearing this pin applauding them today. I think we have to know, \ntourists who come here, Members, staff--everybody is kept safe by these \nbrave men and women. I asked those who are assigned to me to join me in \nmy office for a silent prayer yesterday for the safety and the recovery \nof the officer injured, but also for the safety of all of those police \nofficers.\n  They rush in. They rush in when there is trouble. They do not say: \nOh, gosh, I am not getting paid. Or, gee whiz, I am supposed to go off \nduty in a minute. They rush in, no questions asked. They are \nextraordinarily well trained, one of the best trained police \ndepartments anywhere in the country. I think we owe them a debt of \ngratitude.\n  We have also heard a lot over the last few days here on this floor \nabout the costly impacts of this needless government shutdown. It is \nneedless. Of course, the solution to repoening the government is an \neasy one: the Senate has passed a resolution which would reopen the \ngovernment while we work on a meaningful compromise to address our \nbudget and our national debt. Because of a small radical group of tea \nparty activists in the House of Representatives, they will not even \nvote on it.\n  The House of Representatives has decided on a different approach. The \nirony of their parochial, bit-by-bit funding proposal is not lost on \nthe hundreds of Vermonters who were given furlough notices on Tuesday, \nor the veterans in Vermont and across the country who fear the long-\nterm impacts of a government shutdown.\n  They are holding the government hostage, and with it the millions of \nAmericans impacted by this shutdown. They wish to pick and choose \nlittle popular things and say: Here, we are for that. They don't want \nto stand and vote yes or no on actual appropriations, because if they \ndo that they have to take a position. It is easier to vote maybe. If \nthey vote maybe, they can go home and say: Oh, we are for medical \nresearch. We are for the veterans.\n  No, they are not. They voted to shut it down. We had a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives on television posturing to a group of veterans \nsaying isn't it terrible the administration is closing off the \nveterans' memorial. One of the veterans caught them and said: No, it is \nnot the administration that is closing it, it is you. It is you people, \nthe small group of the House of Representatives that has closed it \ndown.\n  Why don't they bring the Senate-passed resolution to the House floor \nfor a vote? This vote would end the shutdown. Instead, a handful of \nextreme ideologues in the House are deciding--\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\narbitrarily--who is worth supporting in this crisis, and when. Bring it \nto a vote. Have all 435 Members stand and vote, yes, we will open the \nveterans programs, the medical research, and everything or, no, we will \nnot. They have to be on record yes or no.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony yesterday--the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is a member of that committee, the \ndistinguished deputy majority leader is. We heard from the Director of \nNational Intelligence about the danger to our country from the threat \nthat increases every day because of all the people who had to be \nfurloughed. Every day the shutdown continues, our readiness and \npreparedness declines.\n  That was evident on Tuesday when the Department of Defense released \nguidance to the National Guard that it would need to issue massive \nfurloughs, even though the National Guard is essential in this country.\n  That included 450 technicians of the Vermont National Guard and an \nadditional 100 Vermont Guardsmen who were recalled from Active orders--\ntheir weekend drills, cancelled. This is where 3,000 members of the \nVermont Guard come together for joint training, so it results in a \ndecrease in that readiness. This also impacts our national security \njust the type of scenario that Director Clapper mentioned.\n  Some of the 450 military technicians in Vermont who received furlough \nnotices on Tuesday are at home without pay, after forfeiting 20 percent \nof their pay for six weeks this summer because of sequestration.\n  I know many of them personally. Some are neighbors of mine in \nVermont. These are real people. I have heard from some of them. They \nhave called and emailed my office. They are asking why their service to \nthe country and their local communities, which is so essential to our \nmilitary readiness and to our ability to respond to crises like natural \ndisasters, can be so readily dismissed. I could not agree more with \nthem. They are not getting paid every week as are the Members of the \nHouse of Representatives--the tea party group--who are holding them \nhostage.\n  I believe the number of furloughs in the National Guard was a \nmisinterpretation by the Department of Defense. This week, the House \nand Senate adopted legislation to ensure that members of our Nation's \nmilitary receive their pay, despite the government shutdown. I am the \ncochair of the National Guard Caucus. I supported this effort in part \nbecause the legislation specifically mentioned the Guard and reserves. \nToday, I have joined Senator Manchin and others in a letter asking the \nSecretary of Defense to reconsider the Department's interpretation.\n  The government shutdown also affects our veterans. There are nearly \n50,000 veterans who call Vermont home. This shutdown is not how we \nthank our veterans and military members for their service. This is not \nhow we show them our support.\n  I have received phone calls and emails from Vermonters about the \nimpact of the government shutdown on services for veterans, but my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont, who is the chairman of the \nVeterans' Committee, has also heard from these people. These are real \npeople. They showed up in support of this country when they were asked. \nNow they say: Why aren't you supporting us?\n  Veterans across the country know that while their benefits payments \nwill continue in the near-term, furloughs within the Veterans \nAdministration are unfair to our veterans who, after their service, \nwere promised our support. Our veterans and military members, including \nthose of our National Guard, should never question our commitment to \ntheir well-being, especially after all they have sacrificed to ensure \nours. They now have a real question: what is our commitment to them? We \ndidn't question their commitment to the country when they served, but \nnow where is our commitment to them?\n  We are not going to solve this problem by adopting a piecemeal \napproach, meant to win headlines and promote the blame game. That is no \nway to run a government. The Senate already passed a bill, a clean \ncontinuing resolution, to keep our government running, and to fulfill \nour commitments. It's time to stop picking winners and losers. If we \nare serious about caring for our servicemembers and veterans, we need \nto get serious about moving beyond this shutdown.\n  The distinguished chair of the Budget Committee is on the floor. She \ngot a budget through this committee. I remember passing the last vote--\nI think it was 5:30 on a Saturday morning after we had gone all day \nlong. Then, when we wanted to go to conference to actually work out the \ndifferences with the House, oh, no, then they might actually have to \nvote on something. It is blocked by a Senator working with the tea \nparty in the House, saying: Oh, no, we can't go to conference.\n  The same people are giving speeches saying: Why can't we have a \nbudget? We passed a budget. Oh, no, now we might actually have to vote \non something. We might have to vote yes or no instead of maybe. We are \nelected to vote yes or no, not maybe. Have the courage to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to thank the President pro tempore, as well as the \nmajority leader for their comments this morning. I am wearing a button, \nas many of my colleagues are, that says thank you to the Capitol \nPolice.\n  The one I am wearing is not one that was issued today but one I asked \nto be commissioned after 9/11 because I thought about the extraordinary \ncourage these men and women showed that day when an imminent attack on \nthis building was well known. Yet they did everything in their power to \nprotect all of us who work here and those who were visiting. I give a \nspecial thank you to them.\n  Yesterday was a tragic day. A young woman--it is still unclear what \nmotivated her--was involved in an incident at the White House, backing \ninto a police vehicle and then trying to escape, followed by a Secret \nService officer. She drove toward the Capitol Building and, sadly, her \nlife was taken.\n  It is understandable. We live in an era where this campus, the U.S. \nCapitol grounds are carefully guarded for obvious reasons. It is a \nclear, visible target to those who hate the United States. Someone in a \ncar is a threat. We know that because car bombs are so common in some \nparts of the world and we are wary of vehicles that may be used to harm \ninnocent visitors or people who work in the U.S. Capitol Building.\n  It will be some time before we sort out all the details of what led \nto this incident yesterday, but there is something we know very \nclearly; that is, that the men and women in the Capitol Police stepped \nforward to defend this Capitol Building and all those who work and \nvisit here. They did this risking their own lives.\n  This morning's Washington Post has a few paragraphs on this which \nbear repeating for the record:\n\n       What seems beyond doubt is that Secret Service personnel, \n     Capitol Police and probably many others rushed toward, not \n     away from, danger--as they are trained to do and as Americans \n     expect them to do. Inside Congress, aides took cover, traded \n     anxious text messages and then went on with their work.\n       Like hundreds of thousands of other federal employees, \n     these are men and women whose contributions have been \n     demeaned by the federal shutdown, who are being asked to work \n     without, at least for the moment, being paid--and who are \n     doing their jobs with considerably more dignity than the \n     House of Representatives has mustered.\n       ``We all owe the Capitol Police a debt of gratitude for \n     their work every day; no finer examples of professionalism & \n     bravery,'' tweeted House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). \n     That's true. But Mr. Boehner owes them, and the rest of the \n     federal workforce, more than a 140-character message of \n     thanks. He owes them a paycheck; he owes them a budget; he \n     owes them an apology.\n\n  How many times have we listened on the floor of the Senate as those \nfrom the other side of the aisle criticize federal workers, try in some \nway to demean the contribution they make to this great Nation, trying \nto find some way to lay them off, if not fire them, or to restrict \ntheir pay over and over; they are trampled on; they are political \ncasualties time and again on the floor of the Senate.\n  Yet each and every one of us, every Member of Congress in the Senate \nand the House, our staffs and our families and those who visit are safe \nbecause of these men and women, these Federal workers. It is about time \nwe realize when we shut down the government, it is the ultimate \ndisrespect to these men and women who simply want to do their job to \nmake this a safer and better nation.\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\n  It was very visible on the grounds right off the Capitol Building \nitself yesterday afternoon. While many of us were told to stay in our \noffices, don't move, for at least half an hour, these men and women \nrisked their lives during a government shutdown when they aren't \nreceiving a paycheck. It was very visible--and should have been visible \nto everyone--the irony of this situation that we shut down the \ngovernment and yet ask them to risk their lives without promise of a \npaycheck.\n  I wish to mention one other thing that happened yesterday that may \nnot have been noticed, where the impact of government shutdown is not \nquite as visible. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Wendy Sherman, Under Secretary of State, testified about the \nfear of Iran developing a nuclear bomb and sanctions imposed by the \nUnited States and the civilized world to persuade them not to develop a \nnuclear bomb.\n  She went on to say: The government shutdown that has furloughed 72 \npercent of the civilian intelligence employees in our government is not \nmaking this a safer country or giving us the eyes and ears around the \nworld we need to make sure Iran does not develop a nuclear bomb, a \nnuclear weapon.\n  She added: Within the Department of the Treasury, 90 percent, 9 out \nof 10, of the people working in the agency which has the responsibility \nof specifically watching that the sanctions in Iran are enforced have \nbeen furloughed--90 percent of them.\n  It isn't only a matter of the visibility of Capitol Police risking \ntheir lives, despite this demeaning government shutdown, it is also \nthat less visible, such as 72 percent of our intelligence workers \ncharged with keeping America safe, avoiding another 9/11, have been \nsent home. Ninety percent of those who are watching carefully so Iran \ndoes not develop a nuclear weapon were sent home because of this \ngovernment shutdown.\n  This is the third embarrassing, shameful day of this government \nshutdown. People say how could it possibly end? It could end very \nsimply. Speaker John Boehner has on his desk in the House of \nRepresentatives a continuing resolution which is a spending bill which \nwill reopen the government for at least 6 weeks. He should call that \nfor a vote today. He will receive bipartisan support. He shouldn't fear \nthat. He should celebrate it, bipartisan support to reopen this \ngovernment.\n  Then I hope he will accept the invitation of Senator Reid and others \nto meet with Senator Murray, the chairman of the Budget Committee, sit \ndown, plan the spending, plan the savings, and plan the important \npolicy decisions--which we have for 6 months tried to bring to this \nfloor--in a conference committee. Let's do it and do it today. Today \nshould be the end of the government shutdown.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial \nfrom today's Washington Post and an article from The Daily Beast on \nIran.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 3, 2013]\n\n Essential Workers: Those Dedicated to Serving the Public Deserve More \n                     Than a Brief Message of Thanks\n\n       The order went out to Capitol Hill personnel Thursday \n     afternoon in capital letters: SHELTER IN PLACE. It was a \n     terrifying moment for a community already on edge. The scare \n     ended with less carnage than we have come to fear in such \n     moments--but not before we were reminded again of the \n     dedication of those who work for the government. Maybe that \n     reminder will bring some politicians to their senses.\n       As we write this, investigators are trying to sort out the \n     series of events that apparently began when a woman tried to \n     drive her car through a security barrier near the White House \n     and ended with shots fired near the U.S. Capitol. What the \n     woman, who was killed, intended, whether police responded \n     appropriately, what lessons may be drawn about the efficacy \n     of security barriers: All of that remains to be examined.\n       What seems beyond doubt is that Secret Service personnel, \n     Capitol Police and probably many others rushed toward, not \n     away from, danger--as they are trained to do and as Americans \n     expect them to do. Inside Congress, aides took cover, traded \n     anxious text messages and then went on with their work.\n       Like hundreds of thousands of other federal employees, \n     these are men and women whose contributions have been \n     demeaned by the federal shutdown, who are being asked to work \n     without, at least for the moment, being paid--and who are \n     doing their jobs with considerably more dignity than the \n     House of Representatives has mustered.\n       ``We all owe the Capitol Police a debt of gratitude for \n     their work every day; no finer examples of professionalism & \n     bravery,'' tweeted House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). \n     That's true. But Mr. Boehner owes them, and the rest of the \n     federal workforce, more than a 140-character message of \n     thanks. He owes them a paycheck; he owes them a budget; he \n     owes them an apology.\n       Beyond the shooting Thursday, Washington was full of the \n     usual posturing, speculating, rumor-trading and jockeying for \n     public relations advantage. Maybe the shutdown would be \n     wrapped into the default. Maybe the Obamacare demands would \n     be subsumed into ``grand bargain''demands. Maybe this, maybe \n     that.\n       Meanwhile, there are mothers who depend on federal \n     assistance for nutrition for their children. There are motel \n     owners and workers on Skyline Drive whose livelihood is \n     threatened because the national parks are closed in what \n     should be their peak season. There are dedicated scientists \n     and food inspectors and intelligence analysts who have been \n     told by Mr. Boehner that he and his fellow Republicans do not \n     consider their work all that essential to the nation.\n       Those scientists and inspectors and analysts are not the \n     nonessential ones.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Daily Beast, Oct. 2, 2013]\n\n    Government Shutdown Empties Offices Enforcing Sanctions on Iran\n\n                            (By Josh Rogin)\n\n       The shutdown has forced the Treasury Department to furlough \n     most of the employees enforcing sanctions on Iran, just as \n     the U.S. is beginning new negotiations. Josh Rogin and Eli \n     Lake report on the potential fallout.\n       With the government shut down, most U.S. officials \n     enforcing sanctions on Iran are not at work, potentially \n     undermining pressure on Tehran as U.S.-Iran negotiations \n     recommence, according to administration officials, lawmakers, \n     and experts.\n       The Treasury Department has furloughed approximately 90 \n     percent of the employees in its Office of Terrorist Financing \n     and Intelligence (TFI), which is responsible for the \n     monitoring of illicit activities and enforcement of sanctions \n     related to several countries, including Iran, Syria, and \n     North Korea, Treasury officials told The Daily Beast. The \n     drastic scaling down of personnel working on those activities \n     comes just as the Obama administration is engaging in its \n     first set of diplomatic negotiations with the new Iranian \n     government, led by President Hassan Rouhani (/articles/2013/\n     09/26/what-hassan-rouhani-really-said-about-the-\n     holocaust.html).\n       A subsection of TFI, the Office of Foreign Asset Control \n     (OFAC), which implements the U.S. government's financial \n     sanctions, has been forced to furlough nearly all its staff \n     due to the lapse in congressional funding, said a Treasury \n     Department spokesman.\n       ``As a result, OFAC is unable to sustain its core functions \n     of: issuing new sanctions designations against those enabling \n     the governments of Iran and Syria as well as terrorist \n     organizations, WMD proliferators, narcotics cartels, and \n     transnational organized crime groups; investigating and \n     penalizing sanctions violations; issuing licenses to \n     authorize humanitarian and other important activities that \n     might otherwise be barred by sanctions; and issuing new \n     sanctions prohibitions and guidance,'' the spokesman said. \n     ``This massively reduced staffing not only impairs OFAC's \n     ability to execute its mission, it also undermines TFI's \n     broader efforts to combat money laundering and illicit \n     finance, protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system, \n     and disrupt the financial underpinnings of our adversaries.''\n       Two other subsections of TFI, the Office of Intelligence \n     and Analysis (OIA) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network (FinCEN), also are working with a skeleton crew. \n     According to FinCEN's shutdown plan (PDF (http://\nwww.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Documents/\nFinCEN%20Shutdown%20Plan_ revised%20FY%202014_ \n     Web%20Version.pdf), 30 of 345 employees were kept on after \n     appropriations ran out Oct. 1.\n       Administration officials often tout the various rounds of \n     sanctions (/articles/2013/09/23/lawmakers-set-a-high-bar-for-\n     iran-to-escape-sanctions.html) passed by Congress and signed \n     by President Obama as crucial to pressuring the Iranian \n     regime to strike a deal to bring its clandestine nuclear \n     program into accordance with international standards of \n     transparency and convince the world it is not developing a \n     nuclear weapon.\n       ``If the lights are not on, then the Iranians will engage \n     in massive sanctions busting to try to replenish their \n     dwindling foreign exchange reserves.''\n       ``Because of the extraordinary sanctions that we have been \n     able to put in place over the last several years, the \n     Iranians are now prepared, it appears, to negotiate,'' Obama \n     said Monday (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/\n09/30/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-netanyahu-\nisrael-after-bilate) after meeting with Israeli Prime \n     Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. ``But we \n     enter into these negotiations very clear-eyed. They will not \n     be easy. And anything that we do will require the highest \n     standards of verification in order for us to provide the sort \n     of sanctions relief that I think they are looking for.''\n       Pressures must be kept in place and even strengthened as \n     new negotiations with the Iranians begin, Netanyahu \n     responded. But the furloughs are making it more difficult to\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\n     enforce the sanctions during the budget stalemate.\n       FinCEN processes tips from banks about suspicious activity \n     and possible money laundering, and shares the data with law \n     enforcement. The network and OFAC are two of the most potent \n     tools the U.S. government has used to pressure Iran.\n       ``Given the fact that the vast majority of FinCEN employees \n     have been furloughed, important pieces of financial \n     intelligence will not be sifted through and analyzed by the \n     agency charged with this task,'' said Avi Jorisch, a former \n     policy adviser for the Treasury Department's TFI office. The \n     government is shut down, Jorisch said, but ``money launderers \n     are certainly not taking vacation.''\n       Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for the \n     Defense of Democracies, said Iran could capitalize on the \n     lack of monitoring and sanctions enforcement to replenish its \n     coffers and advance its nuclear program while no one is \n     looking.\n       ``If the lights are not on, then the Iranians will engage \n     in massive sanctions busting to try to replenish their \n     dwindling foreign exchange reserves,'' he said. ``If you \n     don't have the resources to investigate, identify, and \n     designate the tens of billions of dollars of Iranian regime \n     assets, then you've extended the economic runway of the \n     Iranian regime and increased the likelihood that they could \n     reach nuclear breakout sooner rather than later.''\n       In Congress, top Democrats blame House Republicans for \n     failing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the \n     government running.\n       ``Today, we learn that the Republican shutdown is hurting \n     the Treasury's efforts to implement sanctions against Iran to \n     prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon,'' Rep. Jerrold \n     Nadler (D-NY) told The Daily Beast. ``This insanity has to \n     stop. We must not allow a few extreme members of the \n     Republican Party to threaten our national security any \n     longer. Speaker Boehner should put a clean bill on the floor \n     and allow an up or down vote on reopening the government \n     today. Any further delay clearly threatens our national \n     security.''\n       Top Republicans involved with Iran sanctions said the \n     administration is to blame for not keeping the Treasury \n     employees at their jobs.\n       ``Enforcing sanctions and stopping illicit financial \n     transactions are core national security missions,'' Sen. Mark \n     Kirk (R-IL) told The Daily Beast. ``The administration should \n     not be putting our national security at risk to score \n     political points. All sides need to find common ground and do \n     what's right for the American people.''\n       Treasury officials say they are implementing the shutdown \n     guidelines given to them by the Office of Management and \n     Budget and doing the best they can with limited resources.\n       ``The House Republicans' decision to shut down the \n     government has real consequences, and it goes to our ability \n     to execute our mission, which is integral to protecting our \n     country and advancing our interests,'' a Treasury Department \n     official said. ``We are still enforcing our sanctions, we are \n     still capable of taking action if necessary, but it's a hell \n     of a lot harder and we can't be nearly as nimble and \n     comprehensive as we could be if Congress would pass a clean \n     CR.''\n       Meanwhile, the State Department, which has somehow managed \n     to avoid any significant staff reductions due to the shutdown \n     (/articles/2013/09/30/how-the-government-shutdown-hurts-\n     national-security.html), is beginning a new round of \n     negotiations with Iran in conjunction with its partners in \n     the P5+1, set to take place later this month in Geneva \n     (http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130930/eu-plays-\ndown-deadline-iran-talks-0).\n       State Department officials told The Daily Beast on \n     Wednesday that the shutdown won't affect those plans.\n       ``Dealing with Iran's nuclear program is an absolute top \n     priority for the State Department, and Undersecretary Wendy \n     Sherman and the State Department team are working hard every \n     day on this issue preparing for the next round of talks in \n     Geneva with Iran and our international partners,'' said Marie \n     Harf, deputy State Department spokeswoman.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I join with our majority leader who \nspoke just a moment ago, the majority whip who just spoke so \neloquently, as well as our President pro tempore who just spoke, to \nthank our Capitol Police, Secret Service officers, and all those who \nresponded so courageously yesterday to the situation in the Nation's \nCapital. We depend on them to be there to do their jobs for all of us. \nWe need to be there to do our jobs as well today.\n  I thank all of them for doing their jobs, and I plead with our \ncolleagues to do our jobs.\n  I am so disappointed that we find ourselves again in the morning \nwaking up where the government is shut down, where families and \ncommunities across our Nation are feeling the impact today and worried \nabout what the impact will be tomorrow.\n  I spoke to some small businessmen only a few days ago in my office \nfrom the construction industry. The impact on their contracts, lack of \ncontracts or uncertainty about their contracts is affecting their \nability--and they are now worried they are going to have to lay off \nsome of their employees because they can't sign contracts when they are \nso uncertain whether our government is going to be paying our bills in \nthe future.\n  I met with some Head Start moms a few days ago. I spoke with a young \nwoman who told me this passionate story about being homeless and on the \nstreet with a brandnew baby because of an abusive spouse. The Head \nStart folks in her community found her, found her a shelter, placed her \nin some education courses about how to be a mom. In 2 years, she is now \non her own, working, and back in school because of a government service \nthat was there for her. She didn't plead to me; she pleaded for those \nother moms or dads who are out there who now face uncertainty and may \nnot have that help in the future.\n  I have talked to veterans, as the President pro tempore knows, the \nformer chair of the Veterans' Committee, about having worked so hard to \nmake sure our veterans get the services they need as they come home. \nThey are not here pleading for themselves, although they are very \nworried about whether, as this goes on, they will get the services they \nneed. They are pleading, as veterans always do, so selfless in their \nservice to our Nation, for us to get the government moving again so our \ncountry is back on track, this country that they have so proudly fought \nfor and that people are now hurting.\n  Today, of course, we are hearing news of a storm, a tropical storm \nthat is approaching our Nation as well.\n  Families across the South are paying attention to that and they are \nworried about what a government shutdown or impact might be to them as \nthey face that news on their television and radios this morning. Of \ncourse FEMA will be there. They have told us they will be able to call \nback their furloughed workers. They are prepared to respond to this, as \nour great Nation always must. But we have to be very concerned about \nwhat happens in the future if this government remains shut down--\nwhether there will be reimbursements in a timely fashion, whether \ncleanup will be able to move forward, and whether there will be an \nability to pay for that.\n\n  Thousands of members of the National Guard, who have been furloughed, \nas this approaches us, will need to be called back to get ready for \nthat emergency. Of course, if there is any significant damage--and we \nall pray there is not, but if there is--cleanup and recovery will \nlikely be impacted because of furloughs at the SBA and at the \nDepartment of Transportation. All of our government agencies and \ngovernment employees who are normally there to respond in a disaster \nare today not at work, not getting ready, not possibly there in the \nfuture, if this shutdown continues.\n  So I hope for the best for these communities as this storm is \nthreatening. I know our Federal workers will do everything they can to \nprotect these families. We owe it to these communities that are \nimpacted by this storm and to communities across the country to get our \ngovernment back up and running as quickly as we can, which can happen \nvery fast.\n  And by the way, Madam President, I will be here later today to talk \nabout the impacts on my State. The impacts of this shutdown are real, \nand as it continues, so is the uncertainty it produces. Our ability to \nrespond as a Nation to any kind of disaster is a concern for every \nfamily.\n  But I am here today to say it doesn't have to be this way. The answer \nto this is so simple. As the majority whip just said, there is a bill \nin the House of Representatives right now, this minute, that is sitting \nthere, and Speaker Boehner can simply bring it up for a vote. We know \nit has the votes to pass. It will say this government will continue to \nrun until November 15, and it will give us the opportunity to then \nnegotiate and to deal with the broader issues that we all know we need \nto deal with in terms of our budget. But we cannot hold our communities \nand the future of this country hostage while we negotiate those bills.\n  So it is so easy. The Speaker can take up this bill, put people back \nto\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\nwork--our government employees, who need to respond to any kind of \nemergency. Our National Guard will be back at work. Our veterans will \nnot have to worry about payments coming for them, and this will be the \ncountry for our fellow countrymen as we always have been--all that, \nsimply by Speaker Boehner bringing up a bill that would quickly pass. \nIt would then go to the President, and then this would be over.\n  I know there has been a lot of talk the past few days about a grand \nbargain. No one on this floor has worked harder than I have to get us \nto a budget compromise so we have a path in the future to deal not only \nwith our debt and deficit but also with our deficit in terms of \ntransportation and education and our deficit in terms of our \ninvestments that we need to make as a country to be strong in the \nfuture. We all know what the sides are on that. We all know we need to \ncome to the table and solve that--that is, the differences we as \nleaders of this Nation need to address.\n  I have worked extremely hard on that, and it is time for us to do \nthat. As everyone on this floor knows, we were told by our Republican \ncounterparts and told and told and told the Senate needs to pass a \nbudget. I became budget chair at the beginning of this year. We did our \njob. Our committee passed a budget. We brought it to the floor. We \nlived through 5 days of amendments. We brought up every amendment \npossible and voted on over 100 of them and then we passed that budget. \nThat was the time, 6 months ago, when we should have then said, the \nHouse has passed a budget, the Senate has passed a budget, let's go to \nconference and figure out those differences so we don't end up in this \ncrisis today.\n  That is the expectation people have of a democracy. Unfortunately, we \nwere told time and again: No, we are not going to allow you to go to \nconference. So here we are in a crisis. Well, let's address this crisis \nfirst. First, let's put people back to work. Let's get our country and \nour economy moving quickly again, and then allow us to go to conference \nto deal with those issues that are so critical to this Nation in terms \nof our fiscal responsibilities and the investments and priorities we \nneed to make as a Nation.\n  So my plea today is to the Speaker to take up the bill, to allow the \ncountry to work again, and then for us to take up our responsibility to \nfind solutions to the disagreements we truly do have as a Nation. I \nurge my colleagues to urge the Speaker to allow the country to get back \nto work, and then let's get to the table and let's solve this.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I want to first thank the Capitol Police \nfor their bravery and for the important work they do in protecting all \nof us in the Capitol. Yesterday really showed how important they are. \nSo I want to thank them for everything they did yesterday to make sure \npeople were protected.\n  This is day 4 of the government shutdown--a shutdown that did not \nneed to happen. I had hoped when I came to the floor a couple of days \nago, and when I heard congressional leaders were meeting with the \nPresident, at his request, that they would emerge from that meeting \nwith a plan to end this impasse and get the government open again, to \ncome to an agreement as to how we can responsibly fund the government \nand address the challenges we face as a Nation. But coming out of that \nmeeting, what we got, of course, was a President who said he will not \nnegotiate.\n  From the beginning, I have said this strategy was an ill-conceived \nstrategy by some Members of my own party who thought that defunding \nObamaCare--therefore, shutting down the government--would, No. 1, stop \nthe exchanges from opening. But we knew that was not going to happen. \nIn fact, it has already happened, even though we shut down the \ngovernment. It was ill conceived because, again, we knew that with the \nPresident and the Senate Democrats in charge, they were not going to \ndefund their signature piece of legislation.\n  As much as I support repealing that piece of legislation--because I \nhave seen the impact already in my own State of New Hampshire, in terms \nof premiums and in terms of less choice for individuals, and I do \nbelieve there is a better way to address health care in this country--\nwhere we find ourselves right now is unacceptable for America. It is \nunacceptable as leaders elected by the people of this country. We owe \nit to our constituents to resolve this now. Both sides need to get \ntogether and we need to resolve this.\n  I would say to my Republican colleagues in the House and to some in \nthis Chamber, it is time for a reality check. Defunding ObamaCare did \nnot work as a strategy, so let's find common ground and work together, \nyes, to address the very legitimate concerns we have with this health \ncare bill, but also to get this government funded. I would say to my \nDemocratic colleagues here in the Senate and to the President, come to \nthe table and negotiate. Let's work this out on behalf of the American \npeople. I will say it again: I think where we are is the result of an \nill-conceived strategy by many in my party, leading to an immature \nresponse that says we will not negotiate and talk and try to work this \nout on behalf of the American people.\n  We all know the American people are the ones suffering the most from \nthis shutdown. I have heard it from our guardsmen in New Hampshire who \nhave been forced to go to the unemployment office, Federal employees \nwho wonder whether they will be able to pay their mortgages, furloughed \ncivilian workers in New Hampshire at one of our proudest military \ninstallations in this country, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and small \nbusiness owners who can't get the help they need from the Small \nBusiness Administration. They deserve better than this.\n  I hope, as we head into this weekend, the President, the leaders of \nthe House, the leaders of the Senate will get together, and that we \nwill get behind them on behalf of the American people, to get this \ngovernment open, to resolve our differences, to find common ground and \ndo the people's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. First, let me also start, Madam President, by thanking the \nmen and women of the Capitol Police and the District of Columbia and \nthe Secret Service. It reminds us they are the thin blue line standing \nbetween us and danger. This is a moment to extend our thanks to all law \nenforcement and first responders around the country who, on a daily \nbasis, are on that thin blue line as well. So we are all grateful for \nwhat you do for us and how you keep us safe.\n  I wanted to talk, of course, about this week. It has been an \ninteresting week, to say the least, beyond the events of yesterday. \nWhen we turn on the cable news, it features these countdown clocks \nleading up to the government slowdown. Now, in the aftermath of it, we \nsee the countdown about how many days we have been into this thing.\n  Look, there is no doubt this impasse we are at is a problem for the \ncountry. This is not the best way to run the most important government \nin the most important country in the world.\n  There are people around here who all they do is focus on politics. \nFor them, every day is election day. They are focused on who is \nwinning, who is going to get the blame, and who is this going to help \nin the next election. I suppose that has a place in politics and in the \ngoverning process. But let me answer the question: Who will get the \nblame? We all are. Every single one of us in the House, the Senate, and \nin the entire Federal Government will get the blame.\n  And let me tell you why. Because there are people who woke up this \nmorning who didn't get enough sleep last night. Maybe they were up late \nhelping their kids with their homework. They got up, guzzled a bunch of \ncoffee and forced themselves to work. They didn't want to work. They \nwere tired. But they had to. And they are going to work today, and they \nare going to get home and go through all that again. And they are \nwondering: Why can't you guys do that? Why can't you do your job? I \nthink that is a very valid frustration that people have with this \nprocess and with those of us here today.\n  I am not happy about some of the things we have seen this week or \nover\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nthe last couple of weeks. I think it is very unfortunate--some of the \nrhetoric that has been used around here, both in this Chamber and in \nthe public domain. But each day that goes by, what I am more and more \nworried about may not be what everybody else, or at least too many \npeople here, are worried about. See, I think it is wrong that those of \nus who stand on principle, who believe, for example, ObamaCare is going \nto badly damage our economy--I think it is wrong we have a Congressman \nfrom my home State who compares us to the Taliban. We have a \nspokesperson for the White House who says we are like people with bombs \nstrapped to our chests. I think that is wrong.\n  I think it is wrong too by the way, that the President has used the \nmegaphone of the Presidency not to bring Americans together but to \ndeepen these divisions. Mr. President, you are not the chairman of the \nDemocratic party. You are the President of the United States. Act like \nthe President of the United States. Rise above that stuff. Your job is \nto bring this Nation together. I know people are going to say things \nabout you that you don't like. It comes with the territory. You have to \nrise above it. And I hope he will.\n  But those are not the things that concern me the most. What I am most \nworried about is that this country faces a very serious crisis, and we \nare running out of time to fix it. There is no doubt this government \nslowdown is not good, but it is not the crisis I am referring to. This \nissue about hitting the debt limit is a problem, but that is not the \nmost serious crisis we face either. The single most important crisis we \nface in this country is that for millions of Americans the promise of \nthe American dream is literally slipping through their fingers. With \nall the focus around here on whatever the crisis of the day may be, I \nfear we are simply not spending enough time focusing on that reality.\n  It reminds me of a story I know. A few years ago, a friend of mine in \nFlorida was on a twin-engine airplane flying from one part of the State \nto another. At some point during that flight, a fire broke out in the \ncockpit. That fire was a problem. But the bigger problem was that both \nof the pilots started to put out the fire, and no one was flying the \nplane. Within a few seconds, the plane began to plunge, and it lost \nhundreds of feet of altitude. Luckily, they figured it out quickly and \nwere able to correct it. But they were so focused on the fire in the \ncockpit, they weren't flying the plane. Luckily, they realized in time \nif they didn't start flying that plane that fire was going to be pretty \ninsignificant for them in just a few seconds.\n  So we have a government slowdown, and this government slowdown is a \nproblem, yes. We have the upcoming debt limit issue, and that is a \nproblem, yes. But the fire in our cockpit and the one we need to \naddress is the erosion of the American dream.\n  If we think the slowdown of government is problematic, that is a vote \naway from being solved. All we have to do is take a vote in either \nChamber and we can solve that problem. But the slowdown in government \nis going to be a big problem when this government no longer has enough \nmoney to pay its bills, and if we keep doing what we are doing now, \nthat is going to happen.\n  We think this debt limit situation is a problem? That is one vote \naway from being solved. When it is going to be a real problem is when \nno one wants to buy our debt anymore because they don't think we can \npay them back.\n  We think all this division and dysfunction in Washington is bad for \nour economy? Yes. But what is worse is a tax code that kills jobs, \nregulations that on a daily basis are killing jobs, and a national debt \nthat is killing jobs. By the way, one of the greatest destroyers of \njobs in America today is ObamaCare, and that is why we are so \npassionate about it.\n  The American dream--which people throw around so loosely as a term--\nis basically the notion that no matter where you start out in life, no \nmatter how many obstacles you have to overcome, you have the God-given \nright, through hard work and perseverance, to achieve a better life and \nleave your children better off than yourself. But it is being eroded on \na daily basis, and not nearly enough attention is being paid to that. I \ndon't see any countdown clocks on cable television about the American \ndream.\n  The most dangerous thing happening in Washington today is that \neveryone is so busy fighting about the problems before us today that \nthere doesn't seem to be enough focus on the crisis we are headed to \npretty soon; that we are on the verge of losing the American dream. I \nsay that because, to one extent or another, we are all guilty of \nmisplacing that focus.\n  So my speech here today as much as anything else is a reminder to me \nof why I wanted to serve here. The reason I wanted to serve here is \nbecause I know--I don't think; I know--that America is special. I know \nthis partially because I was raised by and around people who know what \nlife is like in places other than America. In places other than \nAmerica, you can only go as far as your parents went. You are trapped. \nWhatever your family did is the only thing you are allowed to do by \nthose societies.\n  But we have been different, and I have seen it with my own eyes. Both \nin my neighborhood and in my family, I have seen people who came here \nwith little education and no connections and through hard work and \nperseverance achieve a better life, achieve a meaningful life, and \nleave their kids better off than themselves. I also see how every \nsingle day there are millions of people out there now trying to achieve \nthe same thing, and they are finding it harder and harder to do that. \nWe are on the verge of losing that. If we lose that, every day that is \neroded, so too is the exceptionalism of this country. People love to \nuse that term, an ``exceptional nation,'' and I believe it is \nexceptional, but it is exceptional primarily because of the American \ndream.\n  Many countries in the world have powerful militaries. Every country \nin the world has rich people and big companies. What makes us different \nis that here, if you are willing to work hard, if you have a really \ngood idea, you can be rewarded for it with a better life. That is \neroding. If we lose that, we lose what makes us special and different, \nand no one seems to be fighting enough about that.\n  The only reason all these other issues matter is because they relate \nto the American dream. The reason the debt really matters is because it \nundermines the American dream. The reason our Tax Code, which is \nbroken, matters is because it undermines the American dream. The reason \nI am so passionate about ObamaCare is because for millions of people it \nis undermining the ability to achieve the American dream.\n  The reason I ran for office is because as a country we are headed in \nthe wrong direction because we are losing the American dream. We still \nhave time to fix this, but we don't have all century. We don't even \nhave all decade. We have to begin to take these issues seriously or we \nwill be known as the first generation of Americans who lost the \nAmerican dream and left our children worse off than ourselves.\n  We still have time to refocus ourselves. With all this noise about \npolitics and who gets the blame and who is responsible for what, I hope \nwe can use these challenges before us as a catalyst to begin to focus \non these issues and why they matter. They matter because they are \nhurting people, and they are hurting people who are trying to achieve a \nbetter life. If we do that, if we focus on that and if we solve the \nproblems before us with an eye toward that, then I think we will have \nthe real opportunity to do what every generation of Americans before us \nhas done: to leave our children better off than ourselves and to leave \nfor them what our parents left for us--the single greatest Nation in \nthe history of the world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I come to the floor again today to \ntalk about the effects of this government shutdown that are being \nexperienced in New Hampshire. As I begin, let me start where a number \nof my colleagues have this morning, and that is by thanking the Capitol \nPolice and the Metropolitan Police for the great job they did \nyesterday, and particularly the Capitol Police, who are willing to put \ntheir lives on the line, as we say frequently, every day to protect us, \nbut in this case where they are doing that and they are not getting \npaid, that is certainly a tribute to the commitment\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\nand the dedication they have to this Congress and to this government.\n  I hope that as Members of the Senate and as Members of Congress, we \nwill take inspiration from that dedication and recommit to trying to \nend this government shutdown and end the negative impacts it is having \non people across this country. We are just 4 days into the shutdown--\nthis is day No. 4--but every day we see more and more of the effects it \nis having across the country and in my home State of New Hampshire.\n  My colleague Senator Ayotte was on the floor earlier talking about \nsome of the frustrations people are experiencing as a result of the \nshutdown. As I said earlier this week, hundreds of Air National Guard \ncivilian employees have already been furloughed. We have Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard workers who are facing furlough. We have new SBA loan \noriginations that have come to a halt, so businesses aren't able to get \nthe capital they need. So many other important services and so many \nother people are being affected.\n  I really wanted to talk today a little more in-depth about the effect \nof the shutdown on one of New Hampshire's national treasures, the White \nMountain National Forest.\n  This time of year the Kancamagus Highway in the White Mountains \nreally starts to see bumper-to-bumper traffic. You might not expect \ntraffic jams in a remote location like that in the middle of the \nmountains, but when tourists come in to see the beautiful fall foliage \nin New Hampshire, it really is a boon to New Hampshire's economy, and \nthey are everywhere.\n  New Hampshire's director of travel and tourism, Lori Harnois, \nestimates that about 7.8 million people will come to New Hampshire \nbetween September and the end of November, which is 2 percent higher \nthan last year. According to Lori, more than spending time, these \nvisitors will spend over $1 billion, which is about 3 percent more than \nwas spent last year. That is why this season is so critical for the \nsmall businesses in New Hampshire that depend on the tourism industry. \nThis is really about the economics of New Hampshire and the ability of \nso many of our small businesses and their owners and employees to \nsurvive throughout the year. Local stores, restaurants, and attractions \nrely on this season to meet their bottom lines.\n  Many tourists coming to New Hampshire visit our Federal forest lands \nin the White Mountain National Forest. Those lands are administered by \nthe U.S. Forest Service. The White Mountain National Forest stretches \nover 800,000 acres in New Hampshire and Maine, and it is one of the \nmost visited outdoor recreation sites in all of United States, with \nnearly 6 million visitors a year. More visitors than go to Yellowstone \nor Yosemite Parks come and visit the White Mountains of New Hampshire. \nFor everyone who has been there or visited one of the many landmarks in \nthe forest, it is no surprise because its natural beauty has kept \nvisitors coming back for centuries. Given its proximity to cities such \nas Boston and Montreal, it is a great place to bring families. Nearly \n60 million people in the United States alone live within 1 day's drive \nof the White Mountain National Forest.\n  Unfortunately, this year, during the busiest few weeks of the year, \ntourists are going to be shut out of important services because of this \nunnecessary government shutdown. Restrooms for families in bumper-to-\nbumper traffic will be closed along the highways and trails in the \nnational forest. Garbage collection is going to be suspended. \nCampgrounds will be closed starting over the next few days. Families \nlooking to camp in the White Mountains will have to find new lodging or \nchange their plans.\n  Ongoing repairs to bridges and roads in response to Hurricane Irene--\nwe are still cleaning up as a result of the damage from Hurricane \nIrene--those projects are going to be put on hold, and only a few staff \nmembers are going to still be there to respond to emergencies, conduct \nrepairs, and help direct people.\n  This is leading to a frustrating experience for tourists, and it is \nfrustrating for all of the businesses that depend on the people who \ncome to visit. The shutdown could really hurt a very important industry \nin New Hampshire at a critical time.\n  All told, about 120 employees for the White Mountains have been told \nto stay home until Congress reaches a budget agreement. And as we have \nheard here in Washington, as we know from our own staffs, these \nemployees have done nothing to deserve these furloughs. They have \nworked hard, they have been dedicated, but they are going to have to \ntry to make ends meet because Congress can't get its act together. No \nwonder people are outraged.\n  Our Federal forest lands are not only critical drivers of the tourism \nindustry, they support New Hampshire's timber industry. If this \nshutdown continues, the Forest Service will have to determine whether \nto suspend existing contracts for timber-harvesting on Federal lands, \nand these companies will have to shut down their operations at one of \nthe best times to harvest timber. So the impact will also be on all of \nthose people who work in the timber industry and depend on that \nindustry for their livelihood.\n  I wish to highlight some of these effects because we need to remind \nourselves just what this government shutdown means for the people who \nare being hurt, what it means for the small businesses and their \nemployees, and what it means to the economy in my State of New \nHampshire and the economy across the country. We are clearly seeing the \neffects of the shutdown in New Hampshire. If we don't act, these \neffects will become more and more severe every day.\n  I hope we can begin to see talks going on between Members of the \nHouse and Senate. I hope those who are holding up the continuing \nresolution in the House--the legislation that would get this country \noperating again--will reconsider. All it takes is the Speaker to bring \nthat legislation to the floor. He keeps saying we haven't negotiated. \nIn fact, we have negotiated. We negotiated for over 1 year before we \npassed the Affordable Care Act. We negotiated before this continuing \nresolution was agreed to, and the Senate, in fact, accepted the \nnumbers, the cost of that continuing resolution to keep the government \nopen. We thought our numbers were better, but we accepted the House \nnumbers because we wanted to try to negotiate and reach an agreement. \nUnfortunately, what we have seen is that the House has reneged on that \nagreement.\n  It is now time to bring that legislation to the floor, to get this \ngovernment operating again, and to end the negative impact and the real \nhardship so many people across this country are experiencing.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, in Vermont and all over this country \nthere is profound anger and disgust at what is going on here in \nWashington. The reason is that today we remain in a significant and \nvery serious economic downturn. Real unemployment is close to 14 \npercent. Over 20 million workers are unemployed. And what the American \npeople are saying as loudly and as clearly as they can is, Congress, we \nwant you to create millions of decent-paying jobs. All over this \ncountry, people are struggling with wages of $9 or $10 a hour. What the \nAmerican people are saying to Congress is: Congress, Mr. President, we \nwant you to raise the minimum wage.\n\n  In the midst of a serious economic crisis, the American people want \nus to act to improve the economy, to create jobs, to raise wages. But \nwhat are we doing today? We are saying to 800,000 hard-working Federal \nemployees: Don't come in to work. We don't know when and if you are \ngoing to be paid. We are saying to 1.2 million other Federal employees \nwho are at work: Thank you very much for coming in to your job today. \nThank you for your work as a Capitol Hill police officer or FBI agent \nor somebody in the CIA or somebody working at Head Start or somebody \ndelivering meals to low-income senior citizens, thank you all very much \nfor your work but we don't know when and if you will be paid.\n  What we are doing right now is the exact opposite of what the \nAmerican people want. They want us to create jobs and raise wages. What \nwe are saying to 2 million American workers is: You are not getting \npaid. Some of you are furloughed. Some of you are coming in.\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\n  These Federal employees are not millionaires. They are hard-working, \nmiddle-class Americans. They are struggling as is everybody else in \nthis country to pay their mortgages, to send their kids to college, to \nafford childcare, to do what other middle-class families need to do. We \nare putting all of them under extreme anxiety today. In an unstable, \nvolatile economy, that is not what we should be doing.\n  In addition, this shutdown is having a very negative impact on the \nentire economy. The estimate is that we are losing about $10 billion a \nweek as a result of the government shutdown, according to Goldman \nSachs. If the government is shut down for 3 weeks, the economy will \nlose over $36 billion. Moody's has estimated if the shutdown lasts 4 \nweeks, it will drain $55 billion from the economy.\n  Does any sane person believe that when our economy today has so many \nproblems--when we are just beginning to recover from the worst economic \ndownturn since the Great Depression, when we were losing 700,000 jobs a \nmonth, when we are trying to get our feet on the ground economically--\ndoes anybody think it makes sense to not be paying over 2 million \nworkers and to be losing billions and billions of dollars in the \neconomy as a result of the shutdown?\n  This is the start of the flu season. Every fall the Centers for \nDisease Control closely monitors the spread of flu and directs vaccines \nto where they are needed the most. But because of the shutdown, the CDC \nis today unable to support the annual seasonal influenza program. Does \nthat make sense to anybody? We are endangering the health and the lives \nof millions of Americans because of the shutdown of the CDC.\n  During the shutdown the Food and Drug Administration is stopping most \nof its food safety operations. We have seen over the years outbreaks of \nsalmonella and other types of food problems. Does anyone think it makes \nsense to shut down the FDA?\n  Most of the Department of Labor is closed. Ironically, we are \nsupposed to be receiving a report from the Department of Labor telling \nus what kind of unemployment rate we now have, but we cannot get that \nbecause they are shut down.\n  The WIC Program, Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program, is \nbeing shut down. This is a program that provides good nutrition to low-\nincome pregnant women and their babies so that the mothers and the \nbabies will be healthy in these critical times in their lives. We want \nhealthy children in this country. We don't want to see children die at \nbirth. That is what the WIC Program is about.\n  Social Security services are being delayed. In Burlington, VT, where \nI live, there was a rally yesterday. Social Security workers are being \nfurloughed. Others are working without pay. We owe it to the seniors in \nthis country that when they are eligible for Social Security and they \napply for Social Security their papers are processed in a timely \nmanner. That is what they are due.\n  Head Start Programs for thousands of lower income kids are starting \nto close. Today Head Start provides education, health, nutrition, and \nother services to roughly 1 million children throughout our country. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported yesterday on the impact the shutdown \nis already having. Four Head Start Programs that offer preschool \nactivities for 3,200 children in Florida, Connecticut, Alabama, and \nMississippi have closed and officials said 11 other programs would be \nshut down by week's end if Federal funding is not restored. Does any \nsane person believe we should be shutting down Head Start Programs at a \ntime when preschool education is so important? We all understand that.\n  And it is so hard to come by. What we are telling parents today is \nnext week you may not be able to bring your kids into a Head Start \nProgram. How does that impact your employment? What do you do with your \nkid? Does anybody around here care about that?\n  The United States is the only nation in the industrialized world that \ndoes not guarantee health care to all people. Today we have about 48 \nmillion people with no health insurance. ObamaCare, to my mind, is not \na solution to the problem but it is a step forward. We are talking \nabout 20, maybe 25 million people who are in desperate need of health \ninsurance being able to get that insurance; others who are paying more \nthan they can afford perhaps getting insurance that is more affordable \nto them. We should be going farther in terms of health care, but for \nrightwing Republicans in the House of Representatives to be saying we \nare going to keep this government shut down until we deny millions of \npeople the health care based on legislation that we passed is \ninexcusable. It is not acceptable.\n  The point I think many of my colleagues made and everybody agrees \nwith now--this is not in debate and the American people have to \nunderstand this--No. 1, the Senate passed a continuing resolution that \nin my view simply underfunds many of the programs out there. I am not \nhappy about that bill. It should be much higher than that. It is not a \ngood bill, but it was passed. Everybody understands that if Speaker \nBoehner chose to be the Speaker of the United States House of \nRepresentatives and not the Speaker of the Republican Party, and if he \nbrought that bill that we passed here in the Senate on the floor this \nmorning, there is no debate, they have the votes. The Democrats and \nmoderate Republicans and maybe more would vote for that legislation and \ngovernment could be reopened this afternoon. The Speaker there has an \nissue he has to deal with. He has to understand that he represents all \nthis country and not just an extreme rightwing faction.\n\n  I hope very much the Speaker will do the right thing, bring that to \nthe floor, and reopen the government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I want to follow up briefly first on the \ncomments of Senator Sanders. We have a continuing resolution over \nthere. The annualized cut is $70 billion. Usually when you compromise, \none side gives a little, the other side gives a little. On this \ncontinuing resolution that passed out of this body, we took their \nnumbers. Compromise means you take a little bit from both sides. We \ntook 100 percent the numbers from the House, a $70 billion annualized \ncut. That is what we took. So to people who keep saying we are not \nnegotiating, we did. As a matter of fact, we went much farther than \nmany of us wanted. We did it because we wanted to keep the government \nopen.\n  So let's not get fooled by some of the political speeches they are \nmaking on the floor or over there, outside in the courtyard. We met \ntheir annualized reductions--they wanted $70 billion--with this \ncontinuing resolution. When they sent bills over here we have voted on \nthem. They have not prevailed on their side, but we have voted on them.\n  We sent the bill over there. It is sitting. We know by public \nstatements by many Republicans and Democrats over there, they are ready \nto vote on this bill, a clean CR, continuing resolution, to keep the \ngovernment open.\n  What is amazing about this is we are debating this. What we should be \ngetting back to--I know the chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Mikulski, would--as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee we would like to get back to appropriations, annual bills. \nThen we would not be in this start-and-stop deal that I think the \nAmerican people are fed up with, this manufactured crisis that a few \nover in the House used to set us up in a situation where we create more \nuncertainty in the family, more uncertainty with small businesses, more \nuncertainty with individuals in the Federal Government on furlough. \nEighty percent of my staff is on furlough. Every day they are on \nfurlough I donate my salary. I am doing my part because we should not \nbe exempt from this situation. But at the same time we have to \nrecognize the impact it is having to our economy.\n  I get it; they are passionate about their view on the Affordable \nHealth Care Act. They do not like it, some of them over there. Some of \nthem also said we should work to fix it. I proposed multiple solutions \nand ideas how we can move forward on that. But to hold up the economy, \nhold up the budget over this issue is ridiculous. I don't like No Child \nLeft Behind. I hate it. For Alaska it doesn't work. It destroyed many \nefforts in our rural communities. But to hold up the government over \nthat? I am going to work to fix it, and if I can't fix it I am going to\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nvote against the reauthorization. That is the right that we have here. \nBut they are playing, as I called it last night, Russian roulette \neconomics, and the American people are on the back end. It is shameful.\n  We have to get back to doing what we should be doing, annualized \nappropriations bills, create certainty in our economy, create certainty \nin our government, focus on this economy that has moved, for 4 or 5 \nyears now, from this recession, a great recession. It is a slow climb \nout, but it is in the right direction. Let's keep it moving in that \ndirection with the right kind of policies.\n  In my State, winter is setting in. The Low-Income Housing Assistance \nProgram is critical for Alaskans who are living in areas where their \nincome is not able to purchase the energy they need to supply their \nhouse with winter heat, and they depend on the Low-Income Housing \nAssistance Program. It is not about some fluff program or some luxury \nprogram. It is for them life or death. If you cannot heat your home in \nAlaska when it is 30 below, you may not survive. It is that simple.\n  I said earlier I think the Members on the other side clearly \nunderstand that we have to get the government running, and there are \nMembers on both sides who are ready to do that over there if the \nSpeaker would just put it on the table so people could vote on it. If \nit fails, we go back to negotiations. My bet is it will not fail. \nBecause it passed here. People forget the cloture vote here, the vote \nto move the bill forward here in the Senate passed 99 to 0. I am not \nsure when that happened recently around this place, but we did it--\nafter great passionate speeches by some, but we did it. We debated it, \nwe moved the bill over because it was the right thing to do. Again, \nreminding people, we met the House numbers. We didn't lift our numbers \nup or down, we went all the way down to their number--$70 billion in \ncuts in annualized savings--annualized cuts to the Federal budget on \nthis 6-week or so continuing resolution.\n  In Anchorage--a columnist just wrote about it--we estimate about \n13,000 Federal workers are in some form impacted by this, laid off or \nimpacted because they are working longer hours with no pay.\n  I want to detail a couple of examples in Alaska where it is \nimpacting. Take this Federal worker who has now been furloughed. They \nare in the midst of remodeling their home. I got this call. Everything \nstopped. The contractors who are expecting to get paid are not getting \npaid. The contractor working for the employee who was remodeling their \nhome--that will not happen because of the uncertainty. His comment was, \nI thought, pretty clear: Life doesn't stop just because Congress says \nyou can't come to work anymore.\n  Life continues, and these costs pile up.\n  In my State, the Bering Sea crab fishery--many people see this on the \nTV show the ``Deadliest Catch''--is worth about $80 million a year. The \namount of crab they can catch is determined by NOAA Fisheries and the \nState of Alaska.\n  Crab season starts October 15. If they do not have these quotas set, \nthen making sure that the process is safe and the product is exactly \nwhat people expect when they get it on their plate to eat or at the \ngrocery store--the problem is those employees are furloughed, so the \nquota will not be set. As a result, the permits they need to catch the \ncrab will not happen, and the end result is a multimillion-dollar hit--\nand not to some government employee.\n  I heard people criticize the bureaucrats. Well, not only are 1 \nmillion or so employees furloughed across this country, but now it is \naffecting second and third options. In this case it is the crab \nindustry, which will affect people all over this country and people all \nover the world. Again, we have delay after delay.\n  Alaska receives about $1.2 billion from the Federal payroll every \nsingle year. A lengthy disruption will have an incredible fiscal impact \nto our State and will trickle out because these folks travel. I see my \ncolleague from Washington State. We have lots of people who go to \nSeattle, WA. They may not take that trip and spend in that economy \nbecause they are afraid of what might happen with this stop-and-go \nsituation.\n  We are now about to move forward--after decades of waiting--on the \nNational Petroleum Reserve for oil and gas exploration. What does it \ntake? It is a Federal Reserve so it takes Federal permits. Without the \nFederal permits, it cannot happen or it gets delayed, and it is costly.\n  When we look at the issues and the calls I have received, it is all \nthe way from an elder in the Artic Circle who said: Please, get the \npeople back to work. It has a direct impact, not only on Alaskans, but \non people all across this country.\n  There has been a lot of great debate. Yesterday, I saw a press \nconference given by a small group of the minority over there who said \nthey were concerned about the National Institutes of Health. I am \nconcerned about the National Institutes of Health. I can tell you story \nafter story of how those medicines are critical for young people and \nadults. What they failed to mention was the billions they have already \ncut. They forgot that little detail. Amnesia is like a prerequisite for \nsome Members around here, and they forgot that little detail. It's \namazing to me.\n  I will mention again--because I believe the public has not heard this \nenough because they say over there that we are not negotiating--we have \nnegotiated with them. We have taken their numbers and have gone down by \n$70 billion in annualized cuts. We have taken them for this continuing \nresolution. Every time they sent something over here, we voted on it. \nThey may not have liked the vote outcome, but we voted on it.\n  We sent one continuing resolution over there. We also have the farm \nbill, the immigration bill, and the WRDA bill. It has not piled up over \nthere because they have not taken action. They would rather play party \npolitics and figure out what elections they can win or lose rather than \nfocus on what is important for the American people, and for my \nconstituency, specifically, in Alaska that I represent.\n  I hope we end this debate, get on with business, and re-open the \ngovernment. Let's negotiate. They have some ideas to fix the health \ncare act. I am happy to talk with them. I have several bills I have \nintroduced, but I never have heard from them over there. As a matter of \nfact, I know they mentioned my name over there quite a bit. I have seen \nit on TV. The House somehow recognizes that I have some influence, and \nI do in some ways. If they want to have a conversation, I'm game. Pick \nup the phone or walk across the Capitol.\n  Let's be real: The continuing resolution is about managing our budget \nand putting people back to work so we can keep this economy moving and \nget on with the big issues that we have to deal with. If they want to \nfix the health care act, I am happy to sit down with Members. If they \nwant to move the immigration bill, I am happy to work with folks. We \ncan go through the list.\n  Let's not hold the American people hostage for a simple situation. If \nthey were to put it on the floor, it would pass. I would bet on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yesterday we had a hearing in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, as the Presiding Officer knows. We had \ntestimony by Secretary Sherman as to the enforcement of sanctions \nagainst Iran in order to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon \nstate, which would be a game changer.\n  During the course of that hearing, it came out that as a result of \nthe government shutdown, we are not as effective as we could be. There \nis always more that can be done in working with other countries, and \nthe shutdown is affecting our full preparedness for enforcing the \nsanctions internationally against Iran.\n  One of my colleagues started to challenge the representative from the \nState Department as to why they couldn't do more. Of course, it was the \nTreasury Department's budget that was primarily affecting the attention \nto this. The Secretary assured us that we are enforcing our sanctions.\n  Senator Kaine made the observation--and the right observation--don't \nblame the administration; blame the Congress. It is the Congress that \nhas the responsibility to make sure the government is functioning with \nall cylinders. This tea party shutdown is\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\njeopardizing our national security. It is not putting us where we \nshould be as far as taking care of the needs of the people of this \ncountry.\n  I was on the floor a couple of days ago, and I quoted from the \nBaltimore Sun as to the responsibility for the shutdown, and I'm going \nto quote a little bit more from that article. It said:\n\n       It would be tempting, of course, to write that this \n     impasse--the inability to agree on the continuing resolution \n     to fund government past the end of the fiscal year--was the \n     fault of Democrats and Republicans alike. But that would be \n     like blaming the hostages for causing the perpetrator to put \n     a gun to their heads.\n       As President Obama noted, he and congressional Democrats \n     put forward no agenda other than keeping government operating \n     temporarily at the current levels.\n\n  I want to review how we got here on October 1. It was 6 months ago \nthat the Senate passed the budget. It was different than the House \nbudget. Then, we, the Democrats said: Let's go to conference. That is \nwhat we should do, negotiate a budget, so that when it comes to October \n1, we have a budget in place to fund government at the levels we agreed \nto--Democrats and Republicans. The Republicans refused to go to \nconference.\n  Fast forward to October 1. We didn't have a budget, and, therefore, \nit was necessary to pass a continuing resolution. That is what you do. \nWhen we can't pass a budget, we keep government operating at the \ncurrent levels until we can agree on a budget. So that is what we \ndecided to do, but we went further. The majority leader met with the \nSpeaker of the House, and rather than negotiating about what level we \nthought should be in the continuing resolution--what the Democrats and \nthe Republicans thought--we went along with the lower number. We \nnegotiated the continuing resolution at the lower level, and that is \nwhat we passed.\n  The Republicans in the House decided they would not go for that, and \nthey attached their changes in the health care system as a condition to \npassing a continuing resolution. Make no mistake about it; it is a tea \nparty shutdown.\n  Now the Republicans are saying to us: Why aren't we negotiating? \nWell, let me quote from this morning's editorial in the Baltimore Sun. \nI think this morning's editorial really captures where we are as far as \nnegotiations. The headline says:\n\n       There is no room to ``negotiate'' when extremists take the \n     federal government hostage--and threaten to do the same to \n     the economy.\n       How can the tea partiers in the House expect to be offered \n     anything for doing the equivalent of strapping C-4 and a \n     detonator to their chests and holding the government hostage?\n\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       Reward these tactics and you'll only see more of it in \n     Congress. And that's critically important given that the \n     stakes are about to rise. Should Republicans engage in \n     similar behavior with the debt ceiling, they risk not only \n     the health of the U.S. economy but the global economy. To \n     default on the debt--to refuse to pay bills already incurred \n     by the federal government--has the potential to pull the \n     nation back into recession and put thousands, if not \n     millions, of people out of work.\n\n  It is very clear: We have compromised, and the tea party Republicans \nhave shut down government. We can't negotiate with a gun to our head. \nIt reminds me of a football team that played a game and didn't like the \nresults, so they say: Let's just play that game all over.\n  Last Sunday the Baltimore Ravens didn't play a very good game. They \nlost. They didn't say: Let's play that game over. They are going to be \nhere this weekend playing again and trying to improve their record.\n  I heard one of my colleagues use another sports analogy. He said we \ncould do a mulligan on ObamaCare. We are the big leagues. There are no \nmulligans at the U.S. Open. There are no mulligans in golf. Let's use \nthe regular order.\n  Yes, we want to negotiate a budget for the next year, but we can't do \nit with a gun at our head and say: Open government and pay our bills.\n  Then the Republicans are saying: Well, let's do this piecemeal. Why \ndon't we just take up small provisions.\n  This is another quote from this morning's Baltimore Sun:\n\n       Even the little fixes the GOP is offering is outrageous if \n     they slow down the return of a fully-funded government. \n     Reopening parks would be great, but what about cancer \n     patients denied treatment? And for every National Institutes \n     of Health reopened, what about the funding for inspectors \n     that are making sure our food isn't tainted, or intelligence \n     officers monitoring the next al-Qaida attack, or FDA \n     scientists reviewing the next miracle drug? It's impossible \n     to even keep track of all of the hardships the shutdown has \n     created, and why do so when the solution is at hand?\n\n  This shutdown is hard on our country. My colleagues have talked about \nit. It has affected our welfare, it has put our Nation at risk, and it \nhas hurt our economy--including my own State of Maryland. Senator \nMikulski is here, and she will be speaking as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. The State of Maryland loses $15 million every \nday in our State economy.\n  We literally have over 100,000 workers who are on furlough and not \ngetting paid, and it is costing the taxpayers money. The last shutdown \nin 1995 cost $2 billion. What a waste of taxpayers' resources.\n  Let us put an end to this tea party shutdown. Let us also assure \nthose who are on furlough that they will get paid. I have introduced \nlegislation in this regard. I believe the House is going to be passing \nthat legislation. Let's make it clear that our Federal workers--who \nhave endured 3 years of pay freezes, furloughs under sequestration, and \nhave been asked to do more with less--will be made whole when this \nshutdown ends.\n  Let's put an end to the shutdown and make sure we pay our bills. \nLet's meet together to work out a budget for the coming year, as we \nshould.\n  The tragedy here is that the votes are in the House of \nRepresentatives to pass the Senate continuing resolution. If Speaker \nBoehner would just vote on the resolution we sent over, the shutdown \nwould end and we could get on with the business of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I intended to give remarks and then \npromulgate a series of unanimous consent requests. However, the \nmajority leader requested, for purposes of scheduling, that I begin \nwith the unanimous consent requests, which I am happy to do to \naccommodate his schedule. I ask that at the conclusion of these \nunanimous consent requests, I be given 20 minutes to speak to lay out \nthe reasons why I believe the majority should cede to these unanimous \nconsent requests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 72\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.J. Res. 72, making \ncontinuing appropriations for veterans' benefits for the fiscal year \n2014, which was received from the House.\n  I ask further consent that the measure be read three times and passed \nand that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the junior \nSenator from Texas has offered a unanimous consent request that we take \ncare of veterans in this shutdown of government. I would note that \nthere is no Senator or Member of Congress who does not care deeply \nabout making sure our veterans are taken care of, including this \nSenator from the State of Washington.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows and our colleagues know, I have spoken \noften of my own father who was a World War II veteran and who spent \nmost of his life in a wheelchair and received a Purple Heart. I know \nthe sacrifices our veterans make.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee previously, I fought \nto make sure every veteran had what they need, to make sure we said \nmore than just thank you but provided them what they need. So I know \nour veterans well.\n  What I also know about our veterans is that they, above everyone \nelse, are suffering. They went to serve our country and said we will \ntake care of the rest of you at our own personal sacrifice. They would \nbe the last to come before us and say, Take care of me before everyone \nelse. They would say to\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nus, Take care of our fellow man and leave no one behind.\n  So I am going to ask that the Senator modify his request and do what \nour military has always asked their fellow man to do and leave no one \nbehind. Our request will ensure that everyone who fights for our \ncountry, takes care of our country, works for our country in \nemergencies, depends on our country to make sure they have the \nopportunity every one of us has here is able to have that opportunity \nand they are not held hostage to a government shutdown, so we can get \nback to work and solve our country's problems. We need to end this tea \nparty shutdown and we can do it with the request I will ask right now.\n  I have a modification to suggest to the request of the junior Senator \nfrom Texas. I ask unanimous consent that this request be modified as \nfollows: That an amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that \nthe joint resolution, as amended, then be read a third time and passed; \nand the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate. This amendment is the text \nthat passed the Senate and it is a clean continuing resolution for the \nentire government and is something that is already over in the House \nand reportedly now has the support of the majority of the Members of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to object, I thank my friend from \nWashington State. I know she talked about leaving no man or woman \nbehind. I would note the continuing resolution the House has passed to \nfully fund the Veterans' Administration treats our veterans the same \nway the House and Senate have already treated active-duty military.\n  Just a few days ago, this body unanimously passed a bill that said \nthe men and women of the military would be paid. Unfortunately, it \nseems to be the position of the majority in this body that veterans \nshould be treated not as well as our active-duty military and, in \nparticular, that the full funding of the VA should be held hostage to \nevery other priority the Democrats in this Chamber must have.\n  I understand the Democrats in this Chamber are committed to ObamaCare \nwith all of their hearts, minds, and souls, but the veterans of this \nNation should not be held hostage to that commitment. It is likely, \ngiven the majority's refusal to negotiate, refusal to compromise, \nrefusal even to talk to find a middle ground--it is likely that this \nshutdown, instigated by the Democratic majority, will continue for some \ntime, and during that time we ought to be able to find common ground \nthat, at the very minimum, our veterans shouldn't pay the price.\n  If moments from now my friend from Washington simply does not object, \nby the end of the day the VA will be fully funded. If, as we all \nexpect, she does object--if she repeats the objection her majority \nleader and her party have made throughout the course of this week--then \nmuch of the VA will remain shut down because of that objection.\n  She has asked if we can reopen the entire Federal Government. If the \nrequest is not granted to refund every single priority in the Federal \nGovernment that the majority party wants, then the VA will remain \nwithout sufficient funds.\n  I find that highly objectionable, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object on behalf of all Americans who \nshould not be left behind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7182-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7182-S7183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3230\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the second unanimous consent request I will \npromulgate:\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 3230, making continuing appropriations during a \ngovernment shutdown to provide pay allowances to members of the Reserve \ncomponents of the Armed Forces, which was received from the House; I \nask further unanimous consent that the measure be read three times and \npassed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the junior \nSenator from Texas launched this government shutdown with a 21-hour \npresentation here on the floor of the Senate. It is clear from the \nactions of the House and his actions today that he is starting to try \nto reconcile in his mind all the damage which this government shutdown, \nwhich he inspired, is causing across the United States.\n  This particular unanimous consent request relates to National Guard \nReservists, a group which we hold in high esteem. But if the junior \nSenator from Texas is really focused on veterans and those who have \nserved our country, he should take into consideration the 560,000 \nFederal employees who are currently facing furlough or are on furlough, \nwho are veterans, a fourth of whom are disabled veterans. So what the \njunior Senator from Texas is doing is picking and choosing who he will \nallow in the lifeboat. At this moment, it is National Guard and \nReserve, while leaving 560,000 veteran Federal employees out in the \nwater thrashing for themselves. That is not the way we should manage or \ngovern this country.\n  I can understand the anxiety the Senator feels about the problems he \nhas created, but trying to solve them one piece at a time is not the \nAmerican way. I object. And I ask unanimous consent, though--before I \nobject, I ask unanimous consent that the request be modified, that an \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to, that the bill be amended, \nthen be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate. It is a clean \ncontinuing resolution for the entire government, including the National \nGuard, Reserve, VA, NIH--all of them. It is something that is already \nover in the House of Representatives and reportedly has the support of \na majority of Democrats and Republicans and could pass today.\n  I ask for that modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, no one \nwatching these proceedings should be confused. We are in a shutdown \nbecause President Obama and the majority leader of this body want a \nshutdown, because they believe it is in the partisan interests of their \nparty to have a shutdown.\n  Four times the House of Representatives has come to us, four times \nthe House of Representatives has endeavored to meet a middle ground, \nand four times the majority leader and every Democrat in this body has \nsaid, No, we will not talk, we will not compromise, we will not have a \nmiddle ground, and 100 percent of the priorities of the Democrats in \nthis body must be funded or they will insist on a shutdown.\n  I thank my friend from Illinois for making clear that the members of \nthe Reserve components of our Armed Forces, in his judgment, are not \nworthy of being paid during the shutdown that the Democrats have \nforced. I could not disagree with that judgment more strongly. Let us \nbe clear.\n  This bill that has passed the House doesn't mention ObamaCare; it has \nnothing to do with ObamaCare. It simply says the exact same thing my \nfriend from Illinois already agreed to, which is that the active-duty \nmen and women of the military would not be held hostage and would be \npaid if it so happened that the Democrats forced a shutdown.\n  Apparently, the position of the majority of this body is that we have \na double standard, that Reserve members are not treated as well as \nactive-duty members; that Reserve members will not get their paychecks.\n  Let's be clear that this bill could be on the President's desk for \nsignature today if my friend from Illinois would simply withdraw his \nobjection. Unfortunately, in a move I think reflects a level of \ncynicism not befitting of the responsibility all of us have, my friend \nis prepared to object and to say that\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nnot just veterans but Reserve members shall be held hostage in order to \nforce ObamaCare on the American people; that that is the objective. I \nguess now the Democratic Party has become the party of ObamaCare, by \nObamaCare, and for ObamaCare all of the time, and every other priority \nrecedes. So veterans are told, Your concerns do not matter unless we \ncan use you to force ObamaCare on the American people. Reserve military \nmembers are told, Your concerns do not matter unless we can use you as \na hostage to force ObamaCare on the American people. That is cynical. \nWe ought to take these individuals off the table.\n  I note my friend from Illinois spoke of the great many Federal \nemployees who have been furloughed. I would be very happy to work in a \nbipartisan manner to cooperate with my friend from Illinois to bring a \ngreat many of those Federal employees back to their vital \nresponsibilities. But, unfortunately, the position the Democratic Party \nhas taken is that not a one of them will be allowed to come back until \nthis body agrees to force ObamaCare on the American people, despite the \njobs lost, despite the people being forced into part-time work, despite \nthe skyrocketing health insurance premiums, and despite the millions of \npeople who are at risk of losing their health insurance.\n  I find that highly objectionable and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from Texas, \nsome of the language which he has used in this debate relative to \nimpugning motives of Members may have crossed the line. I am not going \nto raise it at this point, but I ask him to be careful in the future.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  For the edification of all Senators, rule XIX reads as follows:\n\n       No Senator in debate shall directly or indirectly, by any \n     forms of words, impugn to another Senator or to other \n     Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a \n     Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7183-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7183-S7184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.J. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I now promulgate my third unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 70, making continuing appropriations for \nNational Park Service operations, which was received from the House; I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that the measure be read three times and \npassed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will object, but let me say a couple of \nthings here.\n  First, in reference to the colloquy the Senator from Texas had with \nmy good friend from Washington State, he noted that the Senator from \nWashington talks about leaving no man or no woman behind. She does, \nindeed, and that is one of the reasons so many of us oppose this \npiecemeal approach. It is leaving lots of people behind.\n  The bottom line is, the junior Senator from Texas is advocating \nshutting down the government and now he comes before us and says, Well, \nwhy don't we pass the parts of the government I want to open? No one \nwould want to do that. It makes no sense: Let's shut down the \ngovernment and then I will come to the floor and be magnanimous and \noffer a few places where the government opens.\n  I note that no other colleagues are standing here on the floor with \nhim. I note that, at least according to press reports, most of the many \nconservative colleagues in this body reject this approach. And I note \nthat it makes no sense to pick a few--to shut down the government and \nthen pick a few groups to reopen.\n  Who wants to shut down the government? In my view, it is the tea \nparty. They have said it all along. They have advocated for it.\n\n  There are countless instances where even in 2010 tea party folks \nsaid: Let's shut down the government. Then it is said, after the \ngovernment is shut down, that President Obama or this side or the \nSenator from Illinois caused it, when we had a bipartisan resolution, \nwith a majority on this side? There was an opportunity. I believe the \njunior Senator from Texas urged his colleagues to vote against that \nresolution, but 25 of them did not, and that kept the government open \nin the Senate.\n  There were many--everyone on this side. The other side of the aisle \nopposes ObamaCare, but the majority did not want to use a bludgeon and \nsay: Unless you reject ObamaCare we are going to shut down the \ngovernment or, for that matter, not raise the debt ceiling.\n  We are not in an ``Alice in Wonderland'' world, where those who \nadvocate shutting down the government then accuse others of shutting \ndown the government. That is not washing with the American people, and \nit will not wash in this body with the vast majority of Members on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  So I would say to my colleague, if he wishes to have debate on what \nparts of the government should be funded and at what level, it is \nwrong, in my opinion, to say: Shut down the government and then we will \ndecide piece by piece which we open. That is ``Alice in Wonderland,'' \nin my judgment.\n  It makes much more sense to have the government open and then have \nthe debate in the proper place--a conference committee that decides \nfuture funding, in an omnibus appropriations bill--what level of \nfunding, if any, each part of the government should get.\n  So to first deprive our national parks of dollars by advocating \nshutting down the government and then accuse others who do not want to \nleave 98 percent of the government behind and the people who work there \nbehind and the American people who depend on so many other programs, \nwhether it is student loans or feeding the hungry, is wrong.\n  So I ask consent that the request be modified as follows: that an \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the joint \nresolution, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate. This amendment is the text that passed \nthe Senate and is a clean continuing resolution for the entire \ngovernment, actually leaving no man or woman behind, and is something \nthat is already over in the House and has the support reportedly of a \nmajority of the Members of the House, including Members of both \nparties.\n  Would the Senator agree to modify his request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator agree to so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank the \nSenator from New York for his heartfelt concern for the Republican \nParty. I note that the Senator from New York stated that I ``have \nadvocated shutting down the government.'' That statement, \nunfortunately, is a flatout falsehood, and I know the Senator from New \nYork would not do so knowingly, so it must have been a mistaken \nstatement. Because throughout the course of this debate I have said \nrepeatedly in every context we should not shut down the government, a \nshutdown is a mistake, and I very much hoped that the majority leader \nwould not force a shutdown on this country. We are in a shutdown \nbecause the Democrats in this body have refused to negotiate, refused \nto compromise.\n  I would note as well, I am quite grateful for the majority leader's \nadmonition this morning toward civility on the floor and the admonition \nfrom the Senator from Illinois toward rule XIX. That is an admonition \nwell heard. Indeed, it was quite striking. It has been several days \nsince I have been to the floor of the Senate, and yet I feel I have \nbeen here in absentia because so many Democrats have invoked my name as \nthe root of all evil in the world. Indeed, the same majority leader who \ngave an ode to civility just a few days ago was describing me and \nanyone who might agree that we should stop the harms of ObamaCare--\ndescribing us as ``anarchists.'' So I think the encouragement toward \ncivility is an encouragement that should be heard across the board.\n  I would note also that my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle \nhave\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\ndescribed what they claim to be as the piecemeal approach as following \nmy priorities. Several Democrats have used that language publicly. I \nmust note, I find it quite ironic because if I were to stand here and \nsay it is my priority and not the priority of the Democrats to fund \nveterans, it is my priority and not the priority of the Democrats to \nfund the National Guard, it is my priority and not the priority of the \nDemocrats to fund our national parks, it is my priority and not the \npriority of the Democrats to fund research for health care, they would, \nquite rightly, be able to rise and claim under rule XIX that I was \nimpugning their motives.\n  I cannot imagine a greater insult than to claim it is not the \npriority of Members of this body to treat fairly our veterans, and yet \nwhat I find so striking is that so many Democrats go out publicly and \nembrace that. They say: Funding the veterans is Cruz's priority, not \nours.\n  Yet I will note, even on that front, the funding proposals the House \nof Representatives has passed are not even the House's priorities--\nalthough under the Constitution they have a legitimate role laying out \ntheir priorities for funding--they are President Obama's priorities.\n  Just a few days ago, the President gave a speech to this country, a \nspeech that all of us watched closely, in which the President said if a \nshutdown occurred ``veterans who've sacrificed for their country will \nfind their support centers unstaffed.''\n  The President also said, with regard to parks, as we are discussing \nnow, and memorials: ``Tourists will find every one of America's \nnational parks and monuments, from Yosemite to the Smithsonian to the \nStatue of Liberty immediately closed.''\n  To the credit of the House of Representatives, they listened to the \nPresident's speech, they listened to President Obama's priorities, and \nthe House of Representatives acted with bipartisan cooperation. They \nsaid: Mr. President, we have heard your priorities. Let's fund them. \nLet's work together.\n  I would note my friend from Maryland a moment ago gave a speech about \nhow important it is, he thinks, that we should fund food inspectors in \nthe Department of Agriculture and also our intelligence community. I \nwould note to my friend from Maryland, I fully agree with him and, \nindeed, would be happy to work arm in arm and to fund the intelligence \ncommunity, fully fund them today. The only impediment to that happening \nis that the Democrats in this body are objecting, and that is what \nshould be abundantly clear.\n\n  When it comes to parks, when it comes to memorials, we have all read \nabout World War II veterans being turned away from the World War II \nMemorial. We have all read about Mount Vernon, which is privately \nowned--the Federal Government blocking the parking lots.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask permission to direct a question through the Chair to \nmy friend from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question from the majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my question is that I was under the \nassumption that my friend would offer the consent requests, as we do \nhere with brief responses in the competing consent requests, and then \nthe Senator would speak for 20 minutes. My only concern is this: one, \ntwo, three--I have five or six Senators over here wishing to speak. So \nmy question is this: Does the Senator wish to take 20 minutes following \nthis in addition to what time he has taken now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the majority leader for his question. At his \nrequest I began with these unanimous consent requests. It was my \nintention to give my remarks at the end. But I would note, in each of \nthe objections, my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle have \nchosen to stand and give their remarks. If remarks are to be given by \nthe Democrats, then it is certainly appropriate that some response be \ngiven. So if the courtesy the majority leader was asking was that none \nof the remarks that his friends and colleagues make have any response, \nthat was not a courtesy I was prepared to give. I was prepared and am \nprepared to work and cooperate on timing but not to allow only one side \nof the discussion to be presented.\n  Mr. REID. Further, Mr. President, I propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, and the request is: When the Senator from Texas finishes his \nconsent that he is asking--and there is one more, as I understand it--\nthen I ask permission that the next Senators to be recognized be \nSenator Mikulski for 10 minutes, the Senator from Florida--so it is not \nbad. Only a couple speakers. So we have Senator Mikulski, who will be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes. I apologize for the interruption. The \nfloor is the Senator's from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The modification----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \nrequest of the Senator from Texas by the Senator from New York?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to object, the modification that the \nSenator from New York has suggested is that he is unwilling to open our \nnational parks, to open our memorials, unless every other aspect of the \ngovernment is opened immediately and ObamaCare is forced upon the \nAmerican people. That is, quite simply and directly, saying that the \nSenate will not respond to President Obama's priorities.\n  President Obama gave a speech to this country saying we should open \nour parks, we should open our memorials. The House of Representatives \nsaid: Mr. President, we, the Republicans, will work with you to do \nthat, and today the Democrats in the Senate are objecting and saying: \nNo, we want every park closed, every memorial closed. All of that will \nbe held hostage until ObamaCare is forced on every American.\n  I find that highly objectionable, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, and I will be brief----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I just want to make this point: The junior Senator from \nTexas has said it is President Obama and the Democrats who are shutting \nthe government down. My modification, which he just objected to, would \nopen the entire government. We put it on the floor. We are all for it. \nHe objected to it. Therefore, I object to the proposal of the junior \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7184-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7184-S7192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.J. RES. 73\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the fourth unanimous consent request that I \nwould promulgate: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.J. Res. 73, making continuing \nappropriations for the National Institutes of Health for fiscal year \n2014; I ask further consent that the measure be read three times and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to my responding to my friend, I would \nuse just a few minutes of leader time--I will be very brief--with \npermission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Here is what I am going to say.\n  Mr. President, we have heard this back-and-forth stuff about \nveterans. But in addition to what the Senator from Washington said, let \nme read one paragraph from the Record of yesterday:\n\n       I would note also that I believe the resolution the Senator \n     is offering and suggested be passed provides only partial \n     funding for the VA. There is no funding here to operate the \n     national cemeteries. There is no funding for\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\n     the Board of Veterans' Appeals. There is no funding for \n     constructing VA hospitals and their clinics. There is no \n     funding, actually, to operate the IT system that the entire \n     VA needs in order to continue going forward.\n\n  I reserve the right to object to the request of my friend from Texas.\n  I object, as do most Americans. There is no reason for us to have to \nchoose between important government functions, as has been said by my \nthree colleagues so brilliantly this morning. But I guess my objection \nis best paraphrased by reading a column from the Washington Post by \nDana Milbank. Here is what he said:\n\n       House Republicans continued what might be called the \n     lifeboat strategy: deciding which government functions are \n     worth saving. In: veterans, the troops and tourist \n     attractions. Out: poor children, pregnant women and just \n     about every government function that regulates business. . . \n     . Here are some of the functions not boarding the GOP \n     lifeboats: market regulation, chemical spill investigations, \n     antitrust enforcement, worksite immigration checks, workplace \n     safety inspections, the Environmental Protection Agency . . . \n     communications and trade regulation, nutrition for 9 million \n     children and pregnant women, flu monitoring and other \n     functions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and housing rental assistance for the poor.\n\n  I spent, 1 month ago, a day at the National Institutes of Health. I \nremember so clearly one Institute I went to where this young girl, \nabout 12 years old--she had come back for her second visit. She has a \ndisease that they do not know for sure what it is. But they were trying \nto figure out what she had, and they felt they were on the cusp of \nbeing able to figure that out. Her parents, of course, were very happy.\n  We know how important it is that little children, babies, adults be \ntaken care of, especially toward the time when they have no hope. That \nis what NIH is about: hope.\n  I truly believe we should open the government, all the government. \nThis is a trip down a road that is so foolish. We need not be there. If \npeople have a problem with ObamaCare--and I know my friend, the junior \nSenator from Texas, does not care for ObamaCare--let's do it in a \ncontext that is reasonable and fair, not have all the people in America \nwho are so troubled with this----\n  I heard an interview with the Governor of Maryland this morning. They \nare losing $15 million or $20 million a day because of the government \nbeing closed in Maryland. I would ask my friend to accept a \nmodification. It is a modification that is so well-intentioned. What it \nwould do is open the government. It would take care of the National \nInstitutes of Health, it would take care of the veterans, including all \nthe stuff that is left out of the consent we have here before which I \nread into the Record a minute ago, it would take care of the national \nparks, and in Nevada we are really desperate to have those open. We \nhave one 70 minutes outside of Las Vegas where 1 million people a year \nvisit. We have one about 12 miles outside of Las Vegas where we have \n600,000 people a year visit, Lake Mead. The other is Red Rock, and \nothers. We have a Great Basin National Park. We want to open that. That \nwould solve this problem.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the consent of my friend from Texas \nbe modified, that an amendment which is at the desk be agreed to; that \nthe joint resolution, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate and is a clean \ncontinuing resolution for the entire government. It is something that \nis already over in the House and reportedly has the support of a \nmajority of Members of the House.\n  Finally, the statement I made, if that little girl came back there \nnow for her clinical trial, likely she would not be able to have any \nhelp, just as we learned earlier this week there were 200 people who \nwere turned away from clinical trials, 30 of whom were babies and \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator agree to so modify his \noriginal request?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would note \nthat the majority leader made a plea for compromise. I think most \nAmericans want to see a compromise. The House of Representatives has \nrepeatedly compromised already.\n  It is the view of every Republican in this body and, indeed, every \nRepublican in the House that ObamaCare should be entirely and \ncompletely repealed. Nonetheless, the House started with a compromise \nof saying not repealing ObamaCare but simply it should be defunded. \nThey funded the entire Federal Government and defunded ObamaCare. It \ncame to the Senate. The majority leader and 54 Democrats voted in \nlockstep to say: No, absolutely not. We will not talk. We will not \ncompromise.\n  The House then came with a second compromise. They said: Fine. If the \nSenate will not agree to fully defund ObamaCare, then let's all agree \nto a reasonable 1-year delay.\n  President Obama has already delayed ObamaCare for big business. Let's \ntreat hard-working American families at least as well as big business. \nLet's have a 1-year delay, because we are seeing how badly this thing \nhas worked. Now that is a big compromise from defunding.\n  It came over to the Senate. The majority leader and 54 Senate \nDemocrats said: No, absolutely not. We will not talk. We will not \ncompromise. Shut the government down.\n  The House came back a third time and said: Okay. How about we simply \ndelay the individual mandate, one small portion of ObamaCare, and we \nrevoke the congressional exemption that President Obama illegally gave \nMembers of this Congress to exempt us from the burdens of ObamaCare \nthat are inflicted on millions of Americans.\n  That offer represented an enormous compromise from the view of \nRepublicans that ObamaCare should be repealed in its entirety. What did \nthe Senate say? Did the Senate say: Let's sit down and work something \nout? Did the Senate say: Let's meet and find a middle ground? No. The \nmajority leader and 54 Senate Democrats said: Absolutely not. No, we \nwill not talk. We will not compromise. Shut the government down. That \nis why the government is shut down right now.\n  Just a moment ago, the majority leader gave his latest offer. It was: \nGive us everything we demand, 100 percent, no compromise, no middle \nground. That is the position of the Democrats in this body. That is not \na reasonable position. That is not the way people work together to find \na middle ground.\n  You know, it was reported that the majority leader urged the \nPresident not even to talk to congressional leaders. The President \napparently had a change of heart and sat down with congressional \nleaders and had what, by all accounts, was an extraordinary \nconversation, where President Obama told Congressional leaders: I \ncalled you over here to say I am not going to talk to you. I am not \ngoing to negotiate. I must admit, that is a remarkable conversation, to \ncall someone over to say: Hi, good to see you. We are not going to \ntalk.\n  If this matter is going to be resolved, we need to see good faith \namong Members on both sides. Republicans have repeatedly been offering \ncompromises to resolve this shutdown. Unfortunately, the behavior of \nthe majority party in this body has been my way or the highway.\n  One can only assume their stated public belief, from a senior \nadministration official from the Obama administration who said: We \nthink we are winning politically.\n  I am paraphrasing.\n  But we don't care when the shutdown ends.\n  That is a paraphrase. That is not exact. But that was certainly the \nthrust of the statement by what was described as a senior \nadministration official. I think that is cynical. I think that is \npartisan. I do not think that is what we should be doing. So I wish the \nmajority leader and the Democrats would accede to what should be shared \nbipartisan priorities. But it appears right now that they are not, that \ntheir position is: Give us everything. Fully fund ObamaCare and force \nit on the American people. That I cannot consent to. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, still reserving my right to object, my \nfriend from Texas--and I have developed a relationship with him--talks \nabout a meeting\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\nthat he did not attend. I was there. I was one of five people, the \nPresident, Speaker Boehner, Leader McConnell, Leader Pelosi, and me--\nthe Vice President was also there. I am sorry.\n  I attended that meeting. The President did not say: Come on in, I am \nnot going to talk to you, I have nothing to say, words to that effect. \nThe meeting lasted an hour and 20 minutes. There were a lot of things \nsaid. But one thing that was not said is this ``Alice in Wonderland'' \nwhat took place in that meeting, when someone talks about the meeting \nwho was not there.\n  Let's talk about compromise. My friend brought up compromise. We have \nbefore us a continuing resolution. My friend, the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives, John Boehner, called me and said: We have got to \nwork this out. We have got to get this done quickly.\n  I thought: So how are we going to get it done? This was on September \n9 after our recess ended. He said: We have got to have the 988 number \nfor this year.\n  I said: I cannot do that. I cannot do that. Chairman Murray's number \nis $70 billion above that that we passed here in the Senate. We passed \nthat. I cannot agree to 988.\n  He said: You have got to do it. I do not want to be fighting. I want \nto get this done.\n  So I talked to Chairman Murray, Chairman Mikulski, and others. Even \nthough it was desperately hard to do--because we do not like the number \n988, we do not like it. It is not our number--we agreed to do it. That \nwas a compromise. I have been in Congress 31 years. That is the biggest \ncompromise I have ever made. My caucus did not like it, but we did it \nin an effort to have a clean CR.\n  You talk about compromise, that was big time. But, Speaker Boehner, I \nam sure, was well intentioned. He could not get it done. He could not \nget it done. It was his idea how to get it done.\n  Then, talking about further compromise, one of the last things we had \nwalked over from the House is: Go to conference. So I thought: I have \nsomething. It is an offer so good that he cannot refuse. What did I do? \nWith the cooperation of all 53 Democratic Senators, here is what we \nagreed to do: Open the government. What we will do is go to conference. \nNot on little select areas. We will go to conference on a list of \neverything. I listed everything--not everything, but everything I could \nthink of. We listed agriculture, we listed discretionary spending and, \nyes, we listed health care.\n  I gave the letter to the Speaker. I talked to him 45 minutes later. \nHe said: I can't do it.\n  Wow.\n  I know what legislation is all about. It is the art of compromise. I \nunderstand that. We have compromised in big-time fashion. The problem \nis that the Speaker and some other Republican Members of Congress are \nin a real bind because the only thing they want to talk about is the \nlaw that passed 4 years ago, which the Supreme Court declared \nconstitutional. This is a little unusual, I would think, in my \nexperience here.\n  So we are where we are because we not only have the government \nshutdown, but we have the full faith and credit of our Nation before us \nin a week or 10 days.\n  I suggest, I do not want anyone to say I have not compromised. All \none needs to do is talk to any Member of my caucus and they will talk \nabout how difficult it has been for us to accept that number, and agree \nto go to conference on anything.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend would yield, following his statement of 20 \nminutes, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nrecognized: Mikulski already has 15 minutes; Murray, I ask unanimous \nconsent that she follow Mikulski for 10 minutes; Heinrich, 10 minutes; \nSchumer, 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are those the next Senators in order or on the \nDemocratic side?\n  Mr. REID. If some Republicans want to come and talk, my friends, I \nwould be happy to yield to any of them. But we have not had a large \nnumber of people over here this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, Bismarck famously talked about legislation \nbeing like making sausages. There are aspects of both that are not \npretty. I wish we saw our elected leaders in both parties working \ntogether to listen to the American people.\n  You know, the majority leader talks about a meeting at the White \nHouse. I will note, he noted that I was not at that meeting. That is \ncertainly true. But the statement that the President said he would not \nnegotiate came directly from Speaker Boehner who was at that meeting, \nwho came and gave a press conference immediately thereafter.\n  I know the majority leader is not impugning the integrity of the \nSpeaker of the House or disputing that that is exactly what President \nObama said and what the position of the Democrats is. Their position \nis: Give us 100 percent of what we want or the government stays shut \ndown. That, quite simply, is not reasonable.\n  I would like to address for a moment a few of the arguments that have \nbeen raised against these very reasonable bipartisan proposals to fund \nessential priorities in our government because I think the arguments do \nnot withstand scrutiny. There are some on the Democratic side of the \naisle who have said: We are not going to pick and choose. Indeed, the \nmajority leader said: There is no reason to have to choose between \ngovernment priorities.\n  Let me suggest that is the essence of legislation. We have a $17 \ntrillion debt, because far too many people have said, as the majority \nleader just did, there is no reason to choose between priorities; we \nshould spend on everything.\n  I would note also that what the Democrats in this Chamber deride as a \npiecemeal strategy is the traditional means of appropriating and \nlegislating. The only reason we have this omnibus continuing resolution \nis because Congress has failed to do its job to appropriate on specific \nsubject matters.\n  So we should be considering the VA on its own merits. I would note, \nthe majority leader is right, that the House bill funded the most \ncritical components of the VA: pension, home loan, GI bill, and \ndisability payments. But I would readily accede to the majority leader \nthat if he would like a continuing resolution that funds the entirety \nof the VA, including the elements he laid out, I think we could reach a \nunanimous consent agreement on that within hours.\n  The traditional means of legislating is one subject at a time. It is \nnot typical when considering funding for the VA that the argument be \nabout unrelated matters, whether it is the Department of Agriculture or \nObamaCare. The way this body has always operated is it has considered \none subject matter at a time--except when Congress has failed to \nappropriate, and then everything has gotten lumped together in a giant \nomnibus bill. But there is no reason for that.\n  Secondly, every bit as critically, we have done it already. This is \nnot theoretical. At the beginning of this proceeding the House of \nRepresentatives unanimously passed a bill saying: Let's fund the men \nand women of our military. When it came over, a great many people \nexpected the majority leader to do what the majority leader just did--\nto object to funding the men and women of our military. Indeed, some 20 \nRepublican Senators came to the floor prepared to make the argument \nthat we shouldn't hold the men and women of the military hostage. Yet, \nmuch to our very pleasant surprise, the majority leader reconsidered. \nHe decided, one must assume, that it was not defensible to hold hostage \nthe paychecks of the men and women of the military. The majority leader \nagreed, and this body unanimously passed funding for the men and women \nof the military. He said: Regardless of what happens with a government \nshutdown, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines should not be held \nhostage. They should get their paychecks.\n  Indeed, I rose on the Senate floor. I commended the majority leader \nfor doing the right thing and for acting in a bipartisan manner. Yet, \nsadly, that was the last of that behavior we were to see. I hope that \nmajority leader returns. I hope the majority leader who said we are \ngoing to fund the men and women of our military returns to say the same \nthing to our veterans. I hope that majority leader returns to say the \nsame thing to our National Guard. I\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nhope that majority leader returns to say the same thing to our parks \nand war memorials. I hope that majority leader returns to say the same \nthing to the National Institutes of Health and to say the same thing to \nchildren who are facing life-threatening diseases such as cancer.\n  We may not be able to resolve 100 percent of this impasse today; \nthere are differences. To resolve those differences will take sitting \ndown, talking, and working through the matters of this disagreement. \nOne side of this Chamber is prepared to do this. The Democrats are not. \nIn the meantime, it ought to be a bipartisan priority to fund our \nveterans.\n  A second possible objection--I can see some watching this debate who \nthink, well, OK, but if you fund the VA, doesn't that mean the \nDemocrats have given in on ObamaCare? Somehow it has to be connected to \nObamaCare, right?\n  As every Member of this body knows, the VA is totally disconnected. \nThe VA bill that passed the House doesn't implicate ObamaCare, doesn't \nmention ObamaCare, and does nothing on ObamaCare. We have a \ndisagreement on ObamaCare. Part of this body thinks it is a terrific \nbill. Part of this body thinks it is a train wreck, a disaster that is \nhurting millions of Americans. That is an important debate. Whether our \nveterans get their disability payments shouldn't be held hostage to \nresolving that debate. It is exactly like the bill my friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle already voted for to fund the men and \nwomen of the military. It is exactly the same. They have done it once, \nand yet, for whatever reason, they have made a decision that certainly \nappears to the public to be cynical and partisan.\n  There should be no confusion. The House of Representatives has \noverwhelmingly voted to protect our veterans and fund the VA, and 35 \nDemocrats joined Republicans in the House to do that--35. It was \nbipartisan legislation. It came over here. Every Senate Republican \nagrees we should fund the VA, we should pass this bill. There is \nunanimity. Indeed, the President, when he addressed the Nation, said \nhis priority was to fund the VA. We have Republicans and Democrats in \nthe House agreeing we should fund the VA. We have Republicans in the \nSenate and a Democratic President of the United States agreeing we \nshould fund the VA. Sadly, we have Democrats in the Senate and a \nmajority leader in the Senate objecting and stopping the VA from being \nfunded.\n  If my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle simply stood right \nnow and withdrew their objection, by the end of the day the VA would \nreceive its funding. If my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle \nsimply stood and withdrew their objection, by the end of the day our \nfriends in the Reserves would receive their paychecks or have the \npaychecks and the funding returned. If my friends on the Democratic \nside of the aisle withdrew their objection, by the end of the day our \nnational parks and memorials would have their funding and we would be \nable to open our Statue of Liberty and open our war memorials. By the \nend of the day we could restore the funding to the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  Let me note that there are many other priorities. My friend from \nMaryland, when he was talking about other priorities, said there are a \ngreat many aspects of government. For example, earlier this week the \nDirector of National Intelligence and the head of the NSA testified \nbefore the Senate Intelligence Committee. The head of national \nintelligence said that some 70 percent of civilian employees in the \nintelligence community have been furloughed and that represents a real \nthreat to our national security. If that is right, where is the \nCommander in Chief? Why is the President of the United States not \nsaying: Regardless of what you do in the rest of the budget, don't \nexpose us to national security threats. Let's fully fund the Department \nof Defense. Let's fully fund our intelligence agencies.\n  Indeed, I would note that one Senator, the junior Senator from \nArizona, asked the head of national intelligence: Have you advised the \nPresident that Congress should pass a continuing resolution funding the \nintelligence community as we did for the members of the Armed Forces?\n  The answer from the head of national intelligence, appointed by \nPresident Obama, was this: Yes, Congress should do it, and, yes, I will \nadvise the President.\n  Now we have Senate Democrats who are not listening to the testimony \nand advice of the members of our intelligence community who say there \nis a grave national security threat against which we are not adequately \nprepared to defend ourselves. Surely partisan politics should end. \nSurely at that point we should be able to come together and say: We can \nkeep fighting on ObamaCare. We may have disagreements, and eventually \nwe will work it out, but surely we shouldn't expose our national \nsecurity to threats from terrorists or attacks on our homeland in the \nmeantime. That ought to be 100-to-0.\n\n  At the end of the day, there is only one explanation that makes sense \nfor why you saw one Democrat after another standing up and objecting: \nNo, don't fund the VA. No, don't fund the Reserve members of our \nmilitary. No, don't fund the parks. No, don't fund the memorials. No, \ndon't fund the National Institutes of Health.\n  The only explanation that is at all plausible is that many Members of \nthis body agree with some of the pundits that this shutdown benefits \nthe political fortunes of Democrats. I hope people are focused on \nthings other than political fortunes and partisan politics because I \nknow each one of us takes seriously the obligation we have to our \nconstituents back home. I hope that is not going on, but it is hard for \nthe American people not to be cynical when they read about Mount \nVernon--which is privately owned and operated and doesn't get its money \nfrom the Federal Government--being effectively forced to shut down \nbecause the Federal Government blocked the parking lots and put up \nbarricades to prevent people from going to Mount Vernon. It is hard not \nto be cynical when we read about what my friend Senator John Thune told \nme about Mount Rushmore. The Federal Government erected barricades on \nthe roads leading to Mount Rushmore--spent the money to do it, mind \nyou. There is a shutdown. They spent the money to erect the barricades. \nThe problem is that those aren't Federal roads, those are State roads. \nThe Governor said: Take them down. The only conclusion that is possible \nthere is that we are seeing cynical, partisan, gamesmanship--a decision \nby President Obama and, unfortunately, by Democrats in this body that \ninflicting maximum pain on the American people will yield political \nbenefits.\n  We ought to be able to agree that our veterans are above politics. We \nought to be able to agree that our war memorials are above politics. We \nought to be able to come together and agree that defending national \nsecurity and defending against terrorist threats is above politics. \nEveryone in Congress is prepared to do so except for the majority \nleader and the Senate Democrats who are insisting that everything be \nshut down.\n  If a Federal Government worker is at home today furloughed, you \nshould know that the reason is in large part because the Senate \nDemocrats refused to let you come back to work, because we could agree, \nfor significant portions of the Federal Government, to come back to \nwork Monday morning if, simply, the Democrats would stop objecting and \nstop insisting that they get everything on ObamaCare.\n  Let me note that the issue on ObamaCare is very simple. Is there a \ndouble standard? President Obama has exempted Big Business and has \nexempted Members of Congress. Yet he has forced a government shutdown \nto deny that savings exemption to hard-working Americans, millions of \nhard-working Americans who are losing their jobs, being forced into \npart-time work, facing skyrocketing health insurance premiums, and \nlosing their health insurance.\n  Let me remind this body of the words of James Hoffa, president of the \nTeamsters: ObamaCare is destroying the health care--he used the words \n``destroying the health care of millions of working men and women in \nthis country.'' If you don't believe me, perhaps James Hoffa--who put \nit in writing that it is destroying the health care of millions of men \nand women--will underscore what this fight is about. All of the \nseniors, all of the people with disabilities, all of the people who are \nnow\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\ngetting notices that they are losing their health insurance--that is \nwhat this fight is about.\n  At a minimum, we ought to agree on common priorities. We ought to \ncome together today, right now, and fund the VA. We ought to come \ntogether today, right now, and fund our reservists in the National \nGuard. We ought to come together today, right now, and fund our \nnational parks, open our memorials, and stop barricading and sending \npolice officers to prevent World War II veterans from visiting to the \nWorld War II Memorial. We ought to come together, right now, to fund \nthe National Institutes of Health because everyone agrees on that.\n  The decision to hold those priorities hostage because the Democrats \nwant to force ObamaCare on everyone--it is not related to them, has \nnothing to do with them, and it is all about political leverage. That \nis not the way we should be doing our jobs. We should be listening to \nthe people, and we should make DC listen.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin be the next \nDemocratic speaker following Senator Schumer's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before I go into my commends, I want to express my \nthanks to the Capitol Police, to the Secret Service, and to all who \nresponded to yesterday's pretty scary and dramatic incident. I also \nwant to express my hope that the injured Capitol Police officer quickly \nand fully recovers, and to the little girl who has now been left \nwithout her mother--I hope that as this great tragedy unfolds, we give \nsupport to the people who have suffered.\n  My colleague from Texas has laid out a vision of how he would like to \nsee the day end. He would like to see the day end with funding for VA, \nNIH, and with the Park Service open, and I think there was one more \nitem, but I will stick with those three--NIH, FDA and VA. He would like \nto see them open for business at the end of the day.\n  I have a different vision for the end of the day. At the end of the \nday today, I would like to see the House of Representatives consider \nand vote on the Senate-passed continuing funding resolution that would \nreopen the entire Federal Government and keep it open--not for a long \nterm because we have fiscal issues through November 15--at fiscal year \n2013 levels. At the end of the day, if they took up the Senate-passed \nresolution and actually voted on it, the Federal Government would be \nopen.\n  At the end of the day, people would actually be back on the job, \ngetting paid for the job they signed up to do, and we would have the \nGovernment of the United States of America working the way it should.\n  At the end of the day, it means the Capitol Hill police officers who \nwere at their duty stations would get their pay. Now they are working \nwithout pay.\n  Under my vision of America, if we open the entire U.S. Government, it \nmeans FBI agents who are currently working and doing their job \nprotecting America would be paid. Right now, FBI agents and other \nFederal law enforcement are working for IOUs. Those very FBI agents we \ncount on are using their own money to put gas in the cars they need to \nuse to go after the bad guys or the bad girls. So under the Mikulski \nrecommendation that was passed by the Senate, at the end of the day, \nFBI agents would be paid and they wouldn't have to use their own money \nto put gas in their cars. That is what my vision of the end of the day \nis. We have to reopen government.\n  The cynical strategy of the other side, given with ruffles and \nflourishes and pomp--self-righteously standing up for our veterans, \nopening our national parks, and funding NIH--really is hollow. It would \nbe great if they actually understood how government works.\n  Let's take the VA disability claim process. In order to get your \ndisability benefits, your eligibility is determined not only by the VA \nbut with information you get from the civilian workforce at DOD, from \nthe Social Security Administration headquartered in Woodlawn, MD--where \n9,000 Federal employees are furloughed--or you would get it from the \nInternal Revenue Service--also headquartered in Maryland, where 5,000 \nFederal employees are furloughed. So if we reopened the government, at \nthe end of the day, yes, veterans would get their benefits, but they \nwill get them because not only is the VA open but so is Social \nSecurity, and the civilian workforce will be working at DOD and the \npeople who work at the Internal Revenue Service will be there making \nsure all the paperwork is done in the way it should be. That is what \nthe end of the day should look like.\n  My colleague from Texas talks about how he would like to reopen NIH. \nOh, boy, so would I. Seventy-one percent of the people at NIH right \nthis minute are furloughed. He wants to, at the end of the day, open \nNIH. So do I. But I also know that after they do their research and \nthey have engaged in all of that, our private sector comes in and \nbegins to develop the products, and they need to take those great \nideas--the great ideas that turn into the new products that will save \nlives and create jobs in the United States--to the FDA, the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  So at the end of the day, we want to help NIH stay open, to find the \ncures for the diseases we want them to find, but we also want the \nprivate sector inventing the products to be able to take those great \nideas and turn them into what can save lives here and to be able to \nsell them around the world because they have been certified as safe and \neffective. So at the end of the day, I would like to open the FDA.\n  But I don't want to do it one agency at a time. I want to reopen the \nentire Federal Government. It seems that whenever we now shame them \nwith regard to the reality of the closing of a particular agency, they \nthen decide that agency is important and the House then passes a bill. \nI don't want shame, I don't want blame, and I don't want political \ngames. I want the Government of the United States of America to be \nopen.\n  Now let's go to another agency. They haven't even talked about some \nof these other agencies. Let's take the weather service. Right now \nstorm clouds are gathering not only here in Washington, DC, over \npolitics, but they are gathering in the Southeast. A hurricane is on \nits way. The weather service is also in Maryland. Eight hundred people \nare supposed to be on their job.\n  I was there during another hurricane, just a few months ago. Last \nOctober, I was there while they were at their duty station for \nHurricane Sandy. We watched this hurricane come. It was devastating. We \nall recall how devastating it was. In my own State, my mountain \ncounties were hit by a blizzard, and down over on the eastern shore, \nthey were hit by the hurricane, wiping out whole communities and \nneighborhoods, some people owning family homes and farms that go back \ngenerations.\n  Those very weather service people are furloughed. They are absolutely \nfurloughed. The weather service is calling them back, but they are \ngoing to be working without pay.\n  Let me put a human face on what I am talking about. Yesterday I spoke \nto Amy Fritz. She works at the weather service. She has two master's \ndegrees, one in meteorology and the other as a physical oceanographer. \nHer job is to predict storm surges coming from the hurricane. Her work \nhelps to predict how walls of water will come ashore and knowing where \nthat is going to happen, what is going to happen, and how we can begin \nto protect ourselves so that while we try to save property we can \ndefinitely provide protection for lives.\n  Amy is the primary breadwinner in her family. She is now not getting \npaid. She has $130,000 in student loans so she could get that great \neducation. And she wanted that great education because she thought: I \ncan serve America. I can be a good scientist and a great American. \nWell, at the end of the day, I want the weather service open. At the \nend of the day, I want Amy getting paid.\n  At the end of the day, I want the entire Federal Government open, not \njust whatever agency emerges as part of their strategy. Every part of \nthe Federal Government somewhere is playing an essential part in the \nlives of people in this country and to the communities which they \nserve.\n  Last night there was something called the ``Sammie'' Awards. These \nare awards given to Federal employees\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\nbecause of their outstanding service. They have either saved lives or \nthey have saved money. Well, let me tell you, there was one Federal \nemployee at the National Institutes of Standards. He has a new way of \nbeing able to protect us against fires. Another Federal employee, who \nhas also been furloughed, has come up with how to save $1 billion. \nEmployee after employee.\n  I say to all the Federal employees who might be watching: At the end \nof the day, I think you are important. At the end of the day, whatever \njob you do, I want you to do it well. I want you to strive for \ncompetence and excellence. But I want to do my job well. I extend my \nhand to the other side of the aisle, as I have done repeatedly during \nthe year I have chaired this Committee on Appropriations. I have \nnegotiated, I have compromised, and I will continue to do the same, \nbecause at the end of the day I want the Federal Government open doing \nthe job those people were trained to do and that we hired them to do. I \nwant the Federal employees to be able to be at their job, doing the \nduty they signed up for. Every job has an important mission, whether \nyou are a meat inspector, a poultry inspector, or you work at the \nweather service.\n  So we can continue to do this, where they send over to us one program \nat a time. My gosh. Once again, we are wasting time. And where is \nour standing in the world? At the end of the day, I want us to be \nrespected. I want us to be respected. What do they think about us \naround the world? In hearing after hearing, there is a lot of hand-\nwringing and chest-pounding over what we need to do about China, but \nChina isn't doing this to us. We are doing it to ourselves. There is no \nforeign predator attacking our Federal Government, we are just \ndefunding it. That is what a shutdown is. We are not funding the \nFederal Government.\n\n  This is not the way the United States of America should be operating. \nI know the calls I am getting from the over 100,000 Federal employees I \nrepresent, and they want to be on their job. It is not only they want \nto get paid, they actually want to work. And you know, they are \nprohibited from taking anything home where they could be working. This \nis terrible.\n  So at the end of the day, let us find a new way. At the end of the \nday, let us find a new way to keep the government open. At the end of \nthe day, let us be proud of ourselves and let the Federal Government be \nreopened.\n  I once again conclude my remarks by saying to the House of \nRepresentatives: Please, take up the Senate's continuing funding \nresolution that would reopen the Federal Government right away and get \nus at the desk so that we could negotiate further fiscal compromises. \nThat is the way I would like to see the day end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nvery emotional response and her great statement. I hope all of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol \nlisten to what she just said to us. She represents a State that is \nprobably impacted as much, if not more, than any other State because of \nthe number of Federal employees who work at FDA and NIH and our other \nFederal agencies. But she did not come to the floor and say: Open all \nof the jobs in my State and make sure my State is taken care of. She \ncame to say: Open the Federal Government so every American in every \nState in every part of our country is taken care of.\n  And she is right. I share her vision for the end of the day, not that \nwe take a few here and a few there--whatever one individual decides is \nimportant here today--but that our entire country gets back to work. \nAnd I really share her vision that Speaker Boehner simply take up the \nbill that is at his desk. Allow it to pass. It has the votes. And at \nthe end of the day, we can be proud our country is back to work. So I \nthank the Senator from Maryland for her very well-stated remarks.\n  I wanted to speak today about what is going on. Representative Marlin \nStutzman said something that I think sums up the House Republican \nposition perfectly. He said yesterday: We're not going to be \ndisrespected. We have to get something out of this, and I don't know \nwhat that even is.\n  We have to get something out of this--the Republicans in the House. I \nthink that statement makes it very clear. First of all, House \nRepublicans have exactly one set of interests in their mind: Their own. \nAnd secondly, they couldn't be more removed from the impacts of the \nshutdown being felt across the country. Every day Speaker Boehner \nrefuses to reopen the government is another day of inconvenience and \nstress and uncertainty for families and communities we all serve. And \nbecause House Republicans clearly aren't getting the message yet, today \nI want to describe some of what my constituents in Washington State--\nover 2,000 miles away from here--are saying about the effects of a \nshutdown.\n  The families I talk to in Washington State aren't interested in the \npartisan, political strategizing that goes on in Washington, DC. They \nhave a lot more important issues on their minds right now. Every day \nthey are reading about how the government shutdown is affecting their \ncommunity. Many are feeling the impacts themselves.\n  There are about 50,000 Federal employees in Washington State. \nThousands are being sent home without pay. The shutdown is going to put \na serious burden on many of these workers' families, but the \nconsequences reach even further. This week, the Seattle Times spoke to \na deli owner, whose job happens to be in downtown Seattle. She gets \nabout 30 percent of her sales from Federal workers in the building that \nis across the street from her.\n  Without their business now, they are all home. And without knowing \nhow long this shutdown is going to last, she is concerned about how she \nis going to pay her rent and pay her employees. She says, ``I don't \nthink [Congress] is thinking of people like us.'' Well, it is hard to \ndisagree with that. The shutdown is affecting so many. In fact, it is \naffecting other crucial parts of my home State of Washington. Our \nnational parks are closed--campers and hikers have been asked to leave. \nAnd if the government doesn't open soon, participants in the Bering Sea \nking crab fishery--about which my colleague from Alaska spoke earlier \nthis morning when I was on the floor--many of them are based in \nWashington State, and they are going to face significant economic \nlosses. Why? Because NOAA employees are needed to process and issue \ntheir quotas. They have all been furloughed. There is no one to do the \nwork they need to do their job.\n  I spoke to some of my constituents in the Washington State \nconstruction industry. They told me their business is slow because of \nall of the uncertainty about where our economy is going because of the \nshutdown and because of the looming guidelines. And there is so much \nmore.\n  While our active duty military will continue to get paid, some of \nthose who have heroically served our country are being affected. \nFurloughs in Washington State and across our country have forced our \nveterans to stay home and lose pay. As the shutdown continues, veterans \nare watching, and they are waiting, because if this government doesn't \nopen soon, VA benefits--which many of our veterans rely on just to make \nends meet--and support from the GI bill is going to stop.\n  Our veterans should not under any circumstances be burdened by \npartisan games. But unfortunately, the longer this shutdown goes on, \nthe more they are having to sacrifice. And this shutdown is affecting \nthe dedicated civilian employees who support our military. We have as \nmany as 8,000 civilian employees at Joint Base Lewis-McChord who have \nbeen impacted. Some are going to work without pay and some have been \nsent home without pay, without any sense or idea of when they are going \nto be able to return. And, by the way, many of those workers are \nveterans--and many have already been victims of the gridlock and \nbrinkmanship here in our Nation's capital.\n  A Washington State news station spoke with Joint Base Lewis-McChord \nemployee Matthew Hines earlier this week, and he said his family \nalready lost $1,300 because of the sequestration furloughs this summer. \nThey are struggling to pay their bills and had to refinance their \nmortgage. This week, Matthew and his family were left wondering whether \nthey would face more lost pay and more uncertainty.\n  The shutdown is creating uncertainty for struggling families as well \nthose who depend on nutrition assistance programs. The Spokesman-Review\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nin Spokane, WA, talked with Rosa Chavira, the mother of an 11-month-old \ngirl. Rosa gets support--because she needs it right now--from the \nWomen, Infants, and Children Program, WIC. It helps her to put food on \nthe table. We are now hearing that the Washington State Department of \nHealth is estimating that WIC funds would be threatened as early as \nnext month if this continues. So next month, just a few weeks away, if \nwe are still in a shutdown, Rosa might take her vouchers to the grocery \nstore and be unable to buy any food for her family. As Rosa told the \nSpokesman-Review, that is a scary situation.\n  What I just talked about are a few of the examples we are seeing in \nmy home State of Washington, but I know that families and communities \nacross this country could tell a lot of similar stories. This is beyond \nfrustrating for me. It is beyond frustrating for my fellow Democrats \nand many Republicans--including, by the way, at least 20 in the House \nof Representatives, so far, who see absolutely no reason why this \nshutdown has to continue. We may not agree on much, but there does seem \nto be bipartisan agreement that the shutdown has to end. And once it \ndoes, we should begin the negotiations that many of us, including \nmyself, have been calling for on the floor since March and work toward \na bipartisan agreement that ends the brinkmanship, ends the \nmanufactured crises that are so harmful to our workers and to the \neconomy.\n  I know Speaker Boehner and the tea party aren't on the same page as \nthe rest of us about that yet. But as we continue to hear from \nthousands of Americans--from fishermen to small business owners to \nstruggling moms--who are being hurt as this shutdown occurs, I hope \nthey will at least stop standing in the way of those of us who are \nready to get to work.\n  I will close by quoting Kirsten Watts from Tacoma, WA. She works with \nthe Bonneville Power Administration in Seattle, and she told the \nSeattle Times:\n\n       It's just sad that the government is playing games with \n     people's livelihoods.\n\n  Kirsten said that workers at her agency would still be coming in, but \nshe is worried about the others who will not be. She was thinking about \nhow this shutdown will impact others.\n  I think Speaker Boehner and the tea party--who, according to \nRepresentative Stutzman, are laser-focused on what is in it for them--\ncould learn a lot from that approach.\n  So I say today to Speaker Boehner: Open the government. Let everybody \ngo back to work. Stop hurting our economy.\n  All that it requires is bringing the Senate-passed continuing \nresolution up for a vote on the House floor so that the Democrats and \nRepublicans who want the government to reopen can pass it. Once the \ngovernment is open, we would be more than happy to sit down and work \nout our longer-term budget agreement. But we are not going to do it \nwith our families, workers, and small businesses being held hostage.\n  This is not the time to talk about opening the government. It is time \nto actually do it. The entire country is watching and wondering how we \ngot to this point. Let's do the right thing and show them we can work \ntogether and fulfill the basic responsibilities we were elected to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, like many other Members who spoke on the \nfloor today, I too want to acknowledge the extraordinary work that is \ndone by the Capitol Police officers.\n  Every single day they work around here protecting the people who work \nand visit here. Yesterday was another great example of the skill, the \nprofessionalism, and the courage that they display on a daily basis in \na very quiet and humble way, and I wish to express--on my own behalf \nand for the people that I represent--our appreciation for their \nextraordinary work and the remarkable way in which they go about their \njobs and express how very grateful we all are for that.\n  I wish to talk about what is happening here in Washington, DC. \nUnfortunately, we find ourselves on the 4th day of what is a completely \navoidable partial government shutdown. It is not like we didn't see \nthis coming. The fiscal year ends every year on September 30. So it \nwasn't a deadline that we didn't know was coming. In fact, as I pointed \nout before, the House of Representatives completed work on four \nappropriation bills. Unfortunately, here in the Senate we didn't move \nappropriation bills across the floor to comply with the Budget Control \nAct. We didn't pass a single one this fiscal year.\n  Then recognizing the need to act at the end of the fiscal year as it \napproached, the House passed and sent to the Senate a continuing \nresolution on September 20--2 weeks ago. Instead of acting quickly to \nbring us to a resolution to keep the government funded, Senate \nleadership continued to stall, unwilling to negotiate.\n  The House has now sent us four comprehensive proposals to fund the \ngovernment and to provide fairness under the law when it comes to \nObamaCare. One of these proposals included a request for a conference \ncommittee so we could get to work resolving our differences. It was a \nvery straightforward request. The other proposals that had been sent \nover here--which had other elements in them dealing with ObamaCare, as \nwell as government funding--were rejected by the Senate. They were \ntabled here. So this was a proposal that was very simple and \nstraightforward. All it asked was, let's have a conference. Let's sit \ndown and try to work out our differences.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic majority here in the Senate insisted \nthat they will not negotiate. They tabled the motion--the request to go \nto conference with the House of Representatives.\n  So far this week the House of Representatives has sent us five bills \nto fund various parts of our government. I understand they are \ncontinuing to work on additional bills today. These are bills that \nwould ensure that our veterans get paid and that children can continue \nto have access to life-saving treatments.\n  Yesterday morning my Republican colleagues and I came to the floor \nand requested that several of these commonsense bills that the House \nhas sent to us be agreed to by unanimous consent here in the Senate.\n  Specifically, I asked for a unanimous consent agreement for the Pay \nOur Guard and Reserve Act. This bill would ensure that the men and \nwomen who proudly serve in our National Guard and Reserve--those who \nhave bravely answered the call to protect and defend our country--\ncontinue to train and to get paid for their service. Congress should \nsend a clear message to these men and women who stand ready to serve in \noverseas conflicts or to respond to domestic disasters, that they will \nnot be impacted by the spending disagreements here in Washington. \nUnfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle objected to \nthese requests and, unbelievably, the President of the United States \nhas actually threatened to veto those very measures.\n  Congress has already passed by unanimous consent a bill to ensure \nthat active duty military personnel are paid during this lapse in \ngovernment funding. It is unclear to me why Senate Democrats wouldn't \npass similar measures to fund these important services. After all, \ntaking care of active duty military personnel is something that \neverybody agreed to here by unanimous consent. That rarely happens \naround here in the Senate. But Democrats and Republicans agreed that \nthis is a priority. We have to make sure the active men and women in \nour military who defend this country on a daily basis get paid despite \nthe dysfunction here in Washington, DC. All the bill I offered \nyesterday simply would have done is to apply that same treatment to our \nGuard and Reserve.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we have about 4,300 members of the Army \nand Air National Guard--a couple hundred of which are deployed right \nnow, and the remainder have training functions that they perform on a \nregular basis. If we don't get this issue resolved, they are not going \nto be able to meet those training requirements. As we all know, they \nrespond to domestic disasters, to emergencies that require their \nassistance here at home, as well as on a regular basis are now being \ndeployed to meet the military requirements that we have in many of the\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\nconflicts in which we are involved around the world.\n  So it strikes me as very strange that Democrats would refuse to act \nor engage in a meaningful debate in order to find common ground on \nissues like this and to get our government back up and running.\n  I think the people I represent in the State of South Dakota, like a \nlot of other people across the country, expect their leaders to work \ntogether to resolve their differences. The position of the Democratic \nleadership is that they will not negotiate and simply work together. \nThat is not a position I believe is reasonable. We have heard it from \nthe President; we have heard it from the Democratic leaders here in the \nSenate: We are not going to negotiate.\n  I think most Americans believe they sent us here to Washington, DC, \nto work together, realizing there are differences--legitimate \ndifferences--about how to solve problems and how to approach issues. \nBut they believe, on a very basic level, that the responsibility we \nhave as their elected officials is to sit down and to try to figure out \nhow to solve these problems.\n  To say that we will not negotiate as a starting position is a \ncompletely unreasonable position to take, in the eyes, I believe, of \nthe American people.\n  The dysfunction and the gridlock that we have here in Washington, DC, \nis simply unacceptable.\n  On Wednesday, the President invited congressional leaders to the \nWhite House for what, unfortunately, turned out to be yet another photo \nopportunity, a publicity stunt. The President waited until after the \n11th hour, 2 days into a partial government shutdown, to even engage in \na face-to-face way with congressional leaders. It strikes me that when \nyou invite people to the table and in the same breath make explicit \nthat you are not willing to negotiate, that very little work is going \nto get done for the American people.\n  I hope we would see better from our President and better from our \nleaders in the Senate. It seems like the Democrats are very content to \ntake their ball and go home. Four days into a partial government \nshutdown, they still refuse to negotiate.\n  We haven't experienced a government shutdown for nearly 20 years. I \npose to my friends on the other side of the aisle that the willingness \nof leaders in both parties to negotiate in good faith during previous \nnegotiations is something from which we could take a lesson.\n  Going back to 1995 and 1996, former Speaker of the House Newt \nGingrich, when he was talking about the shutdowns in that period, said:\n\n       Bill Clinton and I would talk, if not every day . . . we \n     would talk five days a week before the shutdown, after the \n     shutdowns.\n       We met face to face for 35 days in the White House trying \n     to hammer things out . . .\n\n  As we know, ending this unnecessary shutdown is not the only \nchallenge we are dealing with here in Washington. But when it comes to \nthe debt ceiling--which Treasury tells us will be reached in the next \nfew weeks--Democrats refuse to come to the table to enact responsible \nspending reforms as part of that package. The American people disagree.\n  According to a recent Bloomberg poll, Americans by a 2-to-1 margin \ndisagree with President Barack Obama's contention that Congress should \nraise the U.S. debt limit without conditions. The American people \nunderstand that if we continue to borrow and borrow like there is no \ntomorrow and pile that burden on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren--they understand that if you are going to increase the \ndebt limit, if you are going to ask for a bigger credit card limit, \nthat you ought to be doing something about the debt. That is why, by a \n2-to-1 margin, they believe that if you are going to raise the debt \nlimit, you ought to do something to address the underlying debt. In \nfact, 61 percent of Americans, according to that poll, believe it is \nright to require spending cuts when the debt ceiling is raised even if \nit risks default.\n\n  I do not believe we ought to have a default, but I believe a \nnegotiation on the debt limit makes sense if we are serious about doing \nsomething about the debt. Every time in the past when we have had major \nbudget deals--when we go back to the Gramm-Rudman deal in 1985 or the \n1990 budget agreement or the 1993 budget agreement or the 1997 budget \nagreement or the one more recently, in 2011, the Budget Control Act, it \nwas always done around and in association with an increase in the debt \nlimit. There is a clear precedent, clear history, when we are facing an \nincrease in the debt limit, of having a serious substantive debate in \nthis country about how to address the debt. In many cases, those led to \nsome of the few times in our Nation's history when we have actually \ngotten budget agreements that did something to reduce spending.\n  It might come as a surprise to some of my colleagues here also that \ninasmuch as many of us do not like the sequester that came out of the \nBudget Control Act of 2011----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, what came out of that was now, for the \nfirst time since the 1950s, literally since the Korean war, government \nspending has gone down for 2 consecutive years.\n  It can be done. It can be done when reasonable people are willing to \nsit down and negotiate, but that requires the engagement of the Chief \nExecutive, of the President of the United States, and it requires the \ngood will of the people here in the Senate. It does not entail taking a \nposition that ``we will not negotiate.'' That is not a position. What \nwe need is an opportunity where we can sit down together and focus on \nthese big challenges we have. In the meantime, we continue to have \nopportunities to vote to fund veterans programs, to vote to fund our \nNational Guard and Reserve, to fund the National Institutes of Health--\nimportant priorities many of my colleagues on the other side have \ntalked about.\n  We have bills coming over from the House of Representatives. We could \ndo like we did with the military pay act--pick them up and pass them by \nunanimous consent so we do not have to worry about any of these issues \nnot being addressed and important programs and projects not being \nfunded. That is all it takes. I hope that can happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, we are here today with our government \ndoors shuttered because of a failure to understand basic civics. \nFrankly, this ``my way or the highway'' brinkmanship has been building \nso long here in Washington that I would not be surprised if the \nAmerican people say ``a pox on both your houses, Republican and \nDemocratic.''\n  Why are we in this fix? How did we get here? Sometimes when you are \nlost in the woods, it helps to retrace your footsteps so you can find \nthe way back out. We are here because some of our colleagues have \nforgotten their middle school civics lesson. They have forgotten the \n``I'm Just a Bill'' episode of ``Schoolhouse Rock'' that some of the \nfolks in the seventies and eighties remember that reminds us all that \nto pass a bill or repeal a bill, you have to meet certain tests. You \nneed a majority of the House of Representatives. You need a majority in \nthe Senate. If someone is going to filibuster, you need 60 votes. And \nyou need the signature and the support of the President.\n  We are here because my colleagues who want to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act do not have a majority of the Senate. They certainly do not \ncontrol the White House despite waging an entire election over the \nhealth care law. Since they cannot repeal the health care law the way \nwe all learned about in middle school, they decided to try something \nnew. They have taken the government hostage. They have said: If you do \nnot give us what we want, we are going to close down the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Can you imagine what it would look like if Democrats employed this \nkind of reckless and irresponsible tactic? What if we said: Unless you \nraise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, we are not going to pass a \nspending bill. Remember in 2009 when our party tried to pass a cap-and-\ntrade bill? We did not have the votes to overcome the filibuster in the \nSenate, so I guess the lesson here is that we should have refused\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nto fund the government until Republicans relented and passed a cap-and-\ntrade bill. Can you imagine. That is not how our democracy works, it is \nnot what our Founders envisioned, and it is not compromise. It is \nextortion.\n  It is our job to pass a spending bill every year. We can fight about \nhow big that bill is. We can fight about how small that bill is going \nto be. But constitutional duty is not optional. Some are saying there \nneeds to be further compromise on the spending bill, but it is clear \nthat sometimes the Republican House does not know when to declare a \nvictory. They actually got the spending levels they asked for. In the \ninterests of keeping the government open, the Senate accepted House \nspending levels, sequester levels, in our funding resolution. I do not \nlike those spending levels. Most Democrats do not support those \nspending levels. But we are not willing to risk the entire economy or \nwell-being of our constituents just to get our way.\n  The bottom line is this: It is time to reopen the government--no \nstrings attached, no policy riders, and no more hostage-taking, just a \nclean funding bill that stops hurting our public servants, our \ncommunities, and our economy, a clean funding resolution that keeps the \nlights on while we negotiate over a long-term budget. The Senate had \nthe votes to pass such a bill, and we did. The House also has the votes \nto pass a clean funding bill, but Speaker Boehner will not bring it to \nthe floor. He will not put it up for a vote because the most extreme \nMembers of his caucus want to play hostage politics instead.\n  It is time to end this.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an aspect of the tea \nparty government shutdown that has not gotten the attention it \ndeserves. Sadly, the effects of this tea party shutdown do not stop at \nour water's edge. The shutdown is putting our national security at \nrisk. The senior Senator from California, the chair of the Intelligence \nCommittee, has talked to us about how 72 percent of our intelligence \nemployees are not working. They are not all useless or laggards or \nslackers. In fact, there is a high degree of professionalism in the \nCIA, NSA, and like agencies. To have close to three-quarters of them \nnot on the job puts every American at risk.\n  There is another area that is putting us at risk. We all know that \nthe greatest threat to our national security and to that of Israel--or \none of the greatest threats to our national security and the greatest \nthreat to Israel is a nuclear Iran. In order to punish Iran for their \npursuit of nuclear weapons, Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan \nway, led in many instances by two of my good friends here, the \nDemocratic senior Senator from New Jersey Mr. Menendez and the \nRepublican senior Senator from South Carolina Mr. Graham--they have \ncome together to pass tough sanctions that would have a crippling \neffect on Iran's economy, and this body in a bipartisan way and the \nother body in a bipartisan way have passed those.\n  Just last week we saw some of the first results and progress, as \nPresident Ruhani said he was open to talks on the nuclear program. Iran \nhad been intransigent before that. We don't even know if they really \nwant to give up nuclear weapons or whether this is a feint, but we \ncertainly know the sanctions are having a dramatic effect. What has \nchanged Iran's mind? Have they suddenly had a change of heart out of \nthe blue? No. The only thing that changed their minds is the sanctions, \nand that is why they are at least acting differently than they have \nacted in the past. Who knows. Hopefully they may actually do something \nreal if the sanctions continue. We know that these tough sanctions are \na huge weight around the ankles of the Iranian economy.\n  But right now, when Iran feels cornered for the first time, the \nshutdown of our government could well take that pressure off the \nIranians, and it comes at exactly the wrong time. That is because the \nshutdown and its concomitant furloughs are preventing us from fully \nenforcing the sanctions, allowing the companies that are trying to do \nbusiness with Iran to escape punishment and allowing the Iranian \neconomy to expand faster than it normally would have. There are many \ncompanies that try to evade these sanctions, but the Federal Government \nhas cops on the beat who have been, by and large, overwhelmingly \nsuccessful in making sure nobody can slip through the cracks and do \nbusiness with Iran. But now, because of the government shutdown and \nfurloughs, those offices are greatly weakened.\n  Two of the major offices in the Treasury Department that enforce \nsanctions--the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Financial \nCrimes Enforcement Network--have only 30 of their 345 employees. Let me \nrepeat that. Two of the most important offices that enforce sanctions \nhave less than 10 percent of their employees. Ninety percent-plus are \non furlough. They cannot work.\n  The Office of Terrorist Financing and Intelligence--a vital part of \nour enforcing tough sanctions against Iran--is usually staffed by 10 \npeople. Right now they just have one--10 percent.\n  The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control--the \nprimary office responsible for enforcing these sanctions and punishing \nthose who violate them--is also operating with a skeleton staff.\n  Just at a time when we need the sanctions to continue to bite, this \ngovernment shutdown is making it a lot easier for rogue actors to sell \noil and trade with the Iranian regime. We all know that those who try \nto avoid sanctions find the weakest place. Now, with so few of our \npeople on the job because of the shutdown, it is going to be a lot \neasier for them. New sanctions designations will halt. We will not be \nable to investigate sanction violations. We cannot punish those who \nhave violated the sanctions. The government shutdown sends a dramatic \nand strong signal to those who seek to violate the sanctions and give \nthe Iranian regime hope that they can continue to keep nuclear weapons. \nIt could not come at a worse time. The Iranian sanctions have been our \nbest pressure point, and the shutdown is letting the pressure off Iran \nat exactly the wrong time.\n  We have seen a pattern over the last few days, and I have a feeling I \nknow what the response from the other side of the aisle--particularly \nthe junior Senator from Texas--will be. He will say: OK, Democrats, \nthat is a good point. Let's fund the sanctions, and maybe tomorrow or \nthe next day we will have a bill on the floor to restore those offices \nin the Treasury Department. Then maybe we will point out that the \ngovernment shutdown is hurting middle-class students from getting \ncollege loans. Again, that was something that had bipartisan support. \nThen maybe the junior Senator from Texas or House Republicans will say: \nOK. Let's fund it too. After a while, it gets a little ridiculous.\n\n  The House Republicans, and their seeming acquiescence to the junior \nSenator from Texas, have given the junior Senator from Texas a veto \npower over which parts of the Federal Government are funded and which \nare not. At the request of the junior Senator from Texas--who has \nfervently and passionately said don't fund the government unless \nObamaCare is\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\neliminated--the House Republicans have shut down government. Those \nactions are not a surprise. After all, the junior Senator from Texas \nsaid 10 months ago that he and the tea party ``have to be prepared to \ngo as far as to shut the government down.'' It is not a surprise.\n  Anyway, the Republicans have shuttered the entire Federal Government \nand they say they are willing to reopen it a piece at a time provided \nthat piece is blessed by the junior Senator from Texas. To allow any \none person to pick and choose which parts of the government can reopen \nis a cynical and ultimately extremely damaging way to run government. \nIt is dangerous for the country, and it is obvious it will not succeed.\n  I have one final point. It seems today's talking point from my \nRepublican colleagues is: Let's talk. It is obvious they feel the \npressure because America sees the intransigence of shutting down the \ngovernment unless our colleagues in the House get 100 percent of what \nthey want. But it is obvious when their talking point is ``let's \ntalk,'' they left out a key point at the beginning of their new talking \npoint. Because to only talk while the government is shut down does huge \ndamage to millions of innocent people and to our country's economy. \nThey forgot to say: Let's vote. Then let's talk. Their motto should be \nmodified.\n  Our motto is: Just vote. Vote to let government stay open. It will \ntake a single vote in the House of Representatives, and then let's \ntalk. To say ``let's talk'' while the government is shut down prolongs \nthe devastation to our colleagues.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues who have come up with this talking \npoint ``let's talk,'' they forgot the first part of their talking \npoint: Just vote, and then let's talk.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Alabama for his \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate Senator \nSchumer's remarks about the Iran sanctions. They are very important. It \nis an action by the United States that I think has helped in a number \nof ways with the radicalism in Iran, and we need to keep it up.\n  Yesterday, I heard Mr. Clapper--or maybe it was the day before--\ntestify before the Judiciary Committee, and he said he had a number of \npeople not working. Senator Grassley said: If they are not critical \npeople, then why do you need so many? If you have a critical job, you \nneed enough people to do the critical duties. How many do you need? You \nmust not need all these people. You said they are not important to us. \nI don't think Mr. Clapper had a very good answer to that.\n  When someone raised the question of defense cuts under the Budget \nControl Act, and he expressed concern about that, which I would share. \nI think Mr. Clapper is right to be concerned about it. So I asked \nDirector Clapper: Do you know the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Have \nyou ever heard of the Commander in Chief of the United States?\n  The House--the Republican House, I must say--has a half dozen times \nor more, over several years, passed legislation that eases those cuts \nand finds other reductions in spending from other departments and \nagencies that have received no cuts and as a result reduces the burden \non the Defense Department. Indeed, the Defense Department represents \none-sixth of the U.S. budget and they are being asked to take one-half \nthe cuts and don't think that counts in bringing down the war costs in \nIraq and Afghanistan; that is entirely different. I am talking about \nthe base defense budget that has taken half the cuts under the Budget \nControl Act. It is too much for the Defense Department. It ought to be \nspread around. The House has voted more than one-half dozen times to do \nthat. It died in the Senate because I guess they want to utilize the \nmilitary to threaten Republicans: If you don't do what we want, we are \nnot going to fund your military.\n  My goodness, the President is the Commander in Chief of the U.S. \nmilitary. Doesn't he have a responsibility to make sure we are \nadequately funded? I have to say, I am just getting a little frustrated \nwith that argument.\n  First of all, I don't think he is required to lay off that many \npeople. He indicated he was reviewing it. He was going to bring back \nmore people, as he could have been doing all along, but I think it did \nallow another example of disastrous complaints beyond reality. One more \nthing. Senator Schumer, and many of our Democratic colleagues, have \nbeen conducting a sustained and direct attack on the millions of people \nwho supported and identified with the tea party movement. Make no \nmistake about it, they don't respect the people in the tea party \nmovement. They demean them in every way virtually every day in this \nbody.\n  The tea partiers believe in America and thought this U.S. Congress \nhas turned into lunatics and are putting this country into bankruptcy \nby its spending too much and passing ObamaCare. Democrats passed \nObamaCare in spite of the overwhelming objections by the American \npeople. They did it without listening. The tea party spontaneously rose \nup, and it clobbered a bunch of Democratic House Members and Senators. \nIt switched the whole majority in the House by a big number. So they \ndon't like it.\n  Everybody who opposes them and says: You are not listening to us, \nthey are now demeaning and attacking. I think the American people and \nthe people who identify with and support the tea party, either directly \nor indirectly, need to know that. I know the people in the tea party. \nThey care about America. They love America. They can't understand what \nis going on here and they think they are moving us into bankruptcy and \nwe forgot the entire concept of constitutional limited government.\n\n  We have heard a lot of talk about the challenges facing the \ngovernment during the funding lapse we are in. All of us want to see \nthe government return to normal operations, and I certainly do, but \nwhat we seem to be losing sight of is the permanent consequences--the \ndebt consequences--of the Affordable Care Act. It needs to be a part of \nthis discussion. The Democrats have refused to listen. They basically \nblocked any effort in the Senate to reform in any significant way the \nAffordable Care Act. It has been going on ever since it passed. Their \ngoal is to put up a wall around it so if anything comes up, they will \nnot listen to it. They will not consider it. They will not discuss it. \nIt is a fact. It is a done deal. We can't even discuss it.\n  The House has a right to fund what they want to fund under the \nConstitution and not fund what they choose not to fund. They are trying \nto initiate and force a discussion on one of the most important issues \nfacing America. One of the things that is so dangerous about this law \nhas not been properly discussed, and I wish to talk about it.\n  A lot of us are going to donate our pay during this furlough to \ncharity. I certainly will. I wish our friends would begin to be more \nconcerned for the private sector workers. There are millions of \nAmerican workers who will be permanently affected by the Affordable \nCare Act. They will be hammered by it. Eventually full funding will \nresume to our government. We know that. This furlough will end.\n  If this ObamaCare remains in full effect, the consequences for \nAmerican workers are going to be lasting and damaging, as will the \nconsequences to the United States Treasury and our financial condition.\n  In particular, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, I would \nlike to focus on the huge and fundamental accounting manipulation that \nlies at the center of this health care law. I am going to make some \nstatements, and if anybody has detailed objections or rejections to it, \nI want to see them, and I will respond to them. But I am correct in \nwhat I am saying, and I look forward to any discussion that anybody \nwould like to have. So far people don't want to talk; they want to \nignore the problem.\n  We have to deal with these accounting manipulations because it is a \ncolossal blow to our Treasury. The Affordable Care Act was packaged and \nsold based on a promise that I am going to disprove. The American \npeople knew it wasn't true anyway. Before a joint session of the \nCongress, the President of the United States said and promised this: \n``I will not sign a [health care] plan that adds one dime to our \ndeficits, now or any time in the future, period.''\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\nThat is a bold statement. It is as good as ``read my lips.''\n  As I addressed earlier this week, hundreds of billions of dollars in \nMedicare savings to the hospital insurance, HI, trust fund were double-\ncounted under the legislation that was passed--at least $400 billion \nover the 2010 to the 2019 10-year period. I asked for an analysis \nbefore the bill passed on December 23. We ended up voting on December \n24, Christmas Eve. They rammed it through before Scott Brown, who would \nhave denied them the 60th vote, was elected in Massachusetts--liberal \nMassachusetts--on the commitment he would be the vote to kill \nObamaCare, but they were able to get it through before he was able to \ntake office.\n  The night before we voted, I asked CBO about it. I insisted they give \nan answer, and they did. They said:\n\n       The key point is that savings to the HI trust fund--\n\n  That is Medicare--\n\n     under PPACA--\n\n  That is ObamaCare--\n\n     would be received by the government only once, so they cannot \n     be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, at the \n     same time, pay for current spending on the other parts of the \n     legislation--\n\n  ObamaCare--\n\n     or on other programs. . . . To describe the full amount of HI \n     trust fund savings----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The CBO went on to conclude to say:\n\n       To describe the full amount of HI trust fund savings as \n     both improving the government's ability to pay future \n     Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of \n     Medicare would essentially double-count a large share of \n     those savings and thus overstate the improvement in the \n     government's fiscal position.\n\n  What a statement that was. In fact, CBO estimated that if Medicare \nsavings were truly set aside to pay future Medicare benefits, the new \nhealth care law would not decrease but increase the deficit over the \nfirst 10 years and subsequent decade. They said it would increase the \ndeficit.\n  But there is a lesser known, equally shocking, account gimmick that I \nwanted to mention today; that is, how it was done with Social Security. \nThey have obtained another $100 billion over the next 10 years by \ndouble-counting Social Security money.\n  My time is up, and I could explain it in more detail, but we have to \nunderstand this. According to the Congressional Government \nAccountability Office--and I asked them not too long ago when they \nissued a report--that over the next long-term implementation of \nObamaCare, it would add $6.2 trillion to the debt of the United States. \nThat is almost as much as the liabilities that Social Security has and \nfully accounted for--my budget staff tells me that the ObamaCare \nlegislation will be harder to fund and add more to the deficit----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Than Social Security will under the current \nproblems. We need to stop digging the hole and we need to start fixing \nMedicare and Social Security and not adding other programs we can't pay \nfor.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I know this is not a town that has ever \nbeen known for having a long memory. In fact, the recent warning bells \nrung about our deficits and our debt have predictably faded into the \nbackground with all of the attention on the rocky start to this fiscal \nyear.\n  Last month, the Congressional Budget Office released its long-term \nbudget outlook. Headlines and news stories associated with that release \nuse words such as grim and gloomy and raised alarm about our ``long-\nterm fiscal crisis.'' The very first line in that report reminds us \nthat between 2009 and 2012, the U.S. Government recorded the largest \nbudget deficits--when compared to the size of the economy--in over half \na century.\n  Reflecting on the current state of play, CBO noted that the Federal \ndebt currently stands at roughly three-quarters of our gross domestic \nproduct. More alarming, they predict our Federal debt will match the \nsize of our economy or be equal to 100 percent of GDP by the year 2038.\n  I understand the temptation to roll our eyes and politely suggest \nthat those facts and figures are of more interest to green-eyeshaded \nbean counters or to simply wave them off as last month's news. Frankly, \nthis is made much easier when the administration says things such as \n``we don't have an urgent debt crisis'' and when appropriations bills \ncome to the floor at levels that make little sense given our current \nfiscal realities.\n  Unfortunately, these facts and figures only tell part of the story. \nThe CBO provides us insight into the impact these facts and figures \nwill have on the economy and the Federal budget deficit. If the growth \nin our Federal debt is left unchecked, we could eventually see a \nfurther drop in private investment, an increase in interest payments, a \ndecrease in Congress's flexibility, and, obviously, a risk of fiscal \ncrisis.\n  CBO notes that ``the unsustainable nature of the federal government's \ncurrent tax and spending policies presents lawmakers and the public \nwith difficult choices . . . To put the federal budget on a sustainable \npath for the long term, lawmakers would have to make significant \nchanges to tax and spending policies.''\n  We all know that given the current environment, it is difficult to do \nthat. It is difficult when we have a problem just bringing routine \nspending measures to the President's desk. So this is not an easy \nconclusion to hear.\n  But within our dim current fiscal landscape and even dimmer outlook, \nthere has been at least one bright spot. In 2011, Congress agreed to \nand the President signed into law the Budget Control Act--the BCA. This \nincluded statutory discretionary spending caps as well as automatic, \nacross-the-board spending cuts for our failure to enact additional \ndeficit reduction measures.\n  Certainly trimming Federal spending via across-the-board \nsequestration cuts is an inelegant means, at best, of addressing our \nspending problem. It is often referred to as a ``blunt instrument.'' At \na minimum, it is a lazy way to legislate. I believe I join a number of \nmy colleagues when I say I am open to providing additional flexibility \nwhile staying within the budget caps with respect to the sequester. But \nwe simply can't deny that locking in discretionary spending caps and \nenforcing them with automatic sequestration has yielded some of the \nmost significant spending cuts we have seen in Congress in years.\n  As my colleague from Tennessee, who recently came to the floor, said, \n2 years ago, discretionary spending stood at nearly $1.5 trillion. Last \nyear, under the BCA spending caps, that number dropped to just under $1 \ntrillion. This year, if no changes occur to the sequester enforcement \ncap, we will be at $976 billion. That is a significant drop. That is \nsignificant. And that is a good thing.\n  A recent Wall Street Journal story entitled ``The GAO's Unheralded \nVictory on Spending'' quoted the head of Americans for Tax Reform as \nconcluding that we had ``made a fundamental shift in the size of the \ngovernment equation.''\n  While runaway spending on mandatory programs represents an ever-\npresent issue we have to get our arms around, the BCA spending caps and \nsequester have put real and meaningful downward pressure on \ndiscretionary spending that represents about a third of our Federal \nbudget.\n  My colleague from Kentucky, the minority leader, recently pointed out \nthat the BCA which passed 2 years ago ``actually reduced government \nspending for 2 years in a row for the first time since the Korean \nWar.'' I agree with him when he urges that we not walk away from the \nspending reductions we have already promised taxpayers.\n  I have made no secret of the fact that I do not favor the strategy of \ntying the funding of ObamaCare to the current continuing resolution. As \nthe resulting shutdown drags on and there are more stories about the \nfights over funding next year, and then the coming debate over the debt \nceiling, I find myself favoring this strategy even less. It is entirely \nlikely that the sequester opponents will use the larger debate to push \nto undo the gains we have made of\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\nmeaningful spending cuts by abolishing the sequester by replacing it \nwith meaningless savings, budget gimmicks, or even new taxes.\n  Far from a conspiracy theory, in recent months there have already \nbeen calls for a 2-year sequester hiatus. I agree with Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense when they say that ``this may be the convenient answer, \nbut it is no way to get our fiscal house in order.''\n  It is my hope we can find a way through this shutdown sooner rather \nthan later. It is also my hope that we can at some point have a real \nconversation about the long-term drivers of our crushing debt that \nunderlie our need to regularly hike the debt ceiling. In the meantime, \nand as this debate unfolds, I urge my colleagues to resist any effort \nto undermine the sequester-enforced Budget Control Act spending caps.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, House Speaker Boehner is sending the \nSenate a series of bills to put one Band-Aid at a time on the House \nRepublicans' government shutdown. It is an obvious attempt to fool the \nAmerican people into thinking House Republicans are acting to end the \nshutdown. But their transparent tactic is not fooling many people, and \nhere is why: The people of this country know the harm of the government \nshutdown isn't about the handful of programs that House Republicans \nwill dangle in front of us. The House Republican gambit will not put \nfood inspectors back to work. It will not put Centers for Disease \nControl experts back to work tracking outbreaks of infectious diseases. \nIt is not going to reopen Head Start classrooms for kids. Their \npiecemeal approach won't restart lending to small businesses or bring \nback the FAA inspectors who make sure commercial aircraft are safe, and \nit won't restore hundreds of other vital services and functions.\n  No matter how many rifleshot bills the House Republicans try, all \nthey do is leave our government full of holes. We could spend months \nlegislating in bits and pieces while House Republicans ignore the \nobvious solution: The House should vote on the clean continuing \nresolution the Senate has sent to them, because that vote will end the \nshutdown.\n  The Republican bits-and-pieces strategy is like smashing a piece of \ncrockery with a hammer, gluing two or three bits back together today, a \ncouple more tomorrow, and two or three more the day after that. House \nRepublicans should stop before they do any more damage, put down the \nhammer, pick up the Senate's continuing resolution, and at least put it \nto a vote.\n  I heard one Republican on the Senate floor yesterday argue that we \nshould adopt the piecemeal approach because, after all, he said, under \nregular order, we pass separate appropriations bills for different \nparts of the government one at a time. While that is true, it is \nirrelevant. We have a mechanism for keeping the government open while \nwe go through the regular order process. It is called a continuing \nresolution, and it keeps the full government open while we adopt \nappropriations bills one at a time.\n  Five days ago, the Senate passed, for the third time, a continuing \nresolution to keep the government open and sent it to the House. It is \nwell past time for Speaker Boehner to bring it to a vote.\n  Republicans want to negotiate changes in the Affordable Care Act. Of \ncourse we will talk about that once the government is functioning, but \nwe should not and will not allow the U.S. Government to be held hostage \nby the Republicans while we are talking about the Affordable Care Act \nor any other subject which they or we wish to talk about.\n  I am keenly aware, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that \none of the most devastating effects of this Republican shutdown is its \ndamage to our national security. Already our men and women in uniform \nhave been asked to operate under the damaging effects of sequestration. \nThose cuts have done serious harm to our military readiness and \nmilitary families, and the shutdown is making things far worse.\n  Because of the House Republican shutdown, workers at the Defense \nDepartment maintenance depots around the country who should be \nrepairing and preparing vehicles, ships, and aircraft for combat, are \ninstead furloughed, along with hundreds of thousands of other \nDepartment of Defense civilians.\n  Training exercises have largely come to a halt. Anyone who thinks \nthat is no big deal has never spent any time with our men and women in \nuniform. The key factor in our military's effectiveness isn't our \nsophisticated weapons systems, as important as they are; it is the \nhighly trained men and women who employ those weapons. Every day of \nthis shutdown wears away the sharp edge of their readiness to respond \nto crises around the world.\n  Some troops and their families won't get tuition assistance. Most \ntravel is suspended, including many permanent changes of station. That \nmeans military families scheduled to move to a new location who may \nhave already sold a home at their old duty location or committed to a \nlease or a mortgage at their new location, and spouses who need to \nstart a job search, face financial loss and disruption and uncertainty \nin their lives. Our troops and their families can't even go to their \non-post commissaries because they are closed.\n  The bill we passed last week to ensure our troops would receive \npaychecks is all well and good, but that did not address the many \nshortfalls our troops and their families face during this shutdown.\n  Another truly outrageous example is that the families of the brave \nmen and women who were killed while defending this Nation will see a \ndelay in the payment of death benefits because of this shutdown.\n  Some may say, You are right, these problems for our national security \nare intolerable. Let's pass a bill to fix them.\n  We have. The Senate passed a continuing resolution three times, the \nlast one 5 days ago, which would keep the government functioning. \nSpeaker Boehner refuses to allow the House to vote on the Senate-passed \ncontinuing resolution. No matter how many piecemeal bills the Speaker \nsends to us here in the Senate, he will be leaving out millions of \nAmericans who will continue to suffer from the shutdown that he and tea \nparty-dominated Republicans have created. Every day they spend \nobsessing over ObamaCare is one more day of unfairness and uncertainty \nfor our troops and their families. Every day of the House Republicans' \ndestructive submission to the tea party is another day food is not \ninspected, it is another day FBI agents are working without pay, it is \nanother day the SBA is not approving loans for small businesses, it is \nanother day scientists are barred from their labs and on and on.\n\n  Speaker Boehner can bring this chaos to a halt by bringing the \nSenate's continuing resolution to the floor of the House for a vote. \nThe Senate has voted three times on House versions of continuing \nresolutions. Speaker Boehner refuses to vote even once on the Senate \nbill. Why? This is the question, by the way, the media has not yet \nasked Speaker Boehner. Why? Why has he not brought to the floor of the \nHouse the Senate-passed continuing resolution? Here is to the answer, \nand it is a stunning answer: Because it might pass. You heard me right. \nThe reason Speaker Boehner is not bringing the continuing resolution \npassed in the Senate to the floor of the House for a vote is because it \nis going to pass.\n  That is anathema. It would be anathema--anathema--to the Speaker of \nthe House for a continuing resolution to pass if it depended upon \nDemocratic votes. It is his policy not to depend on any Democratic \nvotes to pass legislation in the House. The policy of the Speaker is \ntruly the epitome of rank partisanship. In fact, I do not know of a \nclearer example of extreme partisan policy than Speaker Boehner's \nrefusal to hold a vote on bills that would rely on some Democratic \nvotes to pass.\n  One of Speaker Boehner's Republican colleagues, Congressman Dent from \nPennsylvania, has verified this sad fact. Here is what Congressman Dent \nsaid last night on PBS's NewsHour.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed for 4 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Here is what Congressman Dent said:\n\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\n\n       I do believe it's imperative that we do have a clean \n     funding bill to fund the government.\n\n  Then he continued:\n\n       That was the intent of the Republican leadership all along, \n     but obviously there were a few dozen folks in the House \n     Republican Conference who weren't prepared to vote for a \n     clean bill--\n\n  Here is his conclusion. This is now a Republican Congressman speaking \nlast night, saying:\n\n     . . . a few dozen folks in the House Republican Conference \n     who weren't prepared to vote for a clean bill, and that's why \n     we're in the situation we're in right now.\n\n  That is an astonishing report of abdication of leadership in the \nHouse of Representatives. What an incredible statement about the \nstranglehold that a few dozen ideological zealots now have on the \nRepublican Party in the House of Representatives. It is an \nextraordinary moment in history when a Speaker of the House allows a \nfew dozen Members of Congress to bring the government of this Nation to \na standstill.\n  When we cut through all the claims and all the counterclaims, all the \npress conferences, all the photo-ops, there is one unassailable, \nindisputable fact that remains: The Senate has passed a continuing \nresolution to keep the government open, and Speaker Boehner refuses to \nbring it to a vote in the House of Representatives.\n  It need not be this way. All that is required to break the \nstranglehold that the tea party has on House Republicans is for Speaker \nBoehner to bring the Senate-passed continuing resolution that would \nreopen the government to the floor of the House for a vote. I urgently \nhope he will do so, and I hope that every hour until he does, he is \nasked to defend his refusal to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 2 minutes and to be followed by Senator Enzi for \nthe normal time he was allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we share being attorney generals of \nour States, and I just wish to take a moment to express my sincere and \ndeep thanks--and from all of us--to the men and women who protect us \nevery day, the Capitol Police. We had a very serious incident \nyesterday. Our people rallied and responded in an appropriate way. I \nbelieve they conducted themselves in a professional way.\n  For example, I saw one young man. He said he had heard and responded \nimmediately, was running toward the scene. We think: Well, that is OK. \nThat is what they do. That is what they are supposed to do.\n  We need to understand, when one of our young men and women are \nresponding to a scene of a firing, of weapons discharged, they do not \nknow what is there. In this environment, it could be a very serious \nthing. Their very life is at stake every time. Everyplace they stand on \nour streets, everyplace they stand in our building, the Capitol, and \nour office buildings, they are standing there subject to a threat by \nsomebody who could appear out of nowhere with deadly force, and they do \nit with professionalism and courage every day.\n  We have been very fortunate in seeing this Capitol be well protected, \nand I wish to express my appreciation for them and all who place their \nlives at risk every day to protect the operational functions of this \ngovernment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from Alabama \nfor his comments. I too want to add my thanks and appreciation for law \nenforcement people all over the United States who are doing their job \nand often have to do things such as give tickets. They do not get \nanything but bad news and grief for it, but they are out there \nprotecting us at the same time and they definitely deserve credit, our \nadmiration, and our prayers.\n  Madam President, I also wish to comment a little bit on what the \nSenator from Michigan said with his indisputable facts. The \nindisputable fact is that we are only where we are right now with a \ngovernment shutdown and the attempts to get a continuing resolution \nthrough because Congress did not do its job, the Senate did not do its \njob, the job we have to pass spending bills. If we had passed the \nspending bills--and there are 12 of them--if we passed the 12 spending \nbills, there would not be a need for a continuing resolution.\n  What is a continuing resolution? It is permission for government to \ncontinue functioning as it has been functioning, spending one-twelfth \nof what they spent the year before for each month until we finally come \nup with a spending bill.\n  The way the law is written, we are supposed to have a budget by April \n15 and that is a very significant day and it is an intentional day. \nThen, right after that, we are supposed to start doing spending bills, \nand we are supposed to allocate the amount of money we want each \nagency, program, department to spend.\n  We have not done that for years. Consequently, we get into this bind \nwhere we are saying: Go ahead and spend money, and we will figure it \nout later.\n  We have had a sequester, and the way the sequester works is it is \nsupposed to be a 2.3-percent reduction from each agency, program, \ndepartment. We did continuing resolutions last year. We did continuing \nresolutions for at least 7 months--probably 7\\1/2\\, maybe 8 months. So \nthey got to continue spending what they had been spending the year \nbefore.\n  They knew a sequester was coming because Congress again did not do \nits work and come up with an alternate way to fund government. So they \nonly had 4 months left to take their 2.3 percent out of their total \nspending, which would be the whole spending for the year. Do you know \nwhat that does? That makes it 5.3 percent.\n  But that is not bad enough. We have an administration that sent out \nword to make it hurt, and we have an administration that also took care \nof Washington but did not take care of the people out in the \nhinterlands of Wyoming--Wyoming and the rest of the United States--\npeople who are out there actually doing the work, person-to-person, \nthat is supposed to be done with what we are funding. Instead, it went \nto a lot of administration.\n  I had some people in this week from the Head Start program, and they \nshowed me how they were cut 7.5 percent. What part of 2.3 percent would \n7.5 percent be? Part of that is that 5.3 percent because it came so \nlate. But it is 7.5 percent because 2.5 percent of that goes to fund \nthe Federal Government in Washington. That is not where the work is \ndone. That is where the reports are done. That is where the regulations \nare done. That is where the things are done that stymie the people out \nthere who are having to actually help the people.\n  The Civil Air Patrol came to me. They do search and rescue from the \nair when people are lost around Wyoming. They said: We are being cut 60 \npercent. I said: What part of 2.3 percent would 60 percent be? They are \neven taking three of their five airplanes. I said: If they do not have \nany money, how can they take your airplanes? How would they have the \nmoney to fly them anywhere?\n  It is just one more of those things where the administration is \nsaying make them feel the pain. Of course, part of that was closing \ndown White House tours. How much can it cost for a self-guided White \nHouse tour? That is what they are. They are self-guided. You get a \nbrochure. It is my understanding it is about an $18,000 savings. That \nis nothing compared to what we are working with.\n  We have $9 billion a year worth of duplication just on things under \nhealth and education and labor and pensions--$9 billion in duplication. \nWhat is $18,000? Why couldn't we take a look at those budgets in detail \nand get rid of duplication? This is duplication that is evaluated by \nthe White House. But when we have a shutdown, we do not do that. We do \nnot eliminate any of that.\n  Everybody has seen the World War II Memorial with the barricades. \nEver since the World War II Memorial went up, I have never seen \nbarricades there. I have been down there in the middle of the night and \nbeen able to walk through the World War II Memorial or any of the other \nmemorials down there. I do not think I could use the restroom, and \nthere is probably some justification for having the restrooms closed \nbecause there is the problem of cleaning them--what would require some \nadditional personnel--but just to walk through things?\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n  We are making progress, though, because they also barricaded off \nLincoln Park. It is a children's playground up here on the Hill. There \nwere pictures in the paper the other day of a little girl looking at \nthe sign on the gate that was locked saying that the park was closed. I \nam pleased to report that yesterday that sign was gone, kids were \nplaying in the park. There is no cost to that. So there is no purpose \nin having any kind of a shutdown regarding that.\n  The Smithsonian out here is a national park, and there are streets \nthat go through the national park. They go through it one way \nprimarily, but they do not have any additional cost to them. They do \nnot serve anything. But they were blocked off. You could not go through \nstreets that people normally drive through on any given day.\n  In my own State, Jackson Hole--if you are driving from Dubois to \nJackson, on the right-hand side of the road is a gorgeous view of the \nTetons. These are some lands left over from the Alps that God had, so \nhe put them in Wyoming. People like to stop and take pictures of them, \nparticularly at this time of year because the aspens are turning to \ngold and they are mixed in with the pine trees. There is a river that \nruns through there and then there are these majestic mountains.\n  The turnouts along that road are barricaded. You cannot turn out. You \ncould not turn out to fix a flat tire. You could not turn out if you \nneeded a nap. You cannot turn out to take a picture. Why? How did they \nget the barricades? How much did they have to spend for the barricades? \nHow much did they have to spend to have somebody go out and put up \nthose barricades?\n  Incidentally, if you drive along the GW Parkway out here, it is the \nsame way. The little turnouts that are along there are barricaded. \nWhere did we get all these barricades? If it was a business and they \ntreated their customers that way, they would be out of business, and \nthey would deserve to be out of business. We should be operating \ndifferently than that.\n  I did notice Air Force is going to play Navy tomorrow. But the \njustification is there is some revenue for that, and there is. If you \ncharge admission to those things, and they are highly popular sporting \nevents, there will be a lot of people who go and they will pay a lot of \nmoney for it and it will exceed the cost of putting it on at the venue. \nThat would be the government making money. There is an oxymoron.\n  But Yellowstone Park is in my State. Yellowstone was the first \nnational park. In fact, it was the first park in the world. It is a \nhuge park. In fact, it is the size of Connecticut. It sits up there in \nthe corner of Wyoming. A lot of people go through Yellowstone in order \nto get to Idaho or Montana or maybe Montana folks trying to get down to \nWyoming. But that is all closed off now.\n  What is interesting to me is that if you do drive through there, you \npay a fee. It is actually revenue. Now, of course, when I brought that \nup, I was reminded that the revenue goes to the general fund. But I had \nto say: Do you know where the money for the national parks comes from? \nIt comes from the general fund. So if you do not collect the money, you \nwill not have the money to put back into the park.\n  Not only that, there are concessionaires who pay to be able to sell \ngas and food and lodging in Yellowstone Park. Their customers cannot \nget to them. I do not think we relieved them of paying the fee they \nhave to pay. I am pretty sure the concessionaires were expecting about \n$4.5 million worth of business this month--not the busiest month but an \nimportant month. I think there are ways we could have continued to \ncollect revenue, but we are not doing it. Let's make it hurt.\n  We are here with this continuing resolution. The last vote I got to \ndo was actually a vote to have a conference committee. It wasn't any \ndemand from the House, it was a request for a conference committee. \nWhat happens in a conference committee? The leader appoints some people \nfrom here, in conjunction with the minority leader. They appoint some \nin the House. They get together and try to work this out. But, no, that \nwas voted down by the Democrats, so we are not going to have that.\n  I have a lot more that I would say. I realize my time has expired. We \nare in this position because we have been doing a bad job of governing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, we are in day 4 of a tea party \nRepublican shutdown. We need to be very clear as to how we got here. \nThe Senate majority leader negotiated with the Speaker of the House, \nand after a long negotiation in which the Senate made major \nconcessions, we agreed to pass a 6-week funding bill for services of \nthe government, to keep services open while we negotiate the larger \nissues around the budget.\n  We passed a bill with the funding levels asked for by the House \nRepublicans. Republicans asked that we continue funding below the \nlevels we believe are necessary to grow the economy for 6 weeks. Rather \nthan having a government shutdown, at the time we believed it was in \nthe interests of the American people, of all of those who provide those \nimportant services to us, that we, in fact, agree with the House on a \n6-week extension. We sent it over to them, asked for by the Speaker, \nagreed to by the Senate. There it has sat.\n  Let me quote again from Congressman Dent--a Republican colleague of \nSpeaker Boehner's--who said last night on ``PBS NewsHour'':\n\n       I do believe it's imperative that we do have a clean \n     funding bill, a straight funding bill to fund the government. \n     That was the intent of the Republican leadership all along. \n     But obviously there were a few dozen folks in the House \n     Republican conference who were not prepared to vote for a \n     clean bill and that is why we are in the situation we are in.\n\n  ``A few dozen folks''--part of this tea party wing. He said: That is \nwhy we are where we are today.\n  You can overcome that very simply. Just bring the bill that the \nSpeaker said he wanted, that we were willing to agree to for short-term \nfunding of Federal services, bring it to the floor, and those few dozen \nfolks can vote no and everybody else can vote yes. Then we would have \nthe government back open. So it is truly a question of just letting the \nHouse vote. Just vote. Right now, today, before 5:00, we could be done \nwith this irresponsible action. We could then make sure the Federal \nGovernment can pay its bills and not default and at the same time go to \nconference to negotiate the larger budget issues, which we need to do, \nbut that is not what is happening.\n  So it is now day 4. Government services are still closed. The bill \nthat could open them--which has a majority vote, which has Republicans \nand Democrats--is sitting in the House because admittedly Republican \nMembers of the House are saying a few dozen folks did not like it.\n  Well, in our great democracy, our Founders said majority rules, but \nsomehow we seem to have forgotten that around here. We have elections. \nThe person who gets the majority wins. The others are not happy. They \nlose. Majority rules. Same thing happens on legislation.\n  So now we are in a situation with a group defined as ``a few dozen \nfolks'' in the House driving the train because there is no leadership \nin the House to bring up the vote and be able to pass this continuing \nresolution with a bipartisan vote.\n  We are paying a very big cost right now as a country waiting for the \nHouse to vote. Nearly 800,000 people have been laid off--800,000 \npeople. We are just barely coming out of the recession. We are coming \nback. We are creating jobs--not enough. When this President came in, we \nhad six people looking for work for one job. Now it is down to three \npeople looking for work for one job. That is better. It is not good \nenough. There is more to do, and we all know it. So what is the \nresponse? Well, let's just lay off 800,000 people in the middle of this \neffort to try to bring a middle class roaring back in this country.\n  There are about 7,500 people in my State of Michigan who are \nproviding important services, people who are in middle-class jobs, have \na mortgage, have at least one car payment, many sending their kids to \ncollege, trying to make sure they can care for their families, proud of \nwhat they do providing various public services that we all benefit \nfrom, and they are now sitting and waiting.\n  It is costing our country about $300 million a day--$300 million a \nday--in\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nlost wages and productivity, $300 million a day that we cannot afford \nto lose. This could all be ended in 5 minutes if the Speaker of the \nHouse would just allow a vote on a bill that contains the funding \nlevels that the Speaker himself asked for, not those that we would like \nto see because on a longer term negotiation, we are going to fight very \nhard to increase opportunities for education and innovation, focusing \nmore on economic growth and jobs. This is a number asked for for a \nshort-term continuing resolution for 6 weeks. They evidently cannot \ntake ``yes'' for an answer.\n\n  Today I had an opportunity to meet a wonderful little boy named Kai \nwho is 2 years old. He and his mom Anna were with us talking about the \nimpact on the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease \nControl, the Food and Drug Administration, and other public health \nfunctions for our country and what it means to families.\n  Kai was born with a heart defect. He has had two bypass surgeries now \nin just his 2 little years of life. Thanks to a clinical trial at the \nChildren's National Health System, Kai was able to get innovative \ntreatment that he needs. He was running all over the place this \nmorning, a great success story.\n  The things we do together as a country are what we should be proud \nof. The work that is being done by our doctors and researchers at \nplaces such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration \nare literally saving lives. These men and women who are now furloughed, \nnot working because of the shutdown, have gone through years of \ntraining. They are dedicated. They love what they do. These are some of \nthe top experts on infectious diseases and food safety and cancer \nresearch in the country and in the world. Right now they are sitting at \nhome, maybe watching us, trying to figure out what the heck is going \non--or stronger language. They are not allowed to work. If they are \nworking, they are not working with pay, all because of a few dozen \nfolks in the House of Representatives, tea party folks who are running \nthe show in the House who have decided they want to shut the entire \ngovernment down over the Affordable Care Act, over the fact that we \nbelieve--the country believes there had to be a way to find affordable \ninsurance for 30 million folks who have not been able to find and \npurchase affordable insurance.\n  The director of the division at the CDC that monitors food-borne \nillnesses--scary stuff like E. coli outbreaks--said recently he has \nthree people working in his whole department right now--three people \nfor our country monitoring food-borne illnesses, three people in charge \nof tracking every possible case of food-borne illness in the entire \ncountry.\n  This needs to be a wake-up call. It is time to get the government \nopen so that people can go back to work who are in positions to monitor \nand protect our public health, the defense of this country, educational \nopportunities, and the safety of our country. Get these CDC officials \nback to work and make sure our families are safe.\n  CBS News reports that the Centers for Disease Control headquarters, \nwhich is in Atlanta, GA, is a ghost town. Folks who monitor infectious \ndiseases have 6,000 employees in Atlanta, GA, and they are calling it a \nghost town--in America, the greatest country in the world. The Director \nof the CDC, the Nation's top doctor in charge of infectious diseases, \nsaid he is ``losing sleep'' because ``I do not know that we will be \nable to find and stop the things that might kill people.''\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me go on and conclude. We heard on the floor \nearlier from the junior Senator from Texas, who spoke eloquently about \nthe great work being done by the veterans health care system. It is \nunfortunate that it took a government shutdown for my colleague, I \nmight say through the Chair, to understand how important a completely \ngovernment-run health system is. The VA is completely government run \nand funded.\n  My colleagues who are opposing people buying private insurance \nthrough private exchanges and making their own decisions about what \nworks for them, who are saying it is the end of the world if families \ncan buy insurance that is more affordable for them and that they can \nactually get what they are paying for because insurance companies \ncannot kick them off when they get sick or block them from getting \ninsurance if they have a preexisting condition--they are saying that is \nawful, but a completely government-run health care system called the VA \nshould be funded.\n  I happen to agree with that. Our system through the VA is important \nfor veterans. We need to keep it funded. We need to keep the CDC, the \nNational Institutes of Health, the FDA, and every other part of our \nimportant system funded.\n  The House needs to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. First, I wish to thank the Capitol Hill police and the \nSecret Service for their bravery, their heroism, and their work, not \nonly yesterday but every day, to keep this Capitol safe and to keep the \npeople in it safe. We are in their debt.\n  The people of Indiana all want jobs. We want to go to work. We want \nand we know the dignity that comes with a good day's labor and the \nchance to take care of our family. The people in Indiana have told me \ntime after time, and they have said it very clearly: Joe, focus on \njobs, focus on the basics.\n  I couldn't be prouder of my home State. Every day I am thankful I \nhave the amazing privilege to represent all Hoosiers in the Senate. But \nour economy in Indiana isn't as strong as we would like it to be. The \nnational unemployment rate is 7.3 percent; Indiana, 8.1. Indiana's \nmedian household income declined 13.2 percent from 2000 to 2012 and it \nlags behind the national average. We have dropped to 40th among States \nin per capita income. We have so much work to do in my home State and \nin our country.\n  As you know, I am an optimist by nature, but I am incredibly \ndisheartened by what I have seen in Washington recently. Some in \nCongress are playing a game of chicken with our jobs, with our economy, \nand with our future. Because these folks haven't gotten their way, \nthousands of Hoosiers are furloughed and are not receiving paychecks, \nthe paychecks that help them feed their families, pay for college, and \ninvest their hard-earned money in the local-run businesses.\n  Many of the good people at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, \nIN, who keep our troops in Afghanistan and around the world safe, were \nsent home recently. They can't do their critical work that keeps our \nNation safe.\n  The demands of a few here have caused the scientists at the Centers \nfor Disease Control to be unable to go to work. These actions have also \ncaused many of the patriots at Fort Wayne's Air National Guard Station \nand Grissom Air Reserve Base and at Terre Haute to have their work and \ntheir operations idled.\n  We are now at a point in the debate where some are putting our \neconomy at risk simply to advance their own political agendas. These \nfolks are shutting down operations across our Nation and in my beloved \nhome State, and that hurts our still recovering economy.\n  We have so much work to do to move Indiana and our Nation forward, \nand Congress isn't helping. We talk all the time about providing \ncertainty to our business friends. Hoosier businesses thrive on hard \nwork, creativity, and teamwork. They also deserve a government that \nprovides certainty, a steady hand in choppy seas. They don't need a \ngovernment that creates the storm.\n  Most folks back home think Congress can play some role in improving \nthe economy, even if that role is simply not to make things worse. But \nover the past year, Congress has made and continues to make things much \nmore difficult. It is embarrassing that the actions of some in Congress \nthese days are now the greatest obstacle to future job creation in our \ncountry.\n  America's economic confidence is measured daily by polling by Gallup. \nIt is currently at minus 22. It matches the low for the year. It is \nworth pointing out that the other low for the year happened right \nbefore sequestration took effect in March--another problem, another \nself-inflicted wound caused by Congress.\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\n  The implementation of sequester cuts, which is what happened when \nCongress proved itself unable to make the tough decisions that Congress \nwas sent here to make, has led to job losses and furloughs, so many \nfamilies don't have as much to make ends meet.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported we could lose up \nto 1.6 million jobs next year if these across-the-board cuts continue. \nFurther, a number of economists have concluded that Congress \nsignificantly reduced this country's economic growth because we failed \nto replace the cuts with something smarter. Economic growth is a fancy \nterm for people going to work and people who have jobs.\n  The American people are losing confidence in their economy because of \nCongress. Here we are 6 months later, 4 days into a government \nshutdown, 13 days away from defaulting on our debt. History tells us \ngovernment shutdowns are terrible for the economy and terrible for \njobs.\n  If we look at the last time the Federal Government shut down in 1995 \nand 1996 for 27 days, Congress put hundreds of thousands of people out \nof work, with $1.4 billion in damages, and consumer confidence took a \ndouble-digit dip. Back then our country's economy was in a stronger \nplace than it is today and it recovered a little bit more quickly. This \ngovernment shutdown is damaging our economy at a time where it is very \nfragile.\n  However, this government shutdown has damaged our economy, but a \ndefault on our bills as we look forward would be absolutely \ndevastating. What happens if we fail to raise the debt limit and if we \nstop paying our bills? That is what the debt limit is. It is our \nobligation to pay our bills.\n  While it is completely unprecedented, well-respected economists warn \nit could send us right back into a tailspin. We are still recovering \nfrom the last recession. At a time when Hoosiers are trying to get back \nto work and take care of our families, Congress's inability to work \ntogether is making it so much more difficult. Congress is not helping \nand is actually hindering job creation and economic growth.\n  This is no way to run a country. I stand ready to work with anyone in \na commonsense way out of this train wreck. We must find a way to stop \nhurting the economy and to actually help the people who have made this \ncountry such a great place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. As did my colleague from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, I also \nwish to take a moment before I deliver my remarks here to thank the \nCapitol Police, all of law enforcement, and first responders who have \nput themselves on the line to protect others.\n  I know I speak for every Republican, every Democrat, and all of our \nstaffs that we deeply appreciate their work and their sacrifice. These \nbrave men and women are here every day whether they are paid or not. We \nappreciate that.\n  If there is one thing we are united on, and I wish there were more, \nit is our respect for those who serve to protect, those serving us here \nat home as well as those serving us in harm's way abroad. We owe them \nour support and we owe them our thanks.\n  I am hearing from a number of Hoosiers, as my colleague from Indiana \nhas, that they are tired of political gamesmanship, they are tired of \npaying taxes to a government that isn't listening or delivering for \nthem, and now we are in a situation where they are tired of our \ncareening toward these cliffs and shutdown. But when the Republican-\ncontrolled House sent over legislation to the Senate, calling for House \nand Senate leaders to conference together, to sit down in a room, talk \nthrough this problem and come to a solution, this good-faith effort was \nrejected out of hand by the Senate majority leader, Senator Reid of \nNevada.\n  We wanted to sit down and debate this issue. Once again, yet another \ngood-faith effort sent over by Republicans to help fund the essential \nfunctions of this government was dead on arrival in the Senate. The \nSenate majority leader, parroting the words of the President, said: We \nwill not negotiate. This was refusing to allow Republicans and \nDemocrats to try to find a way forward to resolve this issue and get \nour government functioning.\n  In the past when these things happened, Presidents, realizing that \nthey were elected to lead--we are elected to serve here, we are elected \nto serve the President, we are elected to serve the people we \nrepresent, but the President is elected to serve this country. When the \nPresident in the past has come up in a stalemate situation, there has \nbeen a reach out to the other side whenever we have a divided \ngovernment.\n  After 2008, when the Democrats won control of the House, the Senate, \nand the executive branch, they had total control. They pushed through a \nnumber of measures without any single Republican or opposition support. \nThose programs now we are dealing with, and ObamaCare is the primary \none that has brought us to this particular point. The lesson learned \nhere is when one party has total control without support from the \nopposition party, we end up with legislation that is dysfunctional, \nthat doesn't work, that reflects the ideology of one party and doesn't \nhave any balance to it. We are now in a position where we have a \ndivided government. What we would like is to have some say on how this \ngoes forward, to point out those things of this bill that are not \nworking, to point out the disaster this is turning out to be, the \ndysfunction of this particular legislation.\n  The point I am trying to make here is whatever the issue, whenever we \ncome to a stalemate, historically throughout the history of this \ncountry it is the Commander in Chief, the President, who has stepped \nforward and taken the initiative and said: We need to work together to \nsolve this. We can't impose our will on the body that the American \npeople has divided, giving control of one House to one party and \ncontrol of another House to another party.\n  Ronald Reagan reached out to Tip O'Neill, and some very significant \nmeasures, stalemates, were resolved because the President reached out \nand was willing to negotiate.\n  The Democratic President, Bill Clinton, reached out to a then-\nRepublican Speaker of the House in the 1990s, and we addressed a major \nissue with welfare reform, much-needed welfare reform. It couldn't have \nhappened without the President reaching out.\n  I could give other examples, but we are in another stalemate \nsituation. Yet what do we hear? No matter what Republicans send over, \nno matter what the offer is, if the offer is to let us sit down and \nconference this, the reaction from the Senate majority leader is: We \nrefuse to negotiate. The reaction from the White House and this \nPresident over and over and over again is: I will not negotiate.\n  Even though the American public sent you control of one House of \nCongress, even though the Constitution establishes the role of the \nCongress vis-a-vis the President, and calls for an agreement between \nthe two before we can move forward, this President, for whatever \nmotive, says: I will not negotiate.\n  We can do something right now to help Americans. We can come together \nto help fund important programs and departments that should not have \nbeen jeopardized because of this impasse. We can at least do that. If \nwe can't get the President to negotiate, can we not at least take some \nsteps forward for those essential functions of government?\n  Republicans have sent over nine such propositions and proposals. Each \none of them has been rejected, dead on arrival, not even allowed to \ndebate, and procedurally stopped by the majority leader.\n  Let me suggest four that are waiting in the wings and surely, for \nreasons of health and safety of Americans, surely we can agree to \nsupport these four and perhaps more. Some others have been suggested. \nSurely we have to conclude that this is an essential function. How it \nwas that they were declared nonessential is beyond me.\n  Let me mention the four: Honoring our veterans and the commitments \nthat we have made to them, providing for our national security, and \nprotecting Americans' health.\n  I spoke earlier this week on the Honoring Our Promise to America's \nVeterans Act, a bill providing funding for disability payments, the GI \nbill education training, and VA home loans under the same conditions \nthat were in place last year. The House passed this, but the Senate \nmajority leader has blocked it here.\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n  The House also passed the Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act. This bill \nprovides funding for the pay and allowances of military personnel in \nthe Reserve component and National Guard component who are scheduled to \nreport for duty as early as this weekend. Denying support for those who \nwear the uniform and stand ready and are engaged when called on, and \nhave been trained to do so, is a great disservice to the men and women \nwho have dedicated so much and put themselves at great risk to wear the \nuniform of the United States.\n  Secondly, funding the Department of Homeland Security. There are a \nnumber of ways our homeland security is impacted under the shutdown. \nOne of the impacts on FEMA--the Federal Emergency Management Agency--is \nthe need to be funded so they are prepared to respond to natural \ndisasters. We are only a breaking-news headline away from another \nnatural disaster or from some other need for FEMA to engage. Yet their \nemployees are furloughed and not in place to be ready to respond.\n  We have a tropical storm in the gulf right now that may turn into \nsomething dangerous. Our emergency response efforts to provide for our \nhomeland support is inadequately funded. Can we at least do that?\n  How about funding for our intelligence community? The House will send \nus Preserving Our Intelligence Capabilities Act, which will provide \nimmediate funding for personnel compensation and contracts for those \nindividuals who have been determined by the Director of National \nIntelligence as necessary to support critical intelligence activities \nand counterterrorism efforts.\n  Under the current shutdown, 70 percent of our civilian employees in \nour intelligence community have been sent home on furlough. Director of \nNational Intelligence Clapper said this lapse in funding our \nintelligence agency is a ``dreamland'' for our foreign intelligence \nadversaries.\n  Can we not at least, if we have a delay in resolving our issues \nhere--and we have that delay, as I said, because the Senate majority \nleader has not allowed us to sit down and work-- Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n  Can we not at least fund those agencies that are looking to protect \nus from terrorist acts, that are in place to keep the American people \nsafe? How can we reject that?\n  Finally, let me mention a fourth--and there are others, but let me \nmention this one. Fund Food and Drug Safety Programs, safety programs \nfor those who are in need of approvals for new drugs and new devices \nand who are experiencing significant delays because the Federal \nemployees at FDA who review these functions cannot report to work.\n  Madam President, frankly, I am perplexed why the majority leader \ncontinues to oppose even consideration and debate for individual \nfunding bills when they just agreed a couple of days ago to funding for \nour troops, and I applaud that and support that. But if we did that \nbecause of the essential nature of their function, shouldn't we also \ninclude these other items? Shouldn't we agree we need to fulfill our \ncommitments to guard and reserve and our intelligence community at this \ncritical time?\n  The House has already sent over nine proposals to the Senate for \nconsideration--nine--and nine times the Senate has had the opportunity \nto pass legislation to reopen our government and fund essential \nprograms, but the Senate majority leader chose not to do so and the \nPresident refuses to even engage.\n  A government shutdown is a pox on all our houses. We need to do what \nthe people of this great country elected us to do, and that is to work \nto find a solution to this government shutdown. How can we do that if \nthe Democratic chair at the negotiating table is empty? What we are \nlooking at here is a Clint Eastwood moment. We are looking at an empty \nchair. Mr. President, where are you?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I want to thank the Senator from Indiana for invoking the \nname of one of my favorite actors and directors. I would say to my \nfriend, I didn't think our friend Clint Eastwood's appearance at the \nRepublican National Convention was one of his finest moments, but it is \nwhat it is. It is nice to be with my colleague and to follow him on the \nfloor.\n  Madam President, if it were left up to the Senator from Indiana and \nthis Senator, as well as our colleagues here from North Dakota and \nRhode Island, I think we could probably work out a pretty good budget \ndeal in a fairly short period of time that raises some revenues through \ntax reform to reduce the deficit, reforms to the entitlement programs \nto save money and save the programs for the long haul, and to make sure \nwe don't savage old people and poor people. And while we are doing \nthat, probably we can change the culture of the Federal Government a \nlittle so that we focus even more--not on a culture of spendthrift but \non a culture of thrift.\n  Those are the things we need to do. And I am always happy to be with \nhim and happy to follow him. It is so nice to be with Senator Coats \ntoday.\n  Following up on what Senator Coats has been saying, it reminds me of \na phone conversation I had with a Delawarean today. She asked me: Why \ndon't we all just agree to what the Republicans are proposing and adopt \na couple of bills or amendments to fund some pieces of the government \nbut not many? And I said: Let's go back a little in time.\n  What I sought to do in that conversation was to explain, in pretty \nsimple, straightforward terms, how the budget process works here--how \nthe budget process works here--and where it has gone awry. We have had \na budget law since about 1974. The expectation of the Budget Act is \nthat the President, usually in January or February of every year, will \ngive a budget address. This is what the President and his or her \nadministration thinks we ought to do in terms of revenues, in terms of \nspending--what our priorities should be.\n  The expectation in the law is also that this body, the Senate, and \nthe House down the hall from here, will agree on a budget resolution \nsometime by, say late April of the year, for a budget starting October \n1 of that same year. For a number of years--about 4 years--we didn't do \nour job in terms of developing a budget resolution. It was difficult in \na divided Congress to do that. So for several years we didn't. \nRepublicans criticized us harshly for not having passed a budget. What \nthey were talking about was a budget resolution.\n  There is a difference between a budget and a budget resolution. In my \nhome State of Delaware, we have three budgets: An operating budget for \nthe State of Delaware, a capital budget for the State of Delaware, and \nsomething called grant and aid, which is something the legislature \ncares a lot about. It is only a couple of percentage points of all our \nrevenue. But there are actually three budgets. Here we have one, and it \nis a unified budget with capital and operating expenses thrown in \ntogether. But there is no real direct corollary between what we do here \nand what we do in most of our States.\n  Most States have an operating and a capital budget. Here we have a \nbudget resolution. The budget resolution is not a nitty-gritty line-\nitem budget. What it does is to set a framework for what is to follow--\nthe appropriations bills, roughly a dozen of them--and what we do on \nthe revenue side through the work of the Finance Committee here and the \nWays and Means Committee in the House.\n  The budget resolution says: This is roughly how much we are going to \nspend in these general areas, and this is roughly how much revenue we \nare going to raise from these general sources. That is a budget \nresolution. It is, if you will, a framework. I call it the skeleton. It \nis like a skeleton. Later on we have to come along and put the meat on \nthe bones.\n  The budget resolution is supposed to be adopted here by the end of \nApril. Usually the Senate will adopt one version, our version, and the \nHouse will adopt another version. We did that this year, by the end of \nApril, as I recall, and they were different. In our budget resolution \nwe did deficit reduction. We\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\ndidn't balance the budget over the next several years, but we continued \nto reduce the deficit. Remember, 4 years ago, the deficit peaked out at \n$1.4 trillion--$1.4 trillion. This last year that was just concluded we \ncut it by more than half, as I understand, and we expect it will be \nbrought down again further this year. Should we do better? Do we need \nto do better? Sure we do.\n  The budget resolution we passed here took a 50-50 approach; half the \ndeficit reduction for the next 10 years will be on the spending side \nand half will be on the revenue side. The budget resolution adopted by \nthe House of Representatives, as I recall, did nothing on the revenue \nside, nothing on the Defense side, as I recall, and basically took the \nsavings out of, for the most part, domestic discretionary spending. If \nwe set aside entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid--set aside Defense, and set aside interest payments, the whole \nrest of the budget--everything from agriculture to transportation, \neverything else--that is where they took the savings. And they reduced \nthat part of the budget from about 15 percent of all Federal spending \ndown to something close to 5 percent. That is not my vision of what \ngovernment should be about.\n\n  Anyway, we came to the end of April, and the Senate and House passed \ndifferent budget resolutions, and there was an effort here to go to \nconference--to create a conference committee and for us to send \nconferees. For people who might be watching and asking: What is he \ntalking about, a conference committee is like a compromise committee--\nsome Members of the House, some Members of the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, go to this committee we create for just a short period of \ntime to hammer out a compromise. In order to do that, somebody has to \ncome to the floor--usually the leader comes to the floor--to ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate appoint conferees, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to help create this conference committee and work out a \ncompromise.\n  That request was rejected. It was objected to. It has been objected \nto again and again and again, whether the person making the unanimous \nconsent to go to conference to work out this budget compromise--it has \nbeen made by Democrats or Republicans, at least one Republican. Senator \nMurray has made the request--she chairs the Budget Committee--close to \n20 times, and John McCain, a Republican, and Presidential candidate a \ncouple years ago, long-time friend and colleague, has made the request \nclose to 10 times. He wants to go to conference. He wants to solve the \nproblems. So do I, and I think most of us do.\n  The ways to do it are those things I talked about--entitlement \nreforms that save these programs, that save some money but don't savage \nold people or poor people; tax reform that generates, among other \nthings, some revenues that can be used for deficit reduction; and then \nto focus on everything we do. How do we get a better result for less \nmoney in everything we do?\n  Long story short, here we are. It is not the first of May, it is not \nthe first of June, not the first of July, and not the first of August \nor September. It is the first part of October, and we have yet to be \nable to get the unanimous consent to form that conference committee to \nwork out a compromise on the budget. That is where we have fallen \nshort. That is where we have fallen short.\n  We hear a lot about obstruction: The majority leader or the President \nwon't let us work with the Republicans on these piecemeal approaches. \nFor everybody here--and I love Dan Coats--but for everybody here in the \nSenate, we could all come up with our list of four. We could come up \nwith a list of 14 priorities. If you multiply that by 100, that would \nbe 1,400 priorities that ought to be in all this piece work, these \npiecemeal changes we are going to make to the spending for the next \ncouple of weeks or next couple of months.\n  Why don't we just do this. Why don't we agree to what the Speaker of \nthe House agreed to, and that is a spending level for a short period of \ntime--a continuing resolution, a spending plan, for a short period of \ntime--not for the whole year. In this case, we have been talking about \na continuing resolution, a short-term spending bill, that runs about 45 \ndays, until maybe the middle of November.\n  The level of that spending, we can argue about that. But what we \nended up doing is, our leader, Harry Reid, talking to John Boehner, \nSpeaker of the House--and he has a tough job. None of these jobs are \neasy, but they have really tough jobs. But our leader said to the \nSpeaker: What would be a level of spending for those 45 days or 60 days \nfor the short-term spending bill? What level of spending works for you? \nMy understanding is the Speaker vetted that with his folks over there \nand they came back and said: How about using the level of spending we \nare at for the last fiscal year, for 2013, and to fund for those 45 or \n60 days whatever is covered by the continuing resolution, funded at \nthat level for that period of time?\n  That is not our level. The Democratic level, to be honest, is not \n$986 billion, which is last year's level for discretionary spending. We \nwere more interested in something like, I would say not $986 billion \nbut about $1.05 trillion, something like that. Something like that, in \ntrillion dollars.\n  So about another $70 billion--that was our number. The House had \ntheir number. We agreed to the House number. We said: OK, we agree on \nthe number. Now let's figure out how long we are going to fund the \ngovernment at the same level as last year.\n  Then the ship ran aground.\n  Our friends over in the House said: That is not enough. We also want \nto defund Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act.\n  This is not like a proposed bill, this is a law. I was here in the \nFinance Committee when we debated it, amended it, argued it, reported \nit out, and here when we voted on it and then the President signed it. \nIt is law. The President ran for reelection on this and was reelected. \nWe pretend it was a landslide reelection. The electoral vote was fairly \nbig, but it was a reasonably close election. But he won, and he won \nfair and square. When you look at the Electoral College, he won by \nquite a bit.\n  It has been litigated in the courts. The Supreme Court looked at the \none area that some people think is unconstitutional; that is, the idea \nof having a so-called individual mandate. They said it is \nconstitutional. Where did we get the idea? We got it from \nMassachusetts. And who was the Governor that signed the Massachusetts \nlaw into effect? The Republican Presidential nominee, who then turned \naround and ran away from his own idea in the Presidential election last \nyear. I think there is some irony to that.\n  Then, on October 1, this week, what happened? I think some good news \nhappened, and the good news is there are 40 million people in our \ncountry who didn't have health care who had a chance to sign up for \nsomething new and different. It is not socialism, it is not communism, \nit is not government-run health care. It is a Republican idea called \nthe exchange, the health marketplace. And my understanding is that when \nHillaryCare was discarded in the early part the Clinton administration, \nthe Republican counterproposal to HillaryCare was something like a \nlarge purchasing pool, which in the health care exchange we call the \nmarketplace today.\n  On October 1, all over this country 40 million people who didn't have \nhealth care coverage had a chance to start signing up for health care \nin a large purchasing pool in their State, with a variety of options, \nhealth insurance companies competing with each other, driving down \ncosts--in my State, tens of thousands of people; States like Wisconsin, \nprobably hundreds of thousands of people; other States like North \nDakota, tens of thousands of people; but States like New York and \nCalifornia, millions of people who don't have health care coverage have \na chance to sign up there and take advantage of\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\ndriving down the price--competition among insurers--and also taking \nadvantage of economies of scale, driving down administrative costs as a \npercentage of premiums.\n  To buy health insurance in Delaware for families or maybe small \nbusinesses with five employees--we would pay a whole lot more money \nthan folks are going to pay on these exchanges, these large purchasing \npools. For one thing, the administrative costs are so high when you buy \nfor yourself or a small business; however, when you are buying health \ninsurance for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of \npeople, administrative costs are much lower. Competitive forces bring \ndown the prices as well.\n  Our friends in the other party want to pull the plug on the efforts \nof 40 million people to find health care coverage for themselves. I \nthink that is wrong. It is the law of the land. It is a done deal. It \nhas been litigated. It is going to be with us. And I think some of our \nRepublican friends are not afraid that it is not going to work; I think \nmaybe they are concerned that it is going to work and it is going to \nactually meet the needs of people.\n  Abraham Lincoln, when talking about the role of government, would \nsay: The role of government is to do for people what they cannot do for \nthemselves.\n  The chamber of commerce in Sussex County in southern Delaware--a \nrural area--tried to set up a purchasing pool and couldn't do it. They \ntried it 10 years ago.\n  Another guy, David Osborne, in the book ``Reinventing Government,'' \ndescribed the role of government and said the role of government is to \nsteer the boat, not row the boat. And the exchanges are really that. \nThe idea is to create large purchasing pools, a partnership between the \nState and the Federal Government in many States, Delaware and others, \nbut to then let the private sector do its job. These are great examples \nof government steering the boat and the private sector and other \nproviders rowing the boat.\n  I would like to close with this: People say we ought to change \nObamaCare, we ought to change the Affordable Care Act, make significant \nchanges to it. I agree. And the President already made one big change 1 \nmonth or so ago when he announced that the employer mandate was going \nto be delayed for a whole year to give us a chance to stand up the \nexchanges, make sure they are working, and then to revisit this issue \nof the employer mandate. The coverage, if you have more than 50 \nemployees--a year from now it will be more than 100 employees they have \nto cover, I think, but at least more than 50.\n  Some people say we have to change it right now. I want to go back in \ntime 6, 8 years. We debated on this floor the issue of prescription \ndrugs. Should we have a prescription drug program for Medicare? Most \npeople said we should have had it when we created Medicare in 1965. If \nwe could have done as much then with pharmaceuticals as we can do now, \nit would have been a no-brainer. Prescription drug coverage would have \nbeen part of Medicare since its inception. But it wasn't until about \n2005 that we actually got to a place where we had some agreement that \nthis is what we ought to do. Ted Kennedy and the Democrats had one idea \nhow to do it, and some of our Republican friends--certainly President \nBush--had another one. We ended up with sort of a hybrid--a little more \nlike President George W. Bush's idea--and a lot of our Democrats \nobjected. They didn't say: We are going to shut down the government \nbecause we didn't get our way or because we didn't get our specific \nprescription drug program. They said: Why don't we figure out how to \nmake it better?\n  Almost everybody has heard of the doughnut hole with respect to the \nMedicare prescription drug program. The way the original program worked \nis the first $2,000 of pharmaceuticals for a person in Medicare Part \nD--Medicare paid about 75 percent of the cost. If they used over $6,000 \nof prescription medicine a year, Medicare paid about 95 percent of the \ncost, everything over $6,000. But roughly between $3,000 and $6,000--\nwhen the program was introduced and for its first half dozen or so \nyears, if you were between $3,000 and $6,000 roughly in prescription \nmedicine purchases, you got nothing from Medicare. It was all on you.\n  When we did the Affordable Care Act, as our friends from Rhode Island \nand North Dakota know, we started filling the doughnut hole. Now, if \nyou happen to be in that gap between $3,000 and $6,000, Medicare pays \nover half and will eventually pay 75 percent. That is the way we took a \ngood program--Medicare Part D--and we made it better, and we can do \nthat with the Affordable Care Act, and we will.\n  For our Republican friends, our friend Winston Churchill once had a \ngreat quote. He used to say: You can always count on Americans to do \nthe right thing in the end, after they have tried everything else.\n  This is a tough time. I feel especially bad for those Federal \nemployees across the country who have been furloughed. We are going to \nbring you back, I hope, this month. My hope and belief is that we will \nbring you back and make sure you are made financially whole.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues, the next time, whether it is John \nMcCain or Patty Murray or somebody else who asks unanimous consent to \ngo to conference and work out a real budget agreement, don't object. \nLet's accept that and get on with the work that lies ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, yesterday was a scary day on Capitol \nHill. I was sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair and saw the bells \nring, saw all the Capitol Police hustle our great pages in to protect \nthem. Senator McCain was speaking, and like the veteran he is he \ncontinued to make his impassioned plea for help for the Syrian \nopposition as things swirled around. For members of our staff and \nMembers of the Senate and the House and all the tourists and the \nvisitors, I think the only thing that stood at that moment between them \nand potential harm was the Capitol Police and the Secret Service. I was \nstruck by that.\n  As a former attorney general who actually ran a law enforcement \nagency, I have a lot of great relationships with law enforcement \npeople. In fact, I lost two officers in the line of duty during my \ntenure as attorney general, and I know the sacrifices, I know the fears \nof the families, and I know that every day, regardless of what is going \non, some average, ordinary beautiful day can turn into a catastrophe \nwhere an officer loses their life.\n  As we were standing there, I was visiting with one of the officers \nwho was protecting the pages, and she told me a story. She told me a \nstory about a uniformed Capitol Police officer who told her that \nmorning that he has a stay-at-home wife and she is raising their \nchildren, and he has $115 in his checking account and doesn't know how \nhe is going to get through this time period to the next paycheck. Even \nthough they are here and some of them are working overtime, they are \nhere without a paycheck and potentially might not receive a paycheck.\n  So today we wear these buttons that say ``thank you.'' And I think \nabout the hypocrisy of that. I think about the hypocrisy of buttons and \ngalas and ribbons and all, and I want to say it is time for the \nCongress to not just pass out buttons that say ``thank you'' but pass \nout paychecks. That matters more. That is a real thank-you. That is \nreal recognition of the value of those services.\n  So it was with great outrage that I left this body last night as we \nwere working through the challenges, and I realized the great humor of \nthe Capitol Police. I was leaving the building and visiting with my \nguys at the door. He was giving me a hard time, and I said: I want to \nthank you for being here every day. I want to thank you for your \nsacrifice. I want to thank you for the trauma your family goes through. \nAnd he said: Just think how good I would be if you actually paid me.\n  So I wish to say to all of my friends in the Capitol Police, who have \nbeen really truly friends--on some days I feel as if the only friendly \nface I see--that we care deeply. But it is not enough to wear a button. \nWe have to start solving the problem of this impasse. We have to start \nrecognizing that all of our people, all of our employees in the Federal \nGovernment--we have heard all day here this laundry list of let's do \nthis and let's do this. I think we are up to 9, 10, and they are \nbuilding, they are growing each one of\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\nthese lists. There should be some point when we get to the tipping \npoint where we realize that all of the functions are important. \nEverybody who is out there working is important, is essential, and the \nbest way forward is to fund government.\n  I want to build on what Senator Carper has been talking about because \nI think it is so important. I probably was sitting in the chair the \nfirst time this happened. As most of you know, I am new to the Senate \nand new to these procedures. And Senator Murray, chair of the Budget \nCommittee, came out and she asked to appoint a budget conference \ncommittee. I know this process fairly well. You get the big targets, \nand then they get passed down to the appropriators, who then build the \nbudget within those guidelines. And the Senator from Texas stood and \nobjected. I thought, why would you object to the appointment of a \nconference committee with the House and with Representative Ryan, who \nhas been a staunch conservative and a staunch proponent of targets that \nI would think the Senator from Texas agreed to? There was this long \nback-and-forth, and then Senator Murray sat down and that was the end \nof it. I was perplexed. I thought, well, when do we get to vote on this \nconference committee? When do we get to kind of tell her it is OK \nbecause there are a whole lot of people in this place who agree that we \nshould go to conference--only to find out there is something called \nunanimous consent.\n  The same people who have brought us to the brink of triggering a \nresult of a slowdown in our economy with this behavior also have \nstopped the compromise. Now, adding to the hypocrisy of the day, we \nhave the same claim for ``let's compromise.'' The easy compromise here \nis when Senator Murray comes to the floor and asks for a conference \ncommittee, we all agree to start doing it, we all agree to start doing \nour job.\n  There has been a lot of attention on the so-called tea party shutdown \nand the tea party faction and calling them out and saying: You are a \nminority. But I would like to take a different tactic this afternoon, \nand I want to challenge the good people in the House Republican caucus \nwho have already recognized that the best thing to do would be to pass \na clean CR. I want to say I know what it is like to take a tough vote \nthat your party doesn't agree with. I know what it is like to feel as \nthough you have let people down who are part of a group that is helping \nand moving things along and that represents, kind of, your team to some \ndegree. I know what that is like. I have been there and I know it \ndoesn't feel good. But I know at the end of the day doing the right \nthing for what you believe your State believes in is a better feeling.\n\n  I am suggesting maybe the minority, the minority of the majority that \nhas an opportunity to step forward and take on this challenge and do \nthe right thing, are those folks who know this is wrong, those folks \nwho know over there that we could do better, that we have an \nopportunity to end this nonsense and move forward.\n  There is a procedure for doing this, as I understand it. I want to \nspeak to those folks who I think are good-hearted, who understand the \nimpact on families, on children, on our Native Americans. I could tell \nyou horror stories right now, where we are looking at a snowstorm in \nNorth Dakota and many of our native families rely on fuel assistance. \nThe people who do that are not on the job. How are they going to heat \ntheir houses in the middle of this snowstorm? This is life and death. I \ndo not see a special provision coming across for those folks.\n  That is the problem when you piecemeal this. I think there are good \npeople in the House Republican caucus who know that. If there is a way \nthat they can in fact step forward, there will not be a lot of floor \nglory in their caucus. Trust me, I know. There won't be a lot of pats \non the back and it might be pretty chilly for a long time. But you will \nhave your conscience clear knowing that you did the right thing.\n  I am hopeful we can get good people to step forward, to stand up to \nbehavior that can only be described in some ways--it has been talked \nabout as hostage-taking here. It is really bullying behavior when the \nsmall minority does this.\n  Let's step forward. Let's do the right thing. I challenge you to do \nthe right thing on behalf of the Native Americans, on behalf of my \nsheriff from Fargo, who was sent home from Quantico, the premier \ntraining facility. He waited years and years to be in the queue to get \nthat training and now has been sent home. On behalf of law enforcement, \non behalf of the Capitol Police, where we, yes, honor them today by \nwearing these buttons, let's honor them more by passing out paychecks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I join my former attorney general \ncolleague, Senator Heitkamp, in expressing all of our appreciation for \nwhat the Capitol Police did. We all know when that event transpired, \nour job was to go and hunker down, stay away from windows where we \nmight be a target, and keep out of the way and not add to the \ndifficulty or confusion. They had a much tougher job. Their job was to \ngo to the danger and keep the United States Capitol safe. They did \ntheir duty and they did it well.\n  It is now incumbent upon us to do our duty and that is to get rid of \nthe tea party shutdown. We are now in tea party shutdown day 4. I have \nbeen watching this debate as it transpired on the floor and I have been \nparticipating a little bit in it. I have heard some interesting \ncomments that have been made out here.\n  The first one is the suggestion that this is not a tea party \nshutdown. They say it is not a tea party shutdown, but the tea party \nwarned of it, the tea party wanted it, the tea party is cheering it, \nand the tea party says they are profiting from it, that it is a big \nsuccess.\n  When did the tea party warn of it? One example is when Lynn \nWestmoreland, the Republican from Georgia, long before this all began, \ntold the Faith and Freedom Coalition:\n\n       This is what we are going to do. If the Government shuts \n     down we want you with us.\n\n  The tea party wanted it.\n  Joe Walsh, Republican of Illinois:\n\n       Most people in my district say shut it down.\n\n  Representative Jack Kingston told reporters that his Georgia \nconstituents would rather have a shutdown than ObamaCare.\n  Representative Tim Huelskamp said:\n\n       If you say government is going to shut down my constituents \n     say, OK, which part can we shut down?\n\n  The tea party not only warned of it and wanted it, but they are \ncheering it.\n  Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, said this:\n\n       We are very excited. It's exactly what we wanted, and we \n     got it.\n\n  She pointed out in another quote:\n\n       This is about the happiest I have seen members in a long \n     time.\n\n  How happy are the tea partyers about the tea party shutdown? Here is \nwhat Republican Representative Devin Nunes said: ``They are all giddy \nabout it.''\n  The dictionary definitions of ``giddy'' say, ``feeling or showing \ngreat happiness and joy. Joyfully elated, euphoric.'' ``Giddy'' also \nmeans ``lightheartedly, silly'' or ``dizzy'' and ``disoriented,'' but \nthat is another story.\n  Elated, giddy, exactly what we wanted--now they say they are \nprofiting from it. Here is GOP cheerleader John Tamny, in Forbes \nmagazine. I am quoting.\n\n       Republican politicians and members of the Party should \n     cheer. . . . The Republican Party . . . decision to allow a \n     shutdown of the federal government--\n\n  and get this--\n\n     and to ideally allow it to remain shut through the 2014 \n     elections . . . is . . . good politics.\n\n  I will say that again:\n\n       Republican politicians and members of the Party should \n     cheer. . . . The Republican Party . . . decision to allow a \n     shutdown of the federal government and to ideally allow it to \n     remain shut through the 2014 elections . . . is . . . good \n     politics.\n\n  Echoing that sentiment we had our colleague Senator Rand Paul the \nother day say, ``We're going to win this, I think.''\n  So the tea party warned of the tea party shutdown, the tea party \nwanted the tea party shutdown, the tea party is cheering the tea party \nshutdown. They are so happy that they are giddy. And they are claiming \nthat their tea\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\nparty shutdown is a big success. It is a little late now to say, well, \nit is really not our tea party shutdown.\n  I have also heard colleagues come to the floor and say nothing they \nare doing is extremist. It is not extremist to shut down the government \nand make the demands they are making. One dictionary definition for \nextremist is ``one who advocates or resorts to measures beyond the \nnorm, especially in politics.''\n  I would say that shutting down the U.S. Government is beyond the \nnorm, even in politics. I would say refusing to ever allow a vote on a \nSenate-passed bill under the constitutional procedures that prevail \nbetween our Houses is beyond the norm. And I would say that \ndeliberately putting hundreds of thousands of people who serve our \ncountry out of work is beyond the norm.\n  The norm would be for them to vote on our Senate bill over in the \nHouse. Over and over we in the Senate have voted on their House \nmeasures. We voted to strip out the extraneous measure and send back \nthe continuing resolution. We voted to table. We followed the \nConstitution, we have done our duty, and we have voted. They in the \nHouse may not like that they do not win the Senate vote, but we did our \nduty in the Senate and have repeatedly voted on House measures.\n  Over in the House they have not yet once voted on the Senate measure. \nIt is sitting on the Speaker's desk without ever a single vote. If the \nSpeaker called up the Senate measure and allowed a vote over there in \nthe House, it would pass and the tea party shutdown would be over. But, \nremember, who wants this shutdown in order to use it for bargaining \nleverage? The giddy folks, the folks who are so happy they have caused \nthis, the folks who think this is good politics.\n\n  I think it is safe to say they are extremists, both by the dictionary \ndefinition and in their disregard of our traditional back and forth, \none House voting on the other House's measure.\n  Last, and this one is particularly rich, they say we won't negotiate. \nLet's remember that this all began with a deal negotiated between the \nSpeaker and the majority leader that we pass a clean continuing \nresolution funding the government. What did the Speaker get out of that \ndeal? We agreed to fund the government at the Speaker's level. He \nactually won that negotiation. That was what was negotiated. But the \nSpeaker did not honor the deal.\n  As I say, it is rich that we negotiate, we give the Speaker the \nfunding level he wants, then he breaks the deal and now claims we won't \nnegotiate.\n  One of my colleagues came to the floor a little while ago and he \ncalled to mind the radio commentator Paul Harvey. Paul Harvey used to \nhave his catchphrase in his radio broadcast, ``and now for the rest of \nthe story.'' And he talked about the rest of the story. The President \nhas made his position very clear. It is: We will not negotiate while \nyou are holding hostages. Open the government and we will negotiate \nabout everything and anything. But we will not negotiate while you are \nholding hostages.\n  All the Republicans report in this Chamber is the first part: We will \nnot negotiate. It is not a question of the rest of the story, how about \nthe rest of the sentence? We will not negotiate while you are holding \nhostages. Remember that 19 times we have tried to appoint conferees to \nnegotiate a budget between the Senate and the House and every time, the \ntea party extremists have stopped us. Let's remember that they do not \nwant to negotiate. They want to negotiate with hostages. That is a very \ndifferent thing. They want to negotiate with hostages, hundreds of \nthousands of people who serve our country whom they are using as \nhostages and will not let go back to work and earn their living. That \nis not just negotiation. There is something more than just negotiation \ngoing on when it involves hostages or other threats.\n  Every mom whose 4-year-old is having a tantrum over not getting what \nthey want knows that is not just negotiation. Every 12-year-old picked \non by the school bully in the school playground knows that is not just \nnegotiation. And every businessman who is asked to pay protection money \nknows that is not just negotiation. There is something else going on. \nOrdinary Americans get the difference between negotiating in good \nfaith, the way we have to if we had appointed conferees and went to \nhave an actual conference between the House and the Senate about our \nbudget, the way the rules in the Constitution propose, and negotiating \nwith a threat or negotiating while holding hostages.\n  We are not going to negotiate while you are holding hostages. There \nare two parts to that sentence.\n  May I have 1 minute to conclude? I see Senator Portman has arrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader said publicly he will negotiate on anything and \neverything as soon as the hostages are released and the tea party \nshutdown has ended. To now blame the majority leader for this tea party \nshutdown reminds me of when President Lincoln was put in such a \nposition. When President Lincoln was accused of the very thing he was \ntrying to prevent, he said:\n\n       That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and \n     mutters through his teeth: ``Stand and deliver, or I shall \n     kill you, and then you will be a murderer!''\n\n  That was Abraham Lincoln.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam chair, we find ourselves here in Washington with \nthe government shutdown in place and a debt limit approaching, and I \nread this morning in the newspaper that a senior White House official \nhas said with regard to the shutdown, ``We are winning . . . It doesn't \nreally matter to us'' how long it lasts.\n  That is not the right attitude. Today I call upon the White House to \nstop the political posturing, to come to the table so we can find \ncommon ground and end this government shutdown and negotiate something \nsensible on the debt limit. This notion that a senior White House \nofficial would say, ``We are winning . . . It doesn't really matter to \nus'' how long it lasts, shows that it is politics, not substance that \nmatters.\n  It may not matter to the White House how long it lasts, by the way, \nbut it does matter to the American people because they expect us to \nfulfill our constitutional duties, to get our work done, and not to \ntake America to the brink. They expect us to do the job that we were \nsent here to do.\n  It matters, by the way, to a lot of Americans because they are being \naffected by it. There are 8,700 civilian employees at Wright-Patterson \nAir Force Base outside of Dayton, OH, who are being affected. It \nmatters to the roughly 1,800 Ohio National Guardsmen across the State \nof Ohio who have been furloughed.\n  We can stand here and point fingers at each other as to how we got \nhere. The truth is that how we got here is we didn't do our work. The \nfact that we have a continuing resolution at all, which is a \ncontinuation of funding from last fiscal year, is a mark of failure. It \nis a mark of failure because it means that the Congress didn't do the \nappropriations bills that it was supposed to do. There are 12 of them, \nand the idea is that Congress sits down and has hearings about the \ndepartments and agencies to provide proper oversight to the Federal \nGovernment, and then they put together appropriations bills in 12 \ndifferent areas. That hasn't happened. Congress did not pass these \nappropriations bills in an orderly way. If they did, there would not be \na continuing resolution.\n  We can talk about the fact that over the last 4 years, under the \nleadership of the majority in the Senate, we have passed exactly 1 \nappropriations bill out of 48, on time--1 out of 48. That was the \nmilitary construction bill. I think it was in about 2011. That should \nbe a relatively easy one to pass.\n  The House has done better. They have passed more appropriations \nbills, and they passed a budget consistently every year. This year--in \nthe fourth year after 3 years of no budget--the Senate did pass a \nbudget, and I applaud the Senate for that. I do support going to \nconference with those budgets, but the fact is that Congress has not \ndone its work, and that is why we are here. Only 1 appropriations bill \nout of 48 in the last 4 years has passed this Senate on time--one.\n  There is another way to get around this, and we can talk about that. \nThere is legislation called the end government shutdown bill, which \nsimply continues funding from year to year. If we\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\nget to September 30, and any appropriations bill is not done, it says \nwe will have the same level of funding as the previous year, except \nafter 120 days there is a 1 percent reduction in funding, and after \nanother 90 days, there is another 1 percent reduction in funding, and \nso on. The reason is to encourage the appropriators to meet and get \ntheir work done, so we put a little inducement in there.\n  That legislation is bipartisan. We voted on that legislation in the \nChamber earlier this year. It was supported by 46 of the 100 members. \nIt was supported by every Republican except for two, and it was \nsupported by three Democrats. It is my legislation, and we tried to \nbring this up as an amendment last week on the continuing resolution. \nIt would have made all the sense in the world. Instead of us having \nthis discussion we are having now in the context of a government \nshutdown, if we had passed the end government shutdown amendment to the \nCR last week, we would continue funding from last year knowing it would \nbe reduced by 1 percent in 120 days, which gives us plenty of time to \nget the appropriations together, and then another 1 percent after 90 \ndays, and another 1 percent after the next 90 days.\n  We wouldn't be sitting here today in the situation of a government \nshutdown had we passed that. The majority refused to allow that \namendment to even come up for a vote. I don't know if we could have \npassed it or not. Again, 46 of us supported it last time. My sense is, \ngiven the fact that we were heading toward a government shutdown, we \ncould have gotten a majority of this body to support that. But we don't \nknow because, as is the case so often, the leadership here blocks \namendments, so we never had the opportunity to have our voices be heard \nas Senators.\n  Without a doubt, there is plenty of blame to go around, but whatever \nbrought us to this point, it is where we are. I can promise this: As \nlong as the White House and the majority in this Chamber continue to \nrefuse to talk about it and negotiate, and as long as they refuse to \nattempt to find common ground--any common ground--we are not going to \nmake progress. As long as they treat it as a political opportunity, one \nto score political points, then we are not going to be able to move \nforward. It is a failure of leadership because governing is about \ntalking, negotiating, discussing, debating, and then finding common \nground. It is hard, but it is what we are hired to do.\n  We talk a lot in this Chamber about this notion of finding common \nground, and I support it strongly. We don't do it enough. But to find \ncommon ground, you have to step off your own territory and on to some \nterritory in the middle, and that requires negotiations. It requires \nsitting down with both parties and talking. It is what the American \npeople, by the way, want us to do. They do it in their lives every day. \nWe do it in our marriages and in our businesses. Yet, there is this \nunbelievable quote from this morning that I talked about by some senior \nofficial at the White House saying, ``We are winning . . . It doesn't \nmatter to us'' how long it lasts.\n  We have legislation coming over from the House to this Chamber that \nsays: Let's have a conference. That is the conference between the House \nand the Senate. So there is a formal process where we have conferees \nover here--people to represent the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, \nand to represent the House, Republican and Democratic conferees. They \ncome together and discuss, in this case, the continuing resolution and \nthe debt limit, and that was tabled here. In other words, the majority \nhere did not want to move to conference, so they blocked it. To me that \nseems to be the wrong approach. Let's have a conference and a \ndiscussion.\n\n  By the way, this is on top of a hard-line position the President has \ntaken, and I have talked about this over the last month because the \nPresident has been saying it for the last month. He has refused to talk \nabout or negotiate on the debt limit. That is coming up in only a \ncouple of weeks. As important as the government shutdown debate is, in \nmy view, the debt limit discussion is even more important because it \nputs our country's economy at risk.\n  I don't think we should be taking a position on anything if we don't \ntalk, but certainly not on the debt limit discussion. The irony, which \nhas been pointed out by others, is that we have a President of the \nUnited States who says he will negotiate with President Putin of \nRussia, but he will not talk with the Speaker of the House who is in \nthe other party. To me it is irresponsible. It is a failure of \nleadership, and I don't think it is sustainable. I hope it is not.\n  By the way, the President has said he refuses to talk about the debt \nlimit because we should just extend the debt limit without any \npreconditions, without any reduction in spending, without even any \ndiscussion of what should go along with a debt limit extension. That, \nmy friends, is not consistent with the historical precedent either. \nEvery President, Republican and Democrat alike, has engaged in \nnegotiations and discussions about the debt limit, in part, frankly, \nbecause the debt limit is a hard vote. The folks I represent back home \nget it. For them it is kind of like the credit card. Their deal is: OK, \nCongress has once again gone over their limit on their credit card.\n  I have to be careful which credit card I hold up. I am not \nadvertising for any particular one. This happens to be a MasterCard.\n  They are saying: Before you guys extend the limit on the credit card, \nlet's deal with the underlying problem. It's kind of like if your \nteenager puts you, as a parent, in a position of having gone over the \nline on the credit card. We have teenagers here who I am sure have \nnever done that. Your parents would probably say, after they rip up the \ncredit card, let's get at the underlying problem, which is the spending \nproblem. Why are we spending more than we are taking in to the point we \nhave to keep extending the limit on this credit card?\n  The American people get it. That is why every President--Republicans \nand Democrats alike--has had to come to Congress and say: OK, how are \nwe going to work together to extend this debt limit while also dealing \nwith the underlying problem, which is the fact that we are spending too \nmuch? But this President refuses to do it.\n  I have gone back and looked. For the last 3 decades the debt limit \ndiscussion is the only thing that has led to Congress doing anything \nsubstantial on spending. This is a period at which Congress has \nconsistently spent more than it has taken in. Congress and the \nPresidents--Republican and Democrat alike--have led the country into \ndeficits and debt. We are now at historic levels. This year the debt is \njust under $17 trillion. We are in uncharted territory. This year it is \nhigher than ever. Yet this President is saying, unlike other \nPresidents, that he refuses to even talk about it.\n  I will tell you what has happened. Over the last 30 years, every \nsubstantial deficit reduction has come in the context of a debt limit \ndebate. Some may remember Gramm-Rudman back in the 1980s. It was \nconsidered historic legislation at the time, when we had smaller \ndeficits and a much smaller debt. But it provided rescissions--across-\nthe-board spending cuts. It was bipartisan. It came out of a debt limit \ndiscussion.\n  In 1990, when President George H.W. Bush, the first President Bush, \nwent out to Andrews Air Force Base, with Republicans and Democrats \nalike, to negotiate a budget agreement, it was in the context of a debt \nlimit discussion. The pay-go rules that many Democrats now talk about \nfavorably came out of the discussion about the debt limit.\n  The 1997 balanced budget agreement with Newt Gingrich and Bill \nClinton that ended up leading to the balanced budget we got a couple of \nyears later came out of a discussion about the debt limit. Most \nrecently, of course, the Budget Control Act came out of a discussion \nabout the debt limit.\n  So this notion that Presidents never talk about or negotiate on the \ndebt limit is just not accurate in terms of our history. In fact, just \nthe opposite is true. It is the only time we have been able to reduce \nspending.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader is on the floor, so I will be \nshort.\n  We need to figure out how to come together. The President needs to \nengage. It is time to govern. If the President refuses to talk, we will \nnot be able to come to an agreement. If he does engage, as history has \nshown us, tough decisions can be made.\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\n  I have gone through a litany of times when we have done it. I have \nalso talked about the fact that this year we have a bigger debt than \never, a bigger deficit than any of those historical examples I gave. \nTherefore, there is a greater need than ever for us to come together \nand find that common ground.\n  Mr. WICKER. If the Senator would yield for a moment. I think the \ndistinguished majority leader is going to make a procedural motion \nwhich will take only a moment, and then I have a question for my \ndistinguished friend from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I will be happy to yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7206-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7206-S7207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the period \nfor morning business be extended until 5 p.m., and that all the \nprovisions under the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate my two friends for yielding \nfor this consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, as far as I am concerned, my \ndistinguished friend from Ohio can still have the floor. I only wanted \nto take a moment to congratulate him on his remarks and to observe that \nwhen it comes to budget matters, he knows whereof he speaks. He not \nonly has a distinguished record in the House of Representatives, but he \nis a leader in being a budget hawk and was an opponent of additional \ndebt in the House of Representatives, and has had a distinguished \ncareer in the Office of Management and Budget. So I thank the \ndistinguished Senator.\n\n  It may be that he has already asked for an opinion piece from today's \nWall Street Journal to be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I have not.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record at this time an opinion piece written by Kevin Hassett \nand Abby McCloskey on page 23 in today's Wall Street Journal entitled \n``Obama Rewrites Debt-Limit History.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 3, 2013]\n\n                   Obama Rewrites Debt-Limit History\n\n                 (By Kevin Hassett and Abby McCloskey)\n\n       As the government shutdown continues, the nation gets \n     closer and closer to the day--probably Oct. 17--when \n     Washington hits the debt limit, and with it the specter of \n     default. President Obama may be getting nervous about what \n     will happen to his negotiating position as that day \n     approaches.\n       He keeps asserting that the debt limit has never been used \n     ``to extort a president or a government party.'' Treasury \n     Secretary Jack Lew is selling the same story, saying ``until \n     very recently, Congress typically raised the debt ceiling on \n     a routine basis . . . the threat of default was not a \n     bargaining chip in the negotiations.''\n       This is simply untrue. Consider the shenanigans of \n     congressional Democrats in 1989 over Medicare's catastrophic \n     health coverage provision.\n       In this case, the problem was political infighting within \n     the Democratic Party between the House and the Senate. \n     ``Weeks of political maneuvering brought the government to \n     the brink of financial default,'' the New York Times wrote on \n     Nov. 8 of that year. The debt limit was raised just hours \n     before all extraordinary measures to avoid default were \n     exhausted. The final bill dropped any action on Medicare but \n     included a measure to repeal 1986 tax rules barring \n     discrimination in employer-paid health insurance plans.\n       The Obama administration's campaign to make the debt limit \n     appear non-negotiable might reflect concern that Republican \n     congressional strategy might actually work. Six out of 10 \n     Americans say ``it is right to require spending cuts when the \n     debt ceiling is raised, even if it risks default,'' according \n     to a Sept. 26 Bloomberg poll. (Only 28% say ``the debt \n     ceiling should be raised when necessary, with no \n     conditions.'')\n       One thing is certain: The debt limit has been a powerful \n     negotiating tool in the last several decades. It has enabled \n     the passage of important additional legislation.\n       According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress \n     voted 53 times from 1978 to 2013 to change the debt ceiling. \n     The debt ceiling has increased to about $16 trillion from \n     $752 billion. Of these 53 votes, 29 occurred in a Congress \n     run by Democrats, 17 in a split Congress, and seven in a \n     Republican-controlled Congress.\n       While large increases that give the U.S. Treasury a healthy \n     amount of borrowing space happen occasionally, small short-\n     term increases are common. In 1990 alone, while Republican \n     George H.W. Bush was in the White House, a Democratic-\n     controlled Congress voted to increase the debt limit seven \n     times.\n       Congressional Republicans who want legislative conditions \n     in exchange for a debt-limit increase are following a \n     strategy that has been pursued by both parties the majority \n     of the time. Of the 53 increases in the debt limit, 26 were \n     ``clean''--that is, stand-alone, no strings-attached \n     statutes. The remaining debt-limit increases were part of an \n     omnibus package of other legislative bills or a continuing \n     resolution. Other times, the limit was paired with reforms, \n     only some of which were related to the budget.\n       In 1979, a Democratic Congress increased the debt limit but \n     required Congress and the president to present balanced \n     budgets for fiscal years 1981 and 1982. In 1980 the debt \n     limit, again increased by a Democratic Congress, included \n     repeal of an oil-import fee. In 1985, the debt limit that was \n     raised by a divided Congress included a cigarette tax and a \n     provision requiring Congress to pursue an alternative minimum \n     corporate tax in the next year.\n       Most recently, a divided Congress that passed the 2011 \n     debt-limit increase included the Budget Control Act which \n     aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.4 trillion over 10 years \n     and included the automatic budget sequester that kicked in on \n     Jan. 1.\n       As the finger pointing begins, it is important to keep this \n     history in mind. All told, congressional Democrats have been \n     responsible for 60% of the ``dirty'' increases when the debt \n     limit was raised alongside other legislative items. \n     Republicans were responsible for 15%. The remaining 25% \n     occurred during divided Congresses.\n       Of the Democratic dirties, six occurred when Democrats also \n     controlled the White House, and 10 occurred when a Republican \n     controlled the White House. For Republicans, all four \n     occurred while a Democrat held the presidency.\n       Debt-limit votes often have been contentious, but on the \n     whole they serve an important function. First, they force \n     painful votes by legislators who would prefer to offer \n     supporters free lunches through unfunded spending programs. \n     Without these votes, politicians of both parties would have a \n     significantly easier time ignoring fiscal discipline.\n       Second, debt-limit votes have provided a regular vehicle \n     for legislation. Divided governments have a difficult time \n     passing anything. Since the consequences of government \n     default are so severe, debt-limit legislation has always \n     passed in the end, and it has often included important \n     additional legislative accomplishments.\n       Third, the debt limit has provided significant leverage to \n     the minority party and has been a check on the power of the \n     presidency.\n       Republicans today are playing a role that has been played \n     many times. While the debt-limit kabuki inevitably roils \n     markets as deadlines approach, the alternative absence of \n     fiscal discipline would make government insolvency more \n     probable in the fullness of time.\n       Trying to separate ObamaCare from the debt limit, President \n     Obama has asserted that his health law has ``nothing to do \n     with the budget.'' His argument is eagerly echoed by an at-\n     best ignorant media. The Affordable Care Act was passed under \n     ``reconciliation''--a legislative process that is used only \n     for budget measures and which limits congressional debate.\n       The notion that legislation passed as part of a budget \n     might be reconsidered as part of subsequent budget \n     legislation should be uncontroversial. Perhaps that is why \n     the administration has staked so much on its \n     misrepresentation of history.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  This article points out in a very detailed and annotated way a number \nof times when this Congress has made policy changes, important, far-\nreaching policy changes, in connection with negotiations on the debt \nceiling increase.\n  So I join my friend from Ohio in saying it is absolutely incumbent on \nthis Senate--Republicans and our friends on the Democratic side of the \naisle--as well as Members of the House of Representatives and the \nPresident of the United States, our Commander in Chief, to, once again, \nnegotiate in good faith.\n  The President may feel we are entirely unreasonable in our position. \nFrankly, there have been times during my 19 years in the House and now \nin the Senate when I felt the Chief Executive was completely wrong in \nhis viewpoint on how we should address our national debt. But at no \ntime in my recollection have the parties been simply unwilling to sit \ndown and talk at all or to have meetings in the White House and in \nthose meetings to basically say we are not going to make \ncounterproposals or to say publicly: Why should I offer them anything \nat all? I think the American people see that is an unworkable approach.\n  So I point out to my colleagues, and I thank the Senator from Ohio in\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\npointing out that very important fiscal decisions, very important debt-\nrelated decisions have absolutely been made in our Nation's history, \nand I am glad they have been made in connection with this debate on the \nnational debt.\n  I yield back to my friend from Ohio and thank him for allowing me to \nintrude on his time.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, if the Senator will hold for a moment, \nfirst, I thank the Senator for referring to the op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal. I have not seen it yet so I look forward to reading it \nmyself. It sounds as though it is consistent with what I was pointing \nout, which is it would only make sense that the American people would \nwant us to reduce spending when we extend the debt limit yet again--\nagain, at historic levels now. The American people get it. They know we \ncan't keep spending more than we take in, so they expect us to do \nsomething about the underlying problem.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, the Senator from Ohio mentioned the \nBudget Control Act of 2011. It wasn't a particularly pretty way to do \ndebt reduction, but it did give us the spending levels we are operating \nunder now.\n  The authors of this opinion piece go on to point out that according \nto the Congressional Research Service--an independent arm of this \ngovernment--Congress voted 53 times from 1978 to 2013 to change the \ndebt ceiling. The debt ceiling has increased to about $16 trillion. In \nat least 53 votes, 29 occurred in a Congress run by Democrats, 17 in \nsplit Congresses, and 7 in Republican-controlled Congresses. It goes on \nto point out time and again how important policy changes were made in \nconnection with this debate.\n  So I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I wish to ask my friend from \nMississippi a question. He has been stalwart on budget debates and he \nis a guy who has always held the line, in the House and in the Senate. \nHe voted for the Budget Control Act because he believes we need to get \nour spending under control. He also wants to ensure that we deal with \nthe part of the budget that is not being talked about because the whole \ncontinuing resolution debate is about 35 percent of the budget. The \nother 65 percent, which is the faster growing part, based on the \nCongressional Budget Office, parts of that--the health care \nentitlements--will grow over 100 percent over the next 10 years. I ask \nthe Senator from Mississippi if he is hearing back home what I am \nhearing from my constituents, which is they want us to do something on \nthe spending before we extend the credit card limit again.\n  I wonder if he could tell us what he is hearing back home, given his \nbackground.\n  Mr. WICKER. The distinguished Senator from Ohio is absolutely \ncorrect. As a matter of fact, the American people are alarmed, \nactually, at the level of debt this government has run up, particularly \nin the last 4\\1/2\\ to 5 years. It has been astounding. We cannot \ncontinue to add debt upon debt for the next generation, many of whom \nare within the sound of our voices and some of whom are employed as our \npages. The Senator has already referred to them today. We owe them a \ngovernment that grows our debt at a much slower rate.\n  We have done it before. When the distinguished Senator and I were in \nthe House of Representatives, we were told we could not balance the \nbudget within 10 years. Actually, with the leadership of my friend from \nOhio, we passed legislation. We had the cooperation of the President of \nthe United States who negotiated with us, and that divided government \nbalanced the budget not within 10 years but within 3 or 4 years, and we \nfulfilled that until the terrorist attacks of 2001.\n  So, yes, the American people are concerned. I think we would be doing \na disservice to them, simply to go along with a debt increase without \naddressing the underlying problems. As my friend from Ohio knows, the \nPresident of the United States himself in this budget has proposed very \nsignificant changes in the growth rate of certain of our entitlement \nprograms, which would go a long way toward getting us to a bipartisan \nresolution on this issue.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator raises an important point, which is that the \nlarger part of the budget--the 65 percent of the budget that is not \nbeing debated as part of a continuing resolution, not subject to \ncongressional appropriations and the faster growing part of the \nbudget--is an issue the President actually did address in his own \nbudget. In fact, he laid out a number of proposals called mandatory \nspending reforms that would help to reduce some of the debt by reducing \nsome of the cost increases on that 65 percent of the budget.\n  By the way, 65 percent today, 10 years from now will be 76 percent of \nthe budget. The departments and agencies that are appropriated every \nyear are only 35 percent, soon to be reduced to 24 percent of the \nbudget. So that is a very good point the Senator makes.\n  The President himself has pointed out that we need to make changes. \nYet he refuses to negotiate, refuses to talk, refuses to consider any \nof these proposals. It doesn't seem to make sense, and it is certainly \nnot in the interests of the American people, the people from \nMississippi and the people from Ohio.\n  I thank my colleague from Mississippi for joining me. I look forward \nto reading the new material he has provided for the Record today. I \nthank him for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7207-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7207-S7210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as my colleagues have done on several \noccasions, I come to the floor also to speak on the shutdown and the \npending effort to find a compromise we can finally get to the President \nof the United States. Today, specifically, I come to the floor to take \nissue with a remark made by the President on Tuesday this week \nregarding the health care reform bill that he also sometimes calls \nObamaCare. He said:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act is a law that passed the House, \n     that passed the Senate, the Supreme Court ruled \n     constitutional. It was a central issue in last year's \n     election. It is settled, and it is here to stay.\n\n  While I understand the President's position on the law that now is \nreferred to by his name, he also misses the point. On Monday night, the \nSenate had the opportunity to keep the government running. The Senate \nhad a bill that funded the government and did so without delaying or \ndefunding ObamaCare. As we all know, the Senate voted down that bill. \nSo let me repeat: The government could have been kept open without \ndelaying or defunding ObamaCare. Anyone who says anything different is \nsimply not being accurate.\n  What did the bill Monday night seek to do? The bill sought to delay \nthe implementation of the individual mandate for 1 year and require \nexecutive branch appointees to go to the exchanges. Those are changes \nto ObamaCare.\n  Apparently, the President doesn't believe we are allowed to make any \nchanges whatsoever to ObamaCare. I would respect that position if the \nPresident actually enforced it over the last several years, as he had \nbills presented to him that he signed and that actually made some \nchanges in the health care reform law. In fact, Congress has made \nnumerous changes to ObamaCare since it was signed into law. I have a \nlist here, but it is a list I will read in its entirety so people know \nthe President has accepted changes to his prime piece of legislation \nand so I can refute that the President isn't consistent when I go back \nnow to his quotation when he says:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act is a law that passed the House, \n     that passed the Senate, the Supreme Court ruled \n     constitutional. It was a central issue in last year's \n     election. It is settled, and it is here to stay.\n\n  By that, I think the President is signifying that we can't do \nanything to touch the issue whatsoever, even to the minimal extent that \nwe tried to Monday night.\n  So this list was conveniently assembled not by this Senator but by \nthe Congressional Research Service, and it was done on behalf of \nSenator Coburn.\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\n  In the 111th Congress, to start with the first change we made that \nthe President accepted, H.R. 4887 clarified that health care provided \nunder TRICARE, TRICARE for Life, and the Nonappropriated Fund Health \nBenefits Program constitutes ``minimal essential health care \ncoverage.''\n  Then we had H.R. 5014, clarifying that the health care provided by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs constitutes, according to the health \ncare reform bill, ``minimal essential health care coverage.''\n  H.R. 1586 modified the definition of average manufacturer price to \ninclude inhalation, infusion, implanted or injectable drugs that are \nnot generally dispensed through a retail community pharmacy.\n  H.R. 4994 offset the costs of the Medicare and Medicaid Program \nextensions and the postponement of cuts in Medicare physician payments \nwith a change in the Affordable Care Act, but the President signed it.\n  H.R. 4853 extended the nonrefundable adoption tax credit through tax \nyear 2012.\n  H.R. 6523 extended TRICARE coverage to dependent adult children up to \nage 26, to conform with the private health insurance requirements under \nthe Affordable Care Act. The President signed that.\n  In the 112th Congress, H.R. 4 repealed the requirement that \nbusinesses file an information report whenever they pay a vendor more \nthan $600 for goods in a single year.\n  H.R. 674 modified the calculation of modified adjusted gross income \nto include Social Security benefits.\n  H.R. 3630 reduced the Prevention and Public Health Fund annual \nappropriations over the period from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year \n2021 by a total of $6.25 billion to help offset the cost of extending \nthe payroll tax cut. That is a monumental change in the bill. The \nPresident signed that.\n  H.R. 4348 modified the Medicaid disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment by \nchanging the adjustment factor and the effective date.\n  H.R. 8 transferred 10 percent of the remaining unobligated Consumer \nOperated and Oriented Plan--and we call that the CO-OP--program funds \nto a new CO-OP contingency fund and rescinded the other 90 percent of \nthose funds and repealed the CLASS Act.\n  H.R. 1473 was another bill that the President signed. It canceled \n$2.2 billion of the $6 billion appropriation for the CO-OP program.\n  H.R. 2055 rescinded $400 million of the remaining $3.8 billion for \nthe CO-OP program, rescinded $10 million of the $15 million fiscal year \n2012 appropriations for the Independent Payment Advisory Board, \ninstructed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a \nWeb site with detailed information on the allocation of moneys in the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund, and prohibited use of those funds \nfor lobbying, publicity or propaganda purposes. That bill was signed by \nthe President.\n  H.R. 933 rescinded $200 million of the $500 million transfer from the \nMedicare Part A and Part B trust funds for the 5-year Community-Based \nCare Transition Program and rescinded $10 million of the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board's fiscal year 2013 appropriation.\n  These are changes made by Congress to the law the President refers to \nas settled law. When he talks about settled law, he talks to us that \nthe Affordable Care Act cannot be changed now as we are debating things \nwith a continuing resolution. Obviously, the act is not so settled that \nCongress cannot and has not amended it in the last several years.\n  But as we all know, the President, through his own actions, has, in \naddition, considered ObamaCare not to be settled law either. The \nPresident has, through administrative action himself, made numerous \nchanges to ObamaCare.\n  In February, the President delayed application of the out-of-pocket \nlimits. In March, the President delayed implementation of the Basic \nHealth Plan Option. Also, in March, the President delayed a requirement \nthat small business exchanges offer a choice of plans. In July, the \nPresident delayed the exchange applicant eligibility and verification. \nIn July, in perhaps the most famous example, the President delayed \nimplementation of the employer mandate. In regard to that, there were \neven Members of the President's party in the Senate--that said the \nPresident did not have the legal authority to do that.\n  So on Monday night, House Republicans sent the Senate a bill that did \nnot defund or delay ObamaCare. It continued funding our government. It \nsimply sought to amend ObamaCare in the same way--dozens of times--as I \nhave just illustrated it has been amended. There was not even any \ndebate of the proposals on their merits. It was simply handled in the \nmost simple way you can here, tabled by the Democratic leadership. Now \nwe hear about the farcical issue of settled law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, could I have 2 more minutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do not know where this settled law legal theory comes \nfrom. I would note that some of my colleagues have ignored this theory \nduring previous health care debates.\n  In 2003, Congress passed a law, a bipartisan law, called the Medicare \nModernization Act. This law passed with Members of both parties \nsupporting it. It was signed into law by the President. It survived any \ncourt challenges that were made against it. It was, by the same token, \nsettled law. That did not stop my colleagues from proposing legislation \nto amend Part D, called the Medicare Modernization Act. In fact, \nDemocrats, including Members still currently in the Senate, proposed \nand voted to alter the Medicare Modernization Act by striking the \nnoninterference clause. We considered that proposal and debated it on \nits merits, as we should have the amendments to the Affordable Care Act \nrecently offered. We did not dismiss it as offensive because it sought \nto amend a settled law.\n  The government could be open and fully operating today but for the \nDemocrats' unwillingness to engage in legitimate debate over the \nproposals to amend ObamaCare, not defund it or delay it.\n  We are where we are because the majority refuses to give the American \npeople relief from the individual mandate and treat President Obama and \nhis political appointees the same as all other Americans are by going \nto the exchange.\n  In the wash of words that we will hear on the floor, I hope this \nsimple truth can be heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, recently there was a \ndisturbing poll in the Washington Post. It said that most Americans \nfear that the American dream is passing them by. Almost 65 percent \nworry that they cannot make ends meet with their current incomes. That \nis up from 48 percent in 1971.\n  We are not talking about luxuries--just basic living expenses: food \nand clothing for their kids, a roof over their family's head, just \ngetting by day-to-day. So many of our fellow citizens are working \nharder than ever and still feel as though they are falling behind. They \nwonder: Where is the country headed?\n  This week, they are wondering more than ever, watching the spectacle \nhere in Washington, watching the government shut down, grinding to a \nhalt. I am hearing from my constituents, from people in New Mexico, and \nthey are frustrated and worried. They are concerned about the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture crop payments, as we head into the harvest, \nwhen they need financing the most. They are concerned about being able \nto close on mortgages with Federal backing, with their loans on hold.\n  Many New Mexicans are going to be furloughed without pay. This hurts \ntheir families and all the businesses that rely on them in our \neconomy--restaurants, retailers, car washes, landscapers, any type of \nbusiness one can imagine.\n  This shutdown did not have to happen. We are not debating the amount \nof the budget. The fact is, House Republicans are demanding concessions \njust for keeping the lights on at the Federal Government.\n  I think most Americans have two questions. How did we get into this \nmess and how do we get out of it?\n  We are coming out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, \nbut recovery is underway. We have seen 42\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\nmonths of private sector job growth. That is 7.5 million jobs. That is \nhope for millions of families. We have had nine consecutive quarters of \neconomic growth--the longest stretch since the recession hit in 2008. \nSo we are slowly making our way back--not fast enough, with too many \nfolks still struggling, and with great challenges for the future.\n  This is a time for leadership, for working together. Americans expect \ntheir leaders to act as grownups. But they feel they are watching a \nschoolyard spat. Is it any wonder they hold Congress in such contempt \nor that they worry about the kind of country they will leave their \nchildren?\n  Here is what we should be doing. We should have a farm bill by now. \nWe should have comprehensive immigration reform, and we should have a \nserious budget--one that would get rid of sequestration's meat-cleaver \ncuts with targeted spending reductions, tackling the deficit, reforming \nthe Tax Code, helping the middle class and small businesses, helping \nfamilies and seniors who are struggling, moving ahead with smart \ninvestments in infrastructure, creating jobs, investing in our future.\n  The Senate passed that budget 6 months ago. But the House went in a \ncompletely different direction. Their budget put tax cuts for the \nrichest Americans above funding for education and ensuring the safety \nof our roads and bridges.\n  Democrats and Republicans have differences. That is no surprise. But \nwe still have a job to do. We still need to sit down and work it out. \nBut a minority in the House has blocked our way forward--not once, not \ntwice but time and time again.\n  American families and businesses need a long-term budget. Businesses \ndo not hire on a monthly basis. They need certainty and the confidence \nthat their government is working to create an environment for growth. \nWe are giving them neither; instead, we lurch from crisis to crisis.\n  The worst thing about it is it does not have to be this way. This is \na manufactured crisis, a series of self-inflicted wounds to our \neconomy. The American people do not want this. They want a strong \neconomy. They want jobs and a government that can actually get \nsomething done for the middle class, not just for Wall Street \nbillionaires. The American people want a government that works, not a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  There is no logic behind this crisis. Why are we here? Because the \nother side wants to kill the Affordable Care Act. I respect the \ndiversity of views in America and in Congress. But the Affordable Care \nAct passed Congress like every other bill. It passed the House, it \npassed the Senate, and the President signed it. If Republicans want to \nrepeal this law, they should make their case to the American people and \nwork to pass their own health care law. What is happening is \nunprecedented, disruptive, and undemocratic behavior.\n  We heard a lot of indignation--hour after hour of it. But here is the \nthing: It does not stop the Affordable Care Act. This whole stunt has \nbeen a colossal waste of time, and wasting time is something we cannot \nafford. The real problems facing our Nation are still waiting.\n  Everyone outside of a radical group of obstructionists knows this is \nsilly, knows this is misguided and dangerous to our economy.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, business \nleaders from coast to coast--there is a loud chorus of: Stop. This is \nenough. But, so far, it is not loud enough.\n  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. I am not going to come here \nto the floor and say the Affordable Care Act is perfect. What law is? \nBut it is the law of the land. It is being implemented. Shutting down \nthe government does not change that. Here is what a shutdown does do: \n27,000 Federal employees in my State could be furloughed and lose their \nincome. Nearly half of the civilian workers for the Department of \nDefense will be sent home. In New Mexico, that is over 6,500 people who \nhelp defend this country, and they may not be paid.\n  Social Security applications could be jeopardized. Calls to SSA for \nhelp could go unanswered. Federal loans would be delayed for tens of \nthousands of folks trying to buy a home or applying for a small \nbusiness loan. Those doors may be locked. National parks will close. So \nwill museums and monuments.\n  This hurts the tourist economy in my State and hurts small \nbusinesses. During the last shutdown, 7 million tourists were turned \naway. Our veterans, who already face too many delays in their claims \nfor benefits, could face even more. During the last shutdown, more than \n400,000 veterans saw their disability and pension claims delayed.\n  Students will also be hurt. Work-study and Perkins loan payments \nwould stop. Pregnant women and mothers who need nutrition assistance \nfor their children may not get it. All of this is because the other \nside wants to send a message on ObamaCare? Well, it has a very high \nprice, costing our Nation billions of dollars every day and hurting \nFederal agencies, including our critical national labs such as Los \nAlamos and Sandia, in their important national security mission.\n  Wall Street is on edge. Main Street is on edge. Families are worried. \nCommunities suffer. There is another cost. The paralysis of government \nsends a terrible message, a terrible message of failure and \ndysfunction.\n  What is next? The debt ceiling. Holding the credit of the United \nStates of America hostage for political gain. Instead of serious \ndebate, we have ultimatums. Instead of regular order, we have midnight \nshutdowns. Instead of compromise, we have all or nothing, take it or \nleave it.\n  My friend from New Mexico, MSG Jessey Baca, summed it up well in an \ninterview with KOB-TV back home. He said:\n\n       I'm not angry. I'm frustrated because of the way we've \n     always been taught to work together to get things done, you \n     work together--and that just doesn't seem to be happening. \n     Settle your differences.\n\n  Jessey is right. We need to start working together. We have not done \nthat. So here we are on the wrong train, on the wrong track going \nnowhere. It is hurting families, hurting communities, could derail our \neconomy with the recovery still under way.\n  The hard-working families of this country want a government that \nworks, not one that shuts down just to send a message. Meanwhile, those \nfamilies wait--wait for us to meet the real challenges that face our \nNation and that make a real difference in their lives and the lives of \ntheir children.\n  Before I finish, I want to discuss the subcommittee I chair on \nAppropriations, the Financial Services and General Government \nSubcommittee. We work with agencies that are critical to keeping the \neconomy running smoothly. I have to speak up and make sure that those \nwho are causing this shutdown know exactly how badly the country needs \nthe government to reopen. This shutdown is jeopardizing consumer \nsafety. It is adding to the uncertainty facing our financial markets. \nIt is doing real damage on our economy.\n  Our subcommittee funds the Small Business Administration. Small \nbusiness owners are really going to take a hit in this shutdown. The \nSBA, Small Business Administration, is closed. I do not know about my \ncolleagues, but the top concern I hear from small business owners in \nNew Mexico is how hard it is to get a loan to expand. The SBA approves \nan average of $86 million in loans to small businesses each day. But \nwhile the government is shut down, our Nation's job creators are not \ngetting those resources. If the shutdown continues, 28 million small \nbusinesses will no longer be able to get capital from the SBA to \nexpand.\n  There are other impacts too. Each day the government is closed our \neconomy grinds down a little further. The shutdown is affecting the \nservices that keep our capital markets safe. The CFTC, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, will have just 4 percent of its normal \nstaff during the shutdown. That means markets will be without effective \noversight.\n  We are about to hit the debt ceiling, our Nation's borrowing limit. \nIt is a potentially dangerous financial situation. The shutdown has put \nour watchdog at the CFTC and the SEC to sleep. Global markets are open, \nWall Street is open, but investor protection agencies are closed. It is \nan open invitation to financial abuse.\n  The shutdown is also putting the safety of our children at risk. \nChristmas may seem far away, but companies are already working to get \nready for the holiday season. They are shipping\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\ngoods in from overseas, including millions of toys. During this \nshutdown, only 22 employees at the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nwill be available nationwide. That is 22 people to inspect millions of \nimported toys and gifts, gifts that American families will be putting \nunder the Christmas tree. These agencies were created by Congress to \nprotect American investors and consumers, to help small businesses. It \nis a travesty that tea party Republicans in the House have been allowed \nto hold the country hostage. That is unconscionable. Real people are \nbeing hurt, the people who are going without pay, without veterans' \nbenefits or survivor benefits, without important financial and consumer \nprotections.\n  You know the one that is the most devastating to me? People who are \ngoing without food. Here we are talking about millions of women and \nchildren in this country in poverty.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it has been 7 days since we passed a piece \nof legislation to fund the government. I wonder how many days it will \nbe that the Speaker makes the American people wait to open the \ngovernment. How long is he going to make them wait before the \ngovernment is open? It is a real hardship not only to the hundreds of \nthousands of Federal employees but the people who depend on the Federal \nemployees for their own jobs. So it is very unfortunate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7210-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOLDEN GAVEL AWARD\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have not had a harder working Senator \nin the past 9 months than the Presiding Officer.\n  You have worked so hard doing so many different things, not the least \nof which is presiding over the Senate. You have presided over the \nSenate in the early morning hours, late-night hours. It is remarkable. \nI so appreciate your doing this. The entire Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, has expressed their appreciation through me to the \nPresiding Officer for the good work you do in trying to make this place \nbetter. Not only do you preside, but you do a good job. You are \ndignified, and you do it with authority.\n  The people of Wisconsin are so fortunate to have the distinguished \nPresiding Officer as a Senator. I have had the good fortune to serve \nwith a number of other Senators from Wisconsin. Russ Feingold was such \na good friend. I miss him very much. Herb Kohl is a unique individual \nwho added a great deal to the Senate with the many things he did as a \nlong-term member of the Appropriations Committee. However, none of the \nSenators I have served with from Wisconsin will outshine the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer. You have been remarkably good. You \nhave only been here a short period of time, but in the short period of \ntime you have been here, you have had admirable dedication to this \ninstitution.\n  Senator Baldwin is a native of Wisconsin--the first woman ever to \nrepresent that great State.\n  As frequently as you have presided, you have enjoyed a front-row \nseat. History is being made during this congressional session. Some of \nthe sessions you have watched haven't been too much fun, but it has \nbeen good, and you have done such a remarkably good job.\n  On behalf of all of the Senators, I congratulate you and thank you \nfor your service to the Senate. This is the first Golden Gavel Award. \nThere will be a presentation made at our caucus this Tuesday to \nrecognize your distinction. This is something that is traditional, the \nGolden Gavel. It is a beautiful memento we will present to you on \nTuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7210-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MARSHALL LEGACY INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I want to recognize the work of the \nMarshall Legacy Institute, MLI, and extend my congratulations on its \n16th anniversary. While serving as Secretary of State, GEN George C. \nMarshall devised a plan to rebuild Europe after the devastation of \nWorld War II. Founded in 1997 on the 50th anniversary of the plan that \nbears General Marshall's name, the MLI's goal is to extend the plan's \nlegacy by helping rebuild today's war torn countries.\n  Over the past 16 years, the MLI has focused on assisting severely \nmine-contaminated countries, like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, and \nAfghanistan, by clearing mines, offering survivors' assistance \nprograms, and providing educational outreach to children. This work is \nvital to civilians who, when they are finally able to return to their \nhomelands after war, often face the unpredictable threat of landmines. \nIt is also critical to protecting the brave men and women of our Armed \nForces, who risk their lives every day to defend our country and often \nserve where landmines pose a significant threat to their safety.\n  One such servicemember is PFC Barrett Austin, a combat engineer in \nthe 4th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat \nTeam, 3rd Infantry Division who bravely served our country in \nAfghanistan, and who died on April 21, 2013, after his vehicle was \nstruck by an improvised explosive device. Private First Class Austin's \ndedicated service, selflessness, and sacrifice were the qualities that \nGeneral Marshall exemplified and valued. It is therefore fitting that \nthe MLI pay tribute to this soldier through its Mine Detection Dog \nPartnership Program by naming a mine detection dog in his honor.\n  I thank MLI for its 16 years of service, and for its continued \nefforts to make our world a safer place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7210-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3230.

and\n       Whereas, as a member of the Organization of American States \n     and signatory to the Inter-American Democratic Charter, the \n     Bolivarian Government of Venezuela has agreed to abide by the \n     principles of constitutional, representative democracy, which \n     include free and fair elections and adherence to its own \n     constitution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the people of Venezuela in their pursuit of \n     the free exercise of representative democracy as guaranteed \n     by the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela;\n       (2) deplores the undemocratic denial of the legitimate \n     rights of opposition parliamentarians in Venezuela, the \n     inexcusable violence perpetrated against opposition \n     legislators inside chambers of the National Assembly, and the \n     growing efforts to use politically-motivated criminal charges \n     to intimidate the country's political opposition;\n       (3) commends legislators from other countries in the \n     Americas who have declared their opposition to alleged \n     electoral irregularities and condemned the use of violence \n     against opposition parliamentarians in Venezuela;\n       (4) urges the Department of State to work in concert with \n     other countries in the Americas to take meaningful steps to \n     ensure the rule of law in Venezuela in accordance with the \n     Inter-American Democratic Charter and to strengthen the \n     ability of the Organization of American States to respond to \n     the erosion of democratic norms and institutions in member \n     states; and\n       (5) calls for the United States to work with other \n     countries in the hemisphere to actively encourage a process \n     of dialogue between the Government of Venezuela and the \n     political opposition through the good offices of the \n     Organization of American States so that the voices of all \n     Venezuelans can be taken into account through their country's \n     constitutional institutions and free and fair elections.\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A resolution expressing \n     support for the free and peaceful exercise of representative \n     democracy in Venezuela, condemning violence and intimidation \n     against the country's political opposition, and calling for \n     dialogue between all political actors in the country.''.\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 266) designating the week of October \n     7 through 13, 2013, as ``National Chess Week'' to enhance \n     awareness and encourage students and adults to engage in a \n     game known to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving \n     skills.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am proud today to speak in \nsupport of my resolution to designate October 7 through October 13, \n2013 as National Chess Week. I am grateful for the support of my \ncolleagues Senator Alexander and Senator Levin.\n  National Chess Week is designed to increase awareness about the many \nbenefits of chess, and to encourage both children and adults to enjoy \nthis game. Chess has a wide range of educational and cognitive \nbenefits, including improving problem-solving skills and developing \ncritical thinking skills. It helps increase memory function and hone \nreading and math skills. For these reasons, chess is used by some \neducators as part of their curriculum, and is even used to help \npatients who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or the \neffects of a stroke.\n  Over 80,000 children and adults nationwide are members of the U.S. \nChess Federation, and \\1/2\\ of them are students. Engaging students in \nchess can help make learning fun, and give them a lifelong pastime that \nthey can enjoy while using and developing their skills. I am proud to \nsupport and endorse National Chess Week, which I hope will result in \nengaging even more citizens of all ages in this important activity.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 266) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/04/senate-section/article/S7214-4", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR SATURDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
