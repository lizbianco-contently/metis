Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 92, the \nFranken Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 92, S. 162, a bill to \n     reauthorize and improve the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment \n     and Crime Reduction Act of 2004.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, if any, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until 12:15 today.\n  Because of a change in schedule, the Republicans will have their \ncaucus today rather than yesterday as we normally do.\n  The time until 12:15 will be equally divided and controlled between \nthe two leaders or their designees.\n  At 12:15 there will be a rollcall vote on the confirmation of the \nFischer nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors. I am happy we are going to get this good man confirmed, but, \nas I will talk about in a minute, this obstruction is unbelievable. \nFischer is going to now be a member of the Federal Reserve Board. He \nalso has been chosen to be the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  Janet Yellen, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has called \nmany of my colleagues saying: Why do we need another vote? I need him \nhere. There are administrative duties--this is a huge organization--\nwaiting to be done.\n  But we are going to have to go through the cloture process all over \nagain on this man. What a waste of our time--our time--the people's \ntime. Anyway, that is what we are going to do. We are going to vote to \nconfirm him today and then come back at some later time and confirm him \nto be the Vice Chair. We could not confirm him as Vice Chair first \nbecause he is not a member of the Board.\n  Following that vote, the Senate will be in recess until 2 p.m. today, \nallowing for the Republican caucus meeting.\n  At 2:10 there will be up to five rollcall votes in relation to \nseveral nominations: cloture on the Barron nomination to be a circuit \ncourt judge for the First Circuit; confirmation of the Cook nomination \nas a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberty Oversight Board; \nconfirmation of the Daly nomination to be U.S. attorney in Connecticut; \nconfirmation of the Green nomination to\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\nbe U.S. attorney for Louisiana; and confirmation of the Martinez \nnomination to be U.S. attorney in New Mexico.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 2363\n\n  I am told that S. 2363 is due for its second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2363) to protect and enhance opportunities for \n     recreational hunting, fishing, and shooting, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I would object to any further proceedings with respect to \nthis bill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                         Hard Working Senators\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my good friend the Democratic whip, the \nassistant leader, is seated next to me. He and I came to Washington at \nthe same time many years ago. Judging from what he does, I think he \nworks very hard. The Presiding Officer served with us in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is a hard job, the jobs we have. We seek these \njobs. They are the choice of our lives. It is an extreme honor to be a \nMember of the House of Representatives or the Senate, but we have \ntraditionally worked very hard. I have seen it. Our families recognize \nhow hard we work. It is not uncommon for us to wake up in the middle of \nthe night: I should have done that. Then you write yourself a note. \nThis has been going on since we have had a Senate, I am sure.\n  I have seen Members of Congress work themselves to exhaustion. But I \nconfess, I have never seen some Senators--those Senators on the other \nside of the aisle--work so hard to do nothing, so little. My Republican \ncolleagues have exerted so much effort to cause nothing to get done. \nThey prefer it that way. They have broken their backs ensuring that \nnothing happens here on the Senate floor.\n  Last week was another example of the Democrats' fruitless hard work. \nThe Republicans blocked debate on the bill that would reinstate \nimportant and expired tax provisions--tax cuts. This legislation \nextends tax cuts and helps American families and American businesses as \nthey recover from the recession.\n  The bill they stopped last week extends current tax provisions that \nhave bolstered students, teachers, workers and employers, American \nfamilies and businesses, saving money and growing our economy.\n  Listen to this. Now the Republicans are against tax breaks. They have \nbeen against extended unemployment benefits in recent weeks. They have \nbeen against raising the minimum wage. They have been against pay \nequity. They deny climate change. Now they have added a new one to \nthat. They are against tax cuts. It is hard to comprehend how hard they \nwork to get nothing done.\n  Stunningly--listen to this one--stunningly, some of the very \nRepublicans who helped craft the legislation that they killed helped \nfilibuster the bill. The primary Republican who negotiated this, the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, voted against his own bill. \nThat is what I said. It is true. Republicans are voting against their \nown legislation again. For what? To stop President Obama from \naccomplishing anything. That is what they set out to do 5\\1/2\\ years \nago. They have stuck to that, to the detriment of the American people.\n  We have a letter signed by 152 different organizations--152. That is \npretty stunning. There are so many names on this, it takes three or \nfour pages to get all of the names. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthis list printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. There \nare conservative organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers--two of the most conservative \norganizations in the world, certainly in our country, but they are \njoined by 150 others saying: We want tax breaks. Everybody in America \nwants them. Democrats want them. Independents want them. Republicans \nwant them; that is, Republicans who are located everyplace except in \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  Now we have a new one. The Republicans in Congress are against tax \nbreaks. So what have they accomplished? Nothing but bringing anxiety to \nthe American people, businesses, individuals, and certainly hurting our \neconomy. They continue to obstruct. They have broken my legislative \nheart so many times.\n  Yesterday afternoon, in a couple of conversations here with the \nRepublicans, they said they are going to try to do this. They are going \nto meet with their caucus today. Well, that caucus has ruined a lot of \nlegislation. I hope the people I talked to are strong and emphatic in \nsaying: It is not good for the country, and it is certainly not good \nfor this body. We need to move forward and get certain things done, \nsome things done.\n  So I hope that my legislative heart is not broken again, that I can \nrespond to the people of Nevada that we are going to have a tax \ndeduction and subsidies for transit. We have a lot of transit now. In \nthe wisdom of the Congress, we created a tax break for those people who \ntake the trains, subways, monorails, and buses.\n  The Presiding Officer has worked really his entire career to do \nsomething about the environment. That tax break I talked about is part \nof what the Presiding Officer has always advocated: Let's do what we \ncan to get people off the highways to reduce pollution.\n  We have in this bill something for Nevada that gives--it is not for \nNevada; it is for everybody--that sales tax is a deductible item.\n  We have not been able to bring up these tax breaks. There are many \nother things all across this country.\n  Tax cuts--that is what the Republicans have stopped. So I hope the \nfew Republicans I talked to yesterday will be extremely strong in their \ncaucus and say: This is the right thing for the country. We have done \nenough to try to embarrass the President. Let's try to do something \nthat helps our people in all 50 States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 20, 2014.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations urge the U.S. \n     Senate to pass the EXPIRE Act as soon as possible. The EXPIRE \n     Act will extend the tax provisions that expired at the end of \n     2013. These tax provisions benefit a wide range of taxpayers, \n     including associations, businesses, individuals, community \n     development organizations and non-profit organizations and \n     are important to U.S. jobs and the broader economy.\n       The lack of timely action to extend these provisions \n     injects instability and uncertainty into the economy and \n     weakens confidence in the employment marketplace. Moreover, \n     the extension of the expired provisions should not be delayed \n     until the end of the year since companies are making \n     decisions right now related to taxes that will have an \n     immediate impact on the economy.\n       We urge you to pass these important tax provisions as soon \n     as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n       Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA),

Mr. President, yesterday I was visited by several \nhospitals from Chicago. Mount Sinai is an amazing hospital. It \noriginally--you can tell by its name--was founded by Jewish families \nliving in a section of Chicago. The families have moved on. The \nremaining population is largely African American and Hispanic. It is a \nvery poor neighborhood. It is a violence-ridden neighborhood. But in an \namazing show of magnanimity and charity, many of the Jewish families \nwhose ancestors and predecessors predated them and founded this \nhospital continue to support Mount Sinai. It is a beacon of quality \nmedical care in one of the toughest, meanest neighborhoods in that \ngreat city.\n  They came to speak yesterday, to meet with me. They just merged with \nanother extraordinary hospital, Holy Cross Hospital in Marquette Park. \nI have a special affection for this hospital because for decades it was \nrun by the Sisters of St. Casimir, a Lithuanian Catholic order of nuns \nwho devoted their lives first to the Lithuanian population that lived \nin that neighborhood and then, after that population left, to those who \ncame after them, many of them very poor people.\n  Mount Sinai and Holy Cross merged, and between the two of them, I \ncan't think of better examples of hospitals with a mission to help the \npoorest people and to make certain they have care that all of us would \nlike to have for our families. They came yesterday to talk to me about \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  There are so many speeches on the floor about the Affordable Care \nAct. Most of them from the other side of the aisle are entirely \nnegative. But there are some things about the Affordable Care Act which \nwere brought to my attention from these two intercity hospitals which I \nthink we should all look at carefully.\n  First, they are telling me that at these hospitals more people are \nshowing up and paying. In days gone by, many of those who came in for \nservices were charity cases. The cost of their service was passed on to \neveryone else. Now, under the Affordable Care Act, many of these lower-\nincome families have health insurance for the first time in their \nlives.\n  I have met some of these families, and I know what it means to them. \nIt was several years ago when I was approached by the chairman of the \nCook County board, Toni Preckwinkle, the president, and we asked for a \nwaiver from the Obama administration to enroll families in Cook County \nin the Medicaid portion of the Affordable Care Act before it actually \nwent into effect.\n  We were given that waiver. We now have 100,000 individuals in Cook \nCounty--low-income individuals--who have Medicaid protection.\n  This Medicaid protection has allowed them to have quality health \ninsurance for the first time in their lives, in many cases, and also it \nmeans when they present themselves for care in hospitals, they are \npaying. They are paying through the Medicaid program rather than coming \nin as charity cases.\n  What we are finding as well is that as more and more Americans have \nthe option of health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, the \npercentage of Americans who are uninsured has gone down. The share of \nadults without health insurance declined to 13.4 percent last month \nfrom 15.6 percent just a few months before. It is an indication of more \nand more people in America having the peace of mind that comes with \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  I see the Senator from Kentucky is here, and I know he reserved the \nfloor this morning, and I don't want to take his time.\n  I also want to make the point as well that as we are bringing in more \ncost savings in health care through the Affordable Care Act, we are \nseeing the overall increase in health care costs starting to decline \nand slow down. That is what we were shooting for--more and more \naccessibility in coverage, more affordability for those who have that \ncoverage and the overall cost in health care systems starting to come \ndown. It is an experiment which is starting to show good results.\n  Let me add that as proud as I am to have supported this law, it is \nnot perfect. There are things we need to do to improve it and to refine \nit. We should do those on a bipartisan basis. That is what we are \nwaiting for.\n  The House of Representatives has now voted--I believe the number is \n50 times--to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I hope they have gotten it \nout of their system and now will sit down with us and work on a \nbipartisan basis to make it a better law. We can do that and we should \ndo it together.\n  So I commend this effort to both sides of the aisle--in the Senate as \nwell as in the House--and I hope that we can achieve something that \nwill make a difference.\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\n  I would like to close by mentioning two of my constituents in \nIllinois before I turn the floor over to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Philosophy Walker is a 28-year-old graduate student in biblical \nstudies at the University of Chicago. Her husband Adam is 31 years old \nand a part-time youth minister. Philosophy's school provides health \ninsurance, but it is $900 per month for her and her husband. That would \nrequire them to take out additional student loans to pay their health \ninsurance while they are in school.\n  Before moving to Chicago, they were paying $700 per month for health \ninsurance through COBRA, which is an option for those who have lost \nhealth insurance--but an expensive one. The $700 payment depleted their \nsavings because her husband struggled to find a full-time job. Going \nwithout health insurance wasn't an option because Philosophy Walker has \nsome severe allergy problems.\n  Last November they signed up through the Affordable Care Act exchange \nand purchased a plan comparable to the COBRA coverage that had cost \nthem $700 a month, but the plan also included dental insurance, which \nthey never had before.\n  Philosophy and her husband Adam, under this Affordable Care Act plan, \npay $200 a month. It went from $700 to $200. Philosophy also receives \nher monthly allergy medication for free, rather than the previous $10 \nmonthly copay.\n  If we listen to some of the stories on the floor of the Senate, you \nwould never believe this story, but it is true.\n  I wish also to talk about Laurel Tyler, who runs a small business \nwith her husband in Illinois. Because they have two employees and one \nof the children of one of their employees has asthma, the policies they \nwere sold in the past were extremely expensive.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act and the Illinois marketplace, \nLaurel's business is going to save 20 percent on health care costs, and \nthe 22-year-old son with asthma can stay on the employee's plan. That, \nto me, is a success story.\n  Let's build on that success. Let's work together to make this law \neven stronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3198-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3198-S3201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BARRON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I rise today in opposition to the killing of American \ncitizens without trials. I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nanyone who would argue that the President has the power to kill an \nAmerican citizen not involved in combat and without a trial.\n  I rise today to say that there is no legal precedent for killing \nAmerican citizens not involved in combat, and that any nominee who \nrubber stamps and grants such power to a President is not worthy of \nbeing placed one step away from the Supreme Court.\n  It isn't about just seeing the Barron memos. Some seem to be placated \nby the fact that: Oh, they can read these memos.\n  I believe it is about what the memos themselves say. I believe the \nBarron memos, at their very core, disrespect the Bill of Rights.\n  The Bill of Rights isn't so much for the American Idol winner, the \nBill of Rights isn't so much for the prom queen or the high school \nfootball quarterback. The Bill of Rights is especially for the least \npopular among us. The Bill of Rights is especially for minorities, \nwhether you are a minority by virtue of the color of your skin or the \nshade of your ideology. The Bill of Rights is especially for unpopular \npeople, unpopular ideas, and unpopular religions.\n  It is easy to argue for trials for prom queens. It is easy to argue \nfor trials for the high school quarterback or the American Idol winner. \nIt is hard to argue for trials for traitors and for people who would \nwish to harm our fellow Americans. But a mature freedom defends the \ndefenseless, allows trials for the guilty, and protects even speech of \nthe most despicable nature.\n  After 9/11, we all recoiled in horror at the massacre of thousands of \ninnocent Americans. We fought a war to tell other countries we would \nnot put up with this and we would not allow this to happen again.\n  As our soldiers began to return from Afghanistan, I asked them to \nexplain in their own words what they had fought for. To a soldier, they \nwould tell me they fought for the American way. They fought to defend \nthe Constitution, and they fought for our Bill of Rights.\n  It is a disservice to their sacrifice not to have an open and full-\nthroated public debate about whether an American citizen should get a \ntrial before they are killed.\n  Let me be perfectly clear. I am not referring to anybody involved in \na battlefield, anybody shooting against our soldiers. Anybody involved \nin combat gets no due process.\n  What we are talking about is the extraordinary concept of killing \nAmerican citizens who are overseas but not involved in combat. It \ndoesn't mean that they are not potentially--and probably are--bad \npeople, but we are talking about doing it with no accusation, no trial, \nno charge, and no jury. The nomination before us is about killing \nAmericans not involved in combat.\n  The nominee, David Barron, has written a defense of executions of \nAmerican citizens not involved in combat. Make no mistake, these memos \ndo not limit drone executions to one man. These memos become historic \nprecedent for killing Americans abroad.\n  Some have argued that releasing these memos is sufficient for his \nnomination. This is not a debate about transparency. This is a debate \nabout whether or not American citizens not involved in combat are \nguaranteed due process.\n  Realize that during the Bush years, most of President Obama's party--\nincluding the President himself--argued against the detention--not the \nkilling--of American citizens without a trial. Yet now the President \nand the vast majority of his party will vote for a nominee who \nadvocates the killing of American citizens without trial. How far have \nwe come? How far have we gone? We were once talking about detaining \nAmerican citizens and objecting that they would get no accusation and \nno trial. Now we are condoning killing American citizens without a \ntrial.\n  During President Obama's first election, he told the Boston Globe:\n\n       No. I reject the Bush administration's claim that the \n     President has plenary authority under the Constitution to \n     detain U.S. citizens without charges as unlawful combatants.\n\n  As President, not only has he signed legislation to detain American \ncitizens without trial, but he has now approved of killing American \ncitizens without a trial. Where has candidate Obama gone?\n  President Obama now puts forward David Barron, whose memos justify \nkilling Americans without a trial. I can't tell you what he wrote in \nthe memos; the President forbids it. I can tell you what Barron did not \nwrite. He did not write or cite any legal case to justify killing an \nAmerican without a trial because no such legal precedent exists. It has \nnever been adjudicated. No court has ever looked at this. There has \nbeen no public debate because it has been held secret from the American \npeople.\n  Barron creates out of whole cloth a defense for executing American \ncitizens without trial. The cases he cites--which I am forbidden from \ntalking about, which I am forbidden from citing today--are unrelated to \nthe issues of killing American citizens because no such cases have ever \noccurred. We have never debated this in public. We are going to allow \nthis to be decided by one branch of government in secret.\n  Yet the argument against the Barron memo, the argument against what \nBarron proposes should be no secret and should be obvious to anyone who \nlooks at this issue. No court has ever decided such a case. So Barron's \nsecret defense of drone executions relies on cases which, upon critical \nanalysis, have no pertinence to the case at hand.\n  Am I the only one who thinks that something so unprecedented as an \nassassination of an American citizen should not be discussed, that we \nshould discuss this in the light of day. Am I the only one who thinks \nthat a question of such magnitude should be decided in the open by the \nSupreme Court?\n  Barron's arguments for the extrajudicial killing of American citizens \nchallenges over 1,000 years of jurisprudence. Trials based on the \npresumption of innocence are an ancient\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\nrite. The Romans wrote that the burden of proof is on he who declares, \nhe who asserts that you are guilty, not on he who denies. The burden is \non the government.\n  We describe this principle as the principle of being considered \ninnocent until guilty. This is a profound concept. This is not \nsomething we should quietly acquiesce to having it run roughshod on or \ndiluted and eventually destroyed.\n  In many nations the presumption of innocence is a legal right to the \naccused, even in the trial. In America we go one step further to \nprotect the accused. We place the burden of proof on the prosecution. \nWe require the government to collect and present enough compelling \nevidence to a jury--not to one person who works for the President, not \nto a bunch of people in secret, but to a public jury. The evidence must \nbe presented.\n  But then we go even further to protect the possibility of innocence. \nWe require that the accused be guilty beyond reasonable doubt. If \nreasonable doubt remains, the accused is to be acquitted.\n  We set a very high bar for conviction and an extremely high bar for \nexecution, and even doing all of the most appropriate things, we still \nsometimes have done it wrong and have executed people after jury trials \nmistakenly, erroneously. But now we are talking about not even having \nthe protection of a trial. We are talking about only accusations.\n  Are we comfortable killing American citizens no matter how awful or \nheinous the crime they are accused of? Are we comfortable killing them \nbased on accusations that no jury has reviewed?\n  Innocent until proven guilty--the concept--is tested. We are being \ntested. It is being tested when the consensus is that the accused is \nvery likely guilty in this case. The traitor who was killed, in all \nlikelihood, was guilty. The evidence appears to be overwhelming. Yet \nwhy can't we do the American thing--have a public trial, accuse them, \nand convict them in a court?\n  It is more difficult to believe in the concept of innocent until \nproven guilty when the accused is unpopular or hated. The principle of \ninnocent until proven guilty is more difficult when the accused is \ncharged with treason. The Bill of Rights is easy to defend when we like \nthe speech or sympathize with the defendant. Defending the right of \ntrial for people we fear or dislike is more difficult. It is extremely \nhard. But we have to defend the Bill of Rights or it will slip away \nfrom us.\n  It is easy to support a trial for someone who looks like you, for \nsomeone who has the same color skin, or for someone who has the same \nreligion. It is easy. Presumption of innocence is, however, much harder \nwhen the citizen practices a minority religion, when the citizen \nresides in a foreign land or sympathizes with the enemy. Yet our \nhistory is replete with examples of heroes who defended the \ndefenseless, who defended the unpopular, who sometimes defended the \nguilty.\n  We remember John Adams, when he defended the British soldiers--the \nones who were guilty of the Boston massacre. We remember fondly people \nwho defend the unpopular, even when they end up being declared guilty, \nbecause that is something we take pride in--our system. We remember his \nson John Quincy Adams when he defended the slaves who took over the \nAmistad. We remember fondly Henry Selden who defended the unpopular \nwhen he represented Susan B. Anthony, who voted illegally as a woman. \nWe remember fondly Eugene Debs who defended himself when he was accused \nof being against the draft and against World War I and was given 10 \nyears in prison.\n  We defend the unpopular. That is what the Bill of Rights is \nespecially important for. We remember fondly Clarence Darrow who \ndefended the unpopular in the Scopes monkey trial. We remember fondly \nThurgood Marshall who defended the unpopular when he convinced the \nSupreme Court to strike down segregation.\n  Where would we be without these champions? Where would we be without \napplying the Bill of Rights to those we don't like, to those we don't \nassociate with, to those who we actually think are guilty?\n  Where would the unpopular be without the protection of the Bill of \nRights?\n  One can almost argue that the right to trial is more precious the \nmore unpopular the defendant. We cannot and we should not abandon this \ncherished principle.\n  Critics will argue these are evil people who plot to kill Americans. \nI don't dispute that. My first instinct is, like most Americans, to \nrecoil in horror and want immediate punishment for traitors. I can't \nstand the thought of Americans who consort with and advocate violence \nagainst Americans. I want to punish those Americans who are traitors. \nBut I am also conscious of what these traitors have betrayed. These \ntraitors are betraying a country that holds dear the precept that we \nare innocent until proven guilty. Aren't we, in a way, betraying our \ncountry's principles when we relinquish this right to a trial by jury?\n  The maxim that we are innocent until proven guilty is in some ways \nlike our First Amendment which presumes that speech is okay. It is easy \nto protect complimentary speech. It is easy to protect speech you agree \nwith. It is harder to protect speech you abhor. The First Amendment is \nnot so much about protecting speech that is easily agreed to; it is \nabout tolerating speech that is an abomination. Likewise, the Fourth, \nthe Fifth, and the Sixth Amendments are not so much about protecting \nmajorities of thought, religion or ethnicity. Due process is about \nprotecting everyone, especially minorities.\n  Unpopular opinions change from generation to generation. While today \nit may be burqa-wearing Muslims, it has, at times, been yarmulke-\nwearing Jews. It has, at times, been African Americans. It has, at \ntimes, been Japanese Americans. It is not beyond belief that someday \nevangelical Christians could be a persecuted minority in our own \ncountry.\n  The process of determining guilt or innocence is an incredibly \nimportant one and a difficult one. Even with a jury, justice is not \nalways easily discovered. One has only to watch the jurors deliberate \nin ``Twelve Angry Men'' to understand that finding justice, even with a \njury, is not always straightforward. Today, virtually everyone \nsympathizes with Tom Robinson who was unfairly accused in ``To Kill a \nMockingbird'' because the reader knows that Robinson is innocent, \nbecause the reader knows his accusation was based on race. It is a slam \ndunk. It is easy for all of us to believe that he should get a trial.\n  It is easy to object to vigilante justice when you know the accused \nis innocent. When the mob attempts an extrajudicial execution, we stand \nwith Atticus Finch. We stand for the rule of law. But what of an \nAmerican citizen who, by all appearances, is guilty; what of an \nAmerican citizen who, by all appearances, is a traitor, who we all \nagree deserves punishment? Are we strong enough as a country to believe \nstill that this person should get a trial?\n  Do we have the courage to denounce drone executions as nothing more \nthan sophisticated vigilantism? How can it be anything but vigilantism? \nDue process can't exist in secret. Checks and balances can't exist in \none branch of government. Whether it be upon advice of 1 lawyer or \n10,000 lawyers, if they all work for one man--the President--how can it \nbe anything but a verdict outside the law--a verdict that could \nconceivably be subject to the emotions of prejudice and fear; a verdict \nthat could be wrong? This President, above all other Presidents, should \nfear allowing so much power to gravitate to one man.\n  It is admittedly hard to defend the right to a trial for an American \ncitizen who becomes a traitor and appears to aid and abet the enemy, \nbut we must. If we cannot defend the right to trial for the most \nheinous crimes, then where will the slippery slope lead us? The \ngreatness of American jurisprudence is that everyone gets his or her \nday in court, no matter how despicable the crime they are accused of.\n  Critics say: How would we try these Americans? They are overseas. \nThey won't come home. The Constitution holds the answer. They should be \ntried for treason. If they refuse to come home, they should be tried in \nabsentia. They should be given the right to a legal defense. It should \nbe provided. There should be an independent legal\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\ndefense that does not work for the government. If they are found \nguilty, the method of punishment is not the issue. The issue is, and \nalways has been, the right to a trial, the presumption of innocence, \nand the guarantee of due process to everyone.\n  For these reasons I cannot support the nomination of David Barron. \nEven if the administration releases a dozen Barron memos, I cannot \nsupport Barron. The debate is not about partisan politics. I have \nsupported many of the President's nominees. The debate is not about \ntransparency. It is about the substance of the memos. I cannot and will \nnot support the lifetime appointment of someone who believes it is OK \nto kill an American citizen not involved in combat without a trial.\n\n  Some will argue and say: The President, yesterday, has now changed \nhis mind. He is going to release these memos to the public. Well, if \nthat is true, why don't we wait on the vote and let the public read the \nmemos? Why don't we have a full-throated debate over this? Why don't we \nactually see what the public thinks about the right to trial by jury? \nOne would think that something we have had for over a thousand years \ndeserves a bit of debate. Wouldn't you think we would at least take the \ntime? Realize, this is not the position of the administration, this is \nthe position of the administration now that it is relenting to the \nverdict of the Second Circuit Court. They are releasing this memo under \nduress. My guess is they are releasing this memo because they need a \nfew more votes, and they will get a few more votes by releasing these \nmemos to the public--or promising to release these memos. They will not \nbe released--the memos justifying the killing of an American without a \ntrial--will not be released before the vote takes place.\n  So the question is, Is this transparency good enough for you to cast \naside the whole concept of presumption of innocence, the whole concept \nthat an accusation is different than a conviction?\n  There has been much discussion of what due process is, and as we have \nlooked at this debate there are some valid questions and some good \nwritings on this. Conor Friedersdorf has written extensively on this, \nand he writes about the lawyer who enabled the extrajudicial killing of \nan American. He asks the question, Should the Constitution be entrusted \nto a man--and this is essentially what happens; the Constitution will \nbe entrusted to an appellate court judge--should the Constitution be \nentrusted to a man who thinks Americans can be killed without due \nprocess?\n  The Fifth Amendment, Conor Friedersdorf says, is very clear. No \nperson shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous \ncrime unless upon the presentment or indictment of a grand jury. It \ndoesn't say except or on presentment of an accusation by the executive \nbranch without a trial. The Fifth Amendment actually says, ``Nor shall \nany person be deprived of life, liberty or property without due \nprocess.''\n  The question is, What is due process? One would think this would be \npretty clear and there wouldn't be much dispute over due process. But \nlisten to some of these descriptions. This is the description Glenn \nGreenwald writes about in describing both the Bush and the Obama \nadministrations. He says:\n\n       The core of the distortion on the war on terror under both \n     Bush and Obama is the Orwellian practice of equating \n     government accusation of terrorism with proof of guilt.\n\n  Realize what we are talking about. There is a big difference between \nan accusation and a conviction. If we want to realize how important \nthis is, there are Senators on the other side of the aisle who have \ncalled Senators on this side of the aisle terrorists on multiple \noccasions. Who are we potentially going after with these directives \ntoward killing? People who are either senior operatives of Al-Qaeda--of \nwhich there are no membership cards, so that is somewhat open to \ndebate--but we are also going after people who are associated with \nterrorism.\n  The definition of terrorism--since on some occasions we have been \naccused of terrorism by the other side--can be somewhat loose. The \nBureau of Justice put out a memo describing some of the characteristics \nof people who might be terrorists--which might alarm you, if you are \ntraveling overseas: people who are missing fingers, people who have \nstains on their clothing, people who have changed the color of their \nhair, people who have multiple weapons in their house, people who have \nmore than 7 days worth of food in their house.\n  These are people you should be suspicious of, according to the \ngovernment; these are people who might be terrorists; and these are \npeople you should talk to and inform the government about these people.\n  If these are the definitions of someone who might be a terrorist, \nwouldn't we kind of want to have a lawyer before the accusation becomes \na conviction?\n  When we talk about conviction, we talk about the conviction or the \nbar for conviction being beyond a reasonable doubt. One can pretty much \nthink--you can be in a jury pool and pretty much think someone killed \nsomeone--you have a suspicion, you have an inclination they are \nprobably guilty, but you are supposed to be so convinced that it is \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. In these memos there is a different \nstandard.\n  Realize what the standard is of the person whom we will now be \nappointing to a lifetime appointment--one step away from the Supreme \nCourt. That standard is an assassination is justified when an informed \nhigh-level official of the U.S. Government has determined that the \ntargeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against \nthe United States.\n  We are not talking here about beyond a reasonable doubt anymore. That \nstandard is gone. We are talking about an informed, unnamed high-level \nofficial in secret deciding an imminent attack is going to occur.\n  The interesting thing about an imminent attack is we don't go much by \nthe plain wording of what one would think would be imminent anymore. \nThe memo expressly states it is inventing--this is also from Glenn \nGreenwald--the memo expressly states it is inventing a broader concept \nof innocence that is typically not used.\n  Specifically, the President's assassination power does not require \nthat the United States have clear evidence that a specific attack will \ntake place in the immediate future. So you wonder about a definition of \n``imminence'' that no longer includes the word ``immediate.''\n  The ACLU's Jameel Jaffer, as quoted by Glenn Greenwald, explains that \nthe memo redefines the word ``imminence'' in a way that deprives the \nword of its ordinary meaning.\n  When we talk about due process, it is important to understand where \ndue process can occur. Due process has to occur in the open. It has to \noccur in an adversarial process. If you don't have a lawyer on your \nside who is your advocate, you can't have due process. Due process \ncannot occur in secret, but it also can't occur in one branch of \ngovernment. This is a fundamental misconception of the President.\n  The President, with regard to either privacy in the fourth amendment \nor killing American citizens with regard to the fifth amendment, \nbelieves that if he has some lawyers review this process, that is due \nprocess. This is appalling because this has nothing to do with due \nprocess and can in no way be seen as due process.\n  Some have said: Well, this is a judicial opinion. Barron has written \nan opinion; he has justified the President's actions. People have also \nsaid with regard to the NSA spying case that 15 judges have approved \nit. Well, the majority of the judges were in secret in the FISA Court, \nand that is not due process.\n  But the memo written by David Barron as recounted by Glenn Greenwald \nis not a judicial opinion. It was not written by anyone independent of \nthe President. On multiple occasions they have justified and the memo \nargues that due process can be decided by internal deliberations of the \nexecutive branch.\n  The comedian Stephen Colbert mocked this and presented:\n\n       Trial by jury, trial by fire, rock, paper scissors, who \n     cares? Due process just means that there is a process that \n     you do.\n       The current process is apparently, first the president \n     meets with his advisers and decides who he can kill. Then he \n     kills them.\n       It is actually called ``Terror Tuesday'' with flashcards \n     and powerpoint presentation.\n\n  Noah Feldman, a colleague of David Barron, writes:\n\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\n\n       . . . no precedent for the idea that due process could be \n     satisfied by some secret, internal process within the \n     executive branch.\n\n  So to those of my colleagues who will come on down here today and \njust stamp ``approval'' on someone who I believe disrespects the Bill \nof Rights, realize that other esteemed professors, other esteemed \ncolleagues at Harvard disagree and that you cannot have due process by \na secret internal process within the executive branch.\n  To those who say, oh, the memos are now not secret, are we going to \nbe promised that from now on this is going to be a public debate and \nthat there will be some form of due process? No. I suspect it will be \ndone in secret by the executive branch because that is the new norm. \nYou are voting for someone who has made this the historic precedent for \nhow we will kill Americans overseas--in secret, by one branch of the \nadministration, without representation based upon an accusation. We \nhave gone from having to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to \nan accusation being enough for an execution. I am horrified that this \nis where we are.\n  To my colleagues, I would say that to make an honest judgment, you \nshould look at this nomination as if it came from the opposite party. I \ncan promise--and this would absolutely be my opinion, and this isn't \nthe most popular opinion to take in the country--that I would oppose \nthis nomination were it coming from a Republican President.\n  But what I would ask of my Democratic colleagues is to look deeply \nwithin their soul, to look deeply within their psyche and say: How \nwould I vote if this were a Bush nominee? If this were a Bush nominee \nwho had written legal opinions justifying torture in 2007, 2006, 2005, \nhow would I have voted?\n  I think 90 percent would have voted against and would now vote \nagainst a Bush nominee.\n  This has become partisan and this body has become too partisan. There \nwas a time when there were great believers in the Constitution in this \nbody, and we have degenerated into a body of partisanship. There was a \ntime when the filibuster actually could have stopped this nomination. \nThere was a time when there would have been compromise. There was a \ntime in this body when we would get people more toward the mainstream \nof legal thought because those on each extreme would be excluded from \nholding office.\n  The people who have argued so forcefully for majority vote, for not \nhaving the filibuster, are the ones who are responsible now for \nallowing this nomination to go forward. This nomination would not go \nforward were it not for the elimination of the filibuster.\n  Some say about the filibuster: Oh, that was obstructionism.\n  The filibuster was also in many cases about trying to prevent \nextremists from getting on the bench. We will now allow someone who has \nan extreme point of view, someone who has questioned whether guilt must \nbe determined beyond a reasonable doubt, someone who now says that an \naccusation is enough for the death penalty. Now, that person may say: \nOnly if you are overseas. Well, some consolation if you are a traveler.\n  What I would say is we need to think long and hard and examine this \nnomination objectively as if this were a nomination from a President of \nthe opposite party. We need to ask ourselves: How precious is the \nconcept of presumption of innocence? How precious are our Bill of \nRights?\n  We need to examine--and it is hard when you know someone is guilty, \nwhen you have seen the evidence and you feel that this person deserves \npunishment. I sympathize with that and think that this person did \ndeserve punishment. But I also sympathize so greatly with the concept \nof having a jury trial, so greatly that an accusation is different from \na conviction, that I can't allow this to go forward without some \nobjection. I hope this body will consider this and will reconsider this \nnomination.\n  At the appropriate time I will offer a unanimous consent request to \ndelay the David Barron nomination until the public has had a chance to \nread his memo. I will return at an appropriate time, and we will offer \nthat as a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, it wasn't very long ago when the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I were on the floor talking about drones, and I want \nto make sure it is understood that Senator Paul's passion, intellectual \nrigor, and devotion to these issues of liberty and security--which he \nand I have worked on together now for a number of years--is much \nappreciated.\n  I come to the floor today to address the issue Senator Paul and I \nhave discussed in the past, and that is how vigorous oversight--and \nparticularly vigorous oversight over the intelligence field--needs more \nattention. It is not something we can minimize. It goes right to the \nheart of the values the Senator from Kentucky and I and others have \ntalked about, and that is liberty and security are not mutually \nexclusive. We can have both.\n  The Senator from Kentucky and I often joke about how the Senate would \nbenefit from a Ben Franklin caucus. Ben Franklin famously said, in \neffect, that anybody who gives up their liberty for security doesn't \ndeserve either.\n  The Senator from Kentucky and I have certainly had some disagreements \nfrom time to time on a particular judicial nomination, but I thank him \nfor his time this morning, and I thank him for the opportunity we have \nhad over the years to make the case about how important these issues \nare. The American people ought to insist that their elected officials \nput in place policies which ensure we have both liberty and security. I \nthank the Senator from Kentucky for that, and I have some brief remarks \nthis morning.\n  Of course, the Senate is going to vote on the nomination of David \nBarron to serve as a judge for the First Judicial Circuit. His \nnomination has been endorsed by a wide variety of Americans, including \nrespected jurists from across the political spectrum.\n  Mr. Barron has received particularly vocal endorsements from some of \nour country's most prominent civil rights groups. Of course, the aspect \nof his record that has perhaps received the closest scrutiny in recent \nweeks is his authorship of a legal opinion regarding the President's \nauthority to use military force against an individual who is both a \nU.S. citizen and senior leader of Al-Qaeda. I am quite familiar with \nthis particular memo.\n  The executive branch first acknowledged its existence 3 years ago in \nresponse to a question I asked at an open hearing of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. I followed up by working with my colleagues \nand pressing the executive branch to provide this memo to the \nintelligence committee.\n  This month, of course, the administration made this memo available to \nall Members of the Senate. Executive branch officials have now said \nthey will provide this memo to the American people as well. This is \nclearly, in my view, a very constructive step, and I am going to vote \nyes on Mr. Barron's nomination.\n  I want to take a minute to outline that this whole matter is about \nmuch\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\nmore than a single memo. It drives home how incredibly important \nvigorous congressional oversight is, which is, of course, the mission \nof the intelligence committee, and it is the mission of all of us.\n  In his classic work on democratic government, Woodrow Wilson wrote \nthat conducting oversight was one of the most important functions of \nCongress. He suggested it might be more important than passing \nlegislation. Woodrow Wilson wrote:\n\n       It is the proper duty of a representative body to look \n     diligently into every affair of government and to talk much \n     about what it sees.\n\n  He added that Congress must examine ``the acts and disposition'' of \nthe executive branch and ``scrutinize and sift them by every form of \ndiscussion.'' Woodrow Wilson said if the Congress failed in this duty, \nthen the American people would remain ignorant ``of the very affairs \nwhich it is most important that [they] understand and direct.''\n  Woodrow Wilson might not have been able to anticipate the size and \nscale of the modern national security apparatus, but I believe his \nwords are as true today as they were a century ago.\n  As the elected representative of nearly 4 million Americans, I have \nspent years now working from the theory that all of us in the Senate \nhave an obligation to understand how the executive branch is \ninterpreting the President's authority to use military force against \nAmericans who have taken up arms against our Nation. I have long \nbelieved it is my obligation to make sure that those I am honored to \nrepresent in Redmond, Troutdale, and Dallas, and all across Oregon, \nunderstand that as well. I believe every American has the right to know \nwhen their government believes it is allowed to kill them.\n  In the case in question, as I have said before, I believe the \nPresident's decision to authorize a military strike in those particular \ncircumstances was legitimate and lawful. I have detailed my views on \nthis case in a letter to the Attorney General that is posted on my Web \nsite.\n  I agree with the conclusion Mr. Barron reached in what has now \ncertainly become a famous memo. To be clear, while I agree with the \nconclusion, this is not a memo I would have written. It contains, in \neffect, some analytical leaps I would not endorse. It jumps to several \nconclusions, and it certainly leaves a number of important questions \nunanswered.\n  I am hopeful that making this memo public will help generate the \npublic pressure that is needed to get those additional questions \nanswered. I am talking here about fundamental questions, such as: How \nmuch evidence does the President need to determine that a particular \nAmerican is a legitimate target for military action? Can the President \nstrike an American anywhere in the world? What does it mean to say that \ncapture must be ``infeasible''? And exactly what other limits and \nboundaries apply to this authority?\n  Mr. Barron was not asked to answer these questions, but it is my view \nit is vitally important that the American people get answers to those \nquestions. In my view, those questions are essential to understanding \nhow Americans' constitutional rights will be protected in the age of \n21st century warfare, and I am going to stay at it until the American \npeople get answers to those questions.\n  In addition to getting detailed public answers to these matters, \nanother important step will be for the Congress to review the other \nJustice Department memos regarding the President's authority to use \nmilitary force outside of an active war zone. Clearly, the most \nimportant memos on this topic are the ones the Congress has now seen \nregarding the use of lethal force against Americans, but it is also \ngoing to be important for the Senate to review the memos on other \naspects of this authority as well.\n  The past few years have shown when the public is allowed to see and \ndebate how our government interprets the law, it has led to meaningful \nchanges in terms of ensuring that there are additional protections for \nprivacy and civil liberties without sacrificing our country's security \nat a dangerous time.\n  It is unfortunate that it took Mr. Barron's nomination for the \nJustice Department to make these memos public. I will say it has been \nfrustrating over the past few years to see the Justice Department's \nresistance to providing Congress with memos that outline the executive \nbranch's official understanding of the law. When Mr. Barron was the \nhead of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, I believe \ncongressional requests to see particular classified memos and legal \nopinions were appropriately granted. However, in the years since Mr. \nBarron moved on from that position, congressional requests to see memos \nand opinions have frequently been stonewalled--and I use those words \nspecifically--frequently stonewalled.\n  The executive branch often makes the argument that these memos \nconstitute confidential, predecisional legal advice to the President. \nHere is the problem with that argument: The President has to be able to \nget confidential legal advice before he makes a decision, but once a \ndecision has been made and the legal memo from the Justice Department \nhas been sent to the agencies that will carry out the President's \ndecision, that memo is no longer predecisional advice; it is the \ngovernment's official legal basis for actual acts of war, and as such, \nin my view, it is entirely unacceptable to withhold it from the \nCongress.\n  Congress has the power to declare war, and Congress votes on whether \nto continue funding wars, so it is vital for the Congress to understand \nwhat the executive branch believes the President's war powers actually \nare. In that classic work I have discussed from Woodrow Wilson, he \nsaid:\n\n       It is even more important to know how the house is being \n     built than to know how the plans of the architect were \n     conceived.\n\n  As a former basketball player, I often say that sections of the \nplaybook for combating terrorism will often need to be secret, but the \nrule book the United States follows should always be available to the \nAmerican people--all of the American people. Our military intelligence \nagencies often need to conduct secret operations, but they should never \nbe placed in the position of relying on secret law.\n  I am very pleased this morning that we know the executive branch is \ngoing to provide this memo to the American people, and I believe this \nconstructive step must lead to additional steps that are equally \nimportant. This episode is an object lesson in how the U.S. Congress \ncan use the levers it has to fulfill one of the most important \nfunctions of government. As my colleagues and I engage in our personal \ndiscussions about how to make Congress more functional, I hope this is \nan experience we will remember.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3202-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3202-S3204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about the \ncontinuing concerns we see in our office and hear from Missourians \nabout what is happening with the implementation of the health care \nplan. The more people know about the path we are on with health care, \nthe more concerned they appear to become.\n  I know the White House has suggested that somehow the numbers would \nreflect that people have responded to this program in a positive way. \nWhen you take away the health insurance people have and there is only \none place they can go to get the insurance they think they need, \nobviously they are going to go there, but that doesn't mean they like \nit.\n  In fact, there is a new political poll that suggests nearly half of \nthe American voters say they are for outright repeal of this law, and \nnearly 90 percent say it will be important to them in determining how \nthey will vote this year.\n  Another point in terms of why we want to start over again is \neverybody knows what the consequences are when you make a bad decision \nabout people's health care in a way that I think most Americans would \nnot have anticipated in 2009 and 2010. When you fundamentally get \ninvolved in issues that impact people and their families, such as \nhealth care, and do things that fundamentally impact the way their \nmoney is going to be spent, and that decision is made by the Federal \nGovernment instead of by that family whose only decision might be to \npay a penalty or not have insurance at all or\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\npay a whole lot more than they were paying, the government has involved \nitself in an area where the government should have looked for better \nchoices, more options, more ways to seek coverage, and better ways to \nbe sure you can have coverage if you had a preexisting condition. All \nof those, by the way, were proposed. These are not ideas that weren't \nout there a few years ago, but they would be taken much more seriously \ntoday if we did what nearly half of the American voters say we should \nbe doing, and let's just see what would happen if we start all over.\n\n  Several States have announced that their Web sites will not work. \nThis includes Oregon and Massachusetts. There is a report that four of \nthe failed State exchanges cost $474 million of taxpayer money, spent \nin Nevada, Massachusetts, Maryland, Oregon--just those four--for \nsystems that then wouldn't work.\n  Many of these systems around the country that now are being abandoned \nwere put in place partially, if not totally, with grants from the \nFederal Government. If a State gets a grant from the Federal Government \nto do something and then it doesn't do it, every other grantee has to \ngive the money back. A State can't say it is going to take millions of \ndollars from Federal taxpayers to put together an exchange and then \nannounce it didn't work out very well and then have no obligation to \ngive that money back. There was a time when there appeared to be great \nconcern in Washington that States weren't putting an exchange in place. \nNow we find out that States with this particular plan, ill-conceived as \nit was, can't put a system in place apparently that works. The State of \nOregon, one of the earliest advocates of adopting this system, my \nbelief is and I have read, wasn't able to sign up one single person \nfrom October 1 until they abandoned their Web site just a few days \nago--not one person.\n  Subsidies appear to be incorrect. The Washington Post reported last \nweekend that 1 million Americans who have enrolled in the plan may be \ngetting incorrect health care subsidies because the Web site was \ndefective and didn't appropriately calculate what the subsidy would be. \nIf people get too much of a subsidy, they have to pay it back. If they \nget too little of a subsidy, they may decide they are not going to take \nthe health insurance available because they are not getting the \nassistance they had hoped for. Potentially hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans are, according to that article, receiving bigger subsidies \nthan they deserve and will be required to return the excess next year.\n  Under Federal rules, consumers are notified if there is a problem \nwith their application and asked to send in or upload pay stubs or \nother proof of their income. Apparently, only a fraction have done what \nthey are supposed to do. Whose fault is that? If the government \nallocates the subsidy and if a person hasn't complied with the law, is \nthat the person's fault or the government's fault? It is the \ngovernment's job to comply with the law and to insist that people \ncomply if they are going to be part of a Federal program. It is not a \nperson's absolute obligation to say, I need to send that final piece of \npaper in, if the government is saying we are going to give you this \nsubsidy. Don't worry about sending this in, we are going to do this \nanyway. But there will be a reconciliation moment where people find out \ntheir subsidy was more than they deserved and suddenly they have to pay \nit back.\n  The processing centers. KMOV, a television station in St. Louis, \nrecently broke a story regarding the claims of workers at a Wentzville, \nMO, facility that was one of a handful of facilities the Federal \nGovernment financed around the country to handle paper applications. \nNot only, on one side, did the applications not appear to work coming \nin on the Web site--the easiest thing one would have thought possible--\nthe easier thing, I guess, suddenly we find out, would have been to \nfill out the paper application and send it to one of these locations \nthat was set up.\n  Contract costs of over $1 billion, 600 people working at the \nWentzville site, and the allegations from people working there are that \nthere is just nothing to do. They are told to refresh their computers \nonce every 10 minutes--hit the refresh button--so it appears they are \ndoing something, so 600 people don't process more than one or two \napplications a month and that way everybody has a chance to process one \napplication. My belief is these are the kinds of applications people \nwould have assumed every individual would have easily processed dozens \na day. Yet they are told not to process more than one or two a month \nbecause there just aren't that many people making applications at these \ncenters.\n  The television station KMOV did a Freedom of Information Act request \nto CMS on April 8. They are 2 weeks past the 20 days the government is \nsupposed to have to comply. I wonder what would happen if a taxpayer \nhad an EPA penalty and the taxpayer was a couple of weeks late in \ncomplying with whatever that penalty is.\n  Last week I joined Senator Alexander, who is the ranking member of \nthe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, in a \nletter to the CMS Administrator expressing my concerns and his concerns \nand requesting answers to a number of questions no later than the end \nof this month. Hopefully, they will do better complying with us than \nthey did with the Freedom of Information Act and the St. Louis \nreporter.\n  The full 5-year contract has a balance of up to $1.25 billion. The \nWentzville facility reportedly employs about 600 people. We are now \nhearing from a couple of the other facilities that they have exactly \nthe same problem. They are going to work, they have a library with \nbooks stacked on the table so people can read a book during the day so \nthey can wait for what I guess they think eventually will be this \nonslaught of applications coming in, but so far it hasn't happened. We \nhave passed October 1, November 1, December 1, January 1, February 1, \nMarch 1, April 1, May 1, and soon June 1. One would think these would \nbe coming in because we are paying these people to do this.\n  Frankly, people need jobs, so it is hard to fault them for showing up \nevery day until somebody says: The truth is there is no work here for \nmaybe 590 of the 600 employees; maybe we need to eliminate these \nparticular jobs which were supposedly to help implement this system. \nFacilities in Missouri, Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma--there are lots of \nindications that everybody is having the same experience.\n  The American part of this company, Serco, is based in Reston, VA, but \nthis is a British company. They were already in trouble with the \nBritish Government, I have read, for not providing the services they \nguaranteed to provide. It is amazing to me that to do the work to \nimplement this program, we get a Canadian company to design the Web \nsite, which is already in trouble with the Canadian Government for \nfailure to do what they said they would do, but we hired that company \nanyway. One would think there would be American companies that aren't \nin trouble with anybody's government that could design the Web site. \nThen we got a British company that is in trouble with the British \nGovernment to operate these centers for the written applications. No \nwonder taxpayers are wondering, Who is minding the store? Who is \nmanaging the government? Who is doing this work that would make common \nsense anywhere else?\n  I continue to hear from Missouri families every week about the \nproblems they have. We talk to them and we verify these problems. We \nthen try to find a solution, including going through the Affordable \nCare Act, trying to find assistance so they can afford to pay for a \npolicy that costs more than they ever thought they would pay, but we \nare not finding those solutions.\n  I have a few letters, one from a retired substitute teacher who is no \nlonger able to work the substitute hours they were able to work because \nof the unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act. Thirty \nhours, the law says, is when employers have to provide full-time \nbenefits. Different companies had different rules in the past. If we go \nback to the 40-hour workweek, a lot of people would be working 35, 36, \nand 38 hours. Now they are working 25 and 26 and 28 hours.\n  Another letter is from a student, Stephanie, in Jackson, MO. The \nschoolteacher was in Kansas City. Stephanie\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nin Jackson is trying to go to school and trying to do everything she \ncan to pay her own way through school, but her hours have been cut at \nwork. She was working in the past more than 30 hours to try to do what \nkids used to do. What is one of the solutions to not having a lot of \ndebt when you get out of college? Work your way through school. What is \none of the things the Affordable Care Act has made it harder to do? \nWork your way through school. So Stephanie, the student, says she is \nlooking for a second part-time job now that would give her the hours \nshe used to have in her other part-time job because of the consequences \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  Just a couple more examples. Rich from Portageville, MO, his rates \nhave increased from $412 a month to $732 a month. Rick says he is 49 \nyears old. His policy covers him and his son who is 22 years old. They \nare both healthy, but their insurance went up $320 a month.\n  Roy from Oak Ridge, MO, says his deductible has gone from $250 to \n$650, and if his wife wasn't a veteran and couldn't get her medications \nthrough the Veterans' Administration, they would have real health care \nproblems.\n  Just one last example. Rodney from New Franklin, MO, says his rates \nhave jumped. He says: My health insurance for my wife and myself has \njumped from $320 per month to over $700 per month, and now there is a \n$5,000 deductible, despite the fact that we are both in great health. \nIt doesn't include eye or dental coverage. I am self-employed, Rodney \nsays. So it makes a very big difference to him whether he can continue \nto pay well over two times what he was paying before, with a higher \ndeductible.\n  Problems with implementing the system appear to not be dealt with in \nthe right way, and then what happens when people do get coverage. It \nturns out for them not to be coverage they can afford. Of course, \nwhether they had a policy they liked, almost nobody has been able to \nkeep the policy they had, particularly if they had it as an individual. \nI think we are going to see fewer and fewer people having the policies \nthey have had at work.\n  I will go back to the almost 50 percent of Americans who say: Why \ndon't we start over and do this the commonsense way and solve these \nproblems in a way that benefits families and their health care rather \nthan benefiting more government employees and more government \nregulations?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the nomination of David \nBarron to be a Federal court of appeals judge. I commend my friend \nSenator Rand Paul for his excellent remarks earlier today and his \nleadership against Mr. Barron's nomination.\n  I have known Mr. Barron for a long time. He and I were classmates in \nlaw school. He is a smart man. He is a talented man. He is a professor \nat Harvard Law School and he is a well-respected professor. However, \nMr. Barron is an unabashed judicial activist. He is an unapologetic and \nvocal advocate for judges applying liberal policy from the bench and \ndisregarding the terms of the Constitution and the laws of the land. If \nthe Members of this body vote to confirm him, we will bear \nresponsibility for undermining liberty and undermining the rule of law \nin this country.\n  It is well known that Mr. Barron, as a senior official in the Obama \nJustice Department, authored memos allowing the U.S. Government to use \ndrones to kill American citizens abroad who were known and suspected to \nbe terrorists, without any trial, without any due process. To date, we \nstill don't have the details of all of those memos. A number of us, \nincluding myself, have called for releasing the memos that would allow \nthe U.S. Government to use lethal force against U.S. citizens. I am \npleased to say the administration has, in part, complied, but we don't \nhave all of those memos. Yet this body is being asked to proceed with \ngiving Mr. Barron a lifetime appointment without knowing the full \ncontext of the advice he gave.\n\n  I would note that Mr. Barron previously, in 2006, joined a group of \nlegal scholars calling for more transparency in the OLC opinions that \nhe subsequently wrote and that the administration is now keeping \nsecret.\n  But beyond that, beyond Mr. Barron providing the legal basis for the \ntargeted killings of American citizens abroad without judicial process, \nMr. Barron, both in law school and in his writings as a law professor, \nhas been an enthusiastic advocate of judicial activism. It has become \nde rigueur for judicial nominees to forswear activism, to say--even if \ntheir record is to the contrary--no, no, no, Senator, I will comply \nwith the law. To Mr. Barron's credit, his writings have a degree of \ncandor that are unusual.\n  So, for example, he has argued that courts should override elected \nState legislatures and enforce leftwing policies. Mr. Barron, in one \nparticular law review, wrote:\n\n       State supreme Courts, not state legislatures, have also led \n     the revolution in school financing equality, though judicial \n     actions have catalyzed political responses.\n\n  He went on to say that liberals should not object to conservative \ncourt decisions because ``progressive constitutionalists enamored of \nthe Anti-Court rhetoric rarely take account of its potential downstream \neffects on state-court interpretation and legitimacy.''\n  In other words, he is worried that people on the left might be \narguing that courts should follow the law because that would constrain \nthe ability of courts to instead impose a far-left political policy \nagenda.\n  Likewise, in a different article, he argues:\n\n       It is precisely because the Anti-Court strain singles out \n     conservative judicial activism as the problem that it \n     threatens to work progressive constitutional theory into a \n     corner: it needlessly rejects the progressive potential of a \n     significant wielder of power--the courts. . . .\n\n  Let me underscore that. Every Member of this body who votes to \nconfirm Mr. Barron is voting for a candidate who has stated he intends \nto use the courts as a ``significant wielder of power.'' Indeed, what \nis the agenda that he would embrace? He has elsewhere written:\n\n       We contend that the constitutional argument favoring \n     preclusive executive power necessarily rests on a strong form \n     of living constitutionalism.\n\n  There are Members of this body--Democratic Members of this body--who \nare campaigning right now in their home State saying they do not \nsupport judicial activism, they do not support a so-called living \nconstitution, judges imposing far-left policies and disregarding the \nlaw. Well, let me say, any Democratic Member of this body who votes for \nMr. Barron is on record in support of judicial activism and living \nconstitutionalism.\n  Beyond that, Mr. Barron has explicitly written his opposition to \nfederalism. Indeed, he says, ``There is precious little in the \nConstitution's text or the history of its adoption that compels the \nparticular conservative allocation of national local powers favored by \nthe Rehnquist Court.''\n  He has made clear his agenda to overturn or ignore Supreme Court \nprecedents. When he says there is ``little in the . . . text or the \nhistory,'' it seems somehow that he has not read or focused on the \nTenth Amendment or the Federalist Papers or the debates on \nratification.\n  Beyond that, he is an emphatic advocate of the takings clause, of \ngovernment power taking private property, such as the Kelo decision--\nbig money interests going to government and using government power to \ncondemn your private land. He is an emphatic advocate of that and of \ncourts facilitating and expanding that.\n  He has written that the executive branch should be able to waive laws \nwith which it disagrees--a lawlessness that, sadly, has run rampant in \nthis administration.\n  Anyone who cares about property rights should be dismayed by this \nnomination and should vote against it if you do not want to see overly \naggressive takings jurisprudence that allows the government to take \nyour private property.\n  Anyone concerned about free speech should be concerned about this \nnomination if you do not want to see expansive government power taking \naway the rights of citizenry to free speech.\n  Anyone who cares about local control and federalism and the ability \nof local school boards and legislatures to make policy decisions should \nbe concerned.\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\n  Anyone concerned about our right to life should be concerned about \ndrones having the power to take our life without judicial process.\n  Anyone concerned about liberty and the rule of law should be deeply \nconcerned about a judicial nominee who embraces courts as a tool of \npower and the President disregarding the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business until 12:15 \np.m.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, Senator Cruz makes an impassioned plea \nagainst a nominee who is considered by some to be exemplary. It is his \nright to do that, but let me say before my friend leaves the floor, as \nimpassioned as he is, calling Mr. Barron a liberal, I have heard many \ncall Mr. Barron a conservative. So he must be doing something right. I \nthink it is interesting. So let's keep politics out of this and look at \nsomeone's record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3205-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3205-S3210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 WRRDA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, with all the arguments and debate that \ngo on around here in a very legitimate way--it is fair. The parties \nhave grown very far apart--whether you look at the minimum wage, with \nthe Democrats wanting to raise it, with some Republicans who say do \naway with it altogether; with extended unemployment benefits, where we \ncan barely get a handful of them to go along with us--I could go on \nthrough the list. We are going to have a chance to make sure students \nhave a fair shot at refinancing their student loans. We do not know \nwhere they are, but so far I have not seen them join Senator Warren in \nher very important move to allow students to refinance their student \nloans. I could go through a list longer than I am tall. I am not that \ntall, but still it is 5 feet of differences.\n  We finally have come together in a way that I am very proud. As \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, we have two \nsides of our committee--the environment side, which tends to be very \ndifficult, very difficult, with big splits; and then we have the public \nworks side. By putting aside our differences--our deep differences--on \nthe environment and focusing on the other side, we have been able to \ncome up with a couple of really good bills.\n  The first one is the Water Resources Reform and Development Act \ncalled WRRDA. It is so important to our Nation, whether you are a \ncoastal port or an inland port, and it is crucial that this get done.\n  The last WRDA bill was nearly 7 years ago. I was proud to be involved \nin that at that time. This one--7 years later--is long overdue. I am \ngoing to talk to you more about it. We also voted out a highway bill \nout of our committee. We are very proud of that. Senator Vitter and I \nworked very closely, and Senator Barrasso, Senator Carper, and all the \nMembers on both sides and their wonderful staffs.\n  So tomorrow, I believe, we are going to vote on WRRDA, we are going \nto vote on the water bill. I know we have a very hectic day tomorrow, \nso rather than take the time then, I am going to take the time now, and \nI am hoping to be joined by some colleagues today. But if not, I will \nlay out why we need to do this bill.\n  First, I want to say a wonderful thing happened in the House \nyesterday when the conference report passed over in the House 412 to 4. \nThat was really pretty terrific. Everyone pretty much rose above \npartisan politics. I am very pleased that Senator Reid is moving \nforward with this report and all colleagues on both sides want us to \npass that conference report and send it to the President. He will sign \nthis bill.\n  Let me tell you what is at stake: at least half a million jobs--half \na million jobs.\n  First of all, we deal with ports and waterways. The conference \nagreement makes important investments in reforms related to our \nNation's ports. Our Nation's ports and waterways move over 2.3 billion \ntons of goods--that is amazing--every year; 2.3 billion tons of goods. \nSo we need to keep our ports modernized. We need to invest in our \nports. So in this bill we do.\n  We include a project in Texas, for example, to widen and deepen the \nSabine-Neches waterway, which will have over $115 million in annual \nbenefits. This critical waterway transports over 100,000 tons of goods \nevery year. It is the Nation's top port for movement of commercial \nmilitary goods. And it is vital to our Nation's energy security.\n  This bill will allow the Corps to address dangerous cross currents at \nthe Port of Jacksonville, FL--that is another example--that create \nsafety concerns for ships entering and exiting the port. It also allows \nthe deepening of this vital hub of commerce.\n  The bill also authorizes a project to deepen the Boston Harbor to 50 \nfeet. This will prevent heavier road traffic in the busy Northeastern \ncorridor by allowing larger vessels coming through the newly deepened \nPanama Canal to transport cargo all the way north to Boston Harbor. \nWithout the access to Boston, these vessels would have to offload in \nother ports and put the cargo on trucks to their final destinations in \nthe Northeast.\n  Madam President, what I would like to do now is yield to my friend, \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  I just want to say--and I will finish my remarks when she has \ncompleted hers because she has a very hectic schedule and I am able to \nstay on the floor for a while--whenever I see Senator Landrieu she \ntalks to me about her State. And her State is magnificent. I have been \nthere. I was there after Katrina, at her urging. I have been there \nsince to see some of the progress we have made. But Louisiana is a \nspecial place. And this special Senator never forgets what needs to be \ndone, and part of it is playing a big role in a bill like the Water \nResources Reform and Development Act.\n  So at this time I will yield, if it is all right, through the Chair. \nAm I permitted to do this? Can I yield the time that I took to my \nfriend for as much time as she may consume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the courtesy of the chairwoman from California and for her \nreally extraordinary leadership to bring such an important \ninfrastructure bill to the floor of the Senate.\n  Without her dogged determination, we would not be here today and \nLouisiana and so many other States that are benefiting from the \nprojects authorized and green-lighted in this bill would simply still \nbe waiting, with jobs not being created, people not being employed, and \nthe future looking a lot less bright than it does today. I thank the \nSenator so very much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You're welcome.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Not only has she given attention to her home State of \nCalifornia, but she has been very mindful of several other States in \nthe Union that have particularly difficult water challenges. Louisiana \nwould be one such State. Louisiana is not our largest State. It is not \nsmall. It is in the medium size. It has 4.5 million people. But yet our \nState is positioned geographically in the country, in the Lower 48, \nthat we drain almost 50 percent of the continent. The water of this \ncontinent comes through this extraordinary delta almost without peer on \nthe planet. It is the seventh largest delta on Earth.\n  While some States are struggling to find water, we normally have too \nmuch of it in the wrong places--or at times we have too much of it in \nthe wrong places, such as when Lake Pontchartrain breached the drainage \nproject program. The project collapsed and two-thirds of the city of \nNew Orleans went under water--some neighborhoods 14 feet. When Isaac \nhit or Ike or other hurricanes, we had really been bombarded with \ntremendous challenges to the southern part of the United States.\n  Every region has their challenges. But the southern part of the \nUnited States, what I like to call America's energy coast--Texas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--has particular challenges that \nneed addressing in this\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nbill. I thank Senator Boxer for addressing some of them, particularly \nas it relates to Louisiana's challenges because our challenge is not \nonly to keep commerce open for everyone so the entire country can \nbenefit--especially when the Panama Canal opens; larger ships are going \nto be moving across the oceans into our ports. The Mississippi River \nport system combines all the four southern ports of the Mississippi \nRiver, and it is the largest port system in the world--not second; the \nlargest port system in the world--so we have a responsibility to make \nsure this commerce continues to move.\n  So we have to have rivers and bodies of water that are open for \ncommerce but protected with the right kinds of levees that protect the \npeople who live there so we do not drown every time it rains heavily. \nWe are not talking about category 4 and 5 hurricanes. We are talking \nabout highways that go underwater in a heavy rain because the delta is \nsinking due to several factors. The waters are rising due to several \nfactors. This WRRDA bill is one of the only answers to build a \nresilient and sustainable coast. That is why the Louisiana delegation \nfights so hard for it, why we are so anxious for this bill, why we do \nnot like to wait 7 years for a WRDA bill, because we need new \nauthorizations every 2 to 3 years.\n  In fact, we need a whole new way of funding some of these projects, \nwhich is a work in progress. I look forward to continuing to work with \nSenator Boxer. As an appropriator, I am very anxious to find a new, \nmore expedited way. I have proposed revenue sharing and will continue \nto propose revenue sharing as a way for not only Louisiana but coastal \nStates to redirect a portion of offshore oil and gas revenues to come \nback to the coastal communities, America's energy coast, America's \nworking coast, and build the infrastructure that helps our economy \ncontinue to grow, create jobs and, most importantly or equally \nimportantly, protect the people that have to live close to the water \nfor those jobs and for those jobs to be made real and for the economy \nto benefit.\n  Not everybody can live in Vail, CO, and commute to the coast every \nday to work. It is not going to happen. We have to live along these \nrivers, and we have been living there an awfully long time--300 years \nas far as Natchitoches, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. They will be \ncelebrating--just three cities in our State--their 300th birthday.\n  We did not move there in the 1980s to sunbathe. We have been down \nthere for hundreds of years building the economy of this country. We \nare proud to do it. We are happy to do it. But we need help every now \nand then. This bill helps us. The WRRDA bill is important.\n  There are a couple of projects--I am going to finish in about 3 or 4 \nminutes, and turn it back over to Senator Boxer. First, there is \nMorganza to the Gulf, which was originally authorized over 20 years \nago. That is going to provide levee and flood control protection to one \nof the fastest growing, most dynamic cities in this country--Houma, LA. \nIt is an energy epicenter. It is an energy powerhouse for the people of \nHouma, the fabrication, the supply companies--such as in North Dakota--\nwhich is really one of the fastest growing communities in our country.\n  The Presiding Officer can appreciate this. We are like that on the \ncoast, except that when the hurricanes come, it literally threatens to \nwash away the whole place because there are no levees around Houma.\n  The Presiding Officer had terrible flooding in her State, so she can \nappreciate what happens when the levee system fails. But we are not \nonly along rivers, we are also along the coast, and we are also a \nstrong energy center. It is not just the people and the companies, \nwhich range from very small mom-and-pop businesses to some of the \nlargest international energy companies in the world, but it is \ninternational fabricators that have billions of dollars of \ninfrastructure along this coast that are at risk.\n  So this Morganza project, it was not originally in the House bill. I \nfought very hard to make sure that it was in the Senate version. I want \nto give Senator Vitter a good bit of credit for his leadership on the \ncommittee. I do not want to underestimate the role that he played in \nsecuring all of these projects. But we worked together as a team to \nmake sure that Morganza to the Gulf was included.\n  I am very proud that it was in the final conference report, a $10.3 \nbillion authorization. The Louisiana coastal area for $2.1 billion is \nalso included. It is one of the only new starts in the President's \nbudget. It is authorized at a higher level in this bill. Again, we are \ngoing to have to find some additional funding, which is where revenue \nsharing comes in. I hope to convince my colleagues to move in that \ndirection for the benefit of not just our State but for many coastal \nStates in the country.\n  Building this coastal protection for Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, \nAlabama, and Florida is critical, but so are the east coast and the \nwest coast in great need as well. One of the projects--and I have two \nmore to talk about that I am particularly proud of--is the \nauthorization for us to get about the work of dredging the New Iberia \nport. I have tried to explain it on this floor because we only think \nabout ports such as the traditional big cargo ports.\n  You think about Long Beach, you think about the Port of Seattle or \nyou think about New York and New Jersey. That is what people think when \nthey think ports. Those are big cargo ports and big container ports. \nThey are very important. But also tucked along our coasts are energy \nports that people completely forget about. They do not even know what \nan energy port looks like. I am very proud to be taking Secretary Moniz \nto his first energy port next week in Louisiana. These energy ports are \nnot bringing in big containers and big cargo ships, but they are \nbringing in liquefied natural gas, or taking it out, or they are \nbringing in oil imported from the rest of the world or exporting--when \nwe can export. But right now they are bringing crude oil in. They are \nmanufacturing the huge platforms and fabricating the huge platforms \nthat go out into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Without the proper dredging of those ports, without the proper \nsecurity of these ports, America cannot be an energy powerhouse. We \njust cannot do it. We have to have that port infrastructure. So one of \nmy big pushes since I have been a Senator is to try to get the Federal \nGovernment to understand that one size does not fit all. There are \ncertain projects that work well for these big container ports and big \ncargo ports, but there are other important ports in our country, \nparticularly along America's energy coast, which is the Texas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama coast, the only coast that allows \noffshore oil and gas drilling, to allow that industry to continue to \ngrow, so that the country prospers and all the States are benefited by \nthe work that goes on there.\n  So the New Iberia port channel will be dredged deeper. Fabricators \nwill be able to have more projects domestically here and not have to do \nso much work in Korea and other places around the world. We can produce \nusing American steel, American workers, American fabrication techniques \nto create jobs right here at home.\n\n  Finally, Senator Boxer was so helpful in pressing for the Inland \nWaterways Trust Fund, to authorize the trust fund, to basically say \nthat moneys that are collected will stay in the trust fund and be used \nand authorized to help our dams and inland waterways around the \ncountry.\n  Senator Casey and I have an amendment pending on the floor that would \nmake sure that the increases in user fees could potentially be applied \nthis year so that it is not just an authorization but so there is \nactually funding in the trust fund to pay for these projects which are \nso important to keep our maritime industry moving and growing, which is \na real feather in our cap right now.\n  The maritime industry is expanding. It pays much above the average \nwage. They are really high-paying jobs. Instead of stymieing their \ngrowth, we need to be expanding that part of our economy.\n  So this WRRDA bill, because of Senator Boxer's leadership, first of \nall, has gotten to the floor for a vote. It never would have happened \nwithout her dogged determination. There are wonderful projects, \nnecessary projects for the whole country, but particularly for \nLouisiana, a State that has an awful lot of water. We are happy to have \nit, but it has to be directed correctly or it\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\ncan cause many disasters and much heartache and pain.\n  So getting our rivers dredged correctly, getting our levees built so \nthey do not fail, and continuing to be diligent in helping our people \nlive safely along the coast is something that I know Senator Boxer \nshares with me. The people of California have some similar challenges \nthat she is well aware of in the Sacramento Valley. So I want to thank \nSenator Boxer. I appreciate her help and her several visits to \nLouisiana, particularly after the storm, helping to make a firm imprint \non her about the importance of this. I am excited about looking into \nthe Netherlands for a possible partner with building even stronger \ninfrastructure using really first class technology for our States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reclaim my time. I want to again say to the Senator \nthat she has made this case. This WRRDA bill is life and death. It \ntruly is in so many of our States. We all saw Katrina. We all saw \nSuperstorm Sandy. I can tell you--I know it sounds like an \noverstatement, but I can assure you it is not--if we have a situation \nlike that in the Sacramento area, because of the businesses located \nthere and how many people are there--our State has 38 million people--\nthe devastation would be worse than we have ever seen because of the \nnumber of people.\n  This bill takes care of that problem too so we can fix our levees. \nThat is critical. Our levees are falling apart. The Senator has made \nthe case so forcefully for her State, but also she calls attention to \nthe fact that we are experiencing extreme weather. We cannot put our \nheads in the sand. I was thinking the other day that if you put your \nhead in the sand, you are going to get sand in your eye and you will \nnever be able to see too well.\n  We have got to get our heads out of the sand. Extreme weather is \nhere. It is here because of climate change. We have to deal with it. My \npreference is to do what we can to avoid climate change. But it is late \nin the game even now. So we have to adapt. My friend from Louisiana, I \nhave to say, has been a stalwart in protecting her State.\n  We have heard from the Senator from Louisiana as to why WRRDA is so \nimportant. You have heard a little bit from me. I was talking about the \nimportant projects across this Nation. I discussed the one in Texas, \nthrough which they move so many military goods. I discussed the one in \nFlorida where they have these cross currents that are dangerous. I \nbegan to discuss a project to deepen Boston Harbor to 50 feet. This \nwill prevent heavier road traffic in the busy Northeast corridor by \nallowing the larger vessels coming through from the newly deepened \nPanama Canal to transport cargo all the way north to Boston Harbor.\n  Without that access to Boston, these vessels would have to offload in \nother ports and put the cargo on trucks to their final destination in \nthe Northeast. We really have to think about our ports as the \nalternative, in many cases, to putting cars on the road. In our State, \nwe call it kind of the ``sea highway.'' Our idea in California is to \ntie our ports together so there can be a seamless way to transport \ncargo.\n  In addition to authorizing crucial port projects, the bill reforms \nthe harbor maintenance trust fund to increase port investment. Despite \nsignificant maintenance needs at our Nation's ports, only roughly half \nof the fees collected in the harbor maintenance trust fund go to port \nactivities. These are user funds. They ought to be used for the purpose \nfor which they were intended. This conference report calls for a full \nexpenditure of all revenues collected in the trust fund by 2025.\n  I want to say, I have had some very good talks with the \nappropriators, Chairman Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby. They have \nports in their great States. They know the need to utilize these funds \nat the ports. We collect funds for the harbor maintenance trust fund, \nand then they are going to every other kind of use. It does not make \nsense. It is not right. I believe in user funds, whether it is the \nhighway trust fund, the harbor maintenance trust fund, whether it is \nSocial Security, Medicare--they are targeted funds. They should stay \nand be used for those purposes.\n  We do set priorities for our larger ports, smaller ports, for the \nGreat Lakes, the seaports that are large donors. We say, if you are a \nlarge donor port, you ought to deserve to have some attention. I can \ntell you, I represent the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, through \nwhich 40 percent of U.S. container imports pass.\n  They put so much money into the trust fund and they get so little \nback. There are many cases like that. I am particularly familiar with \nthese because I hear from the folks from those particular ports.\n  We also have very important inland waterway systems, and this \nconference report makes important reforms to those. It is essential for \ntransporting goods throughout the country. These include efforts to \nexpedite project delivery and better prepare for future floods and \ndroughts that can slow or even stop navigation at our inland waterways.\n  We talked a little bit about extreme weather. In the Presiding \nOfficer's State, I will never forget, just before your arrival in the \nSenate, seeing pictures of what was happening in North Dakota with \nfloods and fires. It was just the most apocalyptic scene that Senator \nConrad had photos of. It was shocking.\n  We are seeing more and more of this extreme weather. We need to get \nahead of it. We need to do much needed flood control and coastal \nhurricane protection projects around the country.\n  We talked a little bit about Sacramento, our State capital. It faces \nsome of the Nation's most severe flood risks.\n  The bill contains flood protection measures that will allow the port \nto strengthen the levees in the Natomas Basin in Sacramento. Here is \nhow many people will be safeguarded: 100,000 people will be safeguarded \nand $8 billion worth of property.\n  The bill also focuses on lifesaving flood protection for more than \n200,000 residents of Fargo, ND, and Moorhead, MN.\n  We are talking about States all across our great Nation that have to \nprotect their people.\n  The bill will restore the reliability of the levee system that \nprotects Topeka, KS. These levees protect thousands of homes and \nbusinesses in the city, and this project will return over $13 in \nbenefits for every $1 invested.\n  The bill will provide lifesaving protection for coastal communities \nin coastal Louisiana. We heard from Senator Landrieu. Senator Vitter \nwas very strong on this as we worked together.\n  When we are chairmen, we have to do what is right for the country and \nalso do what is right for our States. The conference report is going to \nimprove our responses to extreme weather events whether they occur in \nFargo, Sacramento, or New Orleans.\n  After the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm \nSandy, it became clear that communities needed assistance to protect \nlives, property, and to improve infrastructure resiliency. What does \n``resiliency'' mean? It means that you build your infrastructure in a \nresilient way so that it lasts and doesn't collapse when you need that \nprotection.\n  For the first time, this bill allows the Corps to conduct immediate \nassessments of affected watersheds following an extreme weather event. \nIn the old days, before all this extreme weather, the Corps would come \nback and fix places and make them just the way they were before the \nevent. Now we are saying: If there is an extreme weather event, please, \nCorps, identify and look at the ability to construct small flood-\ncontrol and ecosystem restoration projects, such as levees and \nfloodwalls, and restore wetlands without going through the full study \nprocess and receiving additional congressional authorization.\n  We don't waive any environmental laws. We just say: When you have an \nemergency and you can show us there are small projects that can work, \njust go do it because we want people to have their communities back.\n  The conference report calls for the Corps to use resilient \nconstruction techniques that are far more durable. I remember I was in \na big debate with a Republican Senator when we had a bridge collapse \nafter an earthquake--an approach to a bridge--and he said: Well, why \nare you spending more money than it cost to build it?\n  I said: Because we don't want to rebuild it the same way because it \ndidn't withstand an earthquake.\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\n  It is kind of a ``duh'' moment. You don't want to spend taxpayer \nmoney rebuilding a flawed piece of infrastructure. Make it strong, and \nmake it resilient. That is what we have to do. For the first time, we \nare going to make sure this happens.\n  We require the National Academy of Sciences and the GAO to evaluate \noptions for reducing risk. It is not only the Corps going out there. \nThey are going to depend upon the scientists and they are going to \ndepend upon the GAO, the Government Accountability Office.\n  The bill authorizes investment in vital ecosystem restoration \nprojects across this Nation. These projects not only preserve our \nprecious natural heritage, they also provide essential benefits to \nlocal communities, such as improved flood protection and a boost to \nlocal tourism.\n  A lot of people don't understand the function of a wetland. You see a \nstretch of wetland and you say: Wow, that is flat land. I can go build \non it.\n  Frankly, over the course of our great Nation's history, that is what \nwe used to do. We filled in those wetlands. We ignored the fact that \nthey were a gift for us to protect. Not only were they beautiful, a \nplace for wildlife, and they helped the air quality, but they acted as \nnatural flood control. When we hear Senator Landrieu discuss this--I \nwent to Louisiana, and I saw how critical that was. The wetlands \nrestoration is critical to absorbing the floodwaters so they don't \ndestroy property and lives.\n  WRRDA continues the commitment to restoring one of the Nation's \ngreatest environmental treasures--the Florida Everglades.\n  If you have never seen the Florida Everglades, you need to see the \nFlorida Everglades. It is called a river of grass. It is extraordinary. \nI will never forget it. Senator Nelson invited my husband and me. He, \nhis wife, my husband, and I went out, saw this river of grass, flora \nand fauna, and deer jumping from a little patch of grass in the water. \nIt is a miracle from God.\n  What we do is we allow four Everglades restoration projects to move \nforward.\n  We also reauthorize important restoration programs in the Chesapeake \nBay and the Columbia River Basin. I thank Senator Cardin for his \namazing leadership and, of course, Senator Mikulski as well.\n  We enable the Corps to work with the States along the North Atlantic \ncoast to restore vital coastal habitats from Virginia to Maine, and we \nallow the Corps to implement projects to better prepare for extreme \nweather in the Northern Rocky Mountain States of Montana and Idaho.\n  If you have been following this speech, I think what you will \nrecognize is how broad a swath we cut with the WRRDA bill. We truly \ntried to step back and help everybody. This is one Nation, and we need \nto take care of our heritage. That means we have to protect it from \nfloods and hurricanes, we have to make sure commerce can move forward \nfrom our ports, and we want to restore this God-given environment we \nare supposed to protect.\n  We direct the Corps to give priority to ecosystem restoration \nprojects that will also provide benefits for public health. This \nensures that projects such as the restoration of the Salton Sea--where \nI live--which both restores vital habitat and addresses serious air-\nquality concerns, can move forward.\n  The Salton Sea is amazing. It is an incredible lake. It is the stop-\noff point for the most amazing array of wildlife. It is drying up. If \nit continues to go this way, it will not only be a disaster for the \nwildlife, but it will be a disaster for the people because the odors \nthat are coming from this drying-up sea float all the way to Los \nAngeles, where we have millions of people. And the jobs we could create \nthere with clean energy and other types of development--we have to move \non that.\n  So I was excited to see that everyone agrees that if you have a body \nof water that is deteriorating, that, if you don't pay attention to it, \ncould cause a public health crisis, then it should have some kind of a \npriority.\n  The conference report also addresses important ocean and coastal \nresiliency issues, allowing the Corps to carry out ocean and coastal \nresiliency projects in coordination with a broad range of stakeholders, \nincluding States, Federal agencies, and NGOs.\n  I compliment Sheldon Whitehouse for the work he put into this \nprovision. It is very important. Our oceans and our coasts are not only \nmagnificent gifts, but they truly are important to our economy.\n  People who come to California like to see the whole State, but people \ngravitate to the coast. It is so magnificent, and we have to make sure \nwe treat our coasts and oceans right. That means making sure that if \nthey are endangered, we do something about it.\n  This is a first. This is exciting for Sheldon Whitehouse, and I am \nvery thrilled to have been able to help him.\n  I have to give a shout-out to Senator Reid, without whom this \nprovision wouldn't have made it in the bill. We were down to that one \nissue. We had taken care of 150 issues, but we were down to that one \nissue. Leader Reid was able to help us. And I thank the House for \nworking with us.\n  I don't know how many of you have heard of TIFIA, which is a program \nwe expanded in the highway bill. What it does is it leverages funds. So \nif our States or localities in our States passed a half-cent sales tax \nto build transportation, the Federal Government now has a way, through \nthe TIFIA Program, to come around up front, take a project that has, \nsay, 20 years of revenue coming in, pay that up-front cost right there, \nand build that project quickly.\n  We did the same for water. We call it WIFIA, and it is a new \ninitiative. We hope that it will be interesting to folks and that they \nwill use it. We will assist localities in need of loans for flood \ncontrol or wastewater and drinking water infrastructure to receive \nthose loans from this new funding mechanism, the Water Infrastructure \nFinance and Innovation Act.\n  WIFIA will allow localities an opportunity to move forward with water \ninfrastructure projects in the same way TIFIA does in transportation. \nWhere there is a local source of funding, the Federal Government can \nfront those funds.\n  The TIFIA Program is working so well. I just went to an amazing press \nconference with the folks from Los Angeles. They have been given an \n$800 million TIFIA loan that is enabling them to build a subway. It is \nvery exciting, and the Federal Government has no risk--almost zero \nrisk--because the funds will be paid back from the sales tax.\n  These new WIFIA funding arrangements supplement existing programs to \nhelp leverage more investment in our Nation's aging infrastructure. The \nconference report also updates the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to \nensure that our existing sources of water infrastructure funding are \nable to continue to meet pressing needs.\n  Chief's reports: The conference report authorizes 34 critical Army \nCorps projects where the Chief of Engineers has completed a \ncomprehensive study.\n  This was an absolute necessity for the Senate. The House and Senate \ncame at this in a very different way. Their priority was making sure \nthey could hold hearings on all the chief's reports. Our priority was \nsaying: Look, we are not going to go ahead with any project that \ndoesn't have a completed chief's report. So that is the ``r'' for \nreform--their reform, making sure Congress holds the hearings; our \nreform, making sure that we include completed chief's reports.\n  We are very happy about these chief's reports. They are all over the \nNation. I gave some examples in the beginning of my statement. These \nprojects will restore vital ecosystems, preserve our natural heritage, \nand maintain navigation routes for commerce and movement of goods.\n  In the future, looking forward, how are we going to continue, because \nthese WRDA bills come every 7 years. It is very slow. What is a better \nway to deal with the future needs of our States?\n  We developed a system with the House that allows local sponsors--such \nas someone from the State of the Presiding Officer, a flood control \nagency in the State--to make their case now directly to the Army Corps, \nand then the Corps would recommend those projects to Congress.\n  It is interesting that we took ourselves--because of the earmark \nban--out of the picture. It allows people from Fargo, from Los Angeles, \nfrom Humboldt--wherever they are from--to go and see the Corps and make \nthe case\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nfor their project. Then the Corps would say: We sat down with these \nlocal officials. There are 10 or 15 projects we think are important.\n  That is going to be a new way we are going to give more local input.\n  I am very excited and happy to be standing on the floor today on this \nissue because it was 1 year ago almost to the day that the Senate \npassed the Boxer-Vitter WRDA bill by a vote of 83 to 14. It was just \nover 1 year ago. It has been 1 year--1 year of being in conference; 1 \nyear of struggling with issue after issue; 1 year of people saying: \nThat is it, we are done, we are walking out the door--wait, come \nback. It has been a year. When you read how a bill becomes a law, it \nsounds so simple. It says the House passes a bill, then the Senate \npasses a bill, then there are conferees and they get together and they \nwork it out, and then it comes back and everyone is smiling and happy \nand they pass it, and then the bill goes to the President. Well, it is \nnot exactly that way. It is a lot of give and take.\n\n  Sometimes you do have a bill that is not as complex as these here, \nand it can go smoothly. But how a bill becomes a law depends on who is \nin the room, it depends on what is happening nationwide, it depends on \nwho the President is, and so many different things. But we were able to \ndo this.\n  So 1 year ago we passed it in the Senate, and tomorrow, I believe, we \nare going to pass the conference report. The agreement will cost \nroughly the same as the Senate-passed bill and well below the last WRDA \nbill. One might ask why? Well, it is because as we authorized new \nprojects, we deauthorized old projects. And that is important. We were \nable to go better than one-for-one in deauthorizing and authorizing.\n  Also, we had a very good talk with the CBO--the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It is rare I have ever said a ``good talk'' with the CBO, \nbecause while the Presiding Officer is very good at accounting--a \ngenius at that--I can tell you they do not make any sense to me. But \nSenator Vitter and I were actually able to persuade them on this bill \nto be realistic in the way we score it. If a State isn't going to be \nable to come up with their matching funds for 10 years, don't put this \nin as a cost in the first year. So the CBO was very open to working \nwith us, and for that I thank them. It is a rarity, putting common \nsense on the table.\n  In closing, I thank all of the staff on both sides of the aisle who \nput in countless hours to develop this bipartisan, bicameral agreement. \nThey didn't just work until midnight, 3 a.m., they worked on it 24/7 \nfor all these months. I thank Bettina Poirier, my incredible chief of \nstaff of the EPW Committee, my chief counsel, our guiding light, our \nguiding star; Jason Albritton, who is here with me today, who has \nworked nonstop, and will continue to do it until it is over, right, and \nget it ready for the President to sign; and Ted Illston, who is on the \nfloor and is a wonderful, wonderful staffer; and Tyler Rushforth.\n  These are the key people on my staff. One would think it would be 20 \nor 30 more, but it is not. It is this handful of people who made this \nhappen for all of us.\n  I have to say I got to know Senator Vitter's staff so well, and we \nlaughed at times. There was some irony involved in all of this. I would \nlike to thank Zak Baig, Charles Brittingham, Chris Tomassi on Senator \nVitter's staff. And Senator Vitter himself. Again, we were able to set \naside a lot of differences we have on climate, on environment, on clean \nair, clean water, safe drinking water, where we go at it--nuclear power \nsafety. We go at it. But we were able to say for the good of the \npeople, we have to show people we can set aside our differences and \ncome together. We did it here, we did it on the highway bill, and now \nit is time for the Senate to show the American people we can truly come \ntogether and pass this bill.\n  I do want to show one more thing before I leave the floor, and that \nis some of the organizations that have supported us and that support \nthis bill. I can't read them all; it would take too long, but I will \nhighlight some of these: the AFL-CIO, Transportation Trades Department, \nthe American Association of Port Authorities, the American Concrete \nPavement Association--I am passing over a lot of these--the Associated \nGeneral Contractors of America, the Association of California Water \nAgencies, the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders Association, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation.\n  Let me give a few more. These are the supporters. The Arkansas \nWaterways Commission, the Big River Coalition, the City of Sacramento, \nthe City of Los Angeles, Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, the \nHarbor Maintenance Trust Fund Fairness Coalition, the International \nUnion of Operating Engineers, the International Union of Painters and \nAllied Trades, the National League of Cities, the National Governors \nAssociation, the National Asphalt Paving Association, and the National \nAssociation of Clean Water Agencies.\n  The list goes on. Here are a few more, in case anyone is interested. \nThe National Ready Mix Concrete Association, the National Rural \nElectric Cooperative Association, the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel \nAssociation, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, The Nature \nConservancy, the Texas Department of Transportation, the United \nAssociation of Plumbers and Pipefitters, the U.S. Society of Dams, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Vinyl Institute, the Water Resources \nCoalition, the Waterways Council, Inc.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire list \nof these supporters.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To those who are listening as I read from this list, it \ndid include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it did include the AFL-CIO, \nTransportation Trades Department, which is so encouraging, and the \nNational Governors Association. And I guess I will read this one:\n\n       The nation's governors applaud Congress for reaching an \n     agreement that provides states with the resources to address \n     their critical water infrastructure needs . . . governors \n     urge the House and Senate to pass the WRRDA conference report \n     and send it to the President for signature as soon as \n     possible.\n\n  I want to say how much I endorse what the Governors said. Send this \nbill to the President as soon as possible.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't mention Congressman Shuster, who heads \nmy counterpart committee in the House. Congressman Shuster was a \ndelight to work with, even when it got tough for me. We had some tough, \ntough disagreements, but he stuck with it.\n  I also want to congratulate him on his victory yesterday, and I want \nto tell him, through this statement, how much I look forward to working \nwith him on the Transportation bill. If we can do this, we can do that. \nThat is important because we have to keep America moving. We are the \ngreatest Nation on Earth, but you can't be the greatest Nation on Earth \nif you don't have modern water infrastructure, if your cities are \nflooding, if your ports can't move products. You can't. And you \ncertainly can't have a great nation when you cannot have a highway \nsystem that functions, a transportation system that functions. You \ncan't. There is no such thing. Because if you can't move commerce, if \nyou can't move people, you can't move America forward.\n  I will say again, my deepest thanks to staff, my deepest thanks to \nSenator Vitter, my deepest thanks to Senator Carper, to my entire \ncommittee, Senator Barrasso, to Congressman Shuster, to Senator Reid, \nto all of you, because this was one of those labors of love in which we \nall engage. We all wanted a bill, and we put away our little side \narguments, came together, and now we have a bill that is a \nmultibillion-dollar bill that will build our Nation and that is going \nto help our commerce and it is going to put 500,000 people to work. I \ncouldn't be happier. I look forward to this vote tomorrow.\n  One more person I will thank: Congressman Nick Rahall, who worked as \nthe ranking member with Mr. Shuster. The two of them were a great team, \nand we were able to cut across the partisan divide, cut across the \nHouse-Senate divide, tough as it was.\n  It is a great day. It is a great day in the U.S. Senate and in the \nCongress, and I look forward to the President's signing this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Stanley Fischer, of New \nYork, to be a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem for a term of four years.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to speak in \nsupport of Dr. Stanley Fischer to be a member of the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System. While we are only voting on Dr. \nFischer's nomination to be a member of the Board today, he has also \nbeen nominated to be Vice Chair of the Board of Governors, which we \nwill need to vote on in the near future.\n  As you all know, Dr. Fischer is a distinguished economist who is \nimmensely qualified to serve on the Federal Reserve Board. In his two \ndecades on the MIT faculty, he was primary adviser for 49 Ph.D. \nstudents, including former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and current \nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi. In addition, he has \npreviously served on the frontlines in making public policy decisions \nduring periods of financial crisis--including as the head of the Bank \nof Israel during the last financial crisis. He is supported by experts \nfrom both sides of the aisle and respected by leaders throughout the \nworld. His wisdom on the economy, monetary policy, and banking would be \nextremely valuable to the Board.\n  It is important that we move quickly to confirm Dr. Fischer to the \nBoard. Next week, the Federal Reserve Board will only have 3 out of 7 \nconfirmed Board members. In addition to Dr. Fischer, the Senate needs \nto quickly confirm Dr. Lael Brainard and Mr. Jerome Powell. There is a \nlot of work to do at the Board, including conducting monetary policy, \ndrafting rules implementing Wall Street reform, and taking other \nactions to improve financial stability and economic growth, so it is \nimportant we fill the Board vacancies with highly qualified nominees \nlike Dr. Fischer as soon as possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Dr. Fischer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we yield back all of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Stanley Fischer, of Texas, to be a Member of the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, the Senate is about to proceed to \nseveral votes on important nominees, and I wanted to put in a strong \nword of support for James Walter Green, who has been nominated by the \nPresident to serve as U.S. attorney for the Middle District of \nLouisiana.\n  I was very pleased to recommend Mr. Green to the President for his \nconsideration. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote with me to confirm \nhim today. He has served our country in a variety of capacities, most \nnotably 20 years of military service. He has been involved in multiple \ndeployments, is the recipient of numerous military awards, including \nthe Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps \nCommendation Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon, and the Iraq Campaign \nMedal.\n  Not only is he a strong patriot who has been of extraordinary service \nto our country, he has also served for an additional 15 years in a \nvariety of capacities in this office and supported their work through \nRepublican and Democratic administrations.\n  He comes highly recommended by a broad cross section of individuals \nin my State, and I am pleased I was able to recommend this kind of \nhigh-caliber person to continue to serve in the full capacity as U.S. \nattorney.\n  Mr. Green will bring a wealth of legal experience to his role as U.S. \nAttorney for the Middle District of Louisiana. He has served in a \nvariety of roles within the U.S. Attorney's office in both the Baton \nRouge and Las Vegas offices, including as a trial attorney, trial \nsection supervisor, acting criminal chief, acting administrative \nofficer and first assistant U.S. attorney.\n  He is currently the acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of \nLouisiana and a member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves.\n  I have every confidence that James Walter Green will be exceptional \nin his role as the chief Federal law enforcement official in the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for his courtesy. I wanted to put in a strong \nword for this nominee. He is supported by both Senator Vitter and \nmyself, and I hope to get a strong vote on him today.\n  I ask that the time be equally divided between the majority and \nminority.\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before we vote on the Barron \nnomination, I want my colleagues to know the White House continues to \nkeep the Senate in the dark. Yesterday I called upon the White House to \nstate once and for all whether it has provided to the Senate any and \nall materials written by this nominee on the drone program. The White \nHouse refuses to answer that simple question.\n  One hour after I spoke, the White House Press Secretary refused for a \nthird time to confirm that the Senate has been provided all of this \nnominee's writings on the drone program. Why is that? Why will this \nWhite House not give us a simple, straightforward answer? We still \ndon't know how much more is out there on this subject that this nominee \nhas been involved with.\n  After this vote, my colleagues still will not be able to tell their \nconstituents that the White House has provided all of this nominee's \nmaterials on the drone program because we simply don't know that is \ntrue.\n  Finally, I wish to emphasize one more point about that court order \nrequiring the administration to make a redacted copy of one memo \npublic. Senators should know the court also ordered the trial court to \ntake a second look at the other additional secret documents to see \nwhether any of those additional documents should be made public in \nredacted form.\n  If some of those documents were written by this nominee, and if the \ncourt orders them to be made public, Senators' constituents are going \nto ask why they didn't stand today to get that information. Their \nconstituents are going to ask why they didn't stand up to this White \nHouse and demand to see any and all memos this nominee wrote on this \nsubject before this vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise to oppose the nomination of anyone \nwho advocates for the executive branch killing American citizens not \ninvolved in combat without trial. I strongly believe any nominee who \nrubberstamps and grants such power to a President is not worthy of \nbeing placed one step away from the Supreme Court. It isn't about \nseeing the memos, it is about what they say and how they disrespect the \nBill of Rights.\n  Due process can't exist in secret. Checks and balances can't exist in \none branch of government. Whether it be upon the advice of one lawyer \nor 10,000 lawyers, if they all work for one man, the President, how can \nthere be anything but a verdict outside the law, a verdict that could \nconceivably be subject to the emotions of prejudice and fear, a verdict \nthat could be wrong?\n  The nomination before us is about a nominee who supports killing \nAmerican citizens not engaged in combat without a trial. These memos \ndon't limit drone executions to one individual, they become historic \nprecedent for killing citizens abroad.\n  Barron's arguments for extrajudicial killing of American citizens \nchallenges over 1,000 years of jurisprudence. It is quite simple; an \naccusation is different from a conviction, and due process is different \nfrom internal deliberations. The executive can accuse, but it cannot \ntry and it cannot convict someone.\n  Critics will argue, but these are evil people who plot against and \nplan to kill Americans. I understand that. My first instinct is--\nsimilar to most Americans--to immediately want to punish these \ntraitors. The question is, How do we decide guilt? Aren't we, in a way, \nbetraying our country's principles when we relinquish the right to \ntrial by jury?\n  Due process can't exist in secret. Checks and balances can't exist \nwithin one branch of government. If we can't defend the right to a \ntrial for the most heinous crimes, then where will the slippery slope \nlead us?\n  Critics ask how we will try these people overseas. The Constitution \nholds the answer. They should be tried for treason. If they refuse to \nreturn home, they should be tried in absentia and provided a legal \ndefense. If they are found guilty, the method of punishment is not the \nissue. The issue is, and always has been, the right to a trial, the \npresumption of innocence, and the guarantee of due process to everyone \nno matter how heinous the crime.\n  For these reasons I cannot support the nomination of David Barron. I \ncannot and will not support a lifetime appointment for someone who \nbelieves it is OK to kill American citizens not involved in combat \nwithout a trial.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3211-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3211-S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Ms. Cook loves her \ncountry. She is a true patriot, and a person of character, courage, and \nintegrity.\n  Ms. Cook has had a distinguished legal career. She received her \nundergraduate degree from the University of Chicago in 1997 and her law \ndegree from Harvard Law School in 2000. She graduated from both \nprestigious schools with honors. Following law school, Ms. Cook served \nas law clerk to Judge Lee Rosenthal of the Southern District of Texas, \nand Judge Laurence Silberman of the D.C. Circuit.\n  In 2002, she joined the prominent law firm Cooper & Kirk here in \nWashington, DC. After working for the firm for 3 years, Ms. Cook was \nappointed Special Counsel to the Office of Legal Policy at the \nDepartment of Justice. In 2008, she was confirmed by the Senate without \nopposition to be assistant attorney general for OLP.\n  In 2009, Ms. Cook joined my staff as chief counsel for the Supreme \nCourt nomination of now-Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Her work was \nsuperb. She helped me to examine the important issues raised by that \nnomination on a high level without resorting to personal attacks on the \nnominee.\n  In 2010, she returned to private practice as a partner with Freeborn \n& Peters in Chicago, before returning to Washington, where she is \ncurrently counsel at the well-regarded law firm Wilmer Hale.\n  Ms. Cook has had a wide-ranging law practice, including general civil \nlitigation, policy initiatives, and Federal criminal investigations. \nThe quality of her work has not gone unnoticed. Among her more recent \naccolades are the Intelligence Community Legal Award, multiple attorney \ngeneral awards, and recognition as one of Legal Times' ``40 Under 40.'' \nIn 2008, she received the Edmund J. Randolph Award for Service to the \nDepartment of Justice, the Department's highest award for public \nservice and leadership.\n  Ms. Cook combines a powerful legal mind, broad experience, good \njudgment, and a strong interest in serving her country. She has \nexcellent people skills and works well with others, even when she \ndisagrees with them. Her tenure on the board thus far proves as much.\n  I have nothing but praise for Ms. Cook's abilities, and am confident \nshe will continue to acquit herself as a member of the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board. I am pleased to recommend Ms. Cook to \nmy colleagues and I hope they will support her confirmation to this \nimportant position.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, a year ago the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported out a piece of legislation that would do more than \nincrease the gross domestic product, do more than reduce the deficit, \ndo more than promote prosperity, and do more than create jobs. It \npassed legislation that would take 11 million people out of the shadows \nin America, prevent anyone from becoming a second-class citizen in this \ncountry, and finally establish comprehensive, commonsense immigration \nreform.\n  Today, 1 year later, it sits languishing in the House of \nRepresentatives and 11 million people wait and wait and wait. While \nthey wait, while they hope that we come to our senses and govern as we \nshould, the toll from inaction compounds: families suffer, children \nsuffer, deportations continue, and injustice prevails.\n  There is a cost to our inaction, a cost those in the House of \nRepresentatives are forcing upon us, as we wait for them to act, that \naccrues every day. They claim they are for fiscal responsibility. Yet \ntheir inaction is costing us each year, on average, $80 billion of\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\nreal GDP, $40 billion in higher deficits, 40,000 STEM grads who earn a \nMaster's or a Ph.D. in STEM fields from U.S. universities, 50 million \nin the Social Security trust fund, over 50,000 fewer jobs, and $13.5 \nbillion in lost revenue.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues in the House understand exactly what \nthe cost of inaction is. I hope they understand that every minute we \nwaste passing commonsense immigration reform is costing American \ntaxpayers more and more, and the cost is on them, and the losses I view \nas Republican losses.\n  The fact is Republicans are acting as if nothing is at stake, as if \nthere is no cost, as if the lives of people and families are not in the \nbalance, and they could not be more wrong. Besides the economic cost of \ninaction, there is a very real human cost. Franklin Roosevelt once \nsaid, citing Dante, that, ``Better the occasional faults of a \ngovernment that lives in a spirit of charity than the consistent \nomissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.''\n  Let us not be frozen in the ice of our own indifference. Let us act, \ngovern. I call on my Republican colleagues to warm their hearts and \nthink about the costs of inaction not only in dollars and cents but in \nthe lives of families and the future of this Nation. The legislation we \nare waiting for is a comprehensive way to tackle our immigration \nproblem.\n  We are on the verge of historic change. I am proud to have been part \nof the Gang of 8 that hammered out a strong bipartisan effort that \npassed this institution with 67 votes. That is not usual these days for \nquestions of great controversy.\n  I say to my friends in the other body: Do the right thing for America \nand, by the way, for your own party. Find common ground, lean away from \nthe extreme, opt for reason, and govern with us.\n  In my view, the leadership in the other body has a chance to be \nAmerican heroes, a chance to bring both sides together in an alliance \nthat will ensure passage of this bill. I believe, based on poll after \npoll, that a vast majority of Americans want immigration reform to \npass, and will thank them for doing the right thing. I hope they have \nthe political will. I hope they have the political courage to unite the \nNation and send this bill to the President's desk. I hope they will \npass a bill that will increase the gross domestic product, reduce the \ndeficit, promote prosperity, and create jobs.\n\n  As I have pointed out on this floor many times, this chart shows \ncumulative economic gains of the legalization process over 10 years \nafter passage of this legislation. Fixing the broken immigration system \nwould increase America's gross domestic product by over $800 billion \nover the next 10 years; it would increase the wages of all Americans by \n$470 billion over 10 years, and increase jobs by 121,000 per year for \n10 years. That is over 1.2 million jobs.\n  What do we ever get to do here that increases the gross domestic \nproduct, reduces the deficit, raises the wages of all Americans, and \ncreates 120,000-plus jobs per year? Very little. This legislation does \nthat, not just simply because I say it but because the Congressional \nBudget Office said many of these figures were, in fact, a reality. \nImmigrants will start small businesses, they will create jobs for \nAmerican workers, and it is time to harness that economic power.\n  The CBO report also tells us we reduce direct spending and the \ndeficit by $158 billion over the next decade, and by another $685 \nbillion more from 2024 through 2033. Let's remember, we are talking \nabout almost $1 trillion in deficit spending that we can lift off the \nbacks of the next generation, exactly what our Republican friends \ndemand. Yet they are balking in the face of achieving one of their very \nfundamental principles. What other single piece of legislation \nincreases GDP growth, increases wages, increases jobs, and lowers the \ndeficit?\n  The Center for American Progress found that fixing the broken \nimmigration system would increase wages of all Americans by $470 \nbillion over 10 years and increase jobs by 121,000 per year. What we \nrealize now and what the numbers tell us is that giving 11 million \npeople a clear and defined earned pathway to citizenship is, in effect, \nan economic growth strategy that lowers the deficit and creates jobs. \nThat is exactly what we are looking to do to move this economy forward.\n  New Americans who follow this pathway we lay out will have to play by \nrules. They will have to pass criminal background checks, they will \nhave to pay a fine, they will have to pay their taxes. But if they do, \nthere will be no obstacle they cannot overcome to the day when they \nraise their right hand and pledge allegiance to the United States and \nbecome a naturalized citizen.\n  Too many families have waited too long for that day. Too many have \nwaited too long to say those words that will change their lives \nforever. They changed my mother's life, and, in turn, gave me a chance \nto stand here today and vote for a pathway to citizenship that can \nchange the lives of millions of others.\n  But it is not just the economics of the legislation that creates the \nurgency of now, it is the human toll, the toll on millions living in \nthe shadows. That can be pretty dark and frightening. Last year over \n150,000 people were deported just for paperwork violations. Hundreds of \nthousands have been deported despite having U.S. citizen children. They \nare not criminals; they are hard-working families trying to make ends \nmeet.\n  For many years I have asked the administration to stop deporting \nfathers and mothers, stop separating families, stop taking away parents \nfrom their U.S. citizen resident children. Let me tell you about one of \nthese cases, the case of Carlos Oliva-Guillen who was about to be \ndeported away from his three U.S. citizen children, including his 7-\nmonth-old infant son who is suffering from a life-threatening disorder. \nThe baby was on the verge of a coma and facing potential brain damage \nwhile his dad was in detention about to be deported.\n  The doctors needed to do a blood test on Carlos, the baby's dad, to \nsee if the baby's illness is genetic. Thank God that Carlos was \nreleased and brought back to New Jersey so doctors could pursue these \nlifesaving tests and treatment.\n  Those tragedies continue as long as we do not have comprehensive \nimmigration reform. With all of these economic benefits and the \ntremendous human suffering at stake, what are we waiting for? We are \nwaiting for the House leadership to stand up to a minority--to a \nminority. We are waiting for Speaker Boehner to schedule a vote. We are \nwaiting for reason to prevail, for our Republican friends in the other \nbody to once and for all do what is right and think about the cost of \ninaction, not only in dollars and cents but in the lives of the \nfamilies and the future of this Nation.\n  We are waiting for the Speaker to stop letting the most radical \nvoices, such as Stephen King, dictate the future of immigration reform. \nSpeaker Boehner himself has publicly denounced Congressman King for his \n``hateful language.'' Yet the only--the only--immigration-related vote \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives has allowed in the past \nyear was for radical proposals to end DACA and deport our Nation's \nDREAMers. It is time for Speaker Boehner to stand for the majority of \nthe Republican Party and of the Congress in the House of \nRepresentatives and remove Stephen King's undeserved carte blanche on \nimmigration policy.\n  If we had a vote in the House, the Senate bill as passed would pass. \nIt would pass today. It would pass with both Democratic and Republican \nvotes. We have the votes in the House to pass the Senate bill. We just \nneed the will of a Republican leadership behind a bill that reduces the \ndeficit, increases the GDP, creates jobs. I cannot understand, for the \nlife of me, why they cannot break the stranglehold by a few against the \nwill of the many.\n  Considering that there are enough votes in the House to pass the \nSenate bill and send it to the President, we deserve action. Eleven \nmillion people deserve, at the very least, the political courage to \nface down the extreme minority and do what is right and govern from the \ncommonsense center.\n  Time is not on our side. There is a limited window of opportunity. We \nonly have about another 2 months at most for the Speaker to act. So it \nis in the Speaker's hands. Does he want reform or doesn't he? I know I \nhear him say he does. I want to believe that. I will be the first to \napplaud him.\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\n  Speaker Boehner, however, on the one side said he wants to get \nimmigration reform. The next thing I hear is that he questions the \nPresident's commitment to enforce the law as the reason why they are \nnot moving forward on immigration reform, even as this President is \ndeporting more people than the Bush administration. This administration \nhas deported almost 2 million people. I do not understand. When the \nSpeaker says, ``We can't trust the President to enforce the law,'' it \nseems to me what he is calling for is even greater deportations than \nthe greatest deportations that have taken place over the last \nRepublican administration.\n  So saying the President isn't enforcing enough, the Speaker is really \narguing for more deportations and has done nothing to stop those \ndeportations.\n  The only conclusion we can draw is that my friends on the other side \nsupport the current dysfunctional system, and they do so at a cost to \nthe country. They do so at a cost to families, and I also believe that \nbeyond all the policy arguments that I have talked about--the GDP, the \nreduction in the deficit, the creation of jobs, the raising of wages, \nhelping our agricultural industry through the ag jobs provision, \nhelping our high-tech industries through the provisions of the \nlegislation, and so many others--not only do they risk all of that and \nrisk the families, but I believe they risk their political futures.\n  The road to the White House goes through the barrio, as my friend in \nthe House of Representatives, Congressman Gutieerrez, says. If we look \nat States across the country in which there are large immigrant \npopulations who vote, who are U.S. citizens, and who look at this as \nthe civil rights issue of their time, you cannot win the electoral \nvotes of those States if you cannot find a way to a commonsense \nimmigration reform. So their own futures, politically speaking, are at \nrisk.\n  But even more than that political risk, our country is at risk--a \nrisk that will hinder our own economic growth and leave millions in the \nshadows as second-class citizens, a risk that deportations will \ncontinue to tear parents away from their infants, despite the parents \ndesperately seeking to register, get right with the law, and pay their \ntaxes.\n  I thought that so many of my colleagues talk about the family values. \nWell, family values isn't about ripping families asunder. Family values \nisn't about ultimately saying that someone has a paperwork violation, \nso you rip them apart from their three American children--a risk that \nwe will address as one of the greatest civil rights issues of our time.\n  I have cases in my office of U.S. citizens and legal permanent \nresidents of the United States unlawfully detained in immigration raids \nbecause of the happenstance of where they live or what they look like \nor how they speak.\n  Who among us, who have the privilege of serving in this institution, \nis ready to become a second-class citizen because of the happenstance \nof where you live, what you look like or how you speak, when you are a \nU.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident? This includes among others, \nin one case, an Iraq war veteran who was detained while his status was \ndetermined.\n  My first and foremost focus is on getting the House Republican \nleadership, after 1 year of this body's having passed an immigration \nbill, to either consider the Senate legislation or their own \ncomprehensive version. That is the ultimate solution. Everything else \nis a bandaid. But let me be clear. There is a limited window of \nopportunity we have open to us until the end of July.\n  If Republicans do not act, they will have forced the President to \nultimately use his executive powers on enforcement questions and on \ndeportation relief.\n  Either they are tone deaf to the priorities of the Nation's largest-\ngrowing and fastest-growing minority or they are ignoring the will and \ninterests of their own party and acting against their own stated goal \nof reducing the deficit.\n  They can keep finding excuses for inaction, but there are no more \nexcuses. Enough is enough.\n  The community across the country is riveted in their attention as to \nwhat is going to happen in the House of Representatives. I hope that \nattention will ultimately be a joyful one if the House acts. But if it \ndoes not, it will reap the wrath of a community who sees this as the \ncritical civil rights issue of their time and the consequences will be \nlongstanding. I hope they meet the better angels that are within them \nand ultimately produce the comprehensive immigration reform the Nation \nneeds for its security, for its economy, for doing the right thing as a \nnation of immigrants, by doing the right thing for those families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                             Koch Brothers\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, as the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee, I take no pleasure in making these remarks, but the \ncircumstances have given me absolutely no choice.\n  Our distinguished majority leader recently came to this floor and \ndeclared that his minority colleagues--that would be us on this side of \nthe aisle, Republicans--were ``addicted to Koch.''\n  To those who regularly watch our proceedings, however, it is clear \nwho is suffering from this addiction.\n  Practically every morning our leader starts our session by giving a \nspeech personally attacking David and Charles Koch and their families. \nThe only thing he seems to do more often than block Republican \namendments is attack the Kochs.\n  As distasteful as that is, it is apparently no longer sufficient. The \nproblem with addiction, of course, is that as a tolerance develops, \nmore and more of the drug is needed to satisfy the craving.\n  So now we have learned that not only does the majority leader spend \nhis mornings attacking the Kochs, but he spends his evenings doing so \nas well.\n  Last night, the majority leader attended an event in the Capitol \nVisitor Center--the CVC in the Capitol building--to promote a movie \nattacking the Kochs. Never mind that the regulations prohibit--\nprohibit--the use of the CVC space for any ``campaign, commercial, \npromotional or profit-making purpose.''\n  As House Administration Committee Chairman Candice Miller said:\n\n       We cannot hold partisan political rallies or fundraisers on \n     the grounds of the Capitol, or within its walls. Our work in \n     this hallowed building must solely be in the interests of the \n     American people and not in the interest of any political \n     cause.\n\n  This event is just the latest demonstration of an apparent belief \nthat the rules do not apply to the Democratic leadership. We now have \nanother new precedent: a majority leader appearing in and then \npromoting a movie in the Capitol.\n  It also further demonstrates the hypocrisy of the majority's quest to \nstifle dissent. They celebrate and promote films that attack their \nopponents but want to outlaw films that criticize the majority Members \nand their agenda.\n  The irony of promoting a film to advance their campaign to restrict \nspeech is apparently lost on the majority. So it is worth reminding \nthem what the Citizens United case was really all about. It was about a \nmovie--``Hillary: The Movie,'' to be precise. ``Hillary: The Movie'' \nwas made in the wake of ``Fahrenheit 9/11.'' Anyone who saw \n``Fahrenheit 9/11'' knows that the purpose of the film was to convince \npeople that George W. Bush was not worthy of the Presidency and should \nnot be given a second term.\n  Anyone who saw ``Hillary: The Movie'' knows the purpose was to \nconvince people that Hillary Clinton should not be elected President of \nthe United States. I suspect that many of the people who went to see \nthe movie in the CVC last night thought that ``Fahrenheit 9/11'' was \ngreat and ``Hillary: The Movie'' was terrible.\n  The point of the Citizens United case was that it really doesn't \nmatter. It doesn't matter which film a majority in Congress might \nprefer. The producers have the right to make and distribute either one, \nand they can raise the money necessary to do so as they see fit, not \nsubject to any restrictions or limitations imposed by the Congress. \nThey are guaranteed that right by the First Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. This Congress cannot take that away.\n  Is that too difficult a concept to grasp? Isn't it obvious? Of course \nit is.\n  Yet the majority has spent the last 4 years misrepresenting it, and \nnow it even wants to amend the Constitution to reverse it. That is just \nincredible.\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n  In a press release announcing an upcoming hearing on the majority's \namendment to the First Amendment, it was declared that it was necessary \nto ``build support for amending the Constitution to ensure that all \nAmericans can exercise their First Amendment rights.''\n  It is not necessary to amend the First Amendment to ensure that all \nAmericans can exercise their First Amendment rights. Those rights are \nalready guaranteed by the First Amendment as written. The amendment the \nmajority wants to impose would allow them to once again curtail those \nrights. Why can't we just be honest about this. Because of the Citizens \nUnited decision, people of all points of view now have the opportunity \nto make their views widely known. Even people who disagree with the \nmajority in the Senate have that right, and we should all be very \ngrateful.\n  I know the majority preferred a system where those who wished to \ncriticize them were restrained in their ability to do so. They want to \nreimpose those restraints. I do not think they will succeed, but we \nshould make clear what they want to do.\n  In their view, a corporation that happens to own a network, such as \nNBC or CNN, should be able to broadcast the movie they promoted last \nnight as much as they want. If the networks wanted to show the movie \nevery night of the week for 2 hours, that would be just fine with the \nmajority.\n  But if somebody wanted to buy a 30-second ad during the airing of the \nmovie to present an alternative point of view, that would be \nunacceptable. A 2-hour movie? No problem. A 30-second ad? Terrible. It \ncan't be allowed.\n  That is simply absurd, but that was the reality before the Citizens \nUnited decision. Media corporations could do or say whatever they \nwanted. Other corporations, however, could not. Citizens United ended \nthat ridiculous distinction and the majority has been trying to \nreinstate it ever since.\n  The majority claims they are concerned about wealthy donors. No, they \nare not. They are concerned about wealthy conservative donors.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, the very film they promoted last \nnight received financing from foundations and large individual \ndonations. But those donations were OK, I suppose, because they went to \npromote a cause the majority supports--attacking the Koch family.\n  Likewise, billionaires who support the causes of the majority are not \ntargeted. Billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has \nindicated he intends to spend over $100 million to influence the \nmidterm elections.\n  Does the majority have any problem with that? Of course not.\n  Spending huge amounts of money in politics only concerns them if it \nis spent against them or on behalf of their opponents, but if it is \nspent to promote the majority and their agenda--no problem.\n  The majority leader has convinced himself, however, and seeks to \nconvince the rest of us, that the Kochs are somehow unique, that the \nKoch brothers present some kind of evil threat, if you will, that other \nbillionaires with different points of view do not pose. He seems to \nthink that for everything bad that happens the Kochs are to blame.\n  Recently he claimed that they were one of the main causes of climate \nchange. He said: ``Not a cause, one of the main causes.''\n  What do we make of such a statement? Could anything be more absurd? \nThere are over 7 billion people on Earth, but our majority leader \nbelieves two men, Charles and David Koch, are a main cause of climate \nchange.\n  What is that all about?\n  Just yesterday, the majority leader blamed the Kochs for the \nwildfires in California. What is next? Maybe the Kochs are to blame for \nthe planes lost in the Bermuda Triangle? How about the volcanic \neruption at Pompeii years ago or even the futility of the Chicago Cubs? \nThat has to be the Koch family.\n  The majority leader convinces himself that his Koch obsession is \njustified because he believes their political involvement is motivated \nonly by their own financial interest.\n  It is inconceivable to him that people might exist who simply \ndisagree with him and his agenda and want to see the country take a \ndifferent path. The reality is that there are millions of Americans who \nwant to see this country take a different path, and the Koch family \nproudly supports that goal and has made donations to help achieve just \nthat.\n\n  You will never hear it from the majority leader, but it is time \nsomeone presented the rest of the story about the Koch family. This \nfamily has pledged or contributed more than $1 billion to cancer \nresearch, medical centers, education, the arts, and to assist public \npolicy organizations--$1 billion. Is that the act of a family motivated \nsolely by financial interests? I don't think so. Of course not.\n  Consider a few of these gifts: $100 million as a prime contributor \nfor cancer research at MIT; $100 million to the New York-Presbyterian \nHospital to build a new ambulatory care center, plus $28 million to \nother research causes; $20 million to Johns Hopkins University for a \ncancer research center; $30 million to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering \nCancer Center in New York; $26 million to the M.D. Anderson Cancer \nCenter in Houston; $26 million to the Hospital for Special Surgery in \nNew York City for the Building on Success campaign and other causes; \nand $35 million to the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History \nto renovate what is called dinosaur hall, which will include one of the \nlargest and most complete T. rex specimens in the world; $20 million to \nthe Museum of Natural History; and $65 million to the Metropolitan \nMuseum of Art. Likewise, the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation gave \n$100 million for the preservation and renovation of Lincoln Center, \nhome to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera.\n  All these acts of extraordinary generosity are completely ignored by \nthe majority leader. They are ignored because the Koch family has \ncommitted one unforgivable sin: They have opposed him and the \nDemocratic majority and President Obama. They present a threat to the \nDemocrats' hold on power. That is why they are being demonized. That is \nwhy they are being attacked. That is why they are being vilified. That \nis why they have become his obsession.\n  They have had the temerity to challenge the agenda of this majority \nand its leader, and the leader is not happy about it and he wants it to \nstop. And it looks as if he will do anything he can to make it stop, up \nto and including amending the Constitution of the United States. I \nthink that is a disgrace. It has demeaned this institution. It should \nstop. The first amendment doesn't exist to protect those of us in this \nbody. It exists to protect the people. It is there to prevent us from \nsilencing our critics. And thank God for that.\n  I wish the majority would recognize that they do not have the power \nto silence their critics. The first amendment denies them that power. I \nwish the majority leader would stop engaging in character assassination \nagainst citizens who choose to exercise their first amendment rights. \nAnd I wish he would stop acting as though he is the only person on \nEarth who can say whatever he wants. He isn't. We all have the right to \nexpress ourselves--all of us--from Michael Moore to Citizens United, \nfrom Tom Steyer to the Koch family. All of us have that right. All of \nus. Let's stop trying to deny it. Let's stop trying to change it. It is \nbeneath us. It demeans this body, and it is wrong.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business, followed by the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I came to the floor today to take a few \nminutes and talk about a piece of legislation I have been working on, \nalong with seven of my colleagues from this Chamber and from the House \nof Representatives. That legislation is called the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act. This is a long-overdue bill\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\nthat will reauthorize and improve the Workforce Investment Act--or WIA, \nas we call it--which includes dozens of critical workforce development \nprograms in all 50 of our States.\n  This is an issue I have been working on for more than a decade. For \nseveral years now I have been very proud to work here in the Senate to \nreauthorize WIA, so I am very glad we are finally on a strong \nbipartisan path to get this done for families and businesses in \nWashington State and across the country who have been telling me how \nimportant effective workforce programs are for them and their \ncommunities.\n  The reason we were able to introduce such a strong bill this \nmorning--and a bill that I think has a real chance to become law--is \nthe incredible bipartisan process we have had over the last few months \nto reach a compromise between both parties and both Chambers. So I \nwould like to thank each of the Members who helped me introduce the \nlegislation this morning by name: in the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative John Kline, Republican from Minnesota; Representative \nGeorge Miller, Democrat from California; Representative Virginia Foxx, \nRepublican from North Carolina; and Representative Rubeen Hinojosa, \nDemocrat from Texas; and here in the Senate, Senator Tom Harkin, \nDemocrat from Iowa and the great chairman of our HELP Committee; \nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican from Tennessee; and finally my \nclose partner and cohort in this process, who is here with me today, \nSenator Johnny Isakson from Georgia.\n  None of us got everything we wanted in the bill we introduced this \nmorning, but all of us got legislation we believe in. It is a bill that \nwill help our workers, and it will help our businesses and the economy \nfor years to come.\n  I am as strong a supporter of our Federal workforce development \nprogram as anyone. I have seen firsthand in my home State of Washington \nworkers who were laid off and who were able to get new training and new \nskills and new jobs. I have seen many of our Washington State \nbusinesses, from aerospace companies to video game design firms, that \nwere able to access workers with the new skills they needed to grow and \ncompete.\n  But the fact is that we have been relying on Federal workforce \ndevelopment programs that were written in the 1990s, and with millions \nof new jobs that will require postsecondary education and advanced \nskills in the coming years, we will fall behind in the world if we do \nnot modernize our workforce development now. We have to make sure that \nwhen high-tech jobs of the 21st century are created, Americans are \nready to fill them. That is what we have done in this bill. We have \ndoubled down on the programs that work, we have improved the programs \nthat have become outdated, and we have created a workforce system that \nis more nimble and adaptable and better aligned with what businesses \nneed and more accountable so we can continue to make it better. That is \nwhat we were sent here to do--work with our colleagues across the aisle \nfor the American people. We had a House proposal and we had a Senate \nproposal and we met in the middle.\n  I can't count how many times Senator Isakson, my Republican \ncolleague, and I have talked about the importance of getting this done. \nHis office happens to be right next door to mine. So whether we were at \na committee hearing or on a train to the Capitol, we were always \nfocused on how we could work together and find a path to a deal.\n  We are not done yet. I am going to be working with my colleagues in \nthe Senate--Democrats and Republicans--to get their support for this \ncompromise, and our colleagues will be doing the same in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This is an all-too-rare opportunity for all of us to get behind a \nstrong, bipartisan, bicameral bill that will help our workers and get \nour economy back on track. I am very proud of the work that went into \nthis.\n  I yield to my colleague, Senator Isakson. This would not be on the \nfloor today without his tremendous work and his work ethic and his \nwillingness to work across the aisle to get this done. I sincerely \nthank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Washington for her overly kind \nremarks with regard to my participation. To reiterate and underline \nwhat is in fact true, we were a team for 8 years when we both chaired \nand were ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace \nSafety in the HELP Committee. We time and again had gotten it to a \npoint we thought we could pass it and then everything was falling \napart.\n  We were at a huge divide and chasm at the beginning of this year. The \nHouse had passed the SKILLS Act; we had passed an act. They didn't \nthink we did anything; we thought they did too much. It looked like a \nchasm too far to bridge, but because of the work of Senator Murray, my \noffice, and Senator Alexander's office--Virginia Foxx, for whom I \ncannot say enough. She was the original author of the SKILLS Act. She \ncame to the table with us, and we sat down one floor below this \nbuilding, this floor right now. We sat down around a long table, and we \nstarted talking about the art of the possible, not the art of the \nimpossible.\n  Here are the high points I wish to focus on: first of all, \nconsolidation of programs that were not working to empower programs \nthat were working; flexibility for Governors, both on what they can do \nwith their one-stop shops, as well as their ability to transfer money \nfor unemployed programs and underemployed programs; 100 percent \ntransferability on the behalf of the Governors; 15 percent total \nflexibility of the appropriations that come to them through the WIA--\nWorkforce Investment Act--and workforce investment program.\n  We skinnied down the board so you don't have these huge boards. \nInstead, you have boards that can work. We reduced their size by about \n61 percent. We included management as a majority but labor at the \ntable, to make sure all facets of work were there.\n  Most important, we empowered the States to write the kind of \ncurriculum for the kind of training their State needed. We have 4 \nmillion unfilled jobs in America. We sometimes talk about all the \nunemployment--and we all hate the unemployment--but we have some \nunderqualified people who are underemployed who can take better and \nbigger jobs available in America right now if we train them for these \njobs.\n  So this new Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is just what it \nportends. It is an innovation in the WIA Program, and it is an \nopportunity for millions of Americans to find the training and skills \nnecessary to find a job and keep a job, which is, in turn, good for our \neconomy and good for our country.\n  But this is something that happened because people of good will on \nboth sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol got together and \nsaid let's figure out what we can do rather than argue about what we \ncan't do.\n  Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Miller in the House--whom I served \nwith on that committee years ago--did a tremendous job. Virginia Foxx \nwas very willing to work and Tim Scott, the Senator from South \nCarolina, who was the author of the SKILLS version of Virginia's bill \nin the Senate. Chairman Harkin deserves a lot of credit, particularly \nfor his focus on those with disabilities, and we preserve the programs \nthat make sense for people with disabilities, retraining them and \ngiving them the training they need to have meaningful and skillful \nemployment in the future.\n  But, most important of all, Lamar Alexander, the ranking member, kind \nof steered the ship. He was the rudder in the water who helped guide us \nto the point we got to today.\n  I am pleased both the Senate and the House Republican conferences \nhave all had presentations. The feedback we have gotten to date is \nextremely favorable. We hope this is going to be one of those rare \noccasions in 2014 where Republicans and Democrats come together for the \nbenefit of the American people to address the No. 1 problem we face in \nAmerica; that is, unemployment and underemployment, and empower people \nthrough innovation and opportunity for jobs in the 21st century.\n  I will end where I began. It would not have happened without Senator \nMurray. I am grateful for her help and assistance and I am proud to be \nher partner.\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, would the gentleman yield for 1 second?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. To Senator Murray, if I could talk about our staff. Tom \nNguyen is behind me. I could not have done what I did in this bill \nwithout Tom Nguyen, and Senator Murray has an outstanding staff who \nworked for us. I wish to have the Record include the tremendous staff \nwork both of us received.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to extend a gracious thank \nyou to staff from my office, senior advisor Scott Cheney; my chief of \nstaff Mike Spahn; my Budget Committee staff director Evan Schatz; Stacy \nRich and Emma Fulkerson from my floor and leadership staff; my \ncommunications team, especially Eli Zupnick and Sean Coit; and everyone \nelse from my team, who have all worked very hard to move this bill \nforward.\n\n  I would like to thank the wonderful staff from Senator Isakson's \noffice: Tommy Nguyen, staff director of the HELP Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Workplace Safety; as well as Brett Layson and Michael \nBlack.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee team: senior education policy advisor Crystal Bridgeman; \nchief education counsel Mildred Otero; disability policy staff director \nMichael Gamel-McCormick; disability policy advisor Lee Perselay; Derek \nMiller, staff director of the HELP Committee; deputy staff director of \nthe HELP committee Lauren McFerren; and labor policy advisor Liz Weiss; \nand many more who have helped.\n  I also thank the staff for Senator Alexander: senior education policy \nadvisor Patrick Murray; education policy director Peter Oppenheim; Bill \nKnudsen; and HELP Committee staff director David Cleary.\n  Finally I would be remiss if I didn't thank the professionals in the \nSenate Legislative Counsel's office, specially Liz King, Amy Gaynor, \nKristin Romero, and Katie Grendon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am honored to represent the 12.5 \nmillion people living in the State of Illinois, and it is a special \nhonor to represent 745,000 veterans who live in my State. These men and \nwomen have served their country honorably. Many of them are leading \ngreat lives and making great contributions to our State. Some are \nstruggling, returning from war with wounds--visible and invisible.\n  I came to speak to the issue involving the so-called VA scandal at \nthe Arizona Hospital. What I have been told is troubling. What I have \nbeen told is that there were secret waiting lists of veterans who were \nbeing unnecessarily delayed when they needed critical medical care. The \nallegations suggest that some of them may have died while on the \nwaiting list. That is as cruel an allegation as anyone could make about \nanybody and particularly cruel when it applies to our veterans.\n  We are trying to investigate this, as we should. The President sent \nhis Deputy Chief Rob Nabors, a person I know, to Arizona today, but we \nare not going to stop with that. We are going to do everything we can \nto make sure every veterans facility across America is serving our \nveterans in a timely and professional way. That includes, of course, \nthose in the State of Illinois.\n  Tomorrow I will be meeting with General Shinseki in my office. He is \nthe head of the Veterans' Administration. We are going to focus on \nIllinois, because in Illinois we have five VA medical centers, 30 \noutpatient clinics, and 11 veterans centers. I want to make certain \nthere are no secret waiting lists at any of those facilities, and I \nwant to make certain we are doing everything in our power to serve our \nveterans in a timely professional way.\n  We know the stories--the stories that have come out of these wars we \nare concluding now. The war in Afghanistan is winding down to a close. \nIraq was over just a few months, maybe 1 year ago, but despite the end \nof these wars, it is not the end of the war for many veterans. They \ncome home with needs--serious needs: post-traumatic stress disorder, \ntraumatic brain injury, amputations, serious problems that will haunt \nthem for some time.\n  We promised these men and women, if they would volunteer to serve our \nNation, if they were willing to serve and even die for our Nation, we \nwould never quit on them; that when they came home, we would stand by \nthem.\n  We passed a GI bill on the floor of the Senate several years ago. Jim \nWebb was the Senator from Virginia, a Marine Corps veteran himself of \nthe Vietnam war. He brought in a modern GI bill for those men and women \ncurrently serving, and it passed overwhelmingly with both political \nparties supporting it, as they should. In a place where we don't agree \non much, we sure agreed on that. When it comes to veterans and the GI \nbill, we stood together. We have to do it again on a bipartisan basis.\n  I read the comments from President Obama this morning. I thought they \nwere unsparing in terms of his personal concern over what has been \nreported.\n  I know we all honor the contribution made to America by General \nShinseki, a disabled veteran himself from the Vietnam war. He is an \nextraordinarily good man. The question is whether he can fix this \nproblem if one exists.\n  I don't know about the Arizona situation. We will wait until those \nfacts come together. But this much I do know: Our Veterans' \nAdministration has been overwhelmed by disability claims coming in at \nrates that surpass this country's experience in any previous war. \nAlmost half, almost 50 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are \nfiling for disability benefits when they come home.\n  The backlog at the VA is 300,000 cases--applications for disability. \nThey have been pending for more than 125 days--4 months. Some have been \nin the process for more than 1 year. It is an improvement--300,000 from \n611,000, which was the case last year--but not good enough.\n  Illinois has cut its backlog in half as well. But when I read some of \nthe delay times in making a decision at the VA, we will understand why \nwe find this still unacceptable.\n  Seven years ago the average processing time for an Illinois veteran \nclaim was 1 year, maybe 18 months. Appeals sometimes took 2 years. \nToday veterans tell us the claim will easily take 2 years to process, \nmaybe longer, and an appeal may take 3 or 4 years. Compared to the \nnumbers of 7 years ago, the numbers are much worse today. I understand \nthere are more veterans who are applying, but it just means we need to \nput the resources in place to serve this surge of veterans looking for \nhelp.\n  The veterans who call my office are just asking for updates and \naccurate information about the claims and medical care. They want to \nknow if somebody--anybody--at the VA is taking a look at their \napplication. They get conflicting information from the VA.\n\n  Sometimes the VA calls them back and says: You have to send such and \nsuch a document.\n  The veteran says: I have already sent it.\n  That kind of frustration for someone who is coping with illness or \nproblems is unacceptable, and it is certainly unacceptable when it \ncomes to our veterans.\n  Even when claims are processed, there are cases of mistaken identity. \nA bad address leads to canceled benefits and checks, and it takes \nmonths to fix it. I am trying to help. As chair of the Appropriations \nDefense Subcommittee, I put $3.6 million in the Defense Department to \nspeed up the program that allows servicemembers' records to be \ntransferred to the VA electronically so we can have at least a quicker \nresponse from the VA. I directed the DOD inspector general in my bill \nto work with the VA inspector general to streamline the transfer of \nrecords between the Departments.\n  Another way we tried to step up support for veterans is by creating \nthe Caregiver Program at the Veterans' Administration. I will be the \nfirst to tell you this was not my idea. It was the idea of Senator \nHillary Clinton of New York. She used to sit back there, and she came \nup with an idea: If members of a disabled veteran's family will stay \nhome with them and help them get through, we ought to help those \nmembers of the family. She called it\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nthe caregivers act. It didn't pass while she was here, but when she \nleft I liked it enough to call her and say to the Secretary of State, \nHillary Clinton: Do you mind if I steal your idea and try to pass it? \nShe invited me to be her guest, and I did. With the support of Senator \nDanny Akaka, Senator Patty Murray, and others, we made the caregivers \nact the law of the land, and now across America hundreds of spouses and \nparents who care for disabled veterans are getting a helping hand. We \nprovide them medical training, nurses training so they can take care of \ntheir veteran. We give them respite care of up to 2 weeks a year so \nthey can have some time off, a vacation to recharge their batteries. If \nthey have a financial hardship, we provide a modest amount of money to \nhelp them get by. It is the right thing to do. These veterans get to \nstay home with families who love them. That is where they want to be. \nFrom our point of view as a government, just to put it down to dollars \nand cents, it is a lot cheaper when they stay home. So we do well and \nthe veterans do well. That is a great outcome.\n  We have to expand the reach of caregivers assistance through the VA \nso at every veterans center there is a source of information to tell \nthat veteran and the veteran's family: The Caregiver Program is there \nif you want to stay home. We want to help you stay home and be healthy \nas you do.\n  I think that is a good thing to offer the veterans. The ones I have \nmet, there are some amazing stories in Chicago that truly warm your \nheart to know that those veterans, after what they have been through, \ncan stay home with their families and be there with the people they \nlove and who love them too.\n  There is another area I wish to mention. Our committee has pushed the \nVeterans' Administration to focus on the sustainability of orthotics \nand prosthetics. We are worried about the professional workforce that \ndeals with these important parts of restoring a veteran's life.\n  Twenty percent of the orthotics and prosthetics workforce, about \n7,000 clinicians, will retire over the next 5 years. We have never \nneeded these specialists more than we need them today: 1,715 \nservicemembers lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many have lost \nmultiple limbs. The United States has 5 quadruple amputees and 40 \ntriple amputees from these wars. The VA serves 40,000 people with limb \nloss every year. That is why I am focused on this--to get the \nprofessionals in the orthotics and prosthetics fields of medicine to be \ntrained and ready to help these veterans in the years to come while \nothers are retiring.\n\n  There are 745,000 veterans in my State, and not a single one of them \nshould be deceived about what they can receive for their service nor \ndelayed when it comes to seeing a doctor or having their claims \nprocessed. Not one of them should wait 2 years before they start \ngetting disability benefits. We have 5 VA Medical Centers, 30 \noutpatient clinics, and 11 Veterans Centers across Illinois, and we \nhave to be there to serve them in a timely way.\n  None of these facilities has the right to mislead or lie to the \nveterans about what doctors they can see or what services they can \nreceive. The Senate just added $5 million to the budget of the \ninspector general at the Veterans Administration, and the Inspector \nGeneral is now investigating 26 facilities.\n  One of the toughest votes that a Member of Congress is called on to \ncast is whether we should go to war. It has happened a few times in my \ncareer. You don't sleep well the night before, wondering how you are \ngoing to vote, and knowing that at the end of the day, even if this is \na just and necessary war, innocent people will die, including innocent \nAmericans. What I have come to learn over the years is that it is not \njust a matter of that simple decision to go to war, but it is the cost \nof war--the cost in human lives. Over 4,000 died in the war in Iraq, \nand over 2,000 have died in the war in Afghanistan. There are thousands \nand thousands who come home with injuries, and, of course, there are \nthe expenses and budget costs that come along with each and every one \nthese conflicts.\n  It really helps when you make these decisions and reflect on them to \nalso be aware and honest about the real cost of war. The real cost of \nwar in human life and human suffering can't be calculated, but we did \nmake a promise that those who would stand for our country in those wars \nwould have our help when they came home.\n  The scandal that has been reported in Arizona--the problems at the VA \ncenters--is unacceptable in a Nation as great as America, and we owe it \nto these veterans and their families to stand by them. I promise I \nwill, not just for veterans facilities in Illinois, which is my first \npriority, but for those across the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                              LEGISLATING\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \ncomments about a problem--and how extensive it is--we are seeing across \nthe United States. I don't think there is a Senator who is not looking \ninto that and ensuring that something is done. I looked at the \nresources that have been allocated, and noticed that we increased the \nresources 60 percent in the last 5 years. I think there is a severe \nmanagement problem, and after reading some of the emails I have \nreceived, I am very concerned about that.\n  I want to talk about a different subject today. A recent headline \nfrom a Capitol Hill newspaper declared that our current Congress could \nbe the ``worst ever.'' Another said negotiating political agreements is \na ``lost art.'' The whole country knows something is wrong with our \ngovernment. The problem is that Senators are being prevented from doing \ntheir job. Common sense is ignored because bills are being made in a \npolitical vacuum. This results in more lengthy, complex, \nincomprehensible laws that defy logic.\n  Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously said that Congress would \nfirst have to pass a bill in order to find out what was in it. That is \na problem. Legislation is often hundreds, if not thousands, of pages \nlong. One bill could contain provisions affecting everything from \nhealth care to housing and increase the debt by hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  I recently introduced a bill with Senator John Barrasso, also from \nWyoming, that would take a page from Wyoming's State legislature \nhandbook. In order to stop Congress from passing bills with countless, \nunrelated measures, S. Res. 351 would require any legislation \nconsidered by the Senate to be limited to a single issue. One topic per \nbill will help get things done. It means more understandable and \nmanageable bills. This is not a flashy concept, but I have found people \nof both parties are receptive to it. It makes sense to them.\n  Change is hard and those who control the Senate now like the system \nwe have. Most Members of Congress have no opportunity to weigh in, and \nneither does the public--directly or indirectly. This is a very tidy \narrangement for those who are in power now, especially in the Senate. \nNothing is approved unless the majority leader allows it to come out.\n  Dissenting opinions are rarely considered. The majority leader uses \nprocedural tactics to prohibit amendments to improve bills in order to \ncontrol the legislation and to prevent his party from taking \npolitically difficult votes. He has done this more than any other \nmajority leader--perhaps more than all the previous leaders. Political \nmotivations and consolidation of power should not be used to deny \nSenators from either party the right to represent their people.\n  Last week the majority leader used procedural tactics to prevent us \nfrom voting on tax amendments important to Wyoming, such as the \npermanent State and local sales tax deduction amendment offered by my \nfriend on the other side of the aisle, the Senator from Washington. We \nwere also prevented from voting on amendments that would be important \nto all of us, such as preventing waste of taxpayers' dollars by \nstopping the IRS from giving bonuses to employees who have not paid \ntheir taxes. Amendments were filed by Members from across the country. \nBy my count, more than 60 amendments to the tax package were filed by \nSenators from the other side of the aisle. Nobody is being represented \nby amendments. At some point we need to actually vote on the issues \nthat are important to our constituents, and Members on both sides of \nthe aisle who support these amendments need to insist on that.\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n  Last week Politico's Huddle claimed ``Senate GOP Filibusters $85B Tax \nExtenders,'' but there is no opportunity to filibuster when the debate \nis cut off before it ever begins. That is what the majority leader did \nby filing cloture on the tax extenders package. Cloture is a political \ntactic designed to bring debate to a close after a supermajority of the \nSenate is satisfied that a matter has received adequate consideration.\n\n  In recent years this majority leader has often filed a cloture motion \nimmediately--before there is an opportunity to debate or introduce \namendments, not after adequate consideration. The number of same-day \ncloture filings has more than doubled compared to when Republicans last \ncontrolled the Senate. We are not even being given a chance to debate, \nmuch less offer amendments, and that is why I have joined Senator \nGrassley, a Republican from Iowa, in cosponsoring his Stop Cloture \nAbuse Resolution. It would amend the Senate rules to prohibit filing \ncloture until there has been at least 24 hours of debate.\n  Another telling statistic is the number of amendments the current \nmajority has blocked from being considered in the Senate. As this chart \nshows, in 2005 and 2006, the Senate voted on almost 700 amendments on \nthe Senate floor. Since the Senate has been controlled by the current \nmajority, the number has dwindled. In 2011 and 2012, there were about \n350 amendments, and since July of last year, the majority leader has \nallowed votes on only 9 Senate Republican amendments. The House--where \ndebate is very limited and controlled by the majority--had 132 votes on \nDemocrat minority amendments.\n  Let's see. The minority in the Senate--the cooling saucer for the \ncountry where there is supposed to be open debate--had nine amendments. \nThe House--always controlled by the majority in a very strict way with \na rules committee--had 132 Democratic minority votes on amendments.\n  The leader has used the tactic of filling the amendment tree to \nprevent amendments from being introduced, and because of that tactic, \nthe amendment to prevent wasting taxpayers' dollars by stopping the IRS \nfrom giving bonuses to employees who have not paid their taxes doesn't \nget to come up. That is just one example of many that has happened. In \nthe last 8 years, he has used this tactic 86 times, and of course, we \nare still counting. By contrast, the last six majority leaders combined \nonly filled the tree 40 times.\n  What is filling the tree? It is a political tactic of setting up a \nfew amendments that cannot be taken down, that have to be voted on \nbefore the bill can be done, and filing cloture even prevents those \nfrom getting done.\n  The chart shows that there have been 86, and still counting, and the \nsix previous leaders only filed cloture 40 times.\n  Filling the amendment tree has become a routine way to prevent any \nSenator--majority or minority--from exercising their right to offer an \namendment because once the tree is filled, no Senator can offer an \namendment.\n  Almost half of the Senate has been here less than 6 years. Yes, 45 of \nthe 100 Senators are in their first term. They don't realize that there \nis a better way. They have not seen how it could work, how it did work, \nand how it should work.\n  I know how this can hurt. I once had a bill that would have been the \nfirst step of 10 for solving health care in this country, and it was a \nsmall business health plan. It would have allowed small businesses \nacross the country to join together through their association to get a \nbig enough block to effectively negotiate with the insurance company or \neven set up their own selfinsurance pool.\n  The majority leader was willing to bring it up and then filled the \ntree and filed cloture. I had 2 people that would have made the 60 \nvotes necessary to get that passed, but each had 1 amendment to the \nbill, and they would have been good amendments. They were not allowed \nto bring up their amendments, and consequently I wound up being just \nshort to pass a very important bill that would have brought down health \ncare costs for this country and might have encouraged people to do the \nother nine steps in the plan that Senator Kennedy and I put together \nand provided more in the way of insurance than what we have now, and it \nwould have been paid for.\n  Committees should have the first opportunity to shape legislation. It \nis there that Members are able to iron out unintended consequences and \ncraft better legislation before it goes to the floor. There is a lot of \nflexibility in the committee process. I used to sit down and go through \nall the amendments. There might be 200 amendments on a bill we were \nworking on, and we would put them into piles according to what we \ncovered. We would look to see who was involved in that particular pile \nand send that bipartisan group off to come up with a solution to these \nmultiple solutions that had been presented. They were usually able to \ncraft something out of that and bring it back as another amendment that \nwould make the bill better and eliminate unintended consequences and \nperform a real service for our country.\n  Most of the bills now don't go to committee first. After a bill goes \nto committee, then it comes to the floor. All 100 Members of the Senate \nshould have an opportunity to improve the legislation. The reason we \nhave so many people in Congress--100 here and 435 at the other end of \nthe building--is to bring together 535 different backgrounds that can \nsuggest improvements to bills. Different Members may know something \nfrom their background that others may not have noticed, and that is why \nwe do amendments. Rarely is that happening in today's Senate. More \noften than not, committees are ignored and massive legislation is the \nresult of a few people behind closed doors deal making for the more \nthan 535 Members of Congress. We need to get away from deal making and \nstart legislating again, and that is apparent, especially in our \nspending. The job of Congress is to decide how much the Federal \nGovernment should spend and on what priorities. That is not being done \nunder the Senate's current management. Deals are made.\n  In fact, last January, the legislation we voted on was a deal between \none Member of the House and one Member of the Senate. Do you know how \nmany amendments we got on that? Nobody had an amendment to it. The \ndebate was very limited. There was $1.1 trillion spent on one vote that \nwas put together by two people. That is deal making, not legislating, \nand that is what is costing this country so much money and what stifles \nthings.\n  A couple of weeks ago we had a bill that was allowed to have \namendments, and in 2 days we covered the amendments and passed the bill \nunanimously because it had been improved significantly. That is what we \nneed to get back to. More time is spent on negotiating not to have \namendments than it would take to vote on 75 amendments on a bill. Yes, \na lot of them would fail, and that is typical, but at least a Senator \ncould feel that his constituents have been heard but he just didn't \nhave the votes for it. At least they have been heard, and that is what \nwe are missing right now.\n  We are not getting to cover the amendments, and they can be covered \nrelatively quickly. So deals are made and then spending bills are all \npackaged into one massive ``take it or leave it'' bill and the deficit \nhas increased.\n  In 2013, the Senate didn't pass a single appropriations bill. We were \nsupposed to do 12 of them right after April 15. We didn't do any of \nthem. We only considered 1 of the 12 bills on the Senate floor, and \nthat bill was shut down because the first amendment the majority leader \ndidn't like, so he pulled it off of the floor and he never brought it \nup again, nor did he bring up any other spending bill. Is it any wonder \nthat since January 2009 the total Federal debt stood at $10.6 trillion \nand now it is over $17 trillion? We don't budget; we don't appropriate; \nwe just deal-make. It has never risen so high so fast in our country's \nhistory.\n\n  Similar to legislation on one topic per bill, we should look at each \nspending bill individually. The committees should be able to look \nclosely at each branch and each agency. That is how it used to work \nbefore the power shift, but we can make some changes now to encourage \nmore spending scrutiny. We could switch to a biennial appropriations \nprocess. That means once every 2\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\nyears for each agency. I have introduced S. 625, the Biennial \nAppropriations Act, and I am cosponsoring Senator Johnny Isakson's \nversion of the legislation.\n  My bill would require the President to submit a 2-year budget \nresolution at the beginning of each Congress. Congress would then adopt \na budget resolution. Following adoption of a budget resolution, \nCongress would focus on appropriations bills. Each Congress would \ndebate the Defense appropriations bill; however, the other \nappropriations bills would be split into two groups. The more \ncontroversial bills would be debated in the first year after an \nelection and the easy ones would be done the year before an election. \nOf course the bill would mandate at least one joint oversight hearing \nwith the authorization committee and the Appropriations Committee in \nthe off-appropriations year for those particular bills.\n  When you are spending a trillion dollars, it is so much money that \nnobody can look at the details. I don't even remember the last time we \nlooked at something as small as a billion dollars, let alone a million \ndollars, and a million is a lot of money out where I live. We have to \nget back to where we can have some scrutiny on the appropriations, not \na one-time deal.\n  Congress has 535 elected representatives. When each of us looks at \nevery proposal, lots of viewpoints and experience get put into the \ndecisions we make for our country, but if all decisions are made by the \nmajority leader, the vast majority of Americans get shortchanged. \nShortcuts are taken, committees are skipped. Legislation is long, \ncumbersome, and it is not easily read and understood. If you skip all \nthe process to do that, then spending will reach all-time highs and we \nwill get less for our money. That has to change.\n  These are some ideas on how we can solve those problems. This won't \nchange unless those who are here exercise our rights. That may not \nhappen until those outside Washington demand that these and other ideas \nget considered. Demand your Senators be allowed to represent you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I wish to speak as if in morning business to talk about \none issue, IRS overreach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Before I do that, I do want to say to my friend who just \nspoke, I am one of those who loves biennial budgets. I think it is a \ngreat idea and one we should continue to work toward. It makes work a \nlittle bit better and we also get a little bit longer planning horizon.\n\n\n                             IRS Overreach\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor because there has been a lot of \ntalk recently in different areas about the IRS, and virtually none of \nit is good. Let me be clear. The IRS going after taxpayers for debts \nallegedly incurred by their dead relatives is shocking. Tax-delinquent \nemployees with IRS bonuses are offensive. Targeting individuals or \ngroups for their political beliefs is unacceptable. But today I want to \ntalk about a different issue: a vital industry in my State crushed by \noverbearing IRS enforcement of their own incomprehensible regulations.\n  Folks who have been to Alaska know we have some of the most beautiful \nterrain in the world. Most of the best sights, however, are off the \nroad system. What does that mean? That means you cannot drive to them. \nThat means if you want to visit a remote part of the Denali National \nPark or try to spot some bears or go to a great fishing area, the \neasiest way to do that is by airplane.\n  Companies that provide these sightseeing services are overwhelmingly \nsmall businesses, mom-and-pop operators. They aren't tax attorneys. \nThey aren't CPAs. They are pilots. They live to fly. As you can see \nright here, this is an incredible view right outside of a glacier where \na small plane has just landed. That is why it is so devastating that at \nleast one of these businesses had to sell its plane to pay the IRS and \nclose up shop forever. Countless others live under the cloud of \nuncertainty because the IRS goes to extraordinary lengths to find them \nliable for taxes. In fact, one company received this massive tax bill, \nincluding penalties, even after they had negotiated with the IRS and \nreceived a favorable resolution. In other words, this bill came after \nthey had agreed with the IRS to get rid of these penalties and these \ninterest charges and everything else. The IRS said there was a little \nmixup, and maybe for them that is all it was, but for a small business \nit could mean financial ruin. Also, getting a bill like this would \ndrive you crazy after you just had a conversation with the IRS and \nresolved this.\n  Let me give a little history. Air transportation is usually subject \nto excise taxes, which go to a trust fund for airports, much like the \ngas tax pays for the highway trust fund. But since 1970 Congress has \nmade it crystal clear that these excise taxes shouldn't apply to small \naircraft, the type shown in the first photo.\n  Here is another example. These types of planes have not been subject \nto excise taxes since 1970, unless they are flying regularly scheduled \nroutes, such as the route I take going back home to Alaska. I fly from \nthe airport in Washington, DC, to Seattle and then to Anchorage. Those \nare regularly scheduled flights.\n  But the IRS brought down the enforcement hammer on some businesses in \nNevada and Alaska. Those companies sued the IRS and eventually lost. So \nCongress came back again in 2005 and said, look, we meant what we said \nin 1970. Small aircraft used for sightseeing are supposed to be exempt \nfrom excise tax--pretty simple, pretty clear, not complicated.\n  But the IRS doesn't get it. The IRS still won't listen to Congress. \nThe IRS still thinks it can ignore the plain meaning of the law backed \nby clear congressional intent. A lot of folks around here talk about \nFederal overreach. This is a perfect example of Federal overreach. \nCongress told the IRS not once but twice: Small aircraft offering \nsightseeing services should not have to collect excise taxes, and still \nthe IRS thumbed its nose at Congress and says, ``We'll do whatever we \nlike,'' in clear contradiction to the plain meaning of the statute that \nwas supposed to be upheld.\n  That is not the way this country is supposed to work. Agencies such \nas the IRS don't get to go it alone. They are bound by the Constitution \nto enforce and follow the laws that Congress writes.\n  I was pleased about a recent letter that was written to the Alaska \nAir Carriers Association in which the IRS acknowledged their guidance \nwas unclear and inappropriately enforced. They offered to give refunds \nto companies flying small aircraft on sightseeing tours. While it is a \nstep in the right direction to recognize they got it wrong, they \nrefused to back down completely. The IRS is still reserving the right \nto go after these same companies in the future.\n  That is why I called the IRS Commissioner into my office last week \nand that is why I am here today, to make it clear to the IRS that I \nwill not stand idly by while they send Alaskan small businesses into \nbankruptcy. I will keep coming here as long as I have to, until the IRS \nlets Alaskan small businesses do what they do best: Fly and share all \nof the beautiful sights my great State of Alaska has to offer to all \nAlaskans and all Americans.\n  It is happening in Alaska. It is starting to happen in other States. \nMy guess is this will go anywhere there are sightseeing planes to be \ndetermined from the IRS perspective that they know what is best. The \nlaw is clear. The IRS in their letter made it clear that their \ninterpretation of the law may be unclear and inappropriately enforced. \nWell, if it is wrong, don't enforce it, or enforce it the way it was \nset out in 1970 and 2005. If you put someone in a plane and take them \nout for sightseeing, they are exempt. There is no rate or schedule.\n  Here is what is also amazing about this. I will go to this first \nphoto again, the one with the glacier. They are restricted as to where \nthey can go. So when the IRS says they flew from point A to point B on \na regular basis, that is because they are regulated by the Federal \nGovernment to go to that location. I think this visitor would love to \nfly all around the glaciers, but they are not allowed to by Federal \nlaw. So they are sightseeing, and the law is clear about this. But, \nonce again, the IRS has determined what they think the\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\nlaw is. The FAA, which regulates the air industry, makes it clear who \nis sightseeing and who is regularly scheduled. So I would plead with \nthe IRS to do the right thing here, settle this issue once and for all \nand make it crystal clear. The law has been passed by Congress--not \nonce but twice. It is time to get off the backs of these small \nbusinesses, small business people, not only in my State but across this \ncountry. Ensure they can do their business, and make sure the great \nsights of Alaska can be seen by anybody anytime through these great \ntour operators who operate in my State and the operators all around the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 WRRDA\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the 2013 \nWater Resources Reform and Development Act conference report. I agree \nwith my colleagues who have spoken about this and who believe that \npassing this conference report is important for our communities. As \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure \nand as one of the members of the conference committee that came out \nwith this report, I believe the agreement we have today addresses the \nissues facing the Army Corps of Engineers and facing our country.\n  We have problems in this country with aging infrastructure, we have \nproblems with a lack of transparency, and we have problems with fiscal \naccountability--all of which impact public health, public safety, as \nwell as the environmental welfare of our communities. As a conferee, I \nand my staff have worked with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand both sides of the building, House and Senate, to create a \nbipartisan product to address these real concerns. We may have our \ndifferences on some key issues, but the bulk of what we have \naccomplished is about protecting our States. It is about protecting our \nconstituents. It is not about partisan politics.\n  For example, issues such as flood mitigation are very important to my \nhome State of Wyoming. Predicting floods and being able and better \nprepared for them is a major component in keeping Wyoming and other \nwestern communities safe. That is why we have successfully included \nlanguage in this bill for the authorization of the Upper Missouri Basin \nflood and drought monitoring. This program will restore the stream \ngauges and the snowpack monitors through the Upper Missouri Basin at \nall elevations. These gauges are used to monitor snow depth and soil \nmoisture to help inform agencies such as the Corps of Engineers as to \npotential flooding as well as drought in the future. This type of \nmonitoring will help protect communities and will save lives.\n  We also included language in this bill for technical assistance to \nhelp rural communities comply with environmental regulations. Rural \ncommunities often don't have the expertise or the funding to make \nimportant upgrades to their water systems. Dedicated professionals, \nsuch as the folks at the Wyoming Rural Water Association, use this \nfunding to go into those communities and provide the critical \nassistance these people need.\n  We also secured an agreement that establishes a 5-year pilot program \nknown as the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. This \nprogram will allow the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental \nProtection Agency to provide loans and loan guarantees for flood \ncontrol, for community water systems, for aging water distribution \nfacilities, and for wastewater infrastructure projects. It also \nincludes language that makes tribes eligible for the loans.\n  As I mentioned, transparency and fiscal responsibility are also \nimportant components to tackling the issues that need to be addressed \nwith the Army Corps of Engineers. That is why we have included language \nin the conference report to create an Army Corps project \ndeauthorization process. Under this process, the Army Corps would \nidentify projects for deauthorization based on established criteria. \nThen, after taking public input, they would submit those projects as a \nsingle package for an up-or-down vote in the Congress.\n  Many of these projects are on the books and have been on the books \nfor extended periods of time, and they authorize the expenditure of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars. Yet these are projects that are going \nnowhere. Under this conference report, the Corps would have to propose \na list of the projects to cut. The list would total $18 billion and \nwould be sent to Congress for this up-or-down vote. And $18 billion is \nmore than enough to offset the entire total authorization of this piece \nof legislation.\n  It truly is time for the Corps of Engineers and for Congress to clean \nthe books, cut the waste, and bring fiscal responsibility to this WRDA \nprocess.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues, including Chairman Boxer, Ranking \nMember Vitter, and former Senator and subcommittee ranking member Max \nBaucus for the bipartisan process under which this bill was considered.\n  The conference report is not perfect, but I believe we have achieved \na product that is substantive, effective, and in the public interests. \nIt is a product that will save lives, maintain the flow of commerce, \nand protect communities for years to come. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this conference \nreport.\n  Once again, I thank the Presiding Officer and my committee colleagues \nfor their willingness to work together on this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto give this speech in full.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments this afternoon \nto correct the record on something very important.\n  In his opening remarks this morning, the distinguished Senate \nmajority leader made a number of claims and accusations relating to the \ntax extenders legislation.\n  As you will recall, last week the Senate voted not to invoke cloture \non the substitute amendment to the tax extenders bill. Since that time, \nthe Senate majority leader has been accusing Republicans of voting \nagainst tax relief. He said we are obstructionists and that we ``work \nso hard to do nothing.'' This is, as we know, par for the course.\n  When the majority leader is not calling out American citizens by name \nand attacking them for getting involved in the political process, he is \nusually accusing Senate Republicans of one thing or another, and doing \nit so unjustifiably.\n  Today, he attacked me personally for my vote against cloture on the \ntax extenders substitute, saying: ``The primary Republican who \nnegotiated this, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nvoted against his own bill.''\n  It is true that I negotiated. It is true that I helped to get it \nthrough the committee. It is true that I got our side to agree to a \nvoice vote.\n  Needless to say, I cannot let this go unanswered. I am here now to \nset the record straight.\n  First and foremost, I want to make clear that I support the tax \nextenders legislation, and everybody in this body knows it, and if they \ndo not, then they better go take an IQ test. I want to see that bill \npassed, and I believe we should pass it sooner rather than later.\n  I do not want speak for anyone else, but I suspect that the majority \nof Senate Republicans feel the same way. But there are serious and \nlegitimate process issues at stake here.\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\n  At the time of last week's cloture vote, the substitute amendment had \nbeen available to the full Senate for little more than a day. Although \nthere were 167 amendments filed--including about 70 Democratic Party \namendments--the distinguished majority leader blocked the consideration \nof any and all amendments.\n  This, unfortunately, has become the norm here in the Senate, where we \nhave voted for a grand total of 9 Republican amendments in the past 10 \nmonths--9. By contrast, in the House of Representatives, where the \nRepublicans are in complete control, where the Rules Committee is 9 to \n4 in favor of Republicans--the committee that decides what comes to the \nfloor--the Democrats, who are in the minority, have had votes on 242 of \ntheir amendments in that same timeframe.\n  Sheila Jackson Lee, for instance, a single Democratic House Member, \nhas received votes on 22 separate amendments in the same timeframe that \nall Republican Senators have, combined, received votes on only 9.\n  So, yes, I, along with almost all of my Republican colleagues, voted \nagainst cloture--in fact, all but one voted against cloture--on the tax \nextenders substitute. But I made it clear before and after the vote \nthat my vote against cloture was a vote to allow Senators--both \nRepublicans and Democrats, especially those who do not serve on the \nSenate Finance Committee--an opportunity to amend the tax extenders \nlegislation, something you would think every Senator in this body would \nwant to justify and would want to support.\n  As I said, at the time of the cloture vote, there were a total of 167 \namendments filed. Yet the Senate majority attempted to close off debate \non the bill without considering or voting on a single amendment--on a \nbill costing $85 billion so far. That is no way to operate the Senate, \nparticularly on a bill as broad and as consequential as the tax \nextenders bill.\n  There are a lot of interests at stake with the expired or expiring \ntax provisions, a number of voices that deserve to be heard. Why, then, \nwould we want to rush through the debate without considering a single \nsolitary amendment? It does not make sense.\n  My vote against cloture was never intended to kill this legislation, \nas the majority leader claimed this morning. As I made clear last week, \nmy vote was for a fair, open, and cooperative process--a bipartisan \nprocess, if you will, something we have not had much of around here \nlately. I would have thought the majority leader would have been \nlistening last week when Republicans, including myself, made it very \nclear why we were voting against cloture. But either he was not \nlistening or he forgot everything we said because this morning he came \nto the floor to attack us, once again, claiming that somehow our votes \nagainst cloture on the tax extenders legislation were related to \nPresident Obama.\n  So let me make it clear for our distinguished majority leader and \nanyone else who may be misunderstanding what is going on with the tax \nextenders bill. This has nothing to do with President Obama. There is \nonly one person who is stopping the tax extenders bill from moving \nforward. It is not me. It is not the minority leader. It is not anyone \non the Republican side or caucus.\n  The distinguished majority leader could solve this impasse today if \nhe would simply allow the Senate to operate in a way it always has. He \nknows--and he knew then when he made these comments because we chatted \nthe day before--he knew that my job is to try and winnow down the total \nnumber of amendments on this bill, approaching almost 100 for each \nside, and get it to where we basically could pass this bill.\n  He can come to the floor as often as he wants to attack Republican \nSenators or anyone else, but that does not change the fact that he is \nthe one in control here. He is the one who will decide if the Senate \nwill live up to its legacy of being the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world or if it will continue to be what it has become--a graveyard \nof ideas.\n  Once again, I stand willing and able to work with the Democrats to \nget this bill across the finish line. I do want this legislation to \npass. It is important legislation. But I do think we ought to have the \nSenate operate as it always has in the past, where each side has at \nleast a reasonable opportunity to bring up amendments that they \nconsider to be important. It is important that the Senate operate in \nthat way, and not in the way it is currently being operated. As I said, \nit is not up to me.\n\n\n                       California Drought Relief\n\n  I would like to take a moment to address the California drought \nrelief bill Senator Feinstein has been working so hard on for the past \nseveral months. There is no question that we are facing some very \nserious conditions across the West. We need to be doing all we can to \nprovide relief to the farmers in California and elsewhere. But it does \nnot make any sense that this drought has gotten to the point that it \nhas when it could have been avoided. This is a manmade crisis. The \nwater that should have been and could have been stored behind the dams \nin California's Central Valley during the past several years has \ninstead been flushed downstream to create fish habitat for the \nendangered delta smelt. Now, do not get me wrong, protecting our \nnatural resources is important. But there is a problem with our system \nwhen we put the needs of fish--and especially this fish--ahead of the \nneeds of people.\n  This is happening in other States too. We are seeing the needs of \npeople made secondary to the regulatory requirements that may or may \nnot even be benefiting the species they are designed to help.\n  I think we have some of the stupidest people in the environmental \nmovement that you can possibly imagine. They consistently place these \ntrumped-up situations against human beings and humankind. It is getting \nreal old to me.\n  Senator Barrasso has an amendment to Senator Feinstein's bill that \nwould bring some common sense into this situation by allowing for some \nflexibility for communities that are facing dire situations as the \nresult of Federal regulatory requirements.\n  I support the Barrasso amendment and would have liked to have seen it \nincluded in the California drought relief bill. I also recognize that \nthe farmers and farm workers in California cannot afford to have \nCongress playing games with their livelihood. For that reason, I am not \ngoing to object to this bill.\n  To have California, where some of the greatest, most productive \nfarmlands in the world are, basically shut down for really what are \nstupid approaches when there could be an accommodation to help both \nsides on those issues is hard for me to understand.\n  When the members of the California delegation sit down with the \ncommittees of jurisdiction to work out the differences between the \nFeinstein bill and the bill that has already passed the House, I would \nurge them to implement Senator Barrasso's proposal into the final bill. \nThis will help rural communities across America avoid getting into \npotentially disastrous situations that are caused by out-of-date, out-\nof-touch regulations.\n  The economy and job creation do not have to be at odds with \nconservation. This is the perfect opportunity to create some badly \nneeded flexibility to make sure they are not. I, for one, would like to \nsee that for a change in the Senate.\n  I sure would like to see us depoliticize this place so we can work \ntogether again. I have been here only 38 years, but I have to tell you, \nthere were many times in that 38 years where we worked together, we \nsolved the problems of America together, and we had the country running \nwell. Frankly, we all walked out of here feeling pretty good.\n  Most people in the Senate right now do not feel all that good--first \nof all, because of the way it is being run; secondly, because there is \na partisan divide that exists--on both sides, by the way; thirdly, \nbecause we have a rough time getting people together in a bipartisan \nway; and last but not least, because we do not spend much time together \nanymore. It used to be that Senators got together and cared more for \neach other and cared less about attacking each other and cared less \nabout some of the ridiculous, stupid things that have been going on \nover the last few years.\n  I would suggest to my Democratic friends that they start thinking \nthis over because the Senate has really gone downhill. We have to stop \nit and start working together for the best interests of our country.\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of S. 2366 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n               Water Resources Reform and Development Act\n\n  Mr. WICKER. I rise this afternoon to express my strong support for a \nnew Water Resources Reform and Development Act, which we can send to \nthe President this very week, and it will be a great bipartisan \naccomplishment. It will be a major win for economic development also.\n  I am proud to have worked on this legislation as a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and I am excited about the \npotential the WRRDA bill has to make a difference in States such as my \nhome State of Mississippi.\n  Like many States, we routinely depend on water infrastructure. In \nMississippi, our ports and waterways are crucial to commerce, and our \nsystem of levees protects us from natural disasters. These modernized \nports and commercial waterways are critical to maintaining \ncompetitiveness in a global economy. They are essential to boosting \ntrade and job growth across the Nation.\n  The House-Senate agreement on this new water resources bill--the \nfirst in 7 years, I might add--would accomplish a number of goals, from \nrestructuring the inland waterway system to completing storm protection \nprojects. It would help ensure that U.S. industries have a reliable, \nnavigable, and cost-effective transportation network to do business.\n  In particular, I am encouraged by reforms to the harbor maintenance \ntrust fund which promise to help our ports with much needed dredging. \nThe fund, which was established for port improvements, is currently \nunderutilized. Using this money for its intended purpose would help \nfacilitate critical port upgrades--an especially important investment \nin preparation for the upcoming completion of the Panama Canal \nexpansion.\n  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has estimated that America's busiest \nports, including the Port of Pascagoula in Mississippi, are operating \nat their full capacity only 35 percent of the time or less. This is \nunacceptable. As a matter of fact, for other ports around the country, \nthe situation is worse than that.\n  A lapse in maintenance can become a vicious cycle, impairing a port's \nability to secure future maintenance dredging. Coastal ports, such as \nMississippi's Port of Gulfport, have been disadvantaged as a result. We \nhaven't received the maintenance. We have less traffic. Therefore, we \nare entitled to less future maintenance dredging.\n  I am pleased to report to my colleagues that thanks to an amendment \nby Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi on crediting authority for \nnavigation projects, ports such as the Port of Gulfport would have \ngreater flexibility in making dredging upgrades.\n  Other provisions in the new water resources bill seek to ensure \nfiscal responsibility by streamlining project requirements and \ntimelines. This means allowing greater private contributions to \ninfrastructure repairs and deauthorizing projects no longer in the \nnational interest.\n  Mississippians understand why water resource infrastructure matters. \nIn recent years we have faced very different challenges because of \nextreme conditions on the Mississippi River. First, historic flooding \nput flood control mechanisms such as the Mississippi River and \nTributaries Project to the test. Then the very next year severe drought \nturned large stretches of the river into nothing more than sandy \nbeaches. These situations can have a big impact. Any disruption in the \nmovement of goods along the Mississippi River has the potential to \naffect staple products such as corn, grain, and petroleum. When that \nhappens, consumers are often left with higher costs. The Mississippi \nRiver alone is responsible for more than $100 billion of America's \ngross domestic product.\n  For our coastal communities, this Water Resources Reform and \nDevelopment Act would also advance beneficial storm protection \nprojects. Many of these projects, developed after Hurricane Katrina \nunder the Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program, have been left \nunfinished. Their completion would help create more resilient coastal \ncommunities and lower the risk of future hurricane and storm damage.\n  Of course, our work is not finished. Implementing this legislation \nwill require oversight, and more can be done to improve our inland \nwaterway trust fund and to protect medium-use ports. I hope in a couple \nof years we will be considering another Water Resources Development \nAct. In other words, I hope we don't wait another 7 years for a WRDA. \nBut today and tomorrow we have an opportunity for a great step forward, \ndemonstrating the strong bipartisan cooperation that exists in the \nHouse and Senate for America's future vitality and competitiveness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                                 China\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I rise to discuss the growing problem with U.S.-China \nrelations.\n  Earlier their week we saw another example of how the Chinese \nCommunist government will do everything it can--anything--to get ahead. \nThe United States of America, in something that rarely happens, charged \nfive Chinese military officers and accused them of hacking into \nAmerican nuclear, metal, and solar companies to steal trade secrets.\n  This is not only a national security concern, it is an economic \nconcern. Two who were allegedly hacked are U.S. Steel and the United \nSteelworkers union--organizations with which I have helped to file \nunfair trade practice cases against Chinese state-owned companies. It \nis not only a cause-and-effect, but these two entities, a steel company \nand a steelworkers union, filed unfair trade practices against China, \nand now the U.S. Government is filing legal charges against them for \ngoing after these two companies--against the Chinese.\n  We won these trade cases because we held China's feet to the fire and \nused our trade laws to level the playing field for our steel companies \nand our steelworkers. Jobs were saved and factories stayed open because \nof these trade cases, and that is precisely why China is targeting \nthese companies.\n  We know the Chinese will do just about anything to get ahead \neconomically. Fair enough. We also know that China will cheat and spy. \nThe best example is currency manipulation, which makes Chinese exports \nmore competitive.\n  When you manipulate the currency--when China sells products into the \nUnited States, the price is less, basically subsidizing Chinese exports \ninto the United States, putting American workers out of jobs. When U.S. \ncompanies export to China, because China has manipulated the currency, \nit means that the prices are higher for these American goods, making \nthem significantly less than competitive, if you will, in China. So \nwhen China cheats on currency, our workers at U.S. Steel in Lorain, \nWheatland Tube in Warren, Vallourec Star in Youngstown, and TMK IPSCO \nin Brookfield lose out, and when our workers suffer, our economy \nsuffers.\n  A December 2012 report by the Peterson Institute--a conservative \nthink tank--found that currency manipulation by foreign governments \ncosts the government between--quite a range--1 million and 5 million \njobs, increasing\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\nthe U.S. trade deficit by $200 to $500 billion a year. These are \nmanufacturing jobs that are about export or competing with imports. \nThey are almost always pretty good-paying jobs.\n  In 2012 our trade deficit with China broke $300 billion for the first \ntime, and then in 2013 for the second time it broke $300 billion.\n  An Economic Policy Institute report notes that ``addressing currency \nmanipulation is the single most important policy change for U.S. \nworkers.'' EPI argues that up to 5.8 million American jobs--40 percent \nof them in manufacturing--would be created if currency manipulation \nwere eliminated by next year. It would reduce the goods deficit by at \nleast $200 billion. For my home State of Ohio, EPI found that \neliminating global currency manipulation by next year would create \n254,000 jobs--up to 75,900 in manufacturing; reduce Ohio's unemployment \nrate by nearly 3 percentage points; increase Ohio's GDP by up to $17.4 \nbillion; and improve the fiscal position of Ohio's State and local \ngovernments altogether by up to $3.7 billion. That is only Ohio. It \ndoesn't count Connecticut; it doesn't count Arizona; it doesn't count \nthe other 47 States. That is why we are urging the administration to be \nmore aggressive and level the playing field for American workers and \nbusinesses.\n  We should pass my bipartisan legislation with Senators Sessions, \nGraham, Stabenow, Hagan, and others, which would treat currency \nmanipulation as an unfair trade subsidy and require the Commerce \nDepartment to investigate currency manipulation.\n  It is also why we must urge China to comply with the World Trade \nOrganization commitments and fully and faithfully implement all the WTO \nrulings against it.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative's report paints a sobering picture of \nthe Chinese state's efforts to intervene in the economy and unfairly \nhelp China's businesses despite its WTO commitments that it wouldn't do \nthat. China still has not agreed to the procurement agreement from WTO. \nBy not doing so, our businesses miss out on the opportunity to compete \nfor potentially $100 billion a year in contracts. In other words, China \nwon't let us sell into their country in many cases because they don't \nfollow the WTO procurement agreement.\n  Another issue noted by the USTR is China's imposition of retaliatory \nduties against countries bringing WTO cases against it. One case \ninvolving grain-oriented electrical steel--and I was speaking to an \nexecutive at AK Steel, David Horn, an executive at AK Steel in \nsouthwest Ohio--China not only lost in a WTO challenge but now appears \nto not comply with the ruling. The continued imposition of these duties \neven after WTO ruled against it has caused significant harm to \ncompanies such as AK Steel, as I mentioned, which is based in West \nChester, OH.\n  The issue of retaliation figured prominently in the latest cyber \nespionage cases brought by the Department of Justice. Several American \ncompanies and the steelworkers union that were targeted were taking \npart in trade cases to challenge China's unfair trade practices.\n  China tries to intimidate our companies and they try to intimidate \nthe U.S. Government from holding them accountable to international and \nU.S. laws. Living up to their trade obligations and promoting the rule \nof law in China not only benefits American companies, American workers, \nand American local communities, it also benefits the Chinese people.\n  There are already examples of Chinese companies willing to play by \nthe rules. I applaud the announcement that Fuyao Glass Industry Group, \na Chinese producer of auto safety items, has finalized its agreement to \nbuy the former General Motors plant in Moraine, OH, a Dayton suburb. It \nis an example of how fair trade and foreign direct investment going \nboth ways can benefit the Chinese, a Chinese company, and create 800 \nnew jobs in Ohio. But to truly have a fair trading relationship, there \nmust be a level playing field. That means playing by international \nrules.\n  This brings me to my final point. If China continues to manipulate \nits currency, cheating American workers, cheating American businesses, \nrefuses to abide by WTO rules, is now accused of stealing trade secrets \nfrom American companies and unions, why in the world would this Senate \neven consider and why would the President consider entering into a \nbilateral investment treaty with China? Have we not learned?\n  In 1999, the year 2000, we passed permanent normal trade relations \nwith China. Many of these issues were aired then. China said they would \nfollow the rule of law. China said they would do it right. China hasn't \nfollowed the rule of law. China hasn't done it right. China hasn't \nplayed fair. So we are considering entering into a bilateral investment \ntreaty with China? I don't think so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 394\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 88, S. 394, the Metal \nTheft Prevention Act; that the bill be read a third time and passed; \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the theft of \nvaluable metal is a serious crime, one that can damage valuable \ninfrastructure--sometimes government infrastructure--and it can cause \nserious harm to businesses and to the owners of the infrastructure at \nissue. For this reason, many States, including my own State of Utah, \nhave enacted measures that deter such criminal activity and punish \nharshly those who engage in this type of criminal activity. These \nmeasures are generally appropriate, but where the Federal Government \nenacts legislation creating criminal penalties, we as lawmakers must be \ncareful to respect the Constitution's enumerated powers and the \nconstitutionally ordained structure of federalism.\n  I have heard concerns expressed regarding people who steal valuable \nmetal and cross State lines to sell stolen metal. While I would support \nFederal legislation addressed to such truly interstate, unavoidably \nnational circumstances, I cannot support legislation that more broadly \nregulates intrastate conduct.\n  Because this bill exceeds Congress's power under the commerce clause \nand imposes a Federal regulatory scheme in an area of the law the \nConstitution properly reserves to the States, I must object to the \nSenate passing it by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I appreciate hearing Senator Lee's \nobjection. I do believe this is an issue that has been delayed for too \nlong. The bill passed the Judiciary Committee by voice vote last June. \nYet businesses, communities, and individuals continue to be victimized.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. This is legislation that has been \nintroduced with Senator Graham of South Carolina, with Senator Hoeven \nof North Dakota--two Republicans--as well as Senator Schumer and \nSenator Coons. As I noted, it passed the Judiciary Committee. Yet we \nstill have objections from the other side--people who are holding up \nthis bill. At the same time, metal theft continues to rise across the \ncountry.\n  This bill does not create the kind of burdens my friend mentioned. \nThis bill is very narrow. The only crime it creates for a Federal crime \nis a crime of theft of critical infrastructure--critical \ninfrastructure, something that could threaten the national security--\nand this is not a far reach, given we have seen people stealing copper \npipes, given we have seen houses blow up. So it is not a far reach at \nall.\n  Secondly, what does this bill do? It leaves it to States to decide \nwhat metal theft laws they want. In the end, it does not preempt those \nlaws. If States have laws that are on point, if they have laws relating \nto metal theft that create some kind of a requirement that not \neverything can be paid for by cash so law enforcement can actually \ntrack this, then we have a situation where that State law would govern.\n  It is not an overly burdensome law. In fact, many States are adopting \nthese kinds of laws. Our problem is there are some States that refuse \nto adopt these kinds of laws. So people are stealing\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\nmetal from places such as Minnesota and bringing it to those States--to \nscrap metal dealerships that are accepting that metal and that don't \nhave to report any kind of information to the police and don't have to \nhave any recordkeeping.\n  We have a national problem. If you don't believe me, listen to this \nstory. Just last week, in my home State, metal thieves robbed dozens of \nveterans' graves--veterans' graves as we are approaching Memorial Day. \nWhat did they do? They took the brass rods that hold their symbol of \nservice.\n  People want to tell me this isn't a problem? People are stealing \nstars on veterans' graves and they are stealing the brass rods that \nhold their symbols of service. Just when families are gathered for \nMemorial Day, we have metal thieves wreaking havoc because they can go \nto some scrap metal dealer that isn't following the law and sell it and \nno one is going to keep track of who they are.\n  This is a crime. This is a crime, and it is not the first time. On \nMemorial Day in 2012, thieves stole more than 200 Bronze Star markers \nfrom veterans' graves in Isanti County, MN.\n  So I ask my colleagues who are holding up the bill how they explain \ndefending this kind of practice and allowing it to continue, when this \nmetal is being taken because it is valuable and it can be brought to \nscrap metal dealers that aren't following the law.\n  Metal thieves have become infamous for shameless acts such as this. \nThese thieves will stop at nothing to get this high-priced metal and \nmake a quick buck. Last month thieves stole the aluminum wheelchair \nramp from the front steps of a man's house in Washington, stranding the \nman inside.\n  Enough is enough. Are our friends going to be listening to some scrap \nmetal dealers when most of them follow the law, but clearly some don't \nwant to follow the law; is that what we are listening to in this \nChamber? Are we going to listen to the veterans of this country? Are we \ngoing to listen to the police groups?\n  By the way, this bill has been endorsed by the Major Cities Chiefs of \nPolice, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the Major County Sheriffs' \nAssociation. So I ask, are we going to listen to those groups or are we \ngoing to listen to the scrap metal lobby?\n  In Minneapolis, thieves have targeted the city's oldest continuously \nused church. First, they stole the copper downspouts. Then they came \nback to steal two air-conditioners and gut the copper supply lines to \nthe kitchen freezers. Before the church even had time to replace the \nstolen air-conditioners, the thieves came back a third time to steal a \nthird air-conditioner and gut the newly replaced copper lines. \nReplacing the stolen items and installing security fixtures has cost \nthe parish thousands of dollars that could have otherwise been spent on \nthe good work of the church.\n  These thefts have cost the parish more than money, it has also cost a \ntradition. This church has been serving French meat pies since the late \n1800s, but this year they had to cancel it because of the thieves.\n  Last winter at a recreation center in St. Paul, MN, thieves stole \n$20,000 worth of pipe from the outdoor ice rink, causing the center to \nclose until local businesses donated labor and materials to make the \nrepairs--$20,000 worth of pipe. The problem is the replacement is much \nmore than $20,000. It was hundreds of thousands of dollars because they \nhave to repair the whole ice rink.\n\n  In Rochester, MN, I met with local businesses that have been robbed \nby metal thieves--one local business 12 times in just the past 2 years \nand has suffered more than $150,000 in losses, similar to the story \nSenator Hoeven and I heard when we met with electric companies in Fargo \nand in Moorhead. During one of the robberies in Rochester, thieves even \nstole a truck with the company logo on it and then used the truck to \nrob other construction sites without raising suspicion.\n  Across the country, copper thieves have targeted construction sites, \npower and phone lines, retail stores and vacant houses. They have \ncaused explosions in vacant buildings by stealing metal from gas lines, \nand they have caused blackouts by stealing copper wiring from street \nlights and electrical substations. Do you know why? Because they have a \nwilling buyer. They have people who are willing to buy their stuff and \nwill not even take the care of keeping records and taking checks so law \nenforcement can later investigate who they are.\n  These next examples show how dangerous metal thefts can be. Last \nOctober four people were injured in an explosion at a University of \nCalifornia-Berkeley electrical station. Officials blamed it on copper \ntheft that occurred 2 hours before the explosion. The copper is stolen, \nthe pipes don't work, the workers turn it on, and there is an explosion \nand four people injured.\n  Georgia Power was having a huge problem with thieves targeting a \nsubstation that feeds the entire Atlanta airport--one of the busiest \nairports in the world, the Delta hub. The airport was getting hit two \nto three times a week and surveillance didn't lead to any arrests.\n  This is a crime that knows no borders, no boundaries. It happens in \ncities, it happens in suburbs, and it happens certainly in rural areas. \nDepending on the case, it threatens public safety, weakens our \ninfrastructure, and undermines our businesses.\n  The impact is staggering. In one study, the U.S. Department of Energy \nfound the total cost to industries affected by copper theft would \nexceed over $900 million every single year--$900 million every single \nyear. Between 2010 and 2012 the National Insurance Crime Bureau \nidentified nearly 34,000 insurance claims related to metal theft. To \nput that number in perspective, it marked a 36-percent increase from \nthe 25,000 claims reported between 2009 to 2011. That 25,000 number was \nmore than an 80-percent increase from the previous reporting period.\n  Listen to who is supporting this bill, and then I ask my colleague: \nAre you going to listen to these businesses or are you going to listen \nto the scrap metal dealers?\n  Air Conditioning Contractors of America, supporting the bill, \nAmerican Public Power Association, supporting the bill, American Supply \nAssociation, Associated Builders and Contractors, CenturyLink, Edison \nElectric Institute, Heating, Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration \nDistributors, the Home Depot, International Council of Shopping \nCenters, Independent Electrical Contractors, Independent Telephone and \nTelecommunications Alliance, Lowe's Companies, Inc., National \nAssociation of Electrical Distributors, National Association of Home \nBuilders, National Electrical Contractors Association, National Retail \nFederation, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Retail \nIndustry Leaders Association, Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning \nContractors' National Association, Inc., United States Telecom \nAssociation, Windstream Corporation, XO Communications.\n  I could go on and on. These are mainstream businesses on Main Street \nthat support this bill because they are getting ripped off.\n  So what can we do about it? We know why it is happening; that is, \nbecause there is a global demand for copper, especially from China and \nIndia, and higher prices encourage thieves to steal copper and other \nmetals. We all know the vast majority of scrap metal dealers are \nlegitimate and law-abiding. They do not want to buy stolen property. I \nhave worked extensively with the scrap metal industry in my \nlegislation. We have made some changes they suggested in order to \nimprove the effectiveness of the bill and lessen the burden on scrap \nmetal dealers wherever possible.\n  Given the scale of the problem, I believe we have to take strong \nsteps to fight these crimes and give law enforcement the tools they \nneed. I worry that at some point we are going to have a major break in \nour Federal infrastructure and everyone will look back and wonder why \nthey listened to some lobbyist representing the scrap metal dealers \ninstead of all these businesses I mentioned and instead of the police. \nThey will look back to this moment.\n  Maybe they could at least listen to the beer dealers. They support \nthis bill because their kegs are getting stolen all over the country.\n  What does our bill do? First of all, it puts modest recordkeeping \nrequirements on the recyclers that buy scrap metal, limiting the value \nof cash transactions, and requiring sellers in certain\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\nStates to prove they actually own the metal.\n  The bill also makes it a Federal crime to steal metals from critical \ninfrastructure and directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review \nrelevant penalties.\n  Our intention is not to preempt State laws, so if a State already has \nlaws on the books regarding metal theft, they would still apply and the \nFederal law would not.\n  These criminals work across State lines--we know that--and they take \nadvantage of States without this type of law. This bill is intended to \nfill the gap in States that don't have these protections. My people are \ngetting ripped off in Minnesota because some States don't have laws. \nThis is a Federal crime, and it is a Federal problem.\n  The shameless--shameless--robberies of veterans' graves make clear we \ncan't just let this go anymore. It is time to pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                                Earmarks\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of talk lately \nabout earmarks. Some Members are even talking about bringing them back.\n  I grew up earmarking. I grew up on a ranch, where we earmarked \ncattle. That is where earmarking gets its name. I didn't think much of \nthe practice then. We already had a brand on the critter. An earmark \nseemed to be redundant. After a while, we didn't do it any more.\n  Then I came to Congress--first in the House and now in the Senate--\nand I had hoped not to be earmarking any more. But when I got to the \nHouse I found out the practice was not just prolific but rampant, so I \ncome here today, after hearing some people want to bring the practice \nback--after we had the moratorium placed a couple years ago--and urge \ncaution. Let me explain a few reasons why.\n  One reason we lamented the absence of earmarks was the saying: \nEarmarks are the glue that helps legislation get passed.\n  I would say it is a little more accurate to say: Earmarks usually \nrepresent the lard that allows earmarks to squeeze through the door and \nget through to the President's desk.\n  Senator Tom Coburn has spoken often about earmarks. I think he at one \npoint said the best statement ever made about earmarks: They are the \ngateway drug to spending addiction.\n  Earmarks are usually small items, but they lead to massive spending \noverall. They leverage greater spending. Once you get an earmark in a \nbill, you usually vote for that bill no matter how big it becomes. We \nhad years and years of that, and we shouldn't return to it.\n  But now earmark fans have a new argument--spending oversight. They \nsay we can provide better oversight when we earmark; we will keep \nbetter track of that spending.\n  They argue that Congress is derelict in its article 1 constitutional \nresponsibilities, the power-of-the-purse argument: By not allowing \nearmarks, we are somehow derelict in our duty. That is an interesting \nargument which we ought to explore for a minute.\n  The same people who will defend earmarking as a constitutional right \nand responsibility will also note: Don't worry, it is only 1 percent or \nless than 1 percent of all Federal spending.\n  But think about that for a minute. If it is our constitutional \nresponsibility, why would we stop at 1 percent? That is not a valid \nargument at all. If it is constitutional, for our constitutional \nresponsibility, shouldn't more than 1 percent be earmarked?\n  When we look at when earmarks were here, they were never evenly \nspaced. Every Member of Congress in the House and the Senate has the \nsame constitutional right, I would assume. But with earmarks, committee \nchairs or those on the appropriate committees get the lion's share of \nthe earmarks when rank-and-file members get far fewer. So the \nconstitutional argument is specious at best.\n  I do share a concern that Congress has ceded to agency bureaucrats \nand administration officials much of our discretion over spending \ndecisions. The culprit is not a lack of earmarks but the lack of \noversight opportunities. The problem is we haven't gone through regular \norder for a long time.\n  Right here in the Senate is the perfect example. We have only had \nnine votes on Republican amendments in this Senate Chamber since July. \nNine votes. This is the most deliberative body in the world. The \nhallmark of this body is an open amendment process, open debate--\nunlimited debate. Yet we have only had nine Republican amendments \nrollcalled in the Senate Chamber since last July. That is no way to \nprovide oversight. We have to get back to regular order if we want to \nhave oversight.\n  We have a pretty dismal record lately on appropriations bills. We \nhave become addicted to continuing resolutions, so-called CRs.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, between fiscal year \n1977 and fiscal year 2014, in all that 30-year period there were only 4 \nyears where all appropriations bills were enacted on time, and in only \none other year were more than half of them completed on time. The last \nyear Congress actually moved through all the appropriations bills and \ndid it on time was 1997. That is the problem we are having with \noversight: When we don't authorize and pass appropriations bills one by \none, we lose the ability to conduct oversight over the Federal agencies \nand over Federal spending in general. Since then, there has been an \naverage of six CRs per year. This year will be no different.\n  I will consider some of the arguments.\n  We are often told this is a way we can have a check on the agencies. \nBut what we have seen in the past is that when we earmark, the bulk of \nthe time spent by the Appropriations Committee is not spent in doing \noversight but is spent in doling out earmarks.\n  The last year we had earmarks, 2009, there were 9,000 earmarks in 1 \nOmnibus appropriations bill. What was the Appropriations Committee \ndoing for months prior to that? Most of their time and staff's time--\ntime that should have been spent on the other 99 percent of Federal \nspending--was spent securing that 1 percent of Federal spending that \nconstituted earmarks for the Members. So we are not exercising \noversight with earmarks. We are abdicating our responsibility and \nspending far too much time on these earmarks.\n  There are 43 Members of the Senate who are in their first 6 years in \nthis body, myself included. I happened to have spent some time in the \nHouse, so I have some perspective there. For those who haven't seen the \nappropriations process with earmarks, I think it is useful to take a \nlittle walk down memory lane and see what it was like in years past.\n  Jack Abramoff, who spent some time in prison for working the \nappropriations process pretty well, called the Appropriations Committee \nthe earmark favor factory. That I don't think has been seriously \nrefuted by anyone. That is what the Appropriations Committees became \nduring that time--earmark favor factories.\n  It is worth remembering some of the earmarks that finally galvanized \nthe country against them: the Bridge to Nowhere; the indoor rainforest \nin Iowa. We could go on and on. I went to the House floor myself \nseveral hundred times over the period of a couple of years to challenge \nthese individual spending projects.\n  In 2008, there was a lobbying firm founded by a former Appropriations \nCommittee staffer that specialized in getting particularly defense \nearmarks from the Appropriations Committee. The FBI finally got wind of \nsome of this and started to investigate. Politico reported that sources \nwithin the FBI indicated they were ``conducting research on earmarks \nand campaign contributions.'' While they did so, this investigation \ncommenced and within weeks the firm imploded.\n  According to analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, clients of the \nfirm received at least $299 million in earmarks. The firm or \nindividuals from the firm made campaign contributions of more than $3 \nmillion to nearly 300 elected officials.\n  ABC News said at the time of the firm's operation: Millions out to \nlawmakers, hundreds of millions back in the form of earmarks for \nclients, have made it for many observers the poster child for tacit \npay-to-play politics.\n  I don't think we want to go back to that time. News reports every day \nwere looking at the link between earmarks and campaign contributions. \nThere was a smack of corruption there.\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\n  As I said, as soon as the FBI turned its attention to this firm doing \na lot of this earmarking, it imploded almost overnight and went away. \nThere was great public distrust in the process, and well there should \nhave been.\n  At that time I remember going to the House floor and offering over a \nseries of weeks nine separate privileged resolutions asking for the \nEthics Committee to look at that relationship between campaign \ncontributions and earmarks.\n\n  Let me take this time to say this is not a partisan issue. \nRepublicans as well as Democrats over years past participated in this \nprocess of earmarking with equal abandon. I am not pointing the finger \nat either party. There are Members of both parties who seek to return \nto the practice. But we ought to remember that it wasn't good for this \ninstitution. For those who say we ought to go back to it, I don't \nunderstand. I would argue it doesn't give us any better oversight \nbecause we spend all of our time actually earmarking projects rather \nthan providing oversight over the other 99 percent of government \nfunding.\n  There is no constitutional requirement. And, frankly, if it is just 1 \npercent of all spending, how can we argue it is our constitutional \nresponsibility? Why wouldn't we be earmarking more of it? I don't know \nhow the corruption that comes with it is avoided.\n  Members may say it will be better now than it was before--names will \nbe attached to earmarks. We will have total transparency. The \ninvestigation of this firm and others happened when there was \ntransparency, when names were attached to earmarks. That didn't help. \nThe corruption continued. There is no way to police this process \nadequately when we earmark in that way.\n  I encourage my colleagues, when we hear Members pining for the old \ndays when we earmarked, remember that Congress went for decades and \ndecades with maybe one here or one there on the margins. It was only in \nthose last couple of decades, the 1990s through about 2010, where we \nhad a rampant corrupt process which I would argue we wouldn't want to \nreturn to. So let's think twice before doing that.\n\n\n                                 WRRDA\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Water Resources Reform \nand Development Act before the Senate for a vote tomorrow. To call \nWRRDA, as it is called, an expansive bill is an understatement.\n  This single piece of legislation would impact the Nation's harbors, \nwaterways, shorelines, infrastructure, and of course it will impact the \nbudget for many years to come. Yet all the talk around the bill before \nus today seems to focus on what has thankfully been left out of its \npages--the very topic I have just been discussing--earmarks.\n  No doubt this reform-minded WRRDA is a step in the right direction, \nand I applaud my colleagues in the House and in the Senate who have \nbeen able to move a bill without earmarks. It is a real accomplishment, \nas it should be done.\n  That said, I do have many concerns about the bill. My chief concern \nis the process by which infrastructure projects will be authorized. \nSimply put, just because it doesn't have earmarks doesn't mean it will \nbe a good process for the taxpayers.\n  Under this legislation, non-Federal interests will have authority to \npropose projects that meet broadly defined goals to the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers. Once the Corps confirms that these projects have met \nthese broadly defined goals, they will be included in a report to \nCongress that will serve as a de facto authorization bill for \nfeasibility studies, and then on the conveyor belt to the chief's \nreport and ultimately to construction.\n  It seems to me that, in order to be effective, this process relies on \nthings that are either entirely unlikely or things we haven't seen \nbefore. It relies on State and local governments, for example, on being \njudicious on what they request from the Corps. Instead, I suspect we \nwill see a virtual tsunami of requests flooding in.\n  It requires the Corps to be selective in what it ultimately embraces \nas worthy projects.\n  This again is an agency that has a reputation of never meeting a \nproject that it didn't want to build.\n  It will require Members of Congress to ultimately be willing to cross \nprojects off a list to prevent taxpayer dollars from going to them. I \nthink we can all be realistic about the chances of that happening.\n  During the process of this bill moving forward, I suggested Congress \nought to give the process some statutory sidebars to ensure that only \nworthy projects make it through the stringent cost-benefit ratio \nrequirement and tight criteria for what will and will not be reviewed. \nIn addition to making sure the projects themselves are actually worth \nconstructing, a limited budget means that some prioritization will be \nnecessary. I believe it would be prudent to include statutory \npriorities. Unfortunately, these were not included.\n  So my concern remains that this process will put us in the same \nposition we have been in recently: Faced with sizable backlogs of \nauthorized Corps projects for varying worthiness, appropriators will be \nin the position to pick and choose which of those get funded. Again, \njust because something isn't earmarked doesn't mean it benefits \ntaxpayers. My hope is that once we see how it plays out, Congress will \nbe willing to adjust this process. As it stands now, while I sincerely \ncongratulate those involved for working diligently to move forward in a \nmanner consistent with the earmark moratorium we have, I will not be \nsupporting the WRRDA conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have come directly to the Senate \nfloor from a terrific event in the Dirksen building where hundreds of \npeople who are concerned about what the carbon pollution is doing to \nour atmosphere and oceans gathered to wake up Congress. At 5 o'clock a \nwhole bunch of alarms went off down there, and it was a very exciting, \nvery enthusiastic moment with more than 40 members of Congress showing \nup to reflect our commitment to getting this done.\n  One of the things I told people at the rally was that we are close to \nturning this issue around. The barricade of special interest propaganda \nthat has surrounded Congress is eroding. The denial castle is built on \nsand and the sand is eroding the foundations for that propaganda, \nwashing out from underneath it, and it will collapse soon. Why do I say \nthat? I say that for several reasons.\n  The first reason that I believe we are close to a win is that for a \nlong time the big polluters have had a free shot at the atmosphere and \noceans. Pollution costs them nothing, and that has created a mindset of \nentitlement and it created a mindset in which pollution was viewed as \nof no consequence. Thankfully, the President of the United States has \nrequired the EPA to promulgate regulations that will for the first time \nput a price on the carbon pollution that is emitted from our biggest \npower plants, and the 50 biggest power plants in America put out more \ncarbon than Korea. They put out more carbon than Canada. So this is a \nvery serious situation. When they are faced with the regulation, I \nthink that is not just going to reduce their emissions, but it is going \nto change the way they see the problem, and they will be motivated in a \nnew way to think: ``Wait a minute; what is the best way to solve this \nproblem?'' Once they are no longer free to pollute, once the advantage \nis taken away, the whole equation changes for them, and I suspect that \nit will not take long between a polluter change in point of view and a \nchange in point of view on the other side of the aisle in the Senate.\n  The second reason is the politics on this. We have seen a recent poll \nthat I have talked about on the floor before that points out that \nRepublican voters--self-identified Republican voters--if they are under \nthe age of 35 think that climate denial is--not my words, but in the \nwords in the poll--ignorant, out of touch or crazy.\n  So if you are a modern political party and you have built your \nclimate change policy on a theory of denial that your own youth cohort, \nyour own young voters under 35 think is ignorant, out of touch, or \ncrazy, that is what I mean by a castle that is built on sand and that \nis doomed to fall.\n  The third reason I want to mention here is there is a very \nsignificant role for America's corporations because what you get in \nthis body from the so-\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\ncalled self-appointed corporate mouthpieces--the Wall Street Journal \neditorial page, the so-called U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers--what you get from all of them is flat out \nclimate denial, the absolute hard stuff--just complete denial, absolute \nignorance and ignoring of the science, totally in the tank with the \npolluters and the oil and coal industry. What is interesting is that \nactually doesn't represent the views of America's corporate community, \nand it doesn't represent them by a lot.\n  If you look at big brand name American corporations, if you look at \nCoke and Pepsi, if you look at Apple and Google, if you look at WalMart \nand Target, if you look at Mars and Nestle, UPS and Federal Express, GM \nand Ford, look at the entire casualty property insurance industry, look \nat the bulk of the electric utility industry, look at the entire green \nenergy sector, all of them know that climate change is a real problem, \nunderstand the undeniable science of what carbon pollution does to the \nEarth's atmosphere and to our oceans, and they are doing things about \nit.\n  They have sustainability policies. They have climate policies. \nWalMart has probably done more to get rid of the incandescent bulb than \nany other force on the planet. They are very strong on this issue. But \nwithin those great corporations, it tends to be cabined into their \ncorporate business and sustainability divisions. It hasn't really \ninfluenced yet the way they communicate with the public, and it \ncertainly hasn't influenced much their government relations. So there \nis a huge mismatch between the so-called voice of the corporate \ncommunity, which is really a polluter-paid propaganda effort coming \nthrough the Wall Street Journal, coming through the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and coming through the National Association of \nManufacturers--a huge difference between that and what the underlying \nleaders of what regular Americans think of as the American corporate \ncommunity believe. That difference is eventually--like these other \nforces--going to tear apart the foundation of the denial castle.\n  We have the chance to make this happen and to make this happen soon, \nand we need to. We absolutely need to. The Presiding Officer is the \nsenior Senator from Connecticut, a State which borders mine. \nConnecticut and Rhode Island share a critical factor, which is \ncoastline. If you follow the logic, such logic as exists in the denial \nmachinery, they will take you off into distant and complex computer \nmodels of what the temperature is going to be and what the atmosphere \nis going to be like 30 or 40 years from now. And yes, that is \ncomplicated. In that area there is room to sow confusion.\n  Come to the coast. At the coastline you see sea levels rising because \nof an immutable law of nature called the law of thermal expansion. The \nocean is warming because it has caught more than 90 percent of the \nexcess heat that the carbon has trapped, and when it warms, it expands.\n  It is as simple as that. That means when you go to my State to the \nNewport tide gauge off the Naval Station Newport, you see it is 10 \ninches higher than it was in the 1930s. That is a big deal because in \nthe 1930s we had the hurricane of 1938. And if you look back at the \ndevastation that hurricane caused to our coastline and you adjust for \nwhat 10 additional inches of sea would do and adjust again for stacking \nup that 10 inches in what a storm surge would do, you end up with a \ntruly apocalyptic vision of the Rhode Island shore, and it is not \ndeniable.\n  You cannot quarrel about a tide gauge. It is in effect a yardstick \nnailed to a dock, and the water has gone up 10 inches. To deny that is \nnot just to deny science; it is to deny measurement. I think it is a \nbit of a stretch for even the most ardent of my denier colleagues to \ndeny measurement. With a thermometer you measure that Narragansett Bay \nis nearly 4 degrees warmer in mean winter water temperature, and that \nmeans a lot for fishermen who used to fish for winter flounder. It \ndoesn't take a very complicated test to determine what the acidity of \nthe ocean is and to measure just the way you would measure the acidity \nin an aquarium. Our oceans are acidifying at the fastest rate that has \nbeen measured in 50 million years.\n  Remember we are a species that has been on this planet as Homo \nsapiens for a little over 200,000 years. So when you are talking about \nthe steepest rate of acidification in millions of years, that is a \ndramatic shift in the habitability of our planet. If you want to know \nwho that matters to, go to the west coast, go to the oyster fisheries \nand look at the wipe-out of young oyster species that took place when \nacidified ocean water got into the growing oysters and killed them all \noff. It was simply too acidic for their little shells to survive.\n  These are the harbingers of things to come. These are the undeniable \nfacts. These are the truths the oceans tell us and our coastlines tell \nus. For all those reasons, I am confident that we will be at serious \nbusiness to address climate change a lot sooner than the deniers think. \nThe American public simply is not going to put up with a Congress that \nhas become the prisoner to a barricade of special interest propaganda \nwhen they know better. Now the American people do, indeed, know better.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of conversation among \nmany of us here in the Senate and last week in the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee about the circumstances we find ourselves in at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and its ability to provide the necessary \ncare and benefits for our military men and women who have become and \nare becoming veterans.\n  What we heard last week at the Veterans' Affairs Committee was very \ndisturbing to me because it still appears that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs has no plan to solve circumstances our veterans find \nthemselves in. Who in this country would we expect to have access in \nthe most timely fashion to the highest quality of care other than those \nwho served our country and who were promised that? A commitment was \nmade to them to make certain that those benefits would be made \navailable. They were told that would be the case.\n  I went home this weekend. Part of our job is to help people. Every \nweek at the end of the week I get what is called a weekly State report. \nI and other members of the Senate have staff who spend significant \namounts of time trying to solve people's problems with government. We \ncall it case work.\n  Every week I get a report of people who called my office to tell me \nsomething they want me to know, people who contacted me asking for help \nwith a variety of federal agencies. But it struck me as so evident in \nreading my report from my State staff about the circumstances that our \nveterans find themselves in. So every week there is a report that I \nread generally at the end of the week, on the weekend. It is really \npage after page of things that have happened involving me and my staff \nand our relationship with Kansans who have a story to tell, who have a \nconcern to raise, who have a request for how I vote. This week's staff \nreport I thought I would highlight for my colleagues. My guess is that \nthe circumstances that Kansan veterans find themselves in is probably \nno different for me than it is for my other colleagues here in the \nSenate.\n  These are just reports from Kansans who called or stopped by my \noffice or wrote to us this week at home looking for help, asking me to \nhelp them solve their problem and telling a story about their \nrelationship with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  A veteran from Hutchinson, KS, called to tell us that he filed a \nclaim with the VA. It has been filed for 6 months, and he is still \nawaiting a decision. Unfortunately, that is all too common. A veteran \nfrom Norton, KS, filed a claim for service due to Agent Orange. He has \nbeen diagnosed with cancer and is seeking treatment through the VA. He \nhas been informed that it could take 7 to 8 months before the VA will \nexamine his claim, and while his cancer is not curable, it is \ntreatable. And yet he has a 7- to 8-\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\nmonth waiting period before he can receive benefits.\n  A veteran from Salina, KS, in the central part of our State indicates \nthat he received double vaccinations before he was deployed to Desert \nStorm due to the fact that his predeployment package had been lost. He \nindicates he now suffers from several health conditions as a result and \nhas been informed that the VA denies his benefits.\n  A veteran from Hutchinson, north of Wichita, indicated he has been \nfighting with the VA for 7 years on appeal. He has something pending \nwith VA. They provided him an answer that was unsatisfactory, and he is \nappealing that decision. He claims the VA has continued dragging out \nhis appeal process, and he has difficulty finding updates on his appeal \nwhen he contacts the VA. That is an example of someone who called the \noffice and asked for help.\n  A veteran from Wichita said his doctors discovered a mass on his \nbrain, and it will require an MRI to determine what the mass is. The \nearliest appointment available for him is on June 30. He, of course, as \nall of us would be, is concerned over that long wait. This is a veteran \nwho has been diagnosed with a mass on his brain, doesn't know what it \nis, needs an MRI--exactly what a doctor would order to get additional \ndiagnostic information--and cannot get the MRI until June 30.\n  A veteran from Junction City--which is a community that is adjacent \nto Fort Riley where a significant number of veterans and military \nretirees reside--indicates that he is living in a nursing home. He is \n100-percent service connected with a disability and the VA is currently \npaying for his nursing home services. He has recently been informed \nthat his physical therapy will no longer be covered by the VA and they \nare discontinuing payment but offer no explanation as to why. He filed \nan appeal late last year and has not received a response or status \nupdate from the VA since that request.\n  A veteran from Lawrence has had an appeal pending with the VA for \nover 1\\1/2\\ years and wants our help because he has received no \ncommunication from the VA in more than a year.\n  A veteran from Overland Park, KS--a suburb of Kansas City--is the \nprimary caregiver for his wife who suffers from Alzheimer's. He has had \ntremendous difficulty in working with the VA to schedule appointments \nwhen he can be away from her to receive his treatments from the VA.\n  A daughter of a veteran from Wichita who passed away in the Wichita \nVA is concerned about the events that took place while he was in the \ncare of the VA.\n  A veteran who lives north of Bird City, KS, is a category 1 disabled \nmarine veteran due to a service-connected disability. He indicates that \nhe has had two heart attacks and is now paying for stress tests and his \nown medical bills out of pocket because the VA has denied him fee \nbasis. What that means is if you are a veteran in Bird City, KS, which \nis the very northwest corner of our State, access to a VA hospital is a \nlong way away, and that fee basis allows the veteran to receive care \nand treatment from a doctor and hospital closer to their hometown or \nneighborhood.\n  My point is that the people who are most deserving of care and \nattention are not receiving the care and attention they need. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is supposed to provide the services and \nbenefits earned and promised to those veterans. This is not anything \nthat is out of the ordinary.\n  This report is something I read every week, and the reports that I \nconvey to my colleagues here on the floor of the Senate are not \nunusual. I suppose what is unusual is that the number is increasing. \nWhat used to be a shorter list of problems with the VA has grown over \ntime to be a longer and longer list.\n  I have been asking for a plan by the Department of Veterans Affairs \nfrom its top leadership, Secretary Shinseki, to explain to me, the \nSenate, the American people, and veterans what the Department of \nVeterans Affairs is going to do to meet the needs of these and other \nveterans across our country.\n  As I have indicated on the Senate floor before on this topic, if we \nare incapable of caring for our veterans today, how are we going to be \ncapable of taking care of veterans in the future as more and more \nmilitary men and women return from our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? \nThe physical and mental circumstances those veterans will find \nthemselves in will be even more difficult and challenging.\n  We have an aging veteran population from World War II and now Vietnam \nveterans will most likely be needing more care and treatment from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. What we need is the leadership that is \nnecessary to meet the needs of these veterans and a commitment that the \nstatus quo is unacceptable and that the bureaucratic culture at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is not something that is going to \nremain. There is going to be a concerted effort to make certain that \nthe Department meets the needs of those who served and sacrificed for \nour country.\n  Again, who, other than those who served our country, would we expect \nto be at the top of the list to receive the most timely and highest \nquality of care than those who served our Nation? It seems to me that \nas these issues are raised, we have a Department of Veterans Affairs \nthat is doing damage control. What we need is a Department of Veterans \nAffairs that reduces the damage being done to the veterans--the men and \nwomen who served our country--in Kansas and across our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BOARD OF EDUCATION ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Saturday we celebrated the 60th \nAnniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. In that unanimous opinion, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court held that the State-sanctioned segregation of \npublic schools was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and \ntherefore unconstitutional. The Court ``concluded that,'' in the field \nof public education, the doctrine of separate but equal' has no place. \nSeparate educational facilities are inherently unequal.'' This landmark \ndecision is rightly celebrated every year.\n  The case of Hernandez v. State of Texas, however, decided by the \nSupreme Court just 2 weeks before the Brown decision, is an often \noverlooked and yet momentous advancement of civil rights in our \ncountry. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth \nAmendment protects those beyond the racial classes of white or black, \nand extends to all racial groups in the United States. Fortunately, we \nare only left to imagine a world without the Hernandez decision, a \nworld that would have blocked Hispanics and other racial groups from \nthe promise of equality made in the Constitution.\n  Taken together, the Brown and Hernandez decisions stand as landmarks \nof progress in our country. We have come far in the march towards \nequality; yet, we must recognize that we can and must achieve more. Six \ndecades after the Brown and Hernandez decisions, our country must \ncontinue to confront social, economic, and racial inequalities \nthroughout this country.\n  Racial inequality is not an issue that our society can just wish away \nin the 21st century. It still exists in our criminal justice system, \neducational, and voting systems, and in our housing and lending \nmarkets. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and as a member \nof the Senate for nearly 40 years, I have fought to uphold the promise \nof equality in our fundamental charter.\n  The anniversary of these civil rights cases is a moment to reflect on \nour past, and to evaluate and commit to the next steps that we need to \ntake as we strive to build a more perfect Union. As many families \nacross the Nation celebrate the graduation of hard-\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nworking students who have earned their degrees, it is important to also \ncelebrate all who helped in the journey traveled. As former Supreme \nCourt Justice Thurgood Marshall once said:\n\n       None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up \n     by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody--a parent, a \n     teacher, an Ivy League crony or a few nuns--bent down and \n     helped us pick up our boots.\n\n  Let us rejoice as a nation that in 60 years we have made great \nstrides.

JERRY BEHRENS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on June 6, 2014, the Wyoming Medical \nCenter in Casper will dedicate its new Orthopedic, Spine and Surgery \nCenter to an American patriot, Jerry Behrens, M.D.\n  For years, patients in Wyoming have known Jerry to be a \ncompassionate, thorough, and trusted surgeon. He has cared for \nthousands of patients in Casper and around the State. What they may not \nknow is that his character was shaped by the courage and determination \nhe displayed half a world away in Vietnam.\n  Dr. Behrens always knew he wanted to help others. For that reason, he \ncompleted his medical degree and internship at the University of \nWisconsin-Madison. Although he was excited about beginning a family and \na new career, he felt a calling to serve a higher cause. It was this \ndesire which pushed him to volunteer as a medical doctor in the U.S. \nNavy during the Vietnam Conflict.\n  Attached to the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment, Dr. Behrens \nperformed surgery in very dangerous and difficult conditions. Jerry was \nassigned to Delta Med, a forward casualty receiving facility in Dong \nHa. Soldiers with fragment wounds, lost limbs, and severe blood loss \nwere triaged, treated, and transported to hospital ships for additional \ncare. It was not unusual for incoming rounds of fire to interrupt \nsurgeries. Yet amidst the chaos and confusion, Jerry kept a level head \nand performed his duties with precision and professionalism.\n  Jerry later became the battalion surgeon for the Rockpile, Ca Lu and \nKhe Sanh Combat Bases. During this time, his courage was tested when \nhis convoy was ambushed as they were making their way to Ca Lu. Of the \n200 men in his unit, 70 were wounded, and 18 were killed. Jerry \nstabilized the injured while waiting for reinforcements. It was a \nharrowing experience, but it would not be the last time he risked his \nlife to serve his battalion. Just a month later, his bunker at the \nRockpile took a direct hit. Though he was uninjured, ten of his \ncorpsmen were lost. Jerry was ultimately awarded the Bronze Star Medal \nwith a V for Valor for his bravery and devotion to duty.\n  Upon the completion of his distinguished service to our Nation, Jerry \nreturned home and completed his orthopedic residency at the University \nof Wisconsin-Madison. It was Wyoming's great fortune that Jerry decided \nto move his family to Casper to begin his orthopedic practice. I was \nlucky enough to be invited to join Jerry in his growing practice in \nCasper, WY, where his family and career thrived.\n  In 1991, Jerry's son Michael deployed with the U.S. Marine Corps as \npart of Operation Desert Storm. Jerry once again showed his patriotism \nand desire to serve. He contacted Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and \nasked to be reactivated so he could provide medical attention to \nAmericans serving overseas. Jerry was commissioned as a lieutenant \ncommander in January 1991, after a 4-day whirlwind of paperwork, \nphysicals, and phone calls. He put his practice aside to once again \nwear the uniform. He was deployed within 3 weeks to Saudi Arabia and \nwent through the breech with the Marines into Kuwait.\n  Certainly his experiences, both in Vietnam and Desert Storm, shaped \nhis character--and his career. As a fellow in the American Academy of \nOrthopedic Surgeons and a board certified physician, he has devoted his \nlife to providing high quality care and service to his patients. With \nevery surgery he performs, he demonstrates integrity and precision. In \naddition to his contributions to the medical community, Jerry also \nvolunteers his free time to serve as a teacher, mentor, and friend to \nour servicemen and women. He is actively involved with veterans' \norganizations around the country and continues to stay in touch with \nthe Marines who served with him in Desert Storm.\n  Jerry is particularly proud of his work with Semper Fi Odyssey. This \nis a week-long transition assistance program which helps prepare \nindividuals for life after military service. Participants work in teams \nand learn valuable skills that help them achieve their personal and \nprofessional goals. Jerry has served as a team leader for Semper Fi \nOdyssey on eight separate occasions and continues to mentor the former \nservicemembers he met through this work. Needless to say, Jerry is a \npositive force within the community and we are fortunate for his \nremarkable contributions.\n  After practicing in Casper for 41 years, the community is honoring \nthis patriot by unveiling the Jerry Behrens, M.D. Orthopedic, Spine, \nand Surgery Center at the Wyoming Medical Center. Hundreds will gather \nto pay their respects to this accomplished surgeon. At his side will be \nhis wife Mary, his children Kelly, Mike, and Ingrid, and his two \ngrandchildren Erik and Jasper. Bobbi and I will be honored to stand \nwith him on this special occasion. I invite my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Dr. Jerry Behrens and thanking him for a life and career \ndevoted to service and the care of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3230-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3230-S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISITS\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I am incredibly honored to \nrecognize a group of 30 heroic military veterans who have traveled from \nsouthern West Virginia to visit our Nation's capital as part of the \nfourth Always Free Honor Flight. On the occasion of their visit, in \nwhich they will see for the first time the monuments built in their \nhonor, I want to express my utmost gratitude to these special men and \nwomen for their extraordinary bravery and patriotism, and for their \nnoble sacrifice to help keep our country free.\n  I have said this time and time again--West Virginia is one of the \nmost patriotic States in this great Nation. With one of the country's \nhighest per capita rates of military servicemembers and veterans, we \nare so proud of the many citizens who have served and who are actively \nserving in the military. The 30 veterans participating in today's \nAlways Free Honor Flight truly embody the Mountain State's history and \ncontributions to the safeguard of our American freedoms.\n  Our special West Virginians visiting today represent three \ngenerations of warriors--5 served in World War II, 9 served in the \nKorean War, and 16 served in the Vietnam War. They range from 63-90 \nyears of age, and have traveled from all parts of our great State--from \nNew Martinsville to Bluefield, Huntington to Princeton to Beckley, and \nmany places in between. In addition to our Mountain State vets, two \nveterans from bordering Bland and Tazewell Counties in Virginia have \naccompanied their West Virginia neighbors on the day-long adventure.\n  I especially want to recognize our two women veterans who joined \ntoday's honor flight, both of whom are the first women to make the \nAlways Free Honor Flight trip. Helen ``J'' Wheby served in the Korean \nwar as an office worker in the Navy. Vanda Jane Butcher served in the \nVietnam war\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\nwith the rank of a seaman as a part of an air flight crew in the Navy. \nDespite the challenges, sacrifices, and hardships they faced while \ndefending this Nation, these women voluntarily stepped forward and put \nservice above self to preserve our freedoms. We cannot thank them \nenough for their tremendous courage and their sacrifices.\n  Showing our appreciation to those who have served is something that \nwe should do each and every day, but today is a special day to pay \ntribute and thank those who have volunteered to put their lives on the \nline for our freedoms. The memorials our Honor Flight participants will \nvisit today serve as an important reminder to us all that our freedoms \nand liberties come at a steep cost. However, I know our veterans will \nfind special meaning and potentially long-lost emotions when they tour \nsuch touching sites.\n  The brave West Virginia heroes today have all served this country in \na variety of ways, working both at home and abroad. They have engaged \nin combat all over the world, traveling to the Panama Canal, working on \nthe docks of Saigon, and serving in historic events such as the Cuban \nMissile Crisis. One of our visiting Vietnam veterans, Stephen Douglas \nPhillips of New Martinsville, earned not just one, but two Purple \nHearts. Another, Gary Curtis Harold of Shady Spring has received both a \nPurple Heart and a Bronze Star.\n  But regardless of their rank or duty, each and every one of these \nveterans answered our Nation's call and has served with incredible \npride and valor.\n  Additionally, I would like to recognize the nine volunteers, or so-\ncalled ``guardians,'' who have accompanied the veterans during their \ntrip today. These guardians have selflessly given their time to travel \nalongside our veterans all the way from Princeton, WV to Washington, DC \nto share this very special journey with them.\n  I am also tremendously grateful for all those involved in the Always \nFree Honor Flight Network, especially the president of the Denver \nFoundation and owner of Little Buddy Radio in Princeton--Dreama Denver. \nAlong with coordinator and executive assistant, Dreama launched the \nAlways Free Honor Flight and has planned four trips within a 2-year \nspan for our West Virginia veterans. I commend Dreama, Pam, and all the \nDenver Foundation staff for their dedication and commitment to West \nVirginia's large veteran population. They have offered the people in \nWest Virginia just one more way to say thank you' to our veterans for \ntheir service and sacrifice.\n  I am filled with pride every time I meet the patriots who have served \nour country, and I am so pleased to welcome West Virginia's most \ncourageous veterans, who are all heroes, to Washington, DC. I encourage \nall of my colleagues to join me in saluting them. They truly inspire us \nall as we are reminded of their selfless service. It is because of \ntheir bravery that all Americans enjoy the greatest liberties and \nfreedoms in the world.\n  God bless all our servicemembers and veterans, God bless the great \nState of West Virginia, and God bless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3231-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring Dr. Charles Monell as he retires from the Rancho Mirage \nLibrary Advisory Commission after two decades of service and dedication \nto the library and the community it serves.\n  Throughout a long and distinguished career in medicine, including as \nthe chief of surgery at the Beverly Glen Hospital in Los Angeles, Dr. \nMonell also gave generously of his time to a variety of charitable \ncauses, especially those supporting music and education. Being \nparticularly devoted to supporting public libraries, Dr. Monell served \non the California State Library Commission for 14 years prior to \nretiring from medicine in 1992 and becoming a full-time resident of \nRancho Mirage, which was working to establish its first public library.\n  In 1993, Dr. Monell was appointed to the Rancho Mirage Public Library \nPlanning Committee, and led the effort to convert a former bank \nbuilding into the first library. On January 6, 1996, as chairman of the \nnew Rancho Mirage Public Library Commission, he introduced President \nGerald Ford for the ribbon-cutting ceremony and formal opening of the \nRancho Mirage Public Library.\n  The library was up and running, but Dr. Monell did not stop there. In \n2003, he secured a gift of $2 million from the Annenberg Foundation to \npurchase land for a new and larger Rancho Mirage Public Library, which \nopened on January 6, 2006--10 years to the day after the first library \nopening.\n  Dr. Monell has shared his lifelong love of music with the library and \nthe community. With his personal contributions and fundraising efforts, \nhe helped the library purchase a Steinway concert grand piano and \nsponsored concert performances by the acclaimed musicians of the \nIdyllwild Arts Academy. He has also donated his personal Civil War \nlibrary to the Rancho Mirage Library, and generously made possible a \nprivate study room in the library for the community to use.\n  On May 12, the Library Advisory Commission honored Dr. Monell for his \nextraordinary devotion to the library and his 18 years of service on \nthe commission. On June 5, Mayor Iris Smotrich will present Dr. Monell \nwith a proclamation from the City of Rancho Mirage in appreciation of \nhis distinguished service.\n  I am pleased to join them in saluting Dr. Charles Monell for his \ndedicated and inspiring service to the community of Rancho \nMirage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3231-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JOHNSTOWN FLOOD ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 125th \nAnniversary of the Johnstown Flood, one of the most unforgettable \ntragedies in our Nation's history. This anniversary reminds us of the \ndelicacy of human life, the great importance of caring for others, and \nthe true resilience that was demonstrated by those who endured the \ncatastrophe.\n  At approximately 3:00 p.m. on Friday, May 31, 1889, the South Fork \nDam, built to hold back a portion of the Conemaugh River, gave way, \nreleasing 20 million tons of water into the valley below. The wall of \nwater rushed towards the City of Johnstown, 15 miles to the southwest, \npicking up large quantities of debris and sweeping away whole towns. It \nfinally hit Johnstown just after 4:00 p.m.\n  The flood event and ensuing typhoid outbreak claimed 10 percent of \nJohnstown's citizens; 2,209 people lost their lives, including 396 \nchildren and 99 whole families, resulting in the largest loss of \ncivilian life in a single day until the September 11, 2001 terrorist \nattacks.\n  The tragedy left our Nation and larger global family in shock. The \nJohnstown Flood was the largest news story of its day and resulted in \nthe single largest international humanitarian fundraising effort to \ndate, with donations contributed from 13 countries. Clara Barton and \nfive Red Cross workers arrived from Washington, DC, on June 5, 1889, \nmaking the Johnstown Flood the first major peacetime relief effort for \nthe American Red Cross. Barton stayed until October 24, 1889, \nsupervising the distribution of supplies and helping more than 25,000 \npeople.\n  The Governor of Pennsylvania called on his constituents to rebuild \nand reopen the rail lines that had been wiped away. Within 14 days, 20 \nmiles of railway reopened ensuring access to the lifesaving supplies \narriving from the surrounding region.\n  During this anniversary we can recall these examples as just a few of \ncountless stories of heroism. The survivors lived on to rebuild \nJohnstown. More importantly, they established a spirit of endurance \nthat would live on in future generations.\n  The flood is a part of the history of Johnstown that will not be \nforgotten. The people of Johnstown and the Conemaugh Valley exhibit an \nindescribable human strength that rises above devastation and exhibits \na true example of hope and determination during difficult \ntimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3231-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3231-S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING CREEKVIEW HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Poweshiek County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Poweshiek County worth over $1.2 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $11.1 \nmillion to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memories of working together have to include \nthe community's tremendous success with using farm bill funds for \nimportant local projects such as remodeling and expanding St. Francis \nManor, which received a direct loan of $1 million from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture Community Facilities Program.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Poweshiek County has received $556,624 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Poweshiek County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $151,108.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Poweshiek County has received more than $3.2 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Poweshiek \nCounty's fire departments have received over $628,329 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Poweshiek \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing more than \n$360,000 for community wellness activities.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nPoweshiek County, both those with and without disabilities. And they \nmake us proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Poweshiek County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Poweshiek \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3232-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3232-S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WAPELLO COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nWapello County, I have fought for funding to separate the combined \nsewers which would overflow during rain events. Over the years, I have \nappropriated over $4.3 million to this project, which reduces the cost \nof these improvements to residents and businesses, helping to create \njobs and expand economic opportunities. I also worked with leaders \nthroughout the region to build a four lane highway from Des Moines to \nBurlington. I was pleased to have been able to acquire nearly $52 \nmillion worth of Congressionally directed funding for various segments \nof this project. Thanks to our years of partnership, this highway will \nresult in a more jobs and a better economy for the entire area.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This is not just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nOttumwa to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Wapello County has earned \n$120,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Wapello County has received $3,301,391 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Wapello County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $57,315.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nWapello County has received over $12.2 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Wapello County has received more than $9.9 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Wapello \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1.4 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Wapello \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing over $2 million \nfor the community health center and for community wellness programs.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\ndisabilities. As the primary author of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, ADA, and the ADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for \nour fellow citizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly \na quarter century since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nWapello County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Wapello County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Wapello \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3234-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MILITARY ACADEMY APPOINTMENTS\n\n Mr. LEE.

I \nchallenge these praiseworthy appointees to continue the tradition of \nhonor, sacrifice, and courage that has been so exceptionally \ndemonstrated by so many throughout the great history of our military. I \nshould like to close with a quote from Lincoln, which I hope we will \nall remember as we strive to do what is right for our country. Of the \nbrave soldiers who were then fighting to preserve the Union, he wrote:\n\n       Honor to the Soldier, and Sailor everywhere, who bravely \n     bears his country's cause. Honor also to the citizen who \n     cares for his brother in the field, and serves, as he best \n     can, the same cause--honor to him, only less than to him, who \n     braves, for the common good, the storms of heaven and the \n     storms of battle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3234-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3234-S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SAMUEL SMITH, SR.\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, on April 14, 2014, our \nNation lost a great hero, Mr. Samuel ``Jesse'' Smith, Sr. Mr. Smith was \none of the few remaining Navajo Code Talkers, who defended our country \nwith such ingenuity and valor during World War II.\n  As the number of these legendary warriors decreases year by year, our \nrespect and gratitude for their remarkable service only increases with \ntime. My State of New Mexico is proud to be the home of many of these \nextraordinary men, and we mourn their passing.\n  Samuel Smith was a student at the Albuquerque Indian School on \nDecember 7, 1941, when news arrived of the Japanese bombing of Pearl \nHarbor. He and two of his fellow students knew, very quickly, what they \nmust do. They resolved, without hesitation, and despite their youth, to \ndefend their country. All three joined the U.S. Marine Corps, \ndetermined to go wherever they were needed. Samuel Smith dreamed of \nbeing a pilot, but fate would have other plans. He would never fly a \nplane, but he would serve with particular distinction as a Navajo Code \nTalker.\n  Mr. Smith possessed the determination, intelligence, and language \nproficiency that was essential to the Code Talkers. He was assigned to \nthe 4th Marine Division and was responsible for transmitting messages \nfor Gen. Clifton Cates, the commander of the Marine landings in Saipan \nand Tinian.\n  In the course of his military service, Samuel Smith fought at the \nbattle of Roi-Namur, the battles of Saipan and Tinian to retake the \nMarianas Islands, and the battle of Iwo Jima. He and his fellow Code \nTalkers turned their language into an unbreakable code. They used the \nlanguage of the Navajo people as a weapon to defend our freedoms. In \nbattle after battle, in ferocious combat, that code helped secure \nAllied victory. Their courage and patriotism is all the more remarkable \nin that they fought so bravely for freedom in a world that did not \nalways accord freedom to them.\n  It would be many years after World War II before the story of the \nNavajo Code Talkers, and the pivotal role they played, could be told. \nThe true purpose of their service was not revealed until over 20 years \nlater. In 2001, Congress honored Samuel Smith and his fellow Code \nTalkers with Congressional Gold Medals. This recognition and honor was \nrichly deserved. The simple words on their medals told the heroic \nstory: ``The Navajo language was used to defeat the enemy.''\n  After the war, Mr. Smith returned home. He married Rena Smith, and \ntogether they started a family. They moved to the Pueblo of Acoma, \nwhere they raised ten children. Later, at Fort Defiance Navajo Nation, \nMr. Smith served as a law enforcement officer and was appointed chief \nranger of the Navajo Nation Rangers. He also served as director of \nTransportation and Water Resources for the Navajo Nation.\n  Samuel Smith lived a long and eventful life, until the age of 89. He \nleaves behind more than 150 direct descendants. His life is a testament \nof service to others, in war and in peacetime. For his family, his \ncommunity, and his Nation, he set an example of courage and commitment. \nThose who knew him will long recall his steady presence. As his son \nMichael said:\n\n       We were very fortunate to have one of the wisest and \n     gentlest men in our lives. He\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\n     could warm your heart with his smile, let you know you had to \n     straighten up with his gaze, and always had something clever \n     to say He is our hero. He is our dad.\n\n  I extend my sincere sympathy to Mr. Smith's family. He will be deeply \nmissed, and he will be forever remembered by a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3235-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3235-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3235-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:34 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3530.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to establish a permanent, nationwide summer electronic benefits \ntransfer for children program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I know that many students across the \ncountry are waiting on the edge of their seats and looking forward to \nschool letting out shortly for their summer break. But for many of \nthose kids who participate in school meal programs, the summer can be a \npretty uncertain time--not knowing when or where they are going to get \ntheir next meal. It can be a stressful time for those kids' parents as \nwell, who have to stretch every dollar they have to feed their family \ntoday.\n  That is a struggle Nicole, a single mom from my home State of \nWashington, knows all too well. She has been unemployed now for about a \nyear. She has two kids. She has a daughter who is finishing \nkindergarten and a son who is just finishing fifth grade. They have \nrelied on SNAP benefits to help pay for their groceries and school \nmeals to get help during the school year. But Nicole says that last \nsummer, without school-provided meals, it was particularly difficult to \nput enough food on the table to feed her kids.\n  Today I am here introducing a bill that will help families like \nNicole's and many across the country. It is a bill to make sure more \nchildren can get the nutrition they need during the summer break. When \nschool is in session, millions of kids from low-income families can get \nfree or reduced-price meals through our National School Lunch Program. \nBut during the summer, hunger goes up in this country about 34 percent \nfor families with school-aged kids, according to a study.\n  Right now we do have a Federal congregate summer meals program, of \nwhich I have long been supportive. It is called the Summer Food Service \nProgram. It is very successful in some areas of our country. I always \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen and expand \nthat program to make sure it is reaching as many children as possible.\n  But in a study from 2012, summer congregate meals programs only \nreached about 14 percent of the students who qualified for free or \nreduced-priced meals during the school year. That adds up to tens of \nmillions of kids across our country who do not have access to meal \nprograms in the summer.\n  In my home State of Washington, just 9.8 percent of those kids \nparticipated in 2012. That means those kids are more likely to deal \nwith hunger or food insecurity. That is unacceptable to me. When it \ncomes to ensuring that our kids grow up with the nutrition they need to \nlearn and to thrive, there are no excuses.\n  We have to do more to fight summer hunger. That is why I am here \ntoday introducing legislation called the Stop Child Summer Hunger Act. \nThe bill is pretty simple. It provides families with an EBT card that \nwill help them afford groceries during the summer months to replace the \nmeals those kids would otherwise have gotten at school. It is based on \na very successful pilot program that has proven now to decrease hunger \nby 33 percent. Some of the demonstration projects had participation \nrates as high as 90 percent. Scaling up that program with the Stop \nChild Summer Hunger Act will help more children get the nutrition they \nneed in the summer months.\n  The bill is fully paid for. We do that by closing a tax loophole that \nactually encourages U.S. companies to shift our jobs and profits \noffshore. From my perspective, that is a pretty fair trade. It will \nencourage companies to keep jobs and profits here in America. At the \nsame time, it will help kids get the nutrition they need during the \nsummer.\n  Fighting hunger, especially among kids, is an issue that is extremely \nimportant to me. I have told this body before that when I was just a \nteenager--15 years old--my dad, who fought in World War II, was \ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Within a few years he could not work \nany longer. My mom had to go to work and find a job. It did not pay \nanywhere near enough to support seven kids and a husband who had a \ngrowing stack of medical bills. So for several months when I was young, \nwe had to rely on food stamps. It was not much, but I remember it \nhelping to get my family by during a very tough time. So I know how \nhard it is for families who are struggling to put food on the table.\n  As adults, I believe it is our moral responsibility to take care of \nour children, to make sure they can grow up healthy and to make sure \nthey have every opportunity to thrive and learn. I hope we can live up \nto this responsibility by tackling this problem and helping more kids \nget the nutrition they need to live healthy lives. I hope this body can \nwork with me to make sure that kids who are now looking forward to \ntheir summer break can enjoy it free from hunger.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 2379. A bill to approve and implement the Klamath Basin \nagreements, to improve natural resource management, support economic \ndevelopment, and sustain agricultural production in the Klamath River \nBasin in the public interest and the interest of the United States, and \nfor other purposes; to the\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that would \nauthorize the implementation of the landmark agreements that settle \nsome of our country's most complex and contentious water allocation and \nspecies preservation issues. Water management crises this century have \nmade the Klamath Basin nationally known, with all interests having \nexperienced devastating water years. Overcoming that adversity, the \nparties in the basin have spent years coming together to hammer out \nsolutions--essentially giving up their right to obstruct in the name of \nthe greater good. With this bill the basin should now be known for the \ndedicated and enduring collaborative efforts that have honed in on a \nsustainable and more economically certain future for the basin--an \nexample that other regions can emulate for their watershed challenges. \nIt is time for Congress to place its seal of approval and set about \nimplementing these agreements to restore the basin by passing the \nKlamath Water Recovery and Economic Restoration Act of 2014.\n  I am pleased to be joined by three colleagues on this bill. Senator \nMerkley has tirelessly worked to support the collaborative approach \nundertaken by two states, four Tribes, multiple Federal agencies, and \ncountless stakeholders. Senators Feinstein and Boxer have answered the \ncall for communities reeling from unprecedented drought, and the \nKlamath Basin--spanning Oregon and California--is yet another \nillustration of their efforts to assist communities in need while \nsupporting fish and wildlife. Together, we are committed to working \nwith our colleagues in the Senate and House to advance this bill and \nget it signed by the President.\n  The story of the Klamath Basin revolves around water. Congress \nauthorized a federal irrigation project for the basin in 1905. Now the \nKlamath Project provides water service to roughly 210,000 acres of \nproductive farmland--producing such crops as potatoes, cereal grains, \nsugar beets, alfalfa and other hay, and irrigated pastures for beef \ncattle. The Klamath Hydroelectric Project supports power needs in the \nbasin with seven dams, the last of which was built more than 50 years \nago. Water needs for irrigation have increasingly come into conflict \nwith the needs of fish and wildlife. In 1908, President Teddy Roosevelt \nestablished the nation's first waterfowl refuge, Lower Klamath National \nWildlife Refuge. The importance of the basin for migratory birds along \nthe Pacific Flyway saw the later creation of the Clear Lake, Tule Lake, \nUpper Klamath, Bear Valley, and Klamath Marsh National Wildlife \nRefuges. The basin is also home to 13 species of anadromous fish. Three \nof these species are listed under the Endangered Species Act, including \nthe endangered listing of the Lost River and shortnose suckers in 1988, \nthe threatened listing of coho salmon in 1997, and the threatened \nlisting of bull trout in 1999. These fisheries--particularly salmon and \nsuckers--are important to the six federally recognized tribes in the \nbasin. Water demand often far exceeds the amount of water in a given \nyear, setting up a situation ripe for conflict.\n  That conflict grew to a head in the early 2000s. In 2001, biological \nopinions about the water necessary for endangered fish resulted in the \nBureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior withholding \nmuch of the water that would have normally gone to Klamath Project \nirrigators. Researchers for Oregon State estimated that the water \ncurtailment would have, in the absence of public and private emergency \nmitigation efforts, reduced agricultural output in the Upper Basin by \n$82 million, about 20 percent, and regional employment by almost 2,000 \njobs. Then in 2002, low water flows and poor water health caused the \ndeath of as many as 70,000 fall chinook before they could navigate up \nthe Klamath and spawn, in an event known as the ``2002 fish kill.'' The \nrancor and legal conflicts only intensified with these events, creating \nuncertainty in the basin that has impeded overall growth and \nprosperity.\n  Instead of accepting a future determined by acrimonious and costly \nlegal battles over the water, stakeholders in the basin came together \nto chart a different path. They recognized that their respective \ninterests could be better met through cooperative efforts designed to \nenhance species recovery, the certainty of agricultural operations, and \nstability in the basin for economic growth and civic relations. Years \nof complex and challenging work culminated in two historic agreements \nin 2010--the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement, KBRA, and the Klamath \nHydroelectric Settlement Agreement, KHSA. The KBRA settles water \ndisputes in exchange for greater water certainty for farmers and \nranchers, water for fish and wildlife needs, reduced power costs for \nirrigators, and restoration efforts for fisheries. The KHSA sets out a \nprocess whereby four hydroelectric dams may be removed, at no federal \ncost, should removal be in interest of fish restoration and the public \ninterest considering local community impacts. Together these \ncooperative efforts can achieve more for the basin than asserting \nindividual interests could. The collective efforts will promote \neconomic stability and growth, while ensure a full suite of restoration \nefforts are in place for the recovery of listed fish species.\n  The latest agreement in the basin became final just this year, the \nUpper Basin Comprehensive Agreement, UBA. I am especially proud of the \nwork that produced the UBA, having helped convene the special task \nforce that worked mightily to find agreement on the key remaining \nissues in the basin. The task force came about after a June 2013 Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on water issues in the \nbasin that I chaired. The Committee heard from 17 diverse witnesses and \nreceived roughly 4,000 comments via email prior to the hearing. Most \nacknowledged the clear impetus for a comprehensive solution given that \nthe Oregon Water Resources Department found in March 2013 that the \nKlamath Tribes held a time immemorial water right, making them the most \nsenior water right holder in the basin. And after months of arduous \nwork on the task force, members including irrigators, \nenvironmentalists, and tribes found common ground on habitat protection \nand restoration and swallowed hard to reduce the federal expenditures \nneeded as I had called for in the Senate. The UBA lays out specific \nwater management and restoration measures for the Upper Basin, \nincluding 30,000 acre feet of increased stream flows into Upper Klamath \nLake. The agreement provides crucial economic certainty to small \nbusiness in the basin who sell equipment to farmers growing the crops, \ncertainty for the cattle ranchers who manage their herds, certainty for \nthe tribes who want to pursue promising opportunities in forestry, like \nbiomass and other economic development.\n  The Klamath Basin Water Recovery and Economic Restoration Act of 2014 \nauthorizes these historic agreements and paves the way for the \nrestoration work needed to achieve their goals. In so doing, it sets \nout a new cooperative management plan that the Bureau of Reclamation \nwill administer. For the first time, the Klamath Reclamation Project \nwill include fish, wildlife, and National Wildlife Refuges as \nauthorized purposes for the project. This will allow water managers to \nincrease in-stream flows and lake levels. Private landowners and others \nwill undertake permanent protections for riparian areas and other \nenhancements that will help restore hundreds of miles of fish habitat. \nFish biologists estimate that these efforts will boost annual \nproduction of adult Chinook salmon by 80 percent. Additional water and \nflexible releases for the National Wildlife refuges means greater \nnumbers of migratory waterfowl, non-game water birds, wintering bald \neagles, and other sensitive species.\n  Achieving these benefits for fish and wildlife correspond to economic \nbenefits to the basin. The restoration efforts will also produce jobs. \nThe Department of the Interior calculates that more than 4,000 farming, \nranching, commercial and recreational fishing, construction, and other \njobs will be created or preserved. The water management plan provides \nfor more predictable water for farmers and ranchers to ensure irrigated \nagriculture continues in the basin. A drought management plan assists \nin navigating the challenges created by drought and climate change in \nthe basin. To deal with the escalating electric costs faced by \nirrigators, the bill lays out a path to\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\naffordable power including renewable energy development. There are also \neconomic benefits to tribes, beyond what a water right alone can \nachieve. The legislation sets up an economic development fund for the \nKlamath Tribes so they can create tribal jobs while sustainably \nmanaging their natural resources. By modifying some parties' interests \nfor the greater good, the basin can move beyond years of polarizing \ndebate and create a stable future from which to plan and prosper.\n  These historic agreements didn't happen by osmosis. They represent \nyears of hard work among parties who have stood up to incredible \npressures and made very real sacrifices to better their communities and \nthe associations they represent. I have thanked many parties for their \ndedication over the course of these agreements and want to again \nexpress my deepest thanks to the members of the task force and those \nwho went before them to tee up the work for Congress. With this bill, \nit is now time for Congress to step up and deliver on this package of \nagreements. The spirit of compromise on these thorny water issues has a \nmessage for not just Congress, but provides an example of how other \nvexing water situations across the Nation can sit down to work out \ntheir differences.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOKER:\n  S. 2380. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to improve the \nnational freight policy of the United States, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Freight \nPriorities Act, which takes an all-of-the-above approach to addressing \nour \nNation's freight needs. We must improve the movement of freight and \nstrengthen our economic competitiveness by examining a comprehensive, \nmultimodal, national network that includes not just our major highways, \nbut our rail, seaports, local roads and intermodal facilities. This \nbill would authorize the Department of Transportation to broaden our \napproach to freight policy, set goals for reducing air pollution, and \ncreates a pilot program to study the disproportionate impacts on urban \ncommunities that can be caused by the movement of freight.\n  In 2011, 17.6 billion tons of goods were transported throughout the \nUnited States, valued at more than $16.8 trillion. The Federal Highway \nAdministration estimates there will be a 60 percent increase of freight \nbeing moved over the next 30 years.\n  In New Jersey, hundreds of millions of tons of freight are annually \nshipped through our ports, by rail, and highways. The port of New York \nand New Jersey, as of 2012, supported over 296,000 jobs and 28.9 \nbillion in business income. This major economic engine drives New \nJersey's economy and boosts U.S. economic competitiveness. 1However, \ntoo often, our lack of investment and our limited focus on the highway \nnetwork causes our freight to get stuck in congested, heavily \ntrafficked urban areas. Extended truck, rail and ship idling negatively \nimpacts the health and air quality of local urban communities. With a \nslight adjustment of our priorities and a strong national commitment to \ninvesting in our infrastructure, we can dramatically reduce congestion, \nimprove the health of American communities, make sure goods get where \nthey need to go faster and cheaper, strengthen our economy and create \njobs.\n  The Freight Priorities Act sets goals for increasing efficiencies. It \noutlines goals to reduce air pollution and congestion, and requires the \ninclusion of port authorities in freight infrastructure investment \ndecisions. The bill requires DOT to meet performance measures for all \nmodes of freight movement, and establishes a pilot program that will \nhelp find ways to reduce the impact on local communities and help \ncreate access to jobs at ports and other multimodal facilities.\n  By refocusing our priorities, we will ensure that the smartest, most-\ncost effective projects secure funding. In New Jersey this could mean \ninvesting in the Raritan intermodal hub project in Essex, Union and \nMiddlesex counties, which would create a direct connection for freight \ncars to access the port of New York and New Jersey. The project would \nrelieve congestion on the roads and shift freight off of Amtrak's \npassenger lines. This bill would also prioritize investments that \nreduce air pollution, such as shore power technology at the port of \nNewark, which would help reduce emissions by allowing major cargo \nvessels to plug into the electric grid while at port.\n  Rather than finding ways to merely skate by on the limited \ninfrastructure funds we have each year, the conversation we should be \nhaving in Congress is how we can dramatically increase investments in \nour infrastructure and improve the safety and functionality of our \nentire network that transports both people and goods. This bill is a \nstrong step in that direction. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important piece of legislation, and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to carry \nthese priorities as we draft our portion of the Surface Transportation \nReauthorization bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3241-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3241-S3242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 453--CONDEMNING THE DEATH SENTENCE AGAINST MERIAM \n  YAHIA IBRAHIM ISHAG, A SUDANESE CHRISTIAN WOMAN ACCUSED OF APOSTASY\n\n  Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. \nFischer, Mr. Cruz, Mr. McCain, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Moran, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. \nBoozman, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, \nMr. Isakson, Mr. Burr, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Coburn) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 453\n\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2014, a Sudanese court affirmed a \n     sentence of death by hanging for 27-year old Meriam Yahia \n     Ibrahim Ishag, a Christian woman accused of apostasy for \n     refusing to recant her Christian faith, and ordered her to \n     receive 100 lashes for adultery because under Sudan's \n     Shari'ah law such inter-religious marriages are illegal;\n       Whereas Ibrahim is eight months pregnant and being held in \n     the Omdurman Federal Women's Prison with her 20-month old \n     son;\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated Sudan as a \n     ``Country of Particular Concern'' under the International \n     Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292) based on \n     the government's systematic, ongoing, and egregious \n     violations of religious freedom since 1999;\n       Whereas the Sudanese 1991 Criminal Code allows for death \n     sentences for apostasy, stoning for adultery, cross-\n     amputations for theft, prison sentences for blasphemy, and \n     floggings for undefined acts of ``indecency'';\n       Whereas, according to the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the Government of \n     Sudan, led by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, continues to \n     engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of \n     religious freedom or belief, imposes a restrictive \n     interpretation of Shari'ah law on Muslims and non-Muslims \n     alike and, along with other National Congress Party leaders, \n     President al-Bashir has stated that Sudan's new constitution, \n     when drafted, will be based on its interpretation of \n     Shari'ah;\n       Whereas, according to USCIRF, since South Sudan's \n     independence from Sudan in 2011, the number and severity of \n     harsh Shari'ah-based judicial decisions in Sudan has \n     increased, including sentences of amputation for theft and \n     sentences of stoning for adultery;\n       Whereas the United States Government has designated Sudan \n     as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since August 12, 1993, for \n     repeatedly providing support for acts of international \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas the Sudanese 2005 Interim Constitution states that \n     ``[t]he State shall respect the religious rights to (a) \n     worship or assemble in connection with any religion or \n     belief'';\n       Whereas the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, which the Government of Sudan has acceded, provides \n     that ``everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, \n     conscience. and religion.

Res. 454\n\n       Whereas heart disease remains the leading cause of death \n     for women in the United States, causing 1 in 4 female deaths \n     and more female deaths than all forms of cancer combined;\n       Whereas since 1984, the number of women who have died from \n     heart disease exceeds the number of men who have died from \n     heart disease;\n       Whereas the rate of cardiovascular death is increasing by 1 \n     percent each year among women ages 35 to 44;\n       Whereas heart disease claims the lives of nearly 422,000 \n     women each year;\n       Whereas almost half of African American women have some \n     form of cardiovascular disease, and African American women \n     are more likely to die from heart disease than white women;\n       Whereas heart disease and stroke account for \n     $312,600,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost \n     productivity annually;\n       Whereas only 54 percent of women recognize that heart \n     disease is the leading cause of death for women, and almost \n     \\2/3\\ of women who unexpectedly die of heart disease have no \n     previous symptoms of disease;\n       Whereas many women, especially younger women, may not be \n     aware of their risk for heart disease because they have never \n     gotten a basic, preventive heart screening and have no \n     symptoms;\n       Whereas studies show that nearly 1 in 5 women rely solely \n     on their obstetrician and gynecologist (``OB/GYN'') for \n     primary care, yet only 35 percent of women recall having even \n     discussed heart disease with their OB/GYN;\n       Whereas early identification of cardiovascular disease risk \n     factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, excessive \n     weight and obesity, high cholesterol, and diabetes allows for \n     more effective intervention and treatment, and can \n     dramatically lower a woman's overall risk of heart disease \n     and heart attack;\n       Whereas the burden of women's heart disease can be reduced \n     in the United States by encouraging primary care providers to \n     offer women basic, preventative heart disease screenings;\n       Whereas experts recommend and encourage that a basic, \n     preventive heart screening be a routine part of a woman's \n     visit to a primary care practitioner; and\n       Whereas once women understand their risk, they still need \n     follow-up information, support, and incentives to maintain \n     cardiovascular health and make the most informed decisions: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that, despite improved education and \n     awareness, heart disease remains the number 1 killer of women \n     in the United States;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of making basic, preventive \n     cardiovascular screening available for women as recommended, \n     so that all women can know the risks they face and what can \n     be done to reduce them;\n       (3) recognizes that basic, preventive heart disease \n     screenings are recommended to be a routine part of women's \n     health care; and\n       (4) commits to improving the heart health of all women, \n     tearing down the barriers that prevent women from getting \n     screened for heart disease, ensuring women are provided with \n     personalized lifestyle modification recommendations and \n     support, and ensuring every woman has a healthy heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/21/senate-section/article/S3242-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3242-S3243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.
