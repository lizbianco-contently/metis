Mr. President, this morning marks 321 days since this body \npassed commonsense immigration reform. For 321 days the Republican-\ncontrolled House of Representatives has done absolutely nothing to \naddress our Nation's problems dealing with our broken immigration \nsystem. It is a system that is broken and needs to be fixed. It cannot \nbe fixed on a piecemeal basis. It needs comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  To the Republican extremists in the House, the time went by like \nthat. To them, 321 days does not seem like a big deal. But outside of \nthe Capitol, where we are dealing with people's lives, those 321 days \nfelt like a lifetime. To American families forced to live in the \nshadows, each one of those days brings the dread of discovery and being \ntorn away from their loved ones. Undocumented immigrants have lived in \nfear for the last 46 weeks, worrying whether they will have to leave \nthe country they call home. For the past 10\\1/2\\ months children have \nlost their parents from government action--all while House Republicans \nhave twiddled their thumbs.\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\n  Enough is enough. It is time for the House Republicans to act. They \nhave wasted far too much time already failing to consider a bill that \nthe Senate considered, and passed in less than 2 months.\n  A year ago the Senate Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Leahy's \nleadership, was in the middle of marking up the commonsense immigration \nreform. After 2 weeks of consideration, what did they do? A bipartisan \nbill was reported out of that committee. Within a month the Senate \npassed immigration reform and sent it to the House of Representatives. \nIt was a good start. It was really good. But in our system of \ngovernment, what we did here will have absolutely no meaning unless the \nHouse takes it up. We were able to move on immigration reform quickly \nbecause both Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans understood the \nneed to fix a broken system.\n  What is the House Republicans' excuse? Why are they doing this? What \nare they achieving by dragging their feet on immigration reform? They \nclaim to be working on things--they say jobs, they say legislation to \nreduce the debt. If they are really interested in reducing the debt, \npass this bill. It is $1 trillion to reduce our debt--$1 trillion. What \nare they doing over there? Day after day, investigations--they \ninvestigate everything and accomplish nothing.\n  The fact is that the Senate-passed immigration bill reduces the \ndeficit and spurs the economy more than the House-passed bills awaiting \nSenate action combined. I repeat: $1 trillion. The immigration \nlegislation passed by the Senate reduces the deficit more than all the \nbills passed by the House that are currently awaiting action in the \nSenate.\n  So it is no wonder that even pro-Republican organizations are calling \non Speaker Boehner to stop wasting time. Earlier this week we heard Tom \nDonohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say that it is \nin the Republicans' best interests to pass immigration reform. He said \nunless the House passes immigration reform this year, Republicans \nshouldn't even bother running in 2016. So that is what he said, and it \nis probably true.\n  Politics should not be the only reason the House passes this bill. \nImmigration reform is far more important than any election-year \npoliticking. Immigration reform is about families and communities.\n  The DREAM Act is a perfect example. In September 2010, I was in the \nmidst of what some considered a tough re-election campaign when I \nhelped champion Senator Durbin's DREAM Act. Though it was eventually \nblocked by a Republican filibuster, I did my best to pass the DREAM \nAct, even as some said it would cost me the election. As everyone knows \nby this time, the President, as he said in his State of the Union \nAddress--and he did this last Congress and he is doing it this \nCongress--because we are doing virtually nothing here in the Senate, he \ndecided to do something administratively. That is why we have deferred \nstatus for these young men and women who want to go into the military, \nfinish their education, and this is the only place they have ever known \nas home.\n  The bill that passed here is common sense. Eleven million people--we \ncannot fiscally deport 11 million people. We cannot physically do it. \nIt just will not work. That is why the legislation that was crafted \nhere on a bipartisan basis is fair to everyone. What it says is that if \nthis is your home and you have improper papers, we will give you some \ntime to get those adjusted. It is going to take some time. You are not \ngoing to go to the front of the line; you are going to go to the back \nof the line. You are going to have to pay taxes. You are going to have \nto work. You are going to have to stay out of trouble and learn \nEnglish. It would take about a dozen years to have your status \nadjusted, but at least during that period of time you can come out of \nthe shadows.\n  Recently, though, the House Judiciary Committee chairman appeared on \na Sunday news show and tried very, very unsuccessfully to justify his \nparty's inaction. His reasoning as to why the House is dragging its \nheels? Republicans claim President Obama cannot be trusted to enforce \nimmigration law. So what Republicans are really saying is that they \nwill not act on immigration reform unless there are more deportations, \nmore families torn apart. That does not make a lot of sense to most \npeople. In a nutshell, it is the House immigration platform.\n  Why work to help undocumented immigrants get right with the law? Why \ndo that? Because it is good for the country. It is fair. And, as I have \nindicated, it is good monetarily for this country. But what the \nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee said on one of those Sunday \nshows is in keeping with what they have done. It is hard to comprehend.\n  I guess that is what we have learned to expect from a House \nRepublican conference whose immigration policy is dictated by the likes \nof Congressman Steven King. Remember him, Mr. President? He is the \nCongressmen who, instead of permitting immigrants to enlist in the \nmilitary and earn citizenship, would rather send them ``on a bus back \nto Tijuana.'' That is a quote from him. Congressman King also claimed \nthat for every hard-working undocumented student, there are 100 more \nworking as drug mules with ``calves the size of cantaloupes because \nthey're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.''\n  The fact of the matter is that these men and women, with their \nfamilies, are our neighbors, our classmates, our colleagues. They are \nhere for a lot of different reasons. They have overstayed their visas. \nSome were brought here illegally. But we have to deal with this issue. \nSo many of them are like Astrid Silva, who is one of the DREAMers. She \nwas 4 years old, a little girl in a boat coming across the Rio Grande \nRiver. She had her Rosary beads and a little doll and her mom. Nevada \nis the only place she has ever known as home. Because she was so \nfrightened, she was afraid to go anyplace.\n  This is the right thing to do. We need to move forward on \ncomprehensive immigration reform, and we can only do that if the \nRepublicans in the House, led by Speaker Boehner, do the right thing. \nIt is very important. I urge the House to stop wasting time and bring \nimmigration reform to a vote. Give the American people the assurance \nthat we are working to finally mend our broken immigration system and \ngive families the opportunity to come forward and work toward legal \nstatus. It really is the right thing to do.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S2982-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this week we recognize National Police \nWeek. National Police Week is a time to pay tribute to the service and \nsacrifice of the men and women in Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement across our Nation. Law enforcement is one of our Nation's \nhighest callings, as brave peace officers put themselves on the line to \ndefend the lives, safety and property of their neighbors. Therefore, it \nis entirely appropriate that we pause this week and throughout the year \nto thank them for their service.\n  The Nation's capital is host to thousands of police officers who have \ncome to celebrate National Police Week with their fellow officers. No \none but another peacekeeper or their families can truly grasp the duty \nof defending their communities. No one but another peacekeeper can \ntruly know the joys of camaraderie and the sorrows of deep loss that \neach one has experienced.\n  I want to especially recognize the many men and women of Kentucky law \nenforcement. Many of them have traveled to Washington this week, and I \nwill have the pleasure of meeting with some of Kentucky's finest and \ntheir families later today, including the Ellis family and the Shaw \nfamily.\n  I am personally grateful to them for bravely risking their lives in \nour defense. Sadly, this occasion of National\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\nPolice Week is also the time when we pay tribute to two brave and \nhonorable police officers from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who have \nfallen in the line of duty in the past year.\n  Deputy Sheriff Chad D. Shaw of the McCracken County Sheriff's \nDepartment tragically suffered a fatal heart attack on August 6, 2013. \nHe was 47 years old. Deputy Shaw had been at the Community Christian \nAcademy in Western Kentucky, near Paducah, helping coordinate security \nfor a meeting among the faculty and staff to kick off the new school \nyear when he collapsed and was immediately taken to Baptist Health in \nPaducah.\n  Tragically, it was too late for the U.S. Army veteran and 12-year \nveteran of the McCracken County Sheriff's Department. McCracken County \nSheriff Joe Hayden says: ``Deputy Shaw will always be remembered for \nhis love of his family, his love for helping others, and the \nthoroughness in the way he did his job as a public servant for the \ncitizens that he served.''\n  Deputy Shaw leaves behind his wife Margaret and two daughters. I \nexpress my deepest condolences to them, as well as to members of the \nMcCracken County Sheriff's Department and to all who knew Deputy Shaw \nat the loss of this fine and good man who chose to wear the uniform of \nboth his country and his Commonwealth and brought honor to both.\n  I also pay tribute to another Kentucky officer lost to us in the last \nyear, officer Jason Scott Ellis of the Bardstown Police Department. \nOfficer Ellis was tragically killed on May 25 of last year. He was 33 \nyears old. Officer Ellis was killed when he was en route home following \nhis shift. He was in uniform and driving a marked vehicle. It is \nbelieved he was ambushed by a subject who deliberately placed debris in \nthe middle of the roadway, causing Officer Ellis to stop and exit his \nvehicle.\n  As Officer Ellis removed the debris, the killer or killers opened \nfire from a nearby hilltop, shooting him multiple times and killing him \ninstantly. It is no exaggeration to call what happened to Officer Ellis \nan assassination. Maddeningly, the killer or killers are still at \nlarge.\n  Officer Ellis's tragic death marked the first time in the history of \nthe Bardstown Police Department for an officer to be killed in the line \nof duty. A reward for the assassin, or assassins, still at large has \ngrown to over a quarter of a million dollars.\n  Commissioner Rodney Brewer of the Kentucky State Police pledges that \nhis troopers will continue to aggressively investigate this heinous \nmurder until an arrest is made. Kentucky State Police, Bardstown \npolice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to seek the \npublic's assistance with any detail, regardless of how small, regarding \nthe evening of Officer Ellis's death, May 25, 2013.\n  Ellis was a huge asset to his force. He was not only a field-training \nofficer, but he was also their only K-9 officer. With his police dog \nFigo, he fought illegal drug use in Bardstown. Few can forget one of \nthe iconic photos of 2013 that featured Figo resting his paw on the \ncoffin of his departed partner Officer Ellis at the funeral service.\n  Bardstown Police Chief Rick McCubbin credited Officer Ellis with \nbeing one of the department's top officers when it came to arrests and \nmaking a dent in the drug problem.\n  ``He also made me feel like he was Superman,'' says Amy Ellis, \nOfficer Ellis's wife, ``that nothing would ever happen to him.'' Chief \nRick McCubbin says Officer Ellis paid the ultimate sacrifice doing what \nhe loved, being a police officer.\n  Jason Ellis was a native of Cincinnati and a student at the \nUniversity of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, KY. At school he was a \nstar baseball player. He set records for alltime career hits, doubles, \nhome runs, and career games played. He went on to play minor league \nbaseball in the Cincinnati Reds system from 2002 to 2005.\n  Even as the star of the baseball diamond, however, coaches and \nteammates remember Jason Ellis talking about becoming a law enforcement \nofficer. His wife Amy says:\n\n       He was always a go-getter . . . He was dedicated to his job \n     and he wanted to clean the streets up. And that was the way \n     to get the drugs off the streets.\n\n  Officer Ellis was a 7-year veteran of the Bardstown Police \nDepartment. He leaves behind a grieving family, including his wife Amy, \nhis two young sons Parker and Hunter, two sisters, his mother and \nstepfather, and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  More than 300 people attended a candlelight vigil for Officer Ellis \noutside the police station shortly after his murder. On May 30 of last \nyear, Officer Ellis was laid to rest at Highview Cemetery in Nelson \nCounty. Fellow law enforcement officers from across Kentucky and as far \naway as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois came to pay their respects. \nHundreds of police cruisers helped to make up the funeral procession \nover those beautiful rolling hills and country roads of Nelson County.\n\n  Over 1,000 people filled the church sanctuary to capacity, with even \nmore standing in the aisles, to show their reverence and respect for \nOfficer Ellis's service and his sacrifice. Chief Rick McCubbin says \nthis about his tragic slaying:\n\n       It's basically a large family here and a lot of these \n     officers have worked together many years, so as you can \n     imagine they are very close. They know each other well, they \n     know each other's families, each other's children, so it's a \n     devastating hit.\n\n  Officer Ellis's loss is a devastating hit not only to his family, not \nonly to his brother officers, but to all of us throughout Kentucky who \nrespect and admire the men and women who wear a police uniform and make \na solemn vow to defend the lives of others, even at the cost of their \nown.\n  I want to express my deepest condolences to Officer Ellis's family, \nto the members of the Bardstown Police Department, and to peace \nofficers across Kentucky for the loss of one very brave officer: Jason \nScott Ellis.\n  I am relieved to say that for the grieving family members of Officer \nEllis, Deputy Shaw, and every peace officer lost in the line of duty \nacross our Nation, resources to help are available. One of those \nresources is COPS, or Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. COPS members \ninclude spouses, children, parents, siblings, significant others, and \naffected coworkers of officers killed in the line of duty.\n  The Kentucky chapter of COPS has been at the forefront of serving \nthis mission. Last year Kentucky COPS hosted the Traumas in Law \nEnforcement seminar for law enforcement agencies to learn how to deal \nwith line-of-duty deaths. With 62 participants, it was one of the \nhighest attended seminars that any COPS chapter or organization has \never put on. This is an organization that does not forget, taking care \nof the families of our fallen law enforcement heroes long after their \nwatches end.\n  I am proud of our Bluegrass State peace officers for taking the lead \nin helping other men and women in blue to deal with these tragic \nlosses. As I have just related in the stories of Officer Ellis and \nDeputy Shaw, any loss of a law enforcement officer is too great a price \nto pay for the families and communities they protect.\n  I will be honored to meet with some members of the Kentucky COPS who \nare here in the Nation's Capital for National Police Week today in my \noffice. Sherry Bryant is the wife of Kentucky Department of Fish & \nWildlife Resources officer Douglas Bryant, who was tragically killed in \nthe line of duty back in 2003.\n  Laurie Stricklen is the wife of police officer James ``Stumpy'' \nStricklen of the Alexandria, KY, Police Department, who suffered a \nfatal heart attack on March 24 as a result of injuries sustained after \nrestraining a suspect.\n  Anthony Jansen is the son of police officer Anthony Jansen of the \nNewport Police Department, who was accidentally shot and killed while \nin the line of duty on December 30, 1984. His son Tony carries on his \nfather's tradition as he is himself now a police officer.\n  So I am privileged to welcome all of those brave police survivors as \nwell as the families of Officer Jason Ellis and Deputy Clay Shaw to my \noffice today. To honor these fallen heroes and to help bring justice to \nthose who would injure or kill our police officers, I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the National Blue Alert Act. This bipartisan legislation \ncalls for what would be equivalent to a national AMBER Alert system to \nefficiently share information with the public when a law enforcement \nofficer is killed or seriously injured.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in holding the deepest \nadmiration and respect for the many brave\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\nlaw enforcement officers across Kentucky and the Nation. We are \ngrateful so many have come to town for National Police Week.\n  We recognize theirs as both an honorable profession and a dangerous \none. We recognize that what they do is vitally necessary to maintain \npeace and order in a civil society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S2984-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it pains me to say that almost every day \nbrings a new story of reported scandals and a long list of failures and \nabuses within the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  The latest scandals are particularly painful to me because they \nemanate from Texas, and we have a proud tradition of being a State that \ncontributes a large number of uniformed military members from our \nState--and, of course, we have a huge population of veterans, people \nwho have worn the uniform of the United States proudly, sacrificed so \nmuch, and risked it all. But just like the scandals in Fort Collins, \nCO; Phoenix, AZ; Pittsburgh, PA; and in other cities, the ones in \nAustin, San Antonio, Harlingen, and Waco are evidence of a callous \ndisregard for the health and well-being of America's heroes.\n  The new information comes from a pair of whistleblowers. The first \none, a VA scheduling clerk named Brian Turner, told the Austin \nAmerican-Statesman that his supervisors at the VA facilities in Austin, \nSan Antonio, and Waco were directing him to falsify appointment data in \nhopes of covering up the problem of long wait times.\n  Meanwhile, the former associate chief of staff at the Harlingen VA \nHealth Care Center, a man by the name of Dr. Richard Krugman, has gone \npublic with a series of disturbing allegations, according to the \nWashington Examiner, which interviewed Dr. Krugman. Veterans seeking \nroutine colonoscopies--cancer screening, in other words--at the \nHarlingen center were forced to endure extremely long wait times and, \nin some cases, they were denied those cancer screenings altogether. He \nsaid, as a result, up to ``15,000 patients [veterans all] who should \nhave gotten colonoscopies either did not get them or were examined only \nafter long and needless delays.''\n  Dr. Krugman believes that some of these veterans actually died as a \nresult of the lack of cancer screening and addressing their symptoms.\n  He also told the Examiner that ``an office secretary deleted about \n1,800 orders for medical tests or other services to eliminate a backlog \nthat threatened a certification inspection from an outside group.''\n  Sadly, these allegations fit within a larger pattern of VA abuses. At \nVA clinics across the country, reports have been made that staffers and \nadministrators have failed to provide veterans with reliable access to \nmedical care and have fraudulently concealed long wait times. Given all \nthese examples, they are not just an individual data point, but in \nconnecting these data points it appears that the problems with the \nVeterans Administration are systemic.\n  What we have is nothing less than a betrayal, a betrayal of our \nNation's veterans, and a betrayal of the American people, all of whom \ndeserve to know the truth about what their government is or is not \ndoing to support our American heroes. Of course, we have heard in \nPhoenix that this betrayal has had tragic consequences, with an \nestimated up to 40 people dying after lingering on a secret waiting \nlist--never receiving the treatment that they were entitled to.\n  We still don't know exactly how many veterans have died or otherwise \nhave suffered because of the VA's assorted failures and abuses, but we \ndo know that it is disgraceful and unacceptable for even one veteran to \nneedlessly die or suffer because of bureaucratic malfeasance. The \nevidence of such malfeasance is now growing, of course. The only \nquestions are: How can we get our veterans the care and support they \nneed in the fastest possible way; and what is the best way to restore \ngenuine accountability and genuine safeguards within the VA system?\n  Whenever I think about the ongoing VA scandals and the broader set of \nchallenges facing America's veterans, I think of an annual tradition \nthat we have in Texas. Every year on Memorial Day I host young Texans \nwho are being sent off to their service academies. These are inspiring \nyoung men and women. Anyone who is feeling a little bit uncertain about \nour Nation's future needs to meet these young men and women who go to \nour service academies. They are the best of the best and are an \ninspiration to me.\n  This is a wonderful event and easily one of the highlights of my \nyear. Yet I can't think of how badly the VA is failing not only our \ncurrent generation but tainting that promise of our commitment to the \nnext generation of our military servicemembers and veterans. The \ngeneration that is now preparing to embark for places such as West \nPoint, Annapolis, and Colorado Springs--these young people should be \ngiven not just a promise but an ironclad commitment that after serving \nour Nation with honor and courage they will get the support they have \nearned and they deserve.\n  Anything less is just not acceptable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                               EXPIRE Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate is now debating the EXPIRE Act.\n  This is bipartisan legislation. I again thank the distinguished \nSenator from Utah Mr. Hatch. He has been so constructive in trying to \nbuild a bipartisan piece of legislation, a bill that came out of the \nSenate Finance Committee several weeks ago with very substantial \nbipartisan support.\n  It really is designed to deal with a number of tax provisions that \nare temporary in nature and it, in effect, extends those temporary tax \nprovisions until the end of 2015. In consultation with the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, I thought it was important to call \nthis bill the EXPIRE Act. It was important because this legislation \nactually does expire after 2 years.\n  It, in effect, says--and I said--on my watch as chair of the Senate \nFinance Committee there will not be another extenders bill. It is not \ngoing to happen on my watch. This is it.\n  In effect, by extending these important provisions now for one last \ntime, the Congress can give itself and the Finance Committee--on a \nbipartisan basis--the space that is needed to take on the challenge of \ncomprehensive tax reform.\n  It is not going to be easy, but it is absolutely imperative for the \nfuture of the American economy. I know it can be done. I know we can \nget Senators of both political parties together and build a bipartisan \ntax reform plan. I know this because I have--and other Senators do as \nwell--a fair amount of sweat equity in this cause.\n  Our former colleague Senator Gregg of New Hampshire sat next to me on \na sofa for more than 2 years to build what still is the only bipartisan \nSenate comprehensive tax reform bill in the last 30 years. With Senator \nGregg's retirement, to their credit, Senator Coats and Senator Begich \npitched in.\n  So we know that there has already been a lot of bipartisan work on \ncomprehensive tax reform and, suffice it to say, again building on this \nbipartisan lineage. My colleague from Utah, the senior Senator Mr. \nHatch, and Ambassador Baucus and Chairman Camp in the other body, have \nalso put in years of work and laid a strong foundation for tax reform.\n  So once the Senate passes the EXPIRE Act, the job of the Finance \nCommittee will be to focus in a kind of\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\nlaser-like fashion on a bipartisan plan that is going to give all \nAmericans the opportunity to get ahead.\n  I want to emphasize that. If I were to sum up my philosophy about tax \nreform, I want everybody in America to have the opportunity to get \nahead--all our small businesses, all our Americans who are trying to \ndeal with an extraordinarily challenging economy.\n  Frankly, that would be my first choice, to be out here working on \ncomprehensive tax reform. But it was clear to me, with Chairman Baucus \ngoing to China as our Ambassador, that it wasn't going to be possible \nin a few short months to pass comprehensive tax reform.\n  I made the judgment--I will share it with the Senate again today, and \nI brought it up yesterday--that the failure to act on these temporary \nprovisions, which are what the EXPIRE Act is all about, would cause \nfurther unnecessary, really gratuitous harm to American workers, to our \nsmall businesses, to our ability to compete in tough global markets. \nThe EXPIRE Act is all about preventing a tax increase. We would clearly \nhave a tax increase absent the EXPIRE Act, and it would be in areas of \nthe economy that would be particularly damaging.\n  For example, it would really be a tax on innovation because right at \nthe center of these temporary provisions--provisions that under this \nbill will last only until the end of 2015, and then they will expire--\nthey are not just meant to expire, they actually expire at the end of \n2015. But if we don't take action to ensure that innovation has an \nopportunity to flourish, what will happen is we will, in effect, have a \ntax on those very jobs that are most important for our middle class--to \ngrow wages, to encourage the kind of economic multiplier that is so \ngood for our economy. So we ought to pass the EXPIRE Act so as not to \nhave a tax increase on innovation.\n  We ought to pass the EXPIRE Act to not make it tougher for a company \nto hire a veteran, which I think is also hugely important. I will talk \nabout it in a couple of minutes in further detail.\n  Another one that I know a lot of Senators are going to hear about \nthis week is what would happen--absent this bill--to millions of \nAmericans who are underwater on their mortgages. These are hardworking \nmiddle Americans who now are deeply underwater. Their lenders are \nwilling to work out arrangements to lower their debt in a number of \ninstances. But absent this bill, instead of getting their heads above \nwater, what we will see is a tax increase on those homeowners that \nreally drives them back down and increasingly sinking under all of this \ndebt. Absent this bill, middle class people would be paying a tax on \nphantom income. I mean, they are not really getting any net income. \nWhen their lender works with them to relieve their debt, they surely \nshouldn't have to pay a hefty new tax. This bill does that.\n  This is National Small Business Week, and this legislation in \nparticular goes to great lengths to make it attractive for small \nbusinesses and particularly for small businesses that would like to \nhire new workers.\n  Today we know there are nearly 10 million Americans out of work, and \nthey are looking for jobs. The unemployment rate in my home State is \n6.9 percent, which is well above the national average.\n  I think we would all agree that our highest priority should be to \nhelp people find jobs, and the EXPIRE Act is an opportunity to do that, \nparticularly with respect to what it does for our small businesses.\n  Let me outline a few of those provisions--again, temporary in \nnature--so that we can do even more on a permanent basis for growing \nour economy and making it attractive for our small businesses to hire \nnew workers.\n  In the EXPIRE Act is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which \nencourages employers to recruit, hire, and retain individuals who often \nhave had trouble finding jobs. The EXPIRE Act extends and expands this \nlegislation in a few key ways so that the credit can help small \nbusinesses hire an even greater number of struggling Americans.\n  First, it would do more to help the long-term unemployed find work. \nThese are those hard-hit Americans who are deeply at risk of falling \nbetween the cracks.\n  Second, the new approach will preserve the credit for veterans \nreturning from overseas whom we have seen packing--literally packing--\njob fairs in cities across the country in search of work. Picture that. \nThe veterans who have worn the uniform of the United States and served \nall of us so admirably come back and can't find work, and they are \ncoming out in throngs to these job fairs around the country. This bill \nwill help them.\n  Small businesses that employee military reservists also currently get \na wage credit when their employees get called to Active Duty. Not only \nwill the EXPIRE Act increase that credit, it will open the credit to \nemployers of all sizes to improve job security for even more \nreservists.\n  I mentioned the research and development credit, which of course \nencourages innovation in firms of all sizes. For many of them, having a \nstrong research and development credit is simply imperative, but the \nreality is the current credit isn't doing all it might do to help small \nbusinesses, and complicated rules that are buried in the Tax Code may \nerase any benefits they see. The EXPIRE Act will change that in several \nkey ways. To start, it will expand the pool of small businesses that \nbenefit. It will also allow startups to use the research and \ndevelopment credit to help pay their employees' salaries, and it will \nbuild a bridge to tax reform so Congress can do more work to improve \nthe credit further and make it permanent.\n  The research and development credit is critically important to the \nfuture of innovation in our country. Apropos again of the bipartisan \ntheme we have taken in the Finance Committee, with the support of the \nranking minority member, the distinguished Senator from Utah, there has \nbeen some very good work done by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, \nand Senator Schumer. I wish to commend them for their efforts to \nspotlight the need to do more to reconfigure the research and \ndevelopment credit to help small businesses.\n  The reality of course is what is the common thread between so many of \nour most successful companies--Intel and Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, \nand a host of others. They all started as innovative small businesses \nwith their eyes trained on developing the future. The EXPIRE Act is a \nstep toward a stronger, permanent research and development credit that \nwill help even more entrepreneurs in our country grow their best ideas \ninto successful businesses.\n  In the meantime, we all know small businesses in my home State of \nOregon and across the country still suffer from the recession. They \nfeel the effects of sluggish growth pretty much like everyone else. In \na stronger economy, healthy small businesses might have decided to turn \nhigher profits into investments aimed at expansion. The research and \ndevelopment credit--particularly the improved research and development \ncredit--is going to help a lot of Americans, but we do want to place a \nspecial focus on our small businesses because helping them to make \ncapital investments in new machinery, vehicles or computers is \nabsolutely critical.\n  Again, the EXPIRE Act steps in to begin to address that effort in a \nthoughtful manner. The legislation allows small businesses to expense \nup to $500,000 of equipment costs right away, and it indexes that \ndollar amount to inflation so it grows in the future. It is what I \nthink a number of Members know as section 179 expensing. If the \nCongress were to fail to pass the EXPIRE Act, that limit would fall \nfrom one-half million dollars to just $25,000.\n  The legislation also continues to simplify recordkeeping--all of the \nredtape we have heard small businesses, concerned about section 179, \ntalk with us about. The legislation continues to simplify those \nprocedures so small businesses can focus on their own growth instead of \nredtape.\n  A lot of small businesses have property that has lost value over \ntime. Those small businesses can claim a deduction to compensate for \nit. The EXPIRE Act extends a key provision that allows small businesses \nto expense up to half the cost of that property upfront in the first \nyear rather than spreading it out over a longer period.\n  Both of these tax incentives, section 179 expensing and bonus \ndepreciation,\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\nare powerful tools to encourage investment. They are lifelines for \nsmall businesses looking to grow, and the EXPIRE Act protects them \nalso.\n  Next, I would like to touch on the energy sector, which I know the \ndistinguished presiding officer has a great interest in. Obviously, \nsmall energy businesses play a major role in the future of the American \neconomy, building a lower carbon future, and the EXPIRE Act is going to \nprotect the incentives those businesses rely on to grow.\n  I will start briefly with the production tax credit. The wind energy \nindustry, which benefits from the production tax credit, supports more \nthan 50,000 jobs. Many wind companies are small, and they require lots \nof capital and planning to bring them to market. Their story \nillustrates what is important to end the cycle of stop-and-go tax \npolicies that make our Tax Code, again, needlessly--as some would say, \nalmost insanely--complicated and uncertain. Growth in wind energy has \nleveled off over the last 2 years, largely because of the expiration \nand late renewal of provisions such as the production tax credit.\n  The EXPIRE Act also extends provisions to encourage the provision of \nother alternative renewable fuels--fuels such as biodiesel, cellulosic \nethanol, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied hydrogen. There are small \nbusinesses across the country that stand to gain if the EXPIRE Act is \npassed, and there are incentives to create jobs in those areas, but our \ncountry is going to lose out if the Senate fails to act.\n  Our small businesses ought to be able to plan for the future, to \nchart a course, in effect, from youth through maturity. Stop-and-go tax \npolicies only make that more difficult. Even when well-intentioned, \nproductive tax incentives go into the code, allowing them to expire \nover and over undermines their effectiveness and the ability of our \nbusinesses to have the certainty needed to grow for the long term. Our \ntaxpayers, small businesses included--and we recognize them especially \nthis week--deserve predictability and certainty.\n  The EXPIRE Act is called the EXPIRE Act for a reason. It is going to \nend after 2 years. I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle over the last day make a number of very thoughtful comments about \nthe need for comprehensive tax reform, and I wish to tell my \ncolleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, that with \nrespect to the need for comprehensive tax reform, they pretty much have \nme at hello. We are going to get this extender bill passed, and then it \nis my intent to work very closely with Senator Hatch, the distinguished \nranking member on the Finance Committee, and all of our colleagues to \nstart putting together a strategy for a comprehensive tax reform plan \nto pass this Congress.\n\n  I will say on the floor that I think there is a real opportunity now \nto break the gridlock on tax reform. If we look, in effect, from this \nday, essentially May of 2014, until certainly the middle of 2015, there \nis an ideal opportunity, an ideal window for Democrats and Republicans \nin the Senate to build a bipartisan coalition to pass that into law--\ncomprehensive tax reform--and to work with our colleagues on the other \nside of the Capitol who have similar interests. I know that because I \nhave talked to a number of them in recent months.\n  I want colleagues on both sides of the aisle to know we are going to \nfocus on getting these extenders passed now. Speed is important because \nthe longer we wait, the more we damage, for example, our ability to \ncreate those innovation jobs because, in effect, we are going to have a \ntax increase on innovation, making it harder to hire veterans and the \ntax hike middle-class people would get, in effect, because they are \nunderwater on their mortgages and they got a break from their lender. \nWe have to get that done. It is my intent to use every single day as we \ngo forward with that effort to make sure the extenders pass and pass \nquickly, then move on to comprehensive bipartisan tax reform. I know we \ncan do it.\n  He is not here today, but my colleague Mr. Coats, the senior Senator \nfrom Indiana, has done very good work--stepped in when Senator Gregg \nretired--and has more than met me halfway. I particularly want to \ncommend Senator Begich, who has been part of our bipartisan coalition \nand who has had very thoughtful ideas, particularly on protecting the \nmiddle-class small business incentives for savings. He is a small \nbusinessperson himself.\n  I have been out here probably 20 minutes or so, and I haven't said \nanything that isn't about Democrats and Republicans coming together, \ncoming together first to pass the extender legislation and then to use \nevery single day over essentially the next year and a half--that window \nuntil the summer of 2015--to put together a bipartisan plan that can \nhelp grow the economy.\n  I will close with this. After the bipartisan effort in 1986, where a \nbig group of progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans came \ntogether, our country created 6.2 million new jobs over the next 2 \nyears. Nobody can claim every one of those jobs was due to tax reform; \nthat simply would be stretching things, but clearly it helped. The \nbusiness people I talk to now in Oregon and others who come to \nWashington say they very much want the same certainty and \npredictability that was seen in 1986, in terms of being able to make \nthose investments to grow their businesses and particularly hire more \nmiddle-class Americans at good wages. That is what we are going to be \nall about. We are going to pursue it in a bipartisan way. Let us pass \nthe EXPIRE Act and move on to address the question of bipartisan \ncomprehensive tax reform.\n  As I leave the floor--I touched on it while he wasn't here--I am \nparticularly pleased about the Roberts-Schumer addition to help more \nsmall businesses be part of those innovation jobs for the future \nbecause what Senator Roberts and Senator Schumer did is to take that \ncredit and do more to move it toward an approach that will help those \nsmall businesses, the ones starting in garages and all across the \ncountry where individuals are betting on the future and taking the \nrisks. It is going to be easier for them because of the good work done \nby Senator Roberts and Senator Schumer. It is another reason for \ncolleagues to vote for the EXPIRE Act.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the Republicans control the \ntime from 3 until 3:45 and the majority control the time from 3:45 \nuntil 4:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first let me thank my colleague from \nOregon, our new shining chairman of the Finance Committee, who is doing \nsuch a great job. He is trying, in his own inimitable way--almost \nalways successful way--to weave together ideas of Democrats and \nRepublicans to create a bipartisan solution, first on the issue of \nextenders--and that will be the big test case, and he knows it--and \nsecond on tax reform in general. If we can't pass these tax extenders \nin a bipartisan way, it will not bode well for tax reform. I am \nhopeful, with the initial signs and the overwhelming vote yesterday, we \ncan get that vote done.\n  As the Senator mentioned, it has many ideas from different parts of \nthe country--ideas from Democrats, ideas from Republicans, ideas, as he \nwas kind enough to mention, that we worked on together, such as the \nproposal Senator Roberts and I put together under the guidance of \nSenator Coons, who was the originator of the idea.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona. I know he has some important words to \nspeak in the next few minutes and has let me go now. I appreciate that \nvery much. I know everyone looks forward to hearing from him.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  It is apropos my colleague from Arizona is on the floor because we \nworked together for so long and hard--at least in the Senate--\nsuccessfully on this issue of immigration. So I rise today to continue \na conversation I started 2 weeks ago about the House's incomprehensible \nrefusal to do anything to try to fix our broken immigration system.\n  I remind everyone it has now been 320 days since the Senate passed a \nstrong bipartisan bill that would secure our borders, hold employers \naccountable for hiring illegal workers, grow our economy, and provide a \nchance for people currently here illegally to get right\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\nwith the law and earn legal status. During all that time the House has \nfailed to do anything to fix our broken immigration system.\n  To be clear, the problem is not that there is a difference of opinion \nbetween a House bill and a Senate bill on immigration that cannot be \nreconciled. The problem is that House Republicans have completely \nabdicated their responsibility to address the important issue of fixing \nour broken immigration system. Again, the problem isn't that the House \nhas passed immigration laws that the Senate disagrees with; the problem \nis that the House won't put any immigration bills up for a vote no \nmatter what is in those bills.\n  Two weeks ago I stated on the floor that the reason the House has \ndone nothing on immigration is because House Republicans have handed \nthe gavel of leadership on immigration to far-right extremists, such as \nCongressman Steve King. Not only has this point not been refuted by \nanyone in the Republican Party, it has actually been confirmed in \nvarious news sources that have come out since the speech.\n  For instance, just 2 days ago Speaker Boehner was quoted as saying:\n\n       I do believe the vast majority of our members do want to \n     deal with this, they want to deal with it openly, honestly \n     and fairly.\n\n  Speaker Boehner is making clear that these folks are part of a ``vote \nno, pray yes'' caucus. But he said immigration hasn't been scheduled \nfor a vote because ``there are some members of our party who just don't \nwant to deal with this. It's no secret.''\n  Now, even by Steve King's analysis, 20 to 25 Members of the House \nRepublican side would vote for the Senate's immigration bill. That \nnumber is clearly an underestimation of support in the House for the \nSenate bill, but it shows that even according to Steven King, if the \nSenate bill were brought up for a vote, it would pass. King added that \nabout 100 to 150 Republican Members of the House could possibly vote \nyes on an immigration bill if it were presented for a vote.\n  Given this broad support for immigration reform that supposedly \nexists in the House, I would say to Speaker Boehner and the Republican \nHouse leadership: What are you waiting for? If you want to pass \nimmigration reform, and you say the vast majority of your Members want \nto pass immigration reform, schedule immigration reform for a vote. It \ndoesn't have to be our bill, although I think that is a good \nbipartisan, down-the-middle--not too liberal, not too conservative--\napproach. But don't do our bill. Do another bill. Come up with your own \nideas. That is fine with us.\n  But the problem is that the House Republican leadership is still too \nafraid of what Steve King calls the ``50 to 70 Republicans who would \nfight to the last drop of blood against any immigration bill.''\n  It is time for the House Republican leadership to decide whether they \nstand with the majority of the American people and the supposed \nmajority of their conference or whether they are really going to let \nSteve King continue to dictate the policy of the Republican Party on \nimmigration.\n  Just to be clear, right now Steve King is winning. Just last week he \nsaid:\n\n       If I had the power, the authority to kill everything \n     immigration-wise that comes through the House, if they \n     actually handed me the keys to the kingdom, and if I actually \n     had the gavel that controls the immigration issue, that would \n     be nice.\n\n  Well, who among us can say he has not been handed the gavel on \nimmigration policy when nothing is being done on immigration--just as \nhe said he would do if he were indeed handed the gavel?\n  What has the House actually done on immigration these past 2 years? \nNothing. Look it up. This is what Steve King wants--he wants the House \nto do nothing. He is winning and America is losing.\n  I am not the only one who is frustrated with this inexplicable \ninaction. Just this week Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, said:\n\n       If the Republicans don't do it, they shouldn't bother to \n     run a candidate in 2016.\n\n  He added that ``failure to act is not an option'' and that ``we're \nabsolutely crazy if we don't take advantage of having passed an \nimmigration bill out of the Senate.''\n  I don't always agree with the president of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, but he is right. Not only is this inaction damaging the \nRepublican Party politically, it is also inflicting needless damage to \nour economy. Our GDP could be growing by over 3 percent by passing this \nbill--more than any Republican tax cut or Democratic spending proposal. \nBut Steve King says no and Speaker Boehner abandons ship.\n  Mario Diaz-Balart, another Republican working to pass immigration \nreform, said that Republicans need a deadline to get moving on \nimmigration reform and that if no action was taken by the August \nrecess, the Republican brand would be damaged with Latino voters for \nyears to come.\n  Has Speaker Boehner said: Fine, we will schedule a vote before August \nrecess? No, he has not. There is no sign that anything will ever be \ndone on immigration reform. Even with the very small, microscopic \nmeasure known as the ENLIST Act, which would let certain immigrant \nyouth earn legal status by joining the military, the House has refused \nto consider this so far as part of the Defense authorization bill.\n\n  Republicans keep trying to place the blame on the President, saying \nhe can't be entrusted to enforce any laws. We believe that is a phony \nexcuse, but if that is really their problem, let's pass a bill now and \ndelay implementation until 2017. I would support that. And then we \nwould have no President Obama enforcing any of these laws. Let's call \ntheir bluff. Is it Obama? Is he the problem? Then pass a bill where he \ncan't enforce any of these laws. We can come to a reluctant agreement \non that. If Republicans can't agree to pass a bill that goes into \neffect after the President's term, then we know that mistrust of the \nPresident is nothing but a straw man.\n  Let's be honest about what is happening right now. Republicans are \ncurrently doing nothing on immigration reform because they don't want \nto rock the boat with primaries happening in Georgia, Pennsylvania, \nKentucky, Virginia, and other key States that are occurring between now \nand early June. But we can't keep having broken families living under a \nbroken system forever without any idea of when Congress might act to \nfinally provide badly needed reform.\n  So today I wish to be clear on what our window is for the House to \npass immigration reform. It is the window between early June and the \nAugust recess. So today I am saying to Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, \nand other Republican leaders who refuse to schedule a vote on \nimmigration reform during this window between early June and the August \nrecess, it will not pass until 2017 at the earliest. I believe it will \nthen pass in 2017 after Republicans take a shellacking in the \nPresidential and congressional elections. But in the meantime, if \nimmigration reform is not passed during this window, Republicans will \nhave to admit that Steve King controls the Republican Party platform on \nimmigration. If nothing happens during this window, it will be clear \nthat this occurred because Steve King calls the shots and he has won \nthe immigration debate among the House Republicans. Whatever their \nsupposed excuse for inaction, inaction is consent to Steve King's point \nof view.\n  Where are the leaders in the House--the Republican Party--with the \ncourage to stand up to Steve King and the far right and say: Enough is \nenough. We will not let our party be hijacked by extremists whose \nxenophobia causes them to prefer maintaining a broken system over \nachieving a tough, fair, and practical long-term solution.\n  Make no mistake about it. Immigration reform will pass either this \nyear with bipartisan support and a bipartisan imprint or it will pass \nin a future year with only Democratic support and Democratic imprint \nbecause Democrats will control Congress and the White House simply \nbecause Republicans have failed to pass immigration reform.\n  In the meantime, the President would be more than justified in acting \nanytime after recess begins to make whatever changes he feels necessary \nto make our immigration system work better for those unfairly burdened \nby our broken laws. If House Republicans refuse to act, it is incumbent \non all of us to look at all the areas where we can act administratively \nto fix our broken system.\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\n  I hope immigration reform passes this year.\n  I see my two colleagues from Arizona who worked so long and hard and \ncourageously and pulled the bill further away from what many Democrats \nmight want, but they knew that America and their State of Arizona \ndemanded a solution. Let's rally to their side. Let's rally to the side \nof all Americans, a majority of Democrats, Independents, and \nRepublicans, all of whom want comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I hope immigration reform passes this year because our broken \nfamilies, our economy, and our country so badly need it. Let's hope the \nHouse finally stops talking and starts acting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis 5-minute speech.\n  I am pleased to join today with my friend and colleague Senator Flake \nto express support for this diverse and historic slate of nominees to \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.\n  Between today and tomorrow, the Senate will hopefully vote to confirm \nsix judges to the Federal court in Arizona, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting these nominees.\n  I am very pleased to have worked with my colleague Senator Flake. \nTogether we have put together a group of people who have devoted their \ntime and effort in our State, who represent the best and the brightest \nlegal minds and judicial experience in our State on a bipartisan basis, \nand we acted, very frankly, on the unanimous recommendation of this \ngroup of outstanding citizens of Arizona who put forth these \nrecommendations.\n  I am very proud that some of these nominees are indeed historic, \nincluding the fact that one of the nominees, Diane Humetewa, has an \nimpressive legal background ranging from work as a prosecutor and \nappellate court judge to the Hopi nation. She served the U.S. attorney \nfor the District of Arizona. And hers is a historic nomination. If \nconfirmed, Diane Humetewa will be the first Native American woman to \never serve on the Federal bench, and we are very proud of her and the \nother five.\n  The Federal district court of Arizona has been under tremendous \nstrain these past few years, and the confirmation of these six judges \nwill be a great relief to an overburdened court, one which is \nconsistently ranked as one of the top 10 busiest in the country. Of the \n13 authorized judgeships for this court, 6 are currently vacant. This, \ntogether with the large caseload, led the District of Arizona to \ndeclare a judicial emergency in 2011. This has created an untenable \nsituation for the court in Arizona, and the confirmation of these \nnominees is critical to ensure that the administration of justice is \ntimely and fair for the people of Arizona.\n  The slate of nominees before the Senate, as I mentioned earlier, is \nthe product of consensus, cooperation, and careful deliberation, \nselected with the help of a nonpartisan judiciary evaluation \ncommission. They saw overwhelming support in the Judiciary Committee \nhere in the Senate, and the brief descriptions that follow only begin \nto capture the breadth of these nominees' experiences and the depth of \ntheir commitment to our legal system.\n  Judge Steven Logan has already proved to be an asset to the district \ncourt in Arizona, where he currently serves as a magistrate judge. That \nexperience, together with his work as an immigration judge and military \ntrial judge, makes him uniquely qualified to serve as an article III \njudge.\n  John Tuchi currently serves as chief assistant to the U.S. attorney \nand has the qualifications to be a district judge based in part on his \ndedication to public service, extensive trial experience, and practice \nbefore Federal courts.\n  Judge Douglas Rayes, also nominated for the Phoenix Division, \ncurrently serves as a Maricopa County superior court judge, where he \nhas presided over thousands of cases in family law, criminal law, and \ncomplex litigation. Together with 18 years in private practice, Judge \nRayes' experience and insight will be valuable to the Federal court.\n\n  Rosemary Marquez has worked as a public defender and prosecutor as \nwell as in private practice. Her extensive experience working in border \ndistricts and her Hispanic heritage will be invaluable assets to the \nFederal court.\n  Lastly, Judge James Soto, whose experience includes running a private \npractice that covered a broad array of commercial, civil, and criminal \ncases and service on the Santa Cruz County Superior Court, together \nwith an understanding of issues important to border communities, have \nprepared him to serve ably as a district judge in Tucson.\n  Each of these nominees has shown commitment to justice, public \nservice, and the people of Arizona. Each also has demonstrated the \njudicial temperament and professional demeanor necessary to serve in \nthis capacity with integrity. I urge my colleagues to support these \nnominees--the three we are voting on today and hopefully the three who \nwill be voted on tomorrow morning--by voting yes for cloture and for \nfinal confirmation.\n  I again wish to thank all those individuals who were a part of the \ncommission that came up with these recommendations. I wish to thank my \nfriend and colleague Senator Flake, also a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for the important role he played in bringing these nominees \nbefore the Senate. I am confident they will serve the State of Arizona \nwith honor and distinction. I would also point out that some of these \nnominees may not be of the same party as Senator Flake and me and there \nmay not be specific agreements on every issue and position that these \nnominees have taken, but I am confident of their ability to serve this \nNation and the people of Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the senior Senator from Arizona Mr. McCain for the \nwork he has done to bring this panel forward with six judges to be \nconfirmed this week. That is a big deal, a big deal for any State, and \nfor a State such as Arizona that has had such a shortage for so long, \nthis is particularly important. I just want to say a few words about \nthe three judges we will vote on after I speak: Judge Steven Logan, \nJohn Tuchi, and Diane Humetewa.\n  Judge Logan has a distinguished record in the military, where he \nearned a Bronze Star among many other honors. In discussing his \nmilitary service at his nomination hearing, one of his statements stuck \nout because it exemplifies his dedication for the rule of law and his \nfitness to be a district judge. He said:\n\n       The rule of law in the United States is very, very \n     important. I have seen what happens in a country, two \n     countries in particular--\n\n  He is referring to Iran and Afghanistan--\n\n     when there is no rule of law that is active.\n\n  Judge Logan will bring this important perspective to the bench, as \nwell as insights he has gained as an assistant U.S. attorney, both in \nMinnesota and in Arizona. He is familiar with immigration issues as \nwell, which provide the bulk of the cases he will be looking at as a \ndistrict court judge.\n  Mr. Tuchi has a long career as a prosecutor, having served the bulk \nof his career in the Arizona U.S. attorney's office from 1998 until \nnow. He is presently serving as chief assistant U.S. attorney, where he \noversees civil and criminal personnel operations. In 2009 he served as \ninterim U.S. attorney for several months. He began his legal career as \na judicial clerk in the Ninth Circuit, and I think he is going to make \na stellar district court judge as well.\n  Ms. Humetewa, similar to Judge Logan, has served as both a prosecutor \nand a judge, serving in the Arizona U.S. attorney's office as an \nassistant U.S. attorney and then as a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney \nfor Arizona from 2007 to 2009. She was also acting chief prosecutor for \nthe Hopi Tribe and appellate court judge for the tribe. As Senator \nMcCain noted earlier, she will be the first Native American woman to \nserve on the Federal bench. I know her varied experience as a judge and \nprosecutor will serve her well in this capacity.\n  Let me just say what a thrill it was to be on the Judiciary Committee \nand have all six of these prospective judges come with their families \nand talk about their experience and how it would relate to their new \nrole if they were to be confirmed. It was great to\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\nbe there to see Diane Humetewa and family and note that on the \nreservation there were many other family members watching that hearing \nbeing streamed and being proud that the first female Native American \nwould be on the Federal bench. What a great occasion, what a great \nevent to witness, and it speaks well for not only her qualifications \nbut the qualifications of the others as well.\n  We look forward in the coming days--hopefully tomorrow--to vote on \nJudge Rayes as well as Rosemary Marquez. Senator McCain mentioned Judge \nSoto. I have had the honor of getting to know Judge Soto and his family \na bit. He served 13 years on the County of Santa Cruz's Superior Court \nand is currently a presiding judge. The comment in the confirmation \nhearing that came up is that the people of Santa Cruz County are going \nto be sad to lose him as a judge; he has been great there, and he will \nbe a great district court judge.\n  I am so happy to go through this process. This is my first time, \nbeing relatively new to this position, of nominating judges and going \nthrough the confirmation process. It was a pleasure working with \nSenator McCain and with the White House and the President in bringing \nthese nominations forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote both for cloture and for final \nconfirmation of these three judges today and hopefully the other three \ntomorrow or later. I appreciate the President making these nominations. \nArizona has waited a long time to fill these judgeships and we are \npleased to do so this week.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              A New Normal\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I sorrowfully rise this morning to take \nnote of the sad state to which this great deliberative body has fallen, \nand I do so reluctantly because I must specifically criticize the \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate for bringing this body to what many \nhistorians observe is a new low in terms of our ability to move \nlegislation and our ability to have open debate and open amendments in \nthe Senate.\n  We see what has become a new normal in the Senate. Earlier this week \na bipartisan and popular piece of legislation on energy efficiency was \nderailed by the majority leader's resistance to the open amendment \nprocess. Certainly, it is not only members of my party, it is not only \npersons on my side of the aisle who have concluded this. There was a \nvery scathing opinion piece on the editorial page of the Wall Street \nJournal this morning entitled ``Harry Reid's Senate Blockade.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this opinion piece printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Harry Reid's Senate Blockade\n\n       The U.S. Senate failed to advance another piece of popular \n     bipartisan legislation late Monday, and the reason tells the \n     real story of Washington gridlock in the current Congress. To \n     wit, Harry Reid has essentially shut down the Senate as a \n     place to debate and vote on policy.\n       The Majority Leader's strategy was once again on display as \n     the Senate failed to get the 60 votes to move a popular \n     energy efficiency bill co-sponsored by New Hampshire Democrat \n     Jeanne Shaheen and Ohio Republican Rob Portman. Mr. Reid \n     blamed the defeat on Republican partisanship. But the impasse \n     really came down to Mr. Reid's blockade against amendments \n     that might prove politically difficult for Democrats.\n       The Nevadan used parliamentary tricks to block energy-\n     related amendments to an energy bill. This blockade is now \n     standard procedure as he's refused to allow a vote on all but \n     nine GOP amendments since last July. Mr. Reid is worried that \n     some of these amendments might pass with support from \n     Democrats, thus embarrassing a White House that opposes them.\n       In the case of Portman-Shaheen, Republicans had prepared \n     amendments to speed up exports of liquefied natural gas; to \n     object to a new national carbon tax; to rein in the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's war on coal plants; and to \n     authorize the Keystone XL pipeline. A majority of the public \n     supports these positions and many Democrats from right-\n     leaning or energy-producing states claim to do the same. The \n     bill against the EPA's coal-plant rules is co-sponsored by \n     West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin.\n       Yet the White House and Mr. Reid's dominant liberal wing \n     won't take the chance that a bipartisan coalition might pass \n     these amendments, most of which the House has passed or soon \n     would. President Obama would thus face a veto decision that \n     would expose internal Democratic divisions. So Mr. Reid shut \n     down the amendment process. Republicans then responded by \n     refusing to provide the 60 votes necessary to clear a \n     filibuster and vote on the underlying bill.\n       It's important to understand how much Mr. Reid's tactics \n     have changed the Senate. Not too long ago it was understood \n     that any Senator could get a floor vote if he wanted it. The \n     minority party, often Democrats, used this right of amendment \n     to sponsor votes that would sometimes put the majority on the \n     spot. It's called politics, rightly understood. This meant \n     the Senate debated national priorities and worked its \n     bipartisan will. Harry Reid's Senate has become a deliberate \n     obstacle to democratic accountability.\n       And speaking of accountability, every supposedly pro-energy \n     Democrat supported Mr. Reid in his amendment blockade. That \n     includes Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu, who is running TV \n     ads back home attacking the Obama Administration energy \n     policies that Mr. Reid is protecting from bipartisan majority \n     rejection. She still claims to support a vote on the Keystone \n     XL pipeline, and she blamed Republicans for not going along \n     with Mr. Reid's vague assurance that he would allow a stand-\n     alone vote on Keystone later this month.\n       But why not force the vote now? If Ms. Landrieu really had \n     Keystone as a top priority, as she claims, she'd have joined \n     Republicans in demanding an immediate amendment to a bill \n     that she knows the White House is reluctant to veto. And \n     she'd have insisted that Mr. Reid allow a 50-vote threshold \n     for passage, rather than Mr. Reid's 60-vote supermajority.\n       Ms. Landrieu instead is playing Mr. Reid's double game, \n     demanding a Keystone vote even as she undermines its passage. \n     She is running for election by boasting about her clout as \n     the new Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, but she is \n     so ineffectual that she can't get her own party to allow a \n     vote on what she claims is one of her top priorities.\n       The lesson for voters is simple: If they want anything \n     meaningful done in the last two years of the Obama \n     Administration, they will have to elect a Republican Senate.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. I will quote at length from the Wall Street Journal this \nmorning, because in mentioning this popular piece of legislation, the \neditorial gets right to the point. It says:\n\n     . . . the reason [the bill failed this week] tells the real \n     story of Washington gridlock in the current Congress. To wit, \n     Harry Reid has essentially shut down the Senate as a place to \n     debate and vote on policy.\n\n  I absolutely agree. Additionally, the editorial says:\n\n       The Majority Leader's strategy was once again on display as \n     the Senate failed to get the 60 votes to move the popular \n     energy efficiency bill co-sponsored by New Hampshire Democrat \n     Jeanne Shaheen and Ohio Republican Rob Portman. Mr. Reid \n     blamed it on Republican partisanship. But the impasse really \n     came down to Mr. Reid's blockade against amendments that \n     might prove politically difficult for Democrats.\n\n  Once again, the majority leader has made it clear he doesn't intend \nto let the Senate work its will on amendments. Instead, the new normal \nis that the majority leader comes to the floor and says: If the bill is \nworded as I think it should be, if we can come to an agreement with how \nit should be written, I will bring it to the floor and we can vote it \nup or down. But this idea of amendments, that is unacceptable to the \nmajority leader, and it is a complete departure from the way this \nSenate has operated for decades and decades on important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  I would point out that in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the \nmajor accomplishments of the Congress in the 20th century, there were \n115 amendments called up during its consideration. The leadership \ndidn't know how those votes would turn out. They had probably done a \nwhip count and they had a decent idea, but the idea was the Senate was \ngoing to be allowed to vote up or down with the light shining on the \nprocess and the American people seeing how their elected Senators felt \non that issue. There were 115 amendments called up during the \nconsideration of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The Panama Canal Treaty \nof 1978 was another major piece of deliberative work that was done by \nthe Senate. There was a total of 89 amendments offered to the Panama \nCanal Treaty. Those amendments were called up and debated in the clear \nlight of day. Votes were held and the American people\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\nfound out how their elected representatives in the Senate felt about \nthose amendments. This week and for the last 52 weeks that has not been \nthe case with the majority leader currently in power in the Senate.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal goes on to say that the majority leader\n\n     . . . used parliamentary tricks to block energy-related \n     amendments to an energy bill. This blockade is now standard \n     procedure as he's refused to allow a vote on all but nine GOP \n     amendments since last July. Mr. Reid is worried that some of \n     these amendments might pass with support from Democrats, thus \n     embarrassing a White House that opposes them.\n\n  I wish to point out that during the time when Republicans--in this \nsupposedly greatest deliberative body in the world--have been given \nnine amendments over the last year, Republicans, which hold the \nmajority in the House of Representatives, have given their Democratic \ncolleagues 125 minority votes. This is in a House which routinely shuts \ndown debate, has a rules committee, and historically limits the number \nof amendments and the number of votes. Minority Members in the House \nhave had 125 votes during that same time period. This Senate has \nallowed minority Members nine votes during that same period of time, \nand that is an outrage, which the Wall Street Journal continues to \npoint out.\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       In the case of Portman-Shaheen, Republicans had prepared \n     amendments to speed up exports of liquefied natural gas; to \n     object to a new national carbon tax; to rein in the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's war on coal plants; and to \n     authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n  I believe these amendments were good amendments. I would have voted \nfor them. The case could be made on the other side of the aisle that \nthey were bad policy. But make the case. Let elected Senators from \nNorth Dakota, Mississippi, and all across the United States of America \nbe heard and vote the wishes of their particular constituencies on \nthese issues. Instead, the majority shut down these amendments.\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       Yet the White House and Mr. Reid's dominant liberal wing \n     won't take the chance that a bipartisan coalition might pass \n     these amendments, most of which the House has passed or soon \n     would. President Obama would thus face a veto decision that \n     would expose internal Democratic divisions. So Mr. Reid shut \n     down the amendment process.\n\n  As I said, he has shut down the amendment process in every case \nexcept for nine lonely votes.\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       It's important to understand how much Mr. Reid's tactics \n     have changed the Senate. Not too long ago it was understood \n     that any Senator could get a floor vote if he wanted it. The \n     minority party, often Democrats, used this right of amendment \n     to sponsor votes that would sometimes put the majority on the \n     spot. It's called politics, rightly understood. This meant \n     the Senate debated national priorities and worked its \n     bipartisan will. Harry Reid's Senate has become a deliberate \n     obstacle to democratic accountability.\n\n  And sadly so, I might add.\n  This Harry Reid gag rule is new to the Senate. We have had a number \nof distinguished majority leaders whose names will go down in history \nas the giants and statesmen of our time, and they did not resort to \nthis gag rule. This is largely a Harry Reid invention.\n  I will give the facts. Mr. Reid has used the gag rule to fill the \namendment tree--which is a parliamentary term. He has used his gag rule \nto cut off amendments 85 times, more than twice the number of the \nprevious six leaders combined, and these were Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  Senator Dole invoked the procedural tactic only seven times. Senator \nRobert Byrd, a giant, a historian, and an expert in the use of Senate \nrules, invoked it only three times. Senator Mitchell of Maine invoked \nit 3 times; Senator Lott, 11 times; Senator Daschle, 1 time; and \nSenator Frist, 15 times. Yet time after time--some 85 times--this \nmajority leader has decided that the Senate doesn't have a right--that \nthe people of Mississippi and the people of North Dakota don't have a \nright--for their Senators to come up and offer an idea and let it rise \nor fall based on whether it is good policy or not. This is an outrage \nthat the people of the United States need to understand.\n  It seems past majority leaders, when entrusted with protecting this \ninstitution, recognized that the gag rule should be used sparingly. Its \ncurrent abuse undermines the Senate's ability to address pressing \nnational issues and to carry on the tradition of debate that has always \ndefined this body. That really cannot be denied.\n  Senator Robert Byrd, who I alluded to earlier, called the Senate \n``the last bastion of minority rights.'' That was true during \nDemocratic majorities when Senator Byrd was the majority leader. Sadly, \nit is not the case any longer.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial--I would commend it to the \nattention of anyone within the sound of my voice--concludes this:\n\n       The lesson for voters is simple: If they want anything \n     meaningful done in the last two years of the Obama \n     Administration, they will have to elect a Republican Senate.\n\n  Those are the words of the Wall Street Journal and not my words.\n  What has become of the Senate under this Harry Reid gag rule is \nunconscionable. It should be reversed and Senators of both parties \nshould stand in resistance to the idea that we cannot offer amendments \nand have them debated as they have always been debated in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this week, we are voting to overcome \nRepublican filibusters of seven highly qualified judicial nominees. \nEvery single one of the nominees we will be voting on this week has \nbeen nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy. This means that \nthe nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has designated \nthem as emergency vacancies due to high caseloads. We continue to seek \nconsent from Republicans to vote on much needed judges to our Federal \njudiciary, and yet they continue to refuse. Republicans have objected \nto moving to a vote on every single judicial nominee this year. I can \nonly hope that they will eventually come to see the error of their \nways.\n  Before proceeding with the qualifications of these judicial nominees, \nI would again like to clarify and address some questions regarding the \nnomination of David Barron. Mr. Barron has been nominated to fill a \nvacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. There have \nbeen press accounts that have inaccurately stated what the \nadministration has made available for Senators to review relevant to \nthis nomination. As I said last week, the administration has made \navailable unredacted copies of any memo issued by Mr. Barron regarding \nthe potential use of lethal force against Anwar Al-Awlaki. This week, \nthe administration has made clear that this material included all \nwritten legal advice by Mr. Barron regarding potential use of lethal \nforce against U.S. citizens in counterterrorism operations. Senators \ntherefore have had the opportunity to conduct their due diligence \nbefore voting on this nomination.\n  In an Internet post titled ``Why Civil Libertarians and Drone Critics \nShould Support David Barron,'' Georgetown Law Professor David Cole--one \nof the foremost critics of the administration over its failure to \npublicly disclose legal material addressing the use of lethal force \nagainst U.S. citizens--has stated:\n\n       It is a mistake to conflate the issues of the appointment \n     of David Barron and disclosure of the memos. Barron is a \n     highly qualified lawyer who I know personally to be \n     thoughtful, considerate, open-minded, and brilliant. His \n     confirmation would put in place a judge who will be \n     absolutely vigilant in his protection of civil liberties and \n     his insistence that executive power be constrained by the \n     rule of law. That long-term value should not be sacrificed \n     because of a short-term battle over memos that every Senator \n     already has the opportunity to review.\n\n  Professor Cole is right. I have personally pressed the administration \nfor greater transparency on these matters as well, but that is a \nseparate debate and we should not be waging it at the expense of \nharming our Federal judiciary and denying the American people an \nindividual who will make a first-rate judge. Not only is this tactic \nunwise, but it also does not help advance the cause of those who are \nseeking public disclosure of the memos. As Professor Cole has further \nexplained:\n\n       [H]olding up Barron's nomination is unlikely to expedite \n     disclosure of the memos. It will only undermine the \n     confirmation of someone who would make an excellent judge. \n     The Administration has been ordered (unanimously) to release \n     the memo, and will in short order either comply with that \n     order or seek further review. Barron has no control over that \n     decision, and should not be held hostage to it . . .\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\n       I am second to none in my support for transparency. And I \n     will continue to fight for that value on its own terms. But \n     it is a huge mistake to let our legitimate concerns about \n     transparency get in the way of the confirmation of a judge \n     who will faithfully protect our liberties and hold government \n     accountable--especially when the Senate already has been \n     given access to all the information they need to exercise \n     their ``advise and consent'' role.\n\n  I agree completely with Professor Cole, and I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record the full posting after my remarks.\n  I would further ask unanimous consent to include a joint op-ed in the \nBoston Globe by Harvard Law professors Charles Fried and Laurence \nTribe--two legal luminaries who often disagree in their views on the \nConstitution and other legal issues. As the two of them have written:\n\n       The nation badly needs the best possible judges--men and \n     women of integrity, intelligence, judicial temperament, \n     respect for the rule of law, and an understanding of the role \n     of judges within our legal system. Barron understands and \n     exemplifies those values. He should be released from the \n     destructive tangle in which he has become quite undeservedly \n     enmeshed and placed on the First Circuit Court of Appeals \n     where he can serve our nation with great distinction.\n\n  We should proceed to Mr. Barron's nomination and confirm him so he \ncan get to work on behalf of the American people. Delays are simply \ndepriving the Federal judiciary and all Americans of a tremendous \npublic servant.\n  This week, we will proceed to vote to end filibusters on the \nfollowing seven nominations:\n  Judge Gregg Costa has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas. He \nhas served since 2012 as a U.S. district judge in the Southern District \nof Texas. He previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the \nSouthern District of Texas from 2005 to 2012. He worked in private \npractice as an associate at Weil, Gotshal & Manges from 2002 to 2005. \nAfter graduating from law school, he served as a law clerk to Judge \nRaymond Randolph of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit from \n1999 to 2000 and to Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States from 2001 to 2002.

Rand Paul has an op-ed in the New York Times today \n     opposing the nomination of David J. Barron to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the First Circuit until the memos Barron wrote \n     concerning the legality of the targeted killing of US citizen \n     Anwar Al-Awlaki are publically released. The ACLU has also \n     urged that Barron's nomination be delayed until Senators are \n     allowed to read all targeted killing memos written by Barron. \n     I have been as much a critic of the drones program as Sen. \n     Paul, and have written often about my critiques of both the \n     apparent scope of the program and the lack of transparency \n     surrounding it. (See here, here & here). I continue to \n     support transparency. But it would be a terrible mistake to \n     hold up David Barron's nomination over this issue.\n       First, and most importantly, it is a mistake to conflate \n     the issues of the appointment of David Barron and disclosure \n     of the memos. Barron is a highly qualified lawyer who I know \n     personally to be thoughtful, considerate, open-minded, and \n     brilliant. His confirmation would put in place a judge who \n     will be absolutely vigilant in his protection of civil \n     liberties and his insistence that executive power be \n     constrained by the rule of law. That long-term value should \n     not be sacrificed because of a short-term battle over memos \n     that every Senator already has the opportunity to review.\n       There can be no doubt that Barron would be an excellent \n     independent judge, and would faithfully exercise his \n     authority to protect Americans' rights and to keep government \n     honest and constrained. As former judge and now Stanford Law \n     Professor Michael McConnell has noted, Barron ``has supported \n     efforts to adopt laws to enable judicial review of executive \n     actions that might otherwise escape judicial review because \n     of lack of standing, and has written powerfully about the \n     need for constitutional limits on executive excesses.'' \n     Indeed, as head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 2009, \n     Barron himself withdrew five OLC memos written during the \n     prior administration to authorize controversial interrogation \n     techniques such as waterboarding. And fellow Harvard Law \n     Professor John F. Manning, a conservative who clerked for \n     Judge Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia, has accurately \n     described Barron as ``undeniably brilliant'' and ``an \n     unusually talented and careful lawyer'' who will ``understand \n     and faithfully carry out the duties of a circuit judge.''\n       Second, the administration has in fact made available to \n     all Senators any and all memos Barron wrote concerning the \n     targeting of al-Awlaki--the core of the issue Sen. Paul is \n     concerned about. So if Sen. Paul and any other Senator want \n     to review Barron's reasoning in full, they are free to do so. \n     Moreover, the administration also made available to the \n     Senate, and ultimately to the public, a ``White Paper'' said \n     to be drawn from the Barron memo (though written long after \n     he left office). Thus, no Senator need be in the dark about \n     the Administration's reasoning, and the public also has a \n     pretty good idea as well.\n       Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \n     recently ruled that a redacted version of the al-Awlaki memo \n     can and should be disclosed, largely because much of its \n     reasoning had already been made public in the White Paper. \n     Thus, while I fully support the public disclosure of the \n     memo, redacted to protect sources and methods, every Senator \n     already has full access to the memo, and therefore can make \n     an informed judgment on advice and consent. And the public \n     also has a good sense of what it says.\n       Notably, Senators Ron Wyden, Mark Udall, and Martin \n     Heinrich, all members of the Intelligence Committee, wrote a \n     letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in November 2013, \n     after reviewing the memo on the killing of al-Awlaki, and \n     stating their view the killing was ``a legitimate use of the \n     authority granted to the President.'' They went on to urge \n     the administration to be more forthcoming about the legal \n     limits on the use of force against U.S. persons in other \n     cases, beyond what the memo apparently had sanctioned, but \n     did not question the legality of the action authorized.\n       Sen. Paul's op-ed notes that the Office of Legal Counsel \n     may have written more than one memo on targeted killing, \n     which is quite possible. But the administration has disclosed \n     to the Senators the full, unredacted versions of any memo \n     authorizing the killing of Americans, the issue Sen. Paul \n     raises in his op-ed.\n       Finally, holding up Barron's nomination is unlikely to \n     expedite disclosure of the memos. It will only undermine the \n     confirmation of someone who would make an excellent judge. \n     The Administration has been ordered (unanimously) to release \n     the memo, and will in short order either comply with that \n     order or seek further review. Barron has no control over that \n     decision, and should not be held hostage to it.\n       I am second to none in my support for transparency. And I \n     will continue to fight for that value on its own terms. But \n     it is a huge mistake to let our legitimate concerns about \n     transparency get in the way of the confirmation of a judge \n     who will faithfully protect our liberties and hold government \n     accountable--especially when the Senate already has been \n     given access to all the information they need to exercise \n     their ``advise and consent'' role. As a civil libertarian and \n     drone critic, I have no hesitation in saying that David \n     Barron should be confirmed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, May 13, 2014]\n\n       David Barron Should Be Confirmed to U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n                (By Charles Fried and Laurence H. Tribe)\n\n       Although the two of us frequently approach legal questions \n     from different perspectives, and just as often disagree about \n     the best answers to those questions, we share a respect for \n     our Constitution and a reverence for the judicial process. \n     That's why, in spite of our disagreements, we agree that \n     Harvard Law School professor David Barron is exceptionally \n     well-qualified to hold a seat on the US Court of Appeals for \n     the First Circuit and that the Senate should promptly confirm \n     him.\n       No one can reasonably question Barron's intelligence, the \n     high quality of his scholarship, his judicial temperament, \n     his deep respect for the rule of law, or his personal \n     integrity and devotion to public service. Barron (who is \n     married to Juliette Kayyem, a Democratic gubernatorial \n     candidate and former Globe columnist) is a brilliant lawyer \n     who will make an excellent judge.\n       Though some conservatives oppose his embrace of what they \n     call ``progressive constitutionalism,'' and some civil \n     libertarians worry about the secrecy of memoranda he signed \n     as head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel \n     regarding the legality of using lethal force against a \n     specific US citizen who was an operational leader of an enemy \n     force, neither of these concerns justifies delaying a vote, \n     or denying Barron a seat on the First Circuit.\n       Any description of Barron as ``an unabashed proponent of \n     judicial activism'' is a caricature that demonstrates a lack \n     of familiarity with serious debate over constitutional \n     issues. What is clear to us is that Barron would decide cases \n     based solely on the relevant sources of legal authority, \n     including binding precedent, and that his political views \n     would in no way distort his legal judgment. We will have \n     reached a tragic turning point if people are disqualified \n     from holding judicial office when they have thought deeply \n     about the issues and expressed their views in public.\n       There is nothing in Barron's record, or in our many years \n     of personal interactions with him, that would lead us to \n     believe that he is anything other than a straight shooter, \n     thoroughly committed to applying rules of law dispassionately \n     and unflinchingly, and without political consideration. \n     That's what judges should and must do, whatever their \n     philosophical bent.\n       Beyond the fight over judicial philosophy, Barron's \n     nomination has encountered resistance because of his \n     authorship of opinions in the Office of Legal Counsel \n     surrounding the legality of using lethal force against Anwar \n     al-Awlaki, a US citizen who was killed by a drone strike in \n     Yemen in 2011. Some have argued that the Senate should not \n     vote to confirm Barron until its members review the OLC \n     memos, but that point is now moot because the White House has \n     made unredacted versions available to every senator. Others \n     have argued that the Senate should not vote until a redacted \n     version of the principal Awlaki memo is made public, as a \n     court of appeals recently held it must be. That is an issue \n     subject to ongoing litigation and of no relevance to Barron's \n     nomination. He left public service four years ago and has \n     nothing to do with administration policies on the release of \n     sensitive information. In any event, it is likely that the \n     memos will be released in short order: Either the \n     administration will not appeal the court's ruling, or the \n     ruling will be upheld on appeal. Without doubt,\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\n     holding up Barron's nomination will not expedite the release \n     of any memo.\n       We agree it is entirely appropriate for Congress to \n     consider carefully the legal framework for drone strikes, \n     although we may reach different conclusions on that score. \n     But it would inflict grave harm on the confirmation process \n     and on our ability to recruit the best persons to the federal \n     judiciary if Barron's nomination to the First Circuit were \n     allowed to become collateral damage in this debate. The \n     pertinent question cannot be whether any senator agrees or \n     disagrees with any particular use of force or with whether \n     the administration should or should not release documents. \n     Barron didn't order the strikes or design the legal framework \n     for their authorization. Indeed we do not know whether he \n     personally agrees with that policy, the wisdom and morality \n     of which it was not his job to assess. And he has not \n     advocated, much less ordered, the withholding of any \n     documents. His job as acting head of the Office of Legal \n     Counsel was to provide thorough, accurate, and unvarnished \n     legal opinions to the president and other executive \n     officials, based on the traditional legal authorities of \n     text, history, and precedent. We have every reason to believe \n     that is precisely what he did, and there is absolutely no \n     evidence to the contrary.\n       The nation badly needs the best possible judges--men and \n     women of integrity, intelligence, judicial temperament, \n     respect for the rule of law, and an understanding of the role \n     of judges within our legal system. Barron understands and \n     exemplifies those values. He should be released from the \n     destructive tangle in which he has become quite undeservedly \n     enmeshed and placed on the First Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     where he can serve our nation with great distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S2993-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I think my colleagues know, this is \nNational Police Week. I know I express the sentiment of every Member of \nthis body who wishes to show their appreciation for the 900,000 \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement officers who literally put \ntheir lives on the line every day to keep us safe. We cannot thank them \nenough, but we can help them by our actions. In 2013 there were 105 who \nlost their lives in the line of duty, so obviously this is a matter \nthat requires the attention of the Senate.\n  Let me cite the most recent casualty in the State of Maryland. On \nAugust 28, 2013, Baltimore County police officer Jason Schneider, who \nwas only 36 years of age, was shot and killed while serving a search \nwarrant at a home on Roberts Avenue in Catonsville at approximately 5 \no'clock in the morning. Officer Schneider was part of a tactical team \nthat had entered the house in search of a juvenile subject wanted in \nrelation to a shooting of the previous week. The entry team encountered \nfour subjects inside the house who attempted to flee. Officer Schneider \nwas pursuing a subject toward the rear of the house when another \nsubject attacked him and opened fire, striking him several times. \nDespite being mortally wounded, Officer Schneider returned fire and \nkilled the subject. Officer Schneider is survived by his wife and two \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, that story was told 105 other times in 2013 with law \nenforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty.\n  I have introduced legislation--S. 357--which provides for a national \nblue alert. I think most Members are familiar with AMBER alerts. It \nmeans the\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nrapid dissemination of information to help law enforcement. Well, a \nblue alert would deal with an officer who has been assaulted, attacked, \nor killed.\n  Law enforcement will tell us rapid dissemination is the most \nimportant part of law enforcement. So it is critically important that \ninformation be made available.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. I originally filed the bill with Senator \nGraham, and I appreciate his help.\n  Senator Leahy has been a real champion. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I can't thank him enough for his help with this legislation \nand the work he has done on behalf of law enforcement.\n  Senator McConnell today in his leader time discussed that this week \nis National Police Week and mentioned he is a cosponsor of the \nlegislation I am referring to and urged that this is the type of bill \nwe need to pass.\n  Senator Blunt is on the floor. I thank him very much. He has been a \nreal leader in regards to law enforcement issues and Blue Alert.\n  This bill passed with 406 votes in the House of Representatives. It \nis a bill which provides for smart ways to help law enforcement. It is \nendorsed and supported by a whole host of groups, including the \nFraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \nConcerns of Police Survivors, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association \nof the New York Police Department. The list goes on and on. So we are \nlooking for a way we can not only express our appreciation to those in \nlaw enforcement but we can tangibly do something to help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent as if in legislative session \nthe Senate proceed to Calendar No. 194, S. 357, the National Blue Alert \nAct; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, per the Senate rules I have submitted a \nletter outlining my reasons for objecting to this, besides it not being \npaid for, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maryland who, \njust as he did when he was in the State legislature and has done every \nsingle day since he has been in the Senate, has been supportive of law \nenforcement and police officers. I am sorry there was an objection.\n  I spoke earlier to my dear friend, the Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nCardin. I told him that earlier today I chaired a hearing on the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Delaware, was there, as were law enforcement \nofficers from Delaware.\n  During that hearing we heard from Officer Ann Carrizales of the \nStafford, TX, police department. This was some of the most powerful \ntestimony I have heard in my almost 40 years on that committee.\n  She was shot in the face and chest during a routine traffic stop last \nyear. She was saved by her protective vest. She returned fire and then \npursued the suspects for 20 miles and ultimately helped a neighboring \npolice jurisdiction apprehend the shooter--a determined police officer, \nformer Marine, mother, and wife.\n  We also heard from a police chief who will be staying here with law \nenforcement during National Police Week. We talked about the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, which Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell--who served in law enforcement, a Republican from \nColorado--and I first introduced, and for decades it has been passed \nunanimously. It saves lives. It is not a luxury item.\n  Last week, I came to the Senate floor, seeking to do what this body \nhas done 3 times before, and that is to reauthorize the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Program. My legislation to renew this life-\nsaving program for another 5 years has the support of every Democrat in \nthe Senate. It is strongly supported by leading law enforcement groups, \nand on a much more personal note, we know that vests provided by this \nprogram have protected thousands of officers and spared their families \nand loved ones from unspeakable grief.\n  Officers like Officer Ann Carrizales. If her story does not inspire \nus all to support brave law enforcement officers by providing them with \nthe most basic protection, then I do not know what could. She brought \nwith her today almost 200 letters from her daughter's elementary \nschool, all calling on the Senate to act. One of the letters I have is \nfrom her daughter MiKayla, talking about what her mother faced. This \nwas powerful testimony.\n  Unfortunately, my efforts to pass this important reauthorization were \nblocked last week by a Republican Senator who seems to think that \nbulletproof vests are a luxury item. Some Republican Senators also \nbelieve that the Federal Government has no role to play in assisting \nlocal law enforcement. I could not disagree more. We in Congress have \nlong supported local law enforcement because we have a duty to keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  Today, during National Police Week, Senators who say they stand with \nlaw enforcement should demonstrate their support and put real meaning \nbehind those words by supporting two important bills. All Senators \nshould support the passage of S. 933, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program Reauthorization Act of 2013. To date, this program has \nenabled over 13,000 State and local law enforcement agencies to \npurchase over 1 million vests. It we act today, this program could help \nprovide more vests to the law enforcement officers who protect us every \nday. We should also pass the National Blue Alert Act, a bill sponsored \nby Senators Cardin and Graham that would create a national alert system \nwhen an officer is injured or killed in the line of duty. We can put \nreal meaning behind our rhetoric. These are commonsense bills and they \nshould be enacted without further delay.\n  Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 162, S. 933, \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of \n2013; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we went through this 10 days ago, and I \ngave a very long and detailed explanation of my objections to this \nbill. I won't belabor that again. But again, we are at the process \nwhere we owe $17 trillion, and we are spending money that we don't have \nin areas that are far lower in priority than this issue.\n  I have no objection, and I think, in terms of bulletproof vests, this \nis actually a great way to protect those who protect us. But again, as \nI stated the last time we had this discussion, under the enumerated \npowers this is the responsibility of the States and local communities. \nOn that basis I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry for that because we will waste \nmore money in 1 or 2 weeks in Afghanistan and Iraq, than this would \ncost for years--years--to protect American law enforcement, police \nofficers who protect us every day.\n  We ought to allow this matter to come to a vote and have everybody \nvote yes or no. The Senator from Vermont would vote yes. I know the \nSenator from Maryland would vote yes, and I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer from Delaware would vote yes, as would every single \nDemocratic Senator, and I believe a number of Republicans would.\n  We will give great speeches this week saying we stand with law \nenforcement. Well, as some say, put up or shut up. Let's stand with \nthem. Let's pass this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about National \nPolice Week. I am pleased to be able to cochair with the Presiding \nOfficer and the Senator from Delaware Mr. Coons the Law Enforcement \nCaucus which we\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\nfounded when we came to the Senate together. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the National Blue Alert Act that Senator Cardin talked \nabout, and I would like to see that done. I think we can do things to \nprovide more safety and security for local police officers as we have \ndone for the fire grants, all those things that followed 911.\n  As I was listening, I was thinking about how much we benefit every \nday from the Capitol Police. We walk by them in their positions \nsecuring these buildings and standing in the way of harm, and we often \nforget they are there for that purpose. When others are able to look \nfor a safer place to be, our police officers run to where the danger \nis. They stand between us and that danger.\n  In the time I have been here, two of our Capitol police officers have \nbeen killed in the building on duty, one just a few feet away from \nwhere my office would be in the next Congress. They were there for us. \nI remember on 9/11 leaving the building with every reason to believe \nthis building could be and perhaps was going to be an immediate target \nto our enemies attacking us that day. I remember walking out of the \nbuilding as the Capitol Police were insisting we get out of the \nbuilding and looking over my shoulder and seeing they were all still in \nthe building.\n  So whether it is the police we see daily here, the police who serve \nus in our communities, or the families who send their loved ones into \nharm's way every day, this is an important time to recognize that \nservice, but also it should be an important time to think about what we \ncould do about it.\n  The National Blue Alert bill doesn't mandate that States create a \nsystem. It simply provides that States could have access to a system \nwhich would create an alert system so that when someone has harmed a \npolice officer, we make a maximum and immediate effort to see that \nperson is apprehended and eventually be called to pay the penalty for \nwhat they have done.\n  We benefit from these people who again run to where the danger is, \nwho stand between us and that which creates danger for us as citizens. \nWhether trying to go to the local grocery store, the local shopping \ncenter or the school play, there is somebody in that community whose \njob it is to make it a safer place than it would otherwise be.\n  I am pleased to have had a chance to work with the Presiding Officer \non so many issues. During National Police Week, I rise with and on \nbehalf of all of our colleagues to say thank you for those who stand to \ndefend and protect us here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of net \nneutrality. Right now there are people who are watching the floor of \nthe Senate streaming live on C-SPAN.org.\n  They might be engaged political junkies or maybe they need something \nto help them take a nap. Let's face it; the action in this most \ndeliberative body can sometimes feel a little slow.\n  Now imagine just a few companies deciding that C-SPAN.org will be put \ninto a slow lane; that the public interest content streamed out to the \nworld will be sent out at an even more deliberative pace, while kitten \nvideos will get priority.\n  When people talk about net neutrality, that is what we are talking \nabout. Instead of open and free Internet where the billions of clicks \nand links made by customers and entrepreneurs in their living rooms and \ngarages determine who wins and loses, it will be just a few companies \nin a few corporate boardrooms deciding who gets into the express lane \nand who falls behind in a traffic jam.\n  We need a truly open Internet because an open Internet has become the \nworld's greatest platform for innovation, job creation, and economic \ngrowth. An open Internet enables freedom of expression and the sharing \nof ideas across town or around the world. An open Internet is driving \neconomic growth in Massachusetts and throughout the United States.\n  Openness is the Internet's heart, nondiscrimination is its soul, and \nany infringements on either of these features undermine the intent of \nnet neutrality.\n  The vitality of this free platform is at stake today because right \nnow our Internet regulators at the FCC are determining how they will \nuse its authority to keep the Internet open for business.\n  When the FCC first unveiled its new Open Internet proposal a few \nweeks ago, the Commission contemplated whether to allow paid \nprioritization. Under these proposed Internet rules of the road, fast \nlanes could open to those who can pay, leaving others stuck in traffic. \nThe result: Consumers could be stuck in an online provider pileup when \na broadband provider decides to slow down a streaming of Netflix's \nHouse of Cards or bring a high-speed Yahoo search to a crawl or block a \nfree online call to a friend abroad. But the worry goes far beyond \nsimply slowing down the videos we watch on YouTube.\n  Without a truly open Internet, startups and small businesses would \nsuffer, slowing our economy and job growth throughout Massachusetts and \naround the country. No one should have to ask permission to innovate. \nBut with fast and slow lanes, that is precisely what an entrepreneur \nwill need to do.\n  Right now the essence of the Internet is to innovate and test new \nideas first. If an idea then takes off, the creator can attract capital \nand expand. The Internet today is a level playing field where the \ncompetition for the best in technology and ideas thrives.\n  Creating Internet fast and slow lanes would flip this process on its \nhead. Instead, an entrepreneur would first need to raise capital in \norder to start innovating, because she would need to pay for fast-lane \naccess to have a chance for her product to be seen and to succeed. Only \nthose with access to deep pockets would develop anything new. Imagine \nthe stifling of creativity if startups need massive amounts of money \neven to innovate. So consider an app developer or creator of a new \nproduct in Boston or throughout the country. How will she reach \npotential customers and viewers if her Web site is stuck on a gravel \npath while those with access to capital whiz by on the interstate as \nthey flash their Internet E-ZPass? She won't reach her customers; only \nthose with money will.\n\n  If you don't believe me, consider the more than 100 tech companies--\nincluding Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and Twitter--that \ncharacterize broadband providers imposing tolls on Internet companies \nas a ``grave threat to the Internet.'' Consider the 50 venture \ncapitalists who wrote to Chairman Wheeler last week and said that with \npaid prioritization, ``an individual in a dorm room or design studio \nwill not be able to experiment out loud on the Internet. The result \nwill be greater conformity, fewer surprises, and less innovation.'' \nLess disruption--less creation of the next big idea. That would be the \nend of the Internet as we know it today.\n  Unfortunately, I have seen this fight before. In 2006, when the open \nInternet was under attack, I introduced the first net neutrality bill \nin the House of Representatives. Today our battle to preserve an open \nand free Internet wages on. That is why last week I joined with 10 of \nmy Senate colleagues to urge Chairman Wheeler to rethink paid \nprioritization and to insist that he explore all options, including \nreclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service.\n  We need to put on the books the strongest open Internet rules as \npossible, and if title II reclassification is the most effective way to \naccomplish this goal, that is what the FCC should do because then it \nwould be treated as a common carrier service. That is how we treat \ntraditional phone service. That, in fact, is what the Internet has \nbecome in the 21st century. You cannot live without it. We have to \ntreat it as such. To be connected in the 21st century, you need \nInternet access. That is why, if needed--and it just might be--title II \nwill have to be the way to go.\n  As one of the primary authors of the 1996 Telecommunications Act--a \nbill that unleashed competition and created hundreds of millions of \ndollars in private investment--I know the FCC has both the power and \nthe responsibility to oversee the operation of broadband networks and \nintervene in its efforts to preserve competition and safeguard \nconsumers. It is time for the FCC to use that power to protect the \ntremendous potential of the Internet.\n  The Internet is a vital tool that helps businesses compete and \nexpand, pumping life into our economy. Again, after\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nthe 1996 act, $1 trillion of private sector investment went into \ndeveloping new companies online, into expanding the Internet. Why? The \ngovernment acted to make sure there was a level playing field in the \n1996 act and then got out of the way and watched the competition \nflourish in this chaotic new world of broadband. There was no YouTube. \nThere was no Google or Amazon. There was no Twitter. There was no \nFacebook. It didn't exist. It could have existed before then but not if \nwe didn't have a flourishing Internet that was wide open for \ncompetition and investment from the private sector.\n  That is why this decision by the Federal Communications Commission is \nso important. It is understanding the very nature of this new \ncommunications job-creating revolution that we have here. We must fight \nto protect it.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me this time, and I yield \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Barrasso pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2339 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to thank Senator Barrasso for his \nleadership on this issue. As a longtime practicing physician before he \ncame to the Senate, he has provided great leadership and expertise and \nis able to evaluate and comment so wisely on the important issue of \nhealth care.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Today, Majority Leader Reid--the leader of the Democratic majority of \nthe Senate--and Senator Chuck Schumer came to the Senate floor to \ndemand that the House of Representatives pass their immigration bill. \nThey labeled Republicans as extremists for not giving in to their \ndemands. And they are correct about one thing: The House is not giving \nin.\n  At this point in time, the House is refusing to yield to the pressure \nof special interest groups and political lobbyists and Senate Democrats \nto pass a bill that would be bad for America. It just will be bad for \nAmerica. So I think once again the special interests will lose and the \nvoice of the American people will be heard.\n  Senator Schumer said Republicans are xenophobes because they won't \npass his plan. Let's talk about what is extreme. A new report just out \nrevealed that this administration has released 36,000 criminal aliens \nfrom ICE detention. Our Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers \nreceive them as prisoners from a State or Federal penitentiary where \nthey have been convicted of some criminal offense unrelated to \nimmigration, usually in a State court. 36,000 are now being released \ninto the general population.\n\n  This report found there were 193 homicide-type convictions, 1,153 \nsexual offenders, 303 kidnapping convictions, and 1,075 aggravated \nassault convictions. These are serious crimes. If you will recall, \nthese criminals are the only group this administration says they are \nthe deporting. They don't deny that they are not deporting others who \nviolate our immigration laws. They promised they are faithfully \nremoving people who commit crimes unrelated to immigration. This report \nproves that claim not to be so.\n  These dangerous offenders should be kept in custody. They should not \nbe released into the general population. We had a study of such \nreleases several years ago. The statistics showed that when a person \nwho entered the country illegally was released on bail, they didn't \nshow up for court. If they are willing to enter the country illegally \nand a judge has them set for trial and he releases them on bail, we \nthen have an incredibly high number who don't show up for trial. This \nwas called catch and release and was roundly criticized. This is now \nbeing done with immigrants who have serious criminal charges and \nconvictions.\n  Do you know what else is extreme? Extreme is trying to pass an \nimmigration bill that would double the flow of guest workers into our \ncountry and triple the number of new permanent residents when 50 \nmillion working-age Americans are out of work. We have a very serious \nunemployment problem. Is no one concerned about that?\n  It is not xenophobic, but it is compassionate to say we should focus \nour attention on struggling and hurting American workers. It is not \nxenophobic. It is our patriotic duty to defend the integrity of our \nborders and enforce the long-established laws of the United States. It \nis the oath we all took as Senators to defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is the oath the chief law enforcement officer, \nPresident Obama, took. We have a duty to defend our citizens and our \npeople at a time when they are struggling financially. There is just no \ndoubt about it.\n  There was one group of people not referenced when Majority Leader \nReid and Senator Schumer talked earlier this morning. Do you know what \ngroup it was? Completely omitted from the conversation was the American \nworker. The American worker is not being discussed by amnesty \nsupporters in this debate. We know the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's view. \nThey would like more workers creating slack labor markets and lower \nwages. We know certain special interest groups want more immigration. \nWe know certain politicians think this will be good for them \npolitically.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office--our own professional \nteam that is selected in a nonpartisan way and gives us advice on the \nramifications of legislation we pass--has looked at the Reid-Schumer \nbill that passed the Senate. According to CBO, the Senate Democratic \nimmigration bill--which was supported by a small number of Republicans, \nbut it is overwhelmingly a Democratic bill--would increase unemployment \nwhile reducing wages. It would increase unemployment while reducing \nwages of American workers for the next 12 years, and it will reduce the \nper person wealth or GNP for the next 17 years.\n  If we bring in 30 million people over the next 10 years--as this bill \nwould do--it will triple the number that normally would be given legal \nstatus in America. It will bring down the per person wealth and it will \nbring down wages. Surely the U.S. Chamber of Commerce understands the \nfree market, do they not? Surely Senator Reid understands that, does he \nnot?\n  We were on a conference call yesterday regarding the American steel \nindustry. A large amount of steel is being dumped into America. What is \nthe impact of that? What is the concern? If we bring in more steel, \nthere will be lower prices for steel. If we bring in more cotton, there \nwill be lower prices for cotton. If we bring in more labor, it will \nresult in lower wages for American workers.\n  CBO told us that. There is no dispute about it. Yet we have Senators \nwho come to the floor and repeatedly say this is going to increase \nwages. Give me a break. You can't just say something and think it is \ngoing to make it reality when it is the opposite of reality.\n  Under current law, we are admitting more than 600,000 guest workers \neach year. Guest workers come to America not to be citizens but just to \ntake jobs that someone contends we don't have enough workers. We grant \npermanent residence to 1 million immigrants each year and perhaps \nultimately become citizens. That is the current law. Right now wages \nare falling and it is serious, but this is the law that has been \nestablished and that is what the nation has agreed to.\n  The bill Senator Reid maneuvered through this Senate would admit more \nthan 1.2 million guest workers each year, thereby doubling the number \nof guest workers, and it will give permanent residency to 30 million \nimmigrants over the next 10 years and that is triple the normal rate.\n  Research from Harvard professor Dr. George Borjas--perhaps the most \npreeminent student of labor, wages, and immigration in America--shows \nthat American workers lose more than $400 billion in wages each year \ndue to competition from low-cost workers from abroad. That is $400 \nbillion in wages each year--not million but billion.\n  Dr. Borjas's research also shows that from 1980 to 2000--he did an \nempirical study using the census, the Department of Labor, and other \nofficial data--wages declined 7.4 percent for lower skilled working \nAmericans. These are the people who go out and work every day. These \nare not people who have a college degree. I am talking\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nabout the working people in this country. Their wages declined from \n1980 to 2000 by 7.4 percent as a result of this very large flow of \nlegal and illegal immigration.\n  There is no doubt--and my colleagues have to understand this--a vote \nfor the Reid-Schumer immigration bill is a vote to lower the wages of \nAmerican workers. Not only that, it will make it harder for Americans \nto get a job, period. It appears the people who are hurt worst by the \nDemocratic immigration policies are young Americans, low-income \nAmericans, and minority workers.\n  According to Dr. Borjas's studies--and others--minority workers are \nparticularly damaged by high levels of immigration. This includes \nHispanics who have lawfully come to America. They are trying to get \nstarted so they can make their way up. They would like to have a pay \nraise, but their wages are also being pulled down by an extraordinary, \nunjustified flow of labor that the economy can't absorb effectively. We \ndon't have jobs for them now. That is the problem.\n  I don't dislike people who want to come here. I know most of them are \ngood people who would like to advance themselves. But, as Senators we \nhave a responsibility to the citizens of our country and we need to \nask: Is this good for America? Can we absorb this number of people and \nmaintain decent wages or are we in a long term trend that will allow \nlower and middle-income workers' wages to continue to erode? I think it \nis a serious issue that we need to be honest about and I hope we will \ndo so. Young and low-income Americans are also hurt.\n  Senator Schumer says we should do the bidding of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--buddying up with them now. He says there is a hijacking out \nhere, but it seems Mr. Schumer's party has been the one that has been \nhijacked by special interests, and they have lost sight of whom they \nclaim to represent--working Americans. That is my charge and that is \nwhat I say.\n  We have a generous immigration policy, and we need to make sure it is \nenforced correctly and lawfully carried out. That is what the American \npeople have asked of us. They have demanded this from us. They want a \nlawful system that we can be proud of and treats people fairly, where a \nperson fills out an application and lays out their qualifications. \nThose qualifications are then evaluated on an objective basis, and the \nbest qualified person, the one who is most deserving, is then admitted \nto the country. What is wrong with that? That is what Canada does. That \nis what the UK does. That is what Australia does. There is nothing \nwrong with such a policy. That is what we should be doing.\n  We should decide how many people the country can absorb and in what \nwage categories before we admit huge numbers of people and certainly \nbefore we double the number we presently bring in.\n  A number of Senators have complained on the floor of the Senate that \nthe tech industries can't find qualified Americans. We have all heard \nthat charge. I sort of accepted it at first, but in fact the data shows \nsomething different and it is rather surprising. In fact, we have twice \nas many STEM graduates each year as there are STEM jobs--science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics.\n  Here is a recent paper by Professor Hal Salzman from Rutgers \nUniversity. He carefully analyzed data from the Department of Education \nand the Department of Labor. He concluded that we first need to get \naccurate data to truly inform policy decisions. If we are going to make \na policy decision about how large our immigration flow should be--not \nto end it but how large it should be--shouldn't we have good data?\n  He says:\n\n       The first data to consider is the broad notion of a supply \n     crisis in which the United States does not produce enough \n     STEM graduates to meet industry demand. In fact, the nation \n     graduates more than two times as many STEM students each year \n     as find jobs in STEM fields. For the 180,000 or so annual \n     openings, U.S. Colleges and Universities supply 500,000 \n     graduates.\n\n  They supply more than twice the number of graduates as we have jobs \nfor now, so I am a little dubious about these big business types \nclaiming they can't get enough people.\n  What about IT specifically? We hear some of our Silicon Valley \nexecutives promoting any kind of immigration as long as they get more \nIT workers.\n  Mr. Salzman says:\n\n       The only clear impact of the large IT guest worker inflows \n     over this decade can be seen in salary levels, which have \n     remained at their late-1990s levels and which dampens \n     incentives for domestic students to pursue STEM degrees.\n\n  Did you know that? IT graduates' salaries are stuck at 1990 \nlevels. It is causing students in college to wonder if this is such a \ngreat field to go into. In fact, the author says there are other fields \nthat do better. If that is true, does that change Senator Reid's view \nof the legislation he jammed through the Senate and he is so proud of \nand he is demanding the House pass? If that is true, if Mr. Salzman is \ncorrect, will Senator Reid change his mind?\n\n  Then he goes on to say--and I agree with this line. He is talking \nabout all STEM graduates now:\n\n       If there is a [talent] shortage, where are the market \n     indicators (namely wage increases) . . . ?\n\n  So Mr. Donohue and friends at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who \nbelieve in the free market: Why are wages down if we have a shortage of \nworkers? Why aren't wages going up?\n  Another businessman said recently:\n\n       There are 600,000 jobs in manufacturing going unfilled \n     today. This immigration bill can go a long way toward helping \n     us fill these positions.\n\n  Well, great Scott. I have seen instances where thousands of people \napply for just a few jobs. Does he have any interest, first of all, in \npromoting sound national goals? Our goal as policymakers for the United \nStates of America should be to say: Wait a minute. You have jobs at \nyour manufacturing plant and we have to get unemployed people ready to \ntake them. Americans are on welfare and on dependency who need to go to \nwork. Give us a chance to get our people into those jobs first before \nwe start bringing in more foreign workers to take a limited number of \njobs.\n  From 2000 to 2013, the grim fact is that all net job gains went to \nimmigrant workers. Can you imagine that? That is what the numbers show. \nUnder the Democratic plan, this bill, if it were to pass the House, job \ndecline will accelerate.\n  From 2000 to 2013, the number of working-age Americans increased by \n16 million. Yet the jobs for American workers--the number of American \nworkers actually working--fell by 1.3 million. That is why the \nunemployment rate and the workforce dropout rate is so high.\n  But during that same period, 2000 to 2013, the number of working-age \nimmigrants increased by 8.8 million while 5.3 million immigrants got \njobs. So all the jobs created during this period of time have been, in \neffect, mathematically speaking, taken by foreign workers. Is this \nhealthy? Isn't this one of the reasons why people are having a hard \ntime today?\n  There are 50 million working-age Americans who are not working today. \nWages are lower today than they were in 1999. Median household incomes, \nadjusted for inflation, have dropped nearly $2,300 since 2009. We have \nthe smallest workforce participation in 36 years.\n  So I say to Mr. Reid and Mr. Schumer, I am glad to talk about this \nissue. I am glad to talk about immigration, but we are going to talk \nabout what is in the interests of the American people. We are not going \nto talk about your politics and your ideology and your special \ninterests. We are going to talk about what is good for America and what \nis good for America is to get more of our unemployed working, to get \nwages going up rather than down. I am not surprised they didn't talk \nabout workers and wages in their remarks when they demeaned people who \ndisagree with them and who oppose their great bill they drafted that \nwill not work.\n  We are not going to be scared off. We are not going to be intimidated \ninto handing over control of our immigration laws to a small group of \nspecial interests who are meeting in politicians' offices and maybe \npromising support. I feel strongly about this. I don't feel there is \nanything wrong, morally or public policy-wise, to say we need to have a \nlawful system of immigration we can be proud of. That is what the \nAmerican people have asked of us for over 30 years and Congress refuses \nto give. Congress is not listening to the\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\npeople. And we can do it. It is possible. I have been in law \nenforcement almost as long as I have been in the Senate. I know this \ncan be done, if we have a leader who wants to see it done. But if the \nPresident doesn't want to enforce the law and says he is only going to \nenforce it against people who commit serious crimes, and we now find \nout even those criminals aren't deported when they are caught, then I \nthink we have a deep problem. I think we can do better.\n  Let's don't go down this road of pushing, pushing, pushing, just pass \na bill, any bill--oh, we have to do it fast. That has been the message \nall along. We have to ram it through, but this thing has been out there \nin the public now for a long time. The mackerel has been in the \nsunshine for a long time and it doesn't smell so good when it is \nexamined, and the American people are not prepared to eat it and they \nshouldn't.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senate for giving me a chance to express \nthese concerns. I believe we need to put American interests first, and \nwhen we do we will draft an immigration bill that is far different from \nthe one being promoted today.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             VA Health Care\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the unfortunate \nallegations of mismanagement and neglect that have been leveled against \nthe Phoenix VA health care system.\n  By now we have all seen the headlines highlighting unsettling \nallegations that veterans may be dying while awaiting care in Phoenix. \nThese revelations have come to light after whistleblowers in Arizona \nhave suggested that Phoenix VA officials were manipulating appointment \nrequests and waiting lists.\n  Recent reports suggest that some veterans may have been placed on an \nunofficial waiting list outside of the VA's official electronic waiting \nlist, which exists to calculate how long a veteran has to wait for \ncare.\n  The alleged reason for the existence of this secret--or unofficial--\nlist was to keep officially reported wait times down and to disguise \nlonger actual waiting times. This apparently would help the Phoenix VA \nsave face and reflect more positively on the VA's system as a whole. As \na result, as many as 1,400 veterans' actual wait times may have been \nsignificantly longer than what was reported by Phoenix VA officials.\n  Now the VA's inspector general's office has launched an \ninvestigation, and senior officials with the Phoenix VA have been \nplaced on administrative leave.\n  At a recent hearing in the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, after \ncautioning that there should be no ``rush to judgment,'' a senior VA \nofficial indicated that after a preliminary review they found no \nevidence of a ``secret list.''\n  Nothing would make me happier than to believe the allegations that \nwere leveled were just as a result of sour grapes from some unhappy \ncurrent or former employees. But, sadly, similar allegations \nsurrounding delayed care have also surfaced elsewhere in the country.\n  Just this week, CNN has reported that two VA officials in North \nCarolina have been placed on administrative leave because of \n``inappropriate scheduling.'' CNN also reports that a scheduler at a VA \nfacility in San Antonio suggested there had been some ``cooking [of] \nthe books'' there to hide lengthy wait times.\n  Will it be any surprise if more VA health care facilities share these \nissues? We have all heard about the backlog of more than 300,000 claims \nmade by veterans to the Department of Veterans Affairs. This backlog \nhas resulted in a wait time for compensation for disability claims that \nreportedly averages a dismal 5 months.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in greater numbers of \nveterans seeking treatment in VA facilities. As more and more \nservicemembers leave the Armed Forces, these numbers are sure to \nincrease.\n  Clearly, the VA is having a hard time providing adequate and timely \ncare to veterans. This is and should be a nationwide concern.\n  While backlogs are one thing, efforts to obscure or hide them is \nsomething else entirely, and a disturbing pattern of allegations to \nthat end are coming into focus.\n  What is alleged to have gone on just in the Phoenix VA system demands \nan honest, independent, and timely investigation. If these allegations \nare confirmed, anyone behind an effort to cover up these wait times or \ninterfere with the truth coming out needs to be held accountable. Heads \nshould roll. Veterans and families impacted by any sort of neglect and \nmismanagement in the Phoenix VA system deserve nothing less.\n  In addition, an apparent pattern of similar problems around the \ncountry would suggest that Congress needs to ensure that its own role \nin substantive, rigorous, and effective oversight has not been \nblatantly ignored.\n  VA Secretary Eric Shinseki will be testifying before the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs later this week to answer questions \nabout the ``state of veterans health care.'' Given what appear to be \npervasive failures at a growing number of VA health care facilities, he \nwill have more than a few questions to answer. I look forward to the \nresults from that hearing.\n  This situation cannot go on. In Phoenix and around Arizona people are \nconcerned. We are receiving a record number of calls to our office from \nveterans who are concerned who want to tell their story of the care \nthey are receiving or not receiving on a timely basis. This is \nsomething we cannot countenance in our oversight responsibilities here \nin Congress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               EXPIRE Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration \nof the Expiring Provisions Improvement, Reform, and Efficiency Act, \notherwise known as the EXPIRE Act. This legislation has, so far, moved \nforward in a cooperative, bipartisan fashion, and I am hoping that \nspirit will continue here on the floor.\n  It seems that the new norm for tax policy around here is conducting \nthis ritual where tax provisions expire, we wait until the following \nyear to decide which ones to extend, and then we finally enact them \ninto law for 1 retroactive year and 1 prospective year.\n  When that happens, half of the benefit is more of a windfall rather \nthan an incentive. And, needless to say, this process causes great \nuncertainty when businesses and individuals try to manage their taxes \nand budgets.\n  I am not casting blame on anyone for this flawed methodology. Indeed, \nboth parties share responsibility for how the tax extenders process has \ndevolved over the years. I think the American people deserve better.\n  I share the view of many on both sides of the aisle--including both \nchairmen of the tax-writing committees--that comprehensive tax reform \nwill be necessary to ensure long-term growth and prosperity in our \neconomy. When it comes to tax policy, that type of reform should be our \nultimate goal. Hopefully, if we can reform our Nation's Tax Code, this \nprocess of extending certain provisions over and over will come to an \nend. However, I am not naive.\n  Fundamental tax reform is unlikely to take place in the immediate \nfuture. That being the case, Congress needs to work to address the tax \nrelief provisions that expired last year or will expire by the end of \nthis year, and we need to do so in a timely fashion.\n  The EXPIRE Act should serve as a starting point for temporarily \nresolving the expired and expiring tax provisions. The Senate Finance \nCommittee voted to report the EXPIRE Act on April 3, 2014. It passed \nthrough the committee by a voice vote. Not every member supported the \nfinal bill, but\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\nthe committee process was, from the outset, constructive and inclusive \nand allowed for the full participation of both Democrats and \nRepublicans. I give the distinguished chairman a lot of credit for \nthat.\n  I have to commend Chairman Wyden, who conducted a fair and open \ndebate on tax extenders during the Finance Committee markup. His \napproach was a prime example of how the Finance Committee is supposed \nto operate and, in my view, it should serve as a model for all of the \nSenate committees in how they should consider legislation in their \nvarious jurisdictions.\n  The process reminds me of a historical analogy with respect to the \nchairman's home State of Oregon. Everyone knows about the Oregon Trail. \nThousands of pioneers started in Independence, MO, and traveled to \nIndependence, OR. They used covered wagons. In fact, the covered wagon \nis part of Oregon's State seal. The pioneers followed the ruts that \nprevious wagons had cut.\n  Like those pioneers, the chairman has taken this tax extenders wagon, \nfollowing the bipartisan, inclusive ruts of the legislative trails \ncharted by previous chairmen of the Finance Committee. I hope we can \nstay on this trail now that the bill is on the floor.\n  In the end, of the 55 or so tax extenders considered by the Finance \nCommittee, only two were not extended. Personally, I would have \npreferred seeing a smaller number of extended provisions, continuing \nthe process we started in 2012 of reducing the number of tax extenders.\n  But, in the end, the final product represented the consensus views of \nthe committee, and I have been very pleased to work with Chairman Wyden \nin the process.\n  As I said during the markup on the EXPIRE Act, as the committee has \nconsidered these extenders package, Chairman Wyden and I have worn two \nhats. We have represented the interests of our respective States and we \nhave also been brokers of the diverse interests of all of the members \nof the committee. That has meant compromise. Compromise has meant some \noutcomes that were likely not optimal from at least one of our \nperspectives.\n  With the bill coming to the floor, we are wearing a third hat, \nrespecting the interests of our respective caucuses. Needless to say, \nthis can be difficult, but it is what we have to do. When we dive into \nthe list of these expiring tax provisions, we can easily see that this \npackage touches upon many facets of our economy from housing to energy \nand from startups to larger corporations that are important to so many \nindustries and important in each and every State.\n  I am glad to see the research and development tax credit, which is so \nimportant to businesses in my home State of Utah, included in the bill \nreported out of the Finance Committee. I know there are other \nprovisions included in this package that are important to other States. \nMy hope is that the floor debate on this extenders package will \nresemble the debate we had in the Finance Committee. That means a fair \nand transparent process and an opportunity for Senators to offer \namendments.\n  The Senate is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. Sadly, it is difficult to call it that these days unless one is \nbeing sarcastic. I have been pretty sarcastic about it. A number of my \ncolleagues, led of course by our distinguished minority leader, have \ncome to the floor in recent months to talk about the degradation of \nSenate rules and procedure that has taken place under the current \nmajority. They have done so with good reason.\n  On bill after bill the process is the same. The majority leader \nbrings a bill to the floor, immediately files cloture, even though \nthere is no desire to filibuster on our side, accuses the Republicans \nof filibustering, fills the amendment tree, and blocks consideration of \nany and all amendments.\n  There is a time to fill the procedural tree, but that is only after \nfull and fair debate and when it has carried on too long and the leader \nfinally decides we have to bring this to a close. But all too often, \nevery time we turn around, the leader has brought the bill to the \nfloor, filed cloture, as though we are filibustering when we are not, \nand then fills the parliamentary tree so we cannot have amendments.\n  Of course, those steps are usually preceded by a short-circuited \ncommittee process, wherein committee consideration of the bill is \neither significantly abbreviated or passed entirely. This is not how \nthe Senate is supposed to operate. With this bill we have a chance to \ndo things differently.\n  As I have mentioned, the EXPIRE Act has already had full and fair \nconsideration in the Finance Committee. The bill was drafted in \nconsultation with all of the members of the committee. I was one who \nhelped make sure that happened. When we held a markup, all Senators \nwere allowed to offer amendments and receive votes on those amendments. \nWhy not continue that process, as we have in the past, on the almighty \nfloor of the Senate.\n  It is ridiculous the way the minority is being treated, and I think \neven the majority Senators are being mistreated with the way this \noutfit is being run right now. While I am satisfied with the way the \nFinance Committee handled the tax extenders package, the vast majority \nof Senators do not serve on the Finance Committee. That being the case, \nmost Senators have not had a chance to fully debate these tax \nprovisions or even offer amendments of their own, which they ought to \nhave the right to do.\n  They deserve that opportunity. I expect a number of my colleagues, \nparticularly on the Republican side, have amendments that would improve \nthis bill by helping to grow our economy and to create jobs. I have a \nnumber of amendments I would like to offer myself. Over the next few \ndays I will be on the floor to talk about some of them. Let's have a \nfloor debate that is worthy of the Senate. This is not some itty-bitty \nbill. This is a very important bill. It can set the trend for tax \nreform that should come in the future.\n  Let's allow Members of both parties to offer amendments and have \nvotes on those amendments. Let's show the American people that Senators \nknow how to work together to solve problems for American businesses and \nfor our citizens. Too often the Senate devolves into yet another \npartisan sideshow where politics are placed above progress.\n  As I said, it does not have to be this way. Once again, I am pleased \nI have had this opportunity to work with my colleague Chairman Wyden to \nmove the EXPIRE Act forward. He has done a very good job. He deserves a \nlot of credit for it. He does not deserve having that work stymied \nbecause people do not have a chance to offer amendments on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  My only hope is, now that the bill is on the floor, the Senate \nDemocratic leadership will follow his example and allow for a full and \nfair debate of this legislation. To be honest with you, I do not know \nwhat they are afraid of. Yes, there may be some amendments that are \ntough to vote on, but that is part of the process. It is part of what \nmakes the Senate, when it functions right, the great body it can be.\n  I understand the majority leader wanting to preserve his side in the \nupcoming election. I think our minority leader wants to preserve his \nside and maybe add to it in the upcoming election. I understand these \nare important considerations, but the rights of Senators on both sides \nare to be considered here and ought to be given not just consideration \nbut given the respect the Senate should give to each and every Member \nof the Senate.\n  I have to say I am very disappointed in what is going on around here. \nI am not the only one. Virtually everybody is. I know some are \ndisappointed on the Democratic side as well.\n  One of the problems is that a high percentage of the Democratic side, \nthey have never been in the minority. They do not know what it is like \nto have to fight for everything you can possibly get, but they are \ngoing to be there someday, whether it is this election or some election \nin the future. They are going to realize, for the first time, that you \ndo not break the rules to amend the rules. Those rules are important.\n  Frankly, they are going to realize this should continue to be the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. Unfortunately, right now it is \nnot. It is not because of the leadership we have in this body. We have \nto make those\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nchanges. This is a bill to start on because this is a bill that I think \neverybody is interested in. It is a very important bill. It is a bill \nthat has been labored on in the Finance Committee for quite a long \ntime.\n  It has taken years to get to this point. Certainly at markup it made \na lot of sense. Do I support everything in this bill? No. There are \nsome things I do not think should be in there. On the other hand, there \nwere some sincere colleagues who felt they should be in there. They \nwere able to prevail. I respect that. We ought to respect both sides. \nUnfortunately, I think our side is being disrespected the way the \nSenate is being handled today. It is time to stop it. This is a bill to \nstop it on. This is the type of bill that both sides have to take great \ninterest in. This is a bill where we can set the tone for tax reform in \nthe future.\n  I think it is time to wake up around here and start letting the \nSenate operate as the Senate should operate, as the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Women's Economics\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank my \ncolleague Senator Warren, who is joining me on the floor. We are here \ntogether to talk about a question that could not be more critical to \nfamily budgets and to our economy as a whole; that is, what can we do \nto break down the barriers that women still face in our workforce and \nmake sure women and their families have the fair shot they deserve. \nThis is a question I know Senator Warren cares very deeply about. She \nhas brought an enormous amount of leadership and focus to this debate. \nI am very appreciative that she is here to speak. So I would yield to \nher first and then I will finish speaking when she gets done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Murray on the \nfloor to stand up for America's women because it is time for a tough \nconversation about the economics of being a woman. I applaud her \nleadership, and I am very pleased she is bringing the women of the \nSenate to the floor today.\n  Women are working hard, earning their own way, and supporting their \nfamilies, but they are not getting the same pay, the same security or \nthe same respect. Take a look at the minimum wage. Two out of every \nthree minimum wage workers are women. Women make up about three-\nquarters of all tipped minimum wage workers. A woman who works minimum \nwage can work full time and yet she will not earn enough to keep \nherself and a baby out of poverty. Minimum wage workers have not \nreceived a wage increase in 7 years. This is bad for women and it does \nnot reflect America's value. CEOs got raises, managers got raises, but \nthe women who cook and clean and care for our children are still stuck \nat the same $7.25 an hour they earned 7 years ago.\n  We could change this. If Congress would pass a bill to raise the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour, more than 15 million women and their \nfamilies would have more economic security, but Republicans have \nblocked this bill. They say they care about women, but they will not \nhelp the women who earn minimum wage or consider equal pay for equal \nwork. I cannot believe I am saying this in 2014, but women still earn, \non average, only 77 cents to the dollar what their male colleagues \nearn. Bloomberg analyzed the census data to find that in 99.6 percent \nof jobs, women get paid less than men. That is not an accident. That is \ndiscrimination.\n  Today, if a woman wonders if she is being paid the same as the guys \nare getting, she can, in some jobs, get fired just for asking. This is \nbad for women and it does not reflect America's values. We could change \nthis by passing Senator Barb Mikulski's Paycheck Fairness Act, a law \nthat would make sure women do not get fired just for asking what the \nguy down the hall is getting paid, but Republicans have blocked this \nbill. They say they care about women but will not help the women who do \nthe same work as a man but get paid less.\n  Consider health care. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed in \n2009, some insurance companies charged women higher premiums simply \nbecause they were women. Some insurance policies refused to cover \npreventive services for women such as mammograms and cervical cancer \nscreenings. Pregnancy costs could be excluded and birth control \ncoverage could be left out. In other words, affordable women's health \ncare took a backseat to the profits of insurance companies.\n  But now we have the Affordable Care Act; women pay the same insurance \nrates as men. We have the Affordable Care Act; women get free coverage \nfor mammograms and birth control. We have the Affordable Care Act; \nwomen can worry a little less about whether health problems will land \nthem in bankruptcy.\n  Where are the Republicans? They want to repeal ObamaCare. The House \nhas now voted more than 50 times to repeal ObamaCare. The Senate \nRepublicans have come to the floor day after day to demand that \nObamaCare be done away with. The Republicans say they care about women, \nbut they will not help women pay for health care or get the full \nmedical coverage they need at a price they can afford.\n  Women are working hard earning their own way and supporting their \nfamilies. They are entitled to the same pay, the same security, and the \nsame respect as men. Policies such as these--minimum wage, equal pay, \nand the Affordable Care Act--provide a measure of equality, better \nsecurity, and some basic respect. Republicans want to block or repeal \nall three. Women are not asking for special deals. They just want a \nfair shot at building lives for themselves and their families.\n  The women of the Senate, the Democratic women of the Senate, are \nready to fight the Republicans to make sure women across this country \nhave their fair shot.\n  I thank Senator Murray for her leadership in fighting for real \neconomic equality for women.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts again for all of \nher extremely hard and important work to expand economic opportunity \nand security for women and their families.\n  She has been an extremely important voice in this debate, and I am \ndelighted she is joining us today.\n  Yesterday I held a hearing on this topic in the Senate Budget \nCommittee. We invited a working mother, whose name was AnnMarie Duchon, \nto testify about some of the challenges that she had faced. AnnMarie \ntold us that she loves her job at the University of Massachusetts-\nAmherst, but since the day that she started, she made a lower salary \nthan her male counterpart who was doing the exact same job. They had \nthe exact same responsibilities. Both of them had taken a pay cut to \naccept that job, and they both graduated from the same university in \nthe same year.\n  When AnnMarie found out that he was making more than she was--even \nthough they had the exact same resume, qualifications, and years of \ngraduation--she went in and asked for a raise. She was told that she \ncouldn't have one.\n  She stayed on that job and continued to work hard. It wasn't until \nher husband's job was at risk that she started thinking about how much \nthose lost wages meant to her and her family.\n  She ran the numbers, and she found out that over the years she had \nmissed out on more than $12,000 in wages compared to her male \ncounterpart who was doing the exact same work.\n  AnnMarie and her husband are first generation college graduates. They \nhave a 5-year-old daughter who is in full-time daycare because both \nAnnMarie and her husband have to work.\n  AnnMarie told us yesterday that when she realized her lost income \namounted to 1 year's worth of child care or 10 months of payments on \ntheir mortgage or student loans, she said that was heartbreaking. \nAnnMarie was ultimately able to go back and convince her employers--by \nshowing them the math--to give her equal pay.\n  But as we know, unfortunately, most women are not able to do that and \nmany don't even know that they are\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\nearning an unfair wage. That is a real loss, both for our families and \nfor our economy as a whole.\n  We heard what $12,000 could have meant for AnnMarie's household \nbudget, but women's contributions in the workforce have also made a \nhuge difference to our overall economic strength.\n  As working families have felt more and more strained by the rising \ncosts for everything from college tuition to childcare and health care, \nand an economy in which the gap between those at the top and everyone \nelse seems to be getting wider and wider, women's economic \ncontributions have helped ease the burden.\n  Economist Heather Boushey, who also testified yesterday at our \nhearing, found in a recent study that between 1979 and 2012 the U.S. \neconomy grew by almost 11 percent as a result of women joining our \nlabor force. As we think today about ways to support growth in the 21st \ncentury, it is absolutely clear our country's economic success and that \nof our middle-class families go hand-in-hand with women's economic \nsuccess.\n  So we have a lot more work to do because despite all the progress we \nhave made and all the glass ceilings that have been broken, women still \nface barriers that are holding them, their families, and our economy \nback.\n  Stories such as AnnMarie's--stories of women who received lower wages \nfor the same exact work as men--are still far too common. Because women \nare more likely to be the primary caregiver in a family, the lack of \npaid leave at most jobs means women today experience higher turnover, \nlost earnings, and are more likely to be passed over for promotions \nthat would help them advance.\n  In addition, our outdated Tax Code works against married women who \nchoose to go back to work as a second earner because their earnings are \ncounted on top of their spouse's. They can actually be taxed at a \nhigher rate, and that deters some mothers from choosing to re-enter the \nworkforce, especially when you consider the high cost and lack of \naccess to high-quality childcare.\n  Those kinds of challenges are especially pronounced for women and, in \nparticular, mothers, who are struggling today to make ends meet. We \nknow that two-thirds of minimum wage earners are women. Their jobs are \ndisproportionately unlikely to offer any flexibility when, for example, \na child gets sick or needs to be picked up early from school. And their \nearnings are quickly swallowed by costs associated with work, such as \nchildcare or transportation.\n  It is also important to note that our outdated policies \ndisproportionately affect women when it comes to their retirement \nsecurity because, on average, women earn less than men, accumulate less \nin savings, and receive smaller pensions. Today nearly 3 in 10 women \nover 65 depend on Social Security for their only income in their later \nyears.\n  All of my colleagues and I should be alarmed that the average Social \nSecurity benefit for women over 65 is just $13,100 per year. Imagine \nliving on that. That is not enough to feel financially secure.\n\n  The impact of these barriers is increasingly clear. Over the last \ndecade the share of women in the labor force has actually stalled, even \nas other countries have continued to see more women choosing to go to \nwork. Experts believe that a major reason for that is that, unlike in \nmany other countries, in the United States we have not updated our \npolicies to reflect our 21st century workforce and help today's two-\nearner families succeed.\n  At a time when we need to be doing everything we can to grow our \neconomy and strengthen our middle class, that is not acceptable. Women \nhave to have an equal shot at success. First and foremost, that means \nwe need to end unfair practices that set women back financially.\n  We took a very good step forward with the Affordable Care Act, which \nprevents insurance companies today from charging women more than men \nfor coverage--which they did before that Act. But we need to do more to \nmake sure women are getting equal pay for equal work.\n  My good friend and colleague Chairman Mikulski has led the way on the \nPaycheck Fairness Act, which would provide women with more tools to \nfight paycheck discrimination. Giving the millions of women earning the \nminimum wage a raise--as Senator Warren just talked about--would also \ngo a long way toward that effort. Of course, we have to update our Tax \nCode so that mothers who are returning to the workforce do not face a \nmarriage penalty.\n  In addition to expanding the earned income tax credit for childless \nworkers, the 21th Century Worker Tax Cut Act that I introduced would \nprovide a 20-percent deduction on the second earner's income for \nworking families with young children to help them keep more of what \nthey earned.\n  As we get rid of these discriminatory practices, we should also \nrecognize the challenges that working parents face, and we should put \nin place a set of policies that help them at work and at home. A big \npart of that is investing in expanded access to affordable, high-\nquality childcare. When parents go to work, they deserve to know that \ntheir child is safe and thriving while they are at work. There are many \nsteps that this Congress could and should take through our Tax Code and \nby building on successful programs, such as Head Start, to help give \nworking parents the peace of mind they deserve.\n  Finally, we need to build on and strengthen Social Security with \npolicies that make it easier for women and their families to build a \nsecure retirement. There is, of course, a lot more that we can do in \naddition, but I believe any one of those changes would have a real \nimpact.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows from our Budget Committee hearing \nyesterday, AnnMarie testified and told us that she hopes when her \ndaughter enters the workforce, pay inequity will be just as much of a \nrelic as the days before the iPhone.\n  I could not agree more.\n  Acting to expand economic opportunity for women is the right thing to \ndo. It is part of our ongoing work to uphold our country's most \nfundamental values. But as our country's recent history shows, it is \nalso an economic necessity--both for our families and for our broader \neconomy.\n  That is why it is so disappointing to see that when it comes to \nissues affecting women. Some of our Republican colleagues are laser-\nfocused on turning back the clock. We saw this just yesterday when the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina came to the floor and tried to pass \nan extreme bill that would severely limit women's reproductive rights.\n  Women today would much rather see Congress focusing on expanding \nopportunity and helping working families than on getting in between a \nwoman and her doctor.\n  Over the next few months, we are going to see Democrats continuing to \nfight for goals such as achieving pay equity, providing access to \naffordable childcare, and raising the minimum wage--all of which would \nmove women, families, and our economy forward not backward.\n  I hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be \nwilling to join us in this very important effort.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander and I be \npermitted to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. We come to the floor today to call attention to the tax \nextender bill currently being debated before the Senate. Included in \nthis legislation is a provision extending the wind production tax \ncredit, known as the PTC, for 2 additional years. This would be the \nninth extension of a supposedly temporary tax credit.\n  The PTC was first enacted in 1992 to jump-start the nascent wind \nindustry. It was meant to expire in 1999, 15 years ago. But this one-\ntime stimulus has turned into a never-ending tax subsidy that has been \nextended eight times,\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\nand the prospect for a ninth extension seems likely.\n  The PTC spends precious tax dollars subsidizing a very mature \nindustry and distorting our energy markets.\n  My friend from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, and I have been vocal \nopponents of this Federal subsidy for years. Unfortunately, this credit \nhas survived under the canard that wind power is an infant industry in \nneed of Federal support.\n  With the PTC's expiration on January 1 of this year, wind producers \nare once again igniting the rallying cry to continue their taxpayer-\nfunded handout.\n  I ask my friend from Tennessee, for those taxpayers who may not be \nfamiliar with this use of their hard-earned dollars, what is the PTC \nand why is it so valuable?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership \nover the years and for pointing out the flaws in this proposal. It \nwastes money, it undercuts reliable electricity--like coal and nuclear \nelectricity--and, in my view, it destroys rather than saving the \nenvironment.\n  But let's say exactly what we are talking about. This was a tax \ncredit that was first passed in 1992, as the Senator from Arizona said, \nto help an infant industry. It has been renewed eight times. If you are \na wind developer, it pays you 2.3 cents for every kilowatt hour of wind \nthat you produce--which in some markets is about the cost of the \nwholesale value of each kilowatt hour of electricity.\n  In fact, the subsidy is so great, sometimes in some markets, wind \nproducers can actually give away their electricity and still make a \nprofit. At other times--in the middle of the night in Chicago--they can \nactually pay utilities to take their wind power and still make a \nprofit. That is what the wind production tax credit is.\n  As the Senator says, this is a mature industry. I support jump-\nstarting certain types of energy for a limited period of time.\n  But Steven Chu, President Obama's Nobel Prize-winning U.S. Energy \nSecretary, in 2011 in response to my question--Is it a mature \ntechnology?--said: Yes, it is a mature technology.\n  I would ask the Senator from Arizona, what is the justification for \nspending over the next 2 years $13 billion of taxpayer money? It is the \nmost wasteful, conspicuous, taxpayer subsidy that I know of in \nWashington, DC. It proves Ronald Reagan's statement that the only thing \nin life that is eternal is a government program.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator. I don't think there is justification.\n  The justification that often is given is that we have to give some \nkind of surety moving ahead, and people won't invest in this industry \nif they don't know that the subsidy is there.\n  Again, this has been around since 1992. It was meant to expire in \n1999. But it has been extended eight times. If anything is unsure, we \nare creating that unsurety--or insecurity--when Congress simply goes \nagain and again and renews it.\n\n  The Senator from Tennessee had a great column in the Wall Street \nJournal talking about part of the problem we have when we subsidize \nthis kind of industry and what that does to baseload power--nuclear and \ncoal--in the interim. Does the Senator wish to talk about that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, and I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  The United States uses almost 20 percent of all the electricity in \nthe world, and we need electricity that we can rely on. We don't want \nto flip the switch and have the lights not come on. We don't want to go \nto work and have the generators not working. So we use a lot of \nelectricity, and that comes from baseload power. That is typically, in \nour country, coal, nuclear, and now natural gas.\n  Wind is intermittent. It usually blows at night. Usually it blows \nonly about a third of the time, and you either use it or lose it. So \nrelying on wind power to run a country that uses 20 percent of all the \nelectricity in the world is the energy equivalent of going to war in \nsailboats when nuclear ships are available.\n  Baseload power is undercut by this intermittent wind power because of \nthis subsidy. This subsidy is so large that wind developers can, in \nsome cases, give away their electricity and still make a profit. And in \nsome cases they pay the utilities to take their wind power, making the \nbaseload power that we need to rely on for the long term less \neconomical. This leads to the closing of nuclear plants and coal \nplants.\n  Mr. FLAKE. In that same column, the Senator also talked about the \nenvironmental impact. It is often thought that these renewables are all \nthe same in terms of their impact on the environment. But the Senator \npoints out where these need to be built generally, and they are not \nyour typical picturesque windmill somewhere in Holland but something \nquite different.\n  He also mentioned what it would take to generate the same amount of \npower that perhaps eight nuclear powerplants generate, what it would \ntake in terms of these wind units. Does the Senator want to talk a bit \nabout that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, the Senator from Arizona is from the West and I, \nof course, am from the East. In the Eastern United States, the wind \nturbines really only work well on ridgetops. I live near ridgetops \naround the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. If we ran wind turbines \nfrom Georgia to Maine along the Appalachian Trail, we would only \nproduce about the same amount of electricity that eight nuclear power \nplants would produce. And we would still need the nuclear power plants \nor the coal plants or natural gas plants to produce electricity when \nthe wind isn't blowing. We don't want to see those 20-story towers on \ntop of our ridgetops. You can see the blinking lights from 20 miles \naway. I think they destroy the environment in the name of saving the \nenvironment.\n  There are appropriate places for wind power, and it has an \nappropriate place in the market. I would ask the Senator from Arizona, \nisn't it time for wind to stand on its own in our marketplace and \ncompete with other forms of electricity?\n  Mr. FLAKE. Yes. And I want to point out as well that neither of us is \nsaying there is no place for wind energy.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Correct.\n  Mr. FLAKE. It is an increasing part of our energy load. In fact, the \nmost new capacity actually went to wind as a percentage of the current \noutput. There is an important place for it. It can and is being done in \nenvironmentally sensitive ways around the country. But it is time for \nthe Federal subsidy to end.\n  The problem is, when we distort the market the way we do--when at \ntimes you can actually pay a utility to take your power because that is \nthe only time the wind is blowing, at night, and still make a profit \nfrom the Federal subsidy--there is a distortion in the markets we just \nshouldn't have, and we ought to let capital flow where it is most \nneeded.\n  So neither of us is saying there is no place for wind energy, but \nthere is no place now or no reason to continue for the ninth time an \nextension of this Federal subsidy for wind.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would say to the Senator from Arizona, just to be \nspecific about this--negative pricing, as we call it--the opportunity \nfor a wind developer at, say, 3 o'clock in the morning in Chicago to \nliterally pay the utility to take the wind power, thereby causing the \nnuclear plant or the coal plant to be less useful, is contributing--it \nis not the whole reason, but it is contributing to the closing of \nnuclear plants.\n  The Center for Strategic and International Studies said that because \nof the low price of natural gas and this subsidy for wind, we might \nlose as many as 25 percent of our nuclear plants in the next 10 years. \nNuclear power produces 60 percent of the carbon-free, sulfur-free, \nnitrogen-free electricity--air pollution-free electricity. A number of \nenvironmental groups have begun to point out their concern for what \nwould happen to our air, if we lost this important source of clean \ngeneration of electricity.\n  This is just one more reason we should let wind take its natural \nplace in the marketplace. Wind is now 4 percent of all the electricity \nthat we produce. It was, as the Senator said, the fastest growing form \nof generation, so let it compete. Let it go where it should go. \nOffshore is another place it could go. But it is time to end the \nsubsidy and let wind stand on its own.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator.\n  Senator Alexander and I are introducing an amendment to the tax \nextenders bill currently on the floor. This\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\namendment would simply strike that extension, do away with it \ncompletely.\n  We also have another amendment as to when producers of wind energy \nclaim the subsidy right now, they can claim it now but not have the \nclock start until they start producing. So if they do not start \nproducing for another 10 years, the end point of that subsidy is a full \n20 years from now and taxpayers are on the hook much longer than was \nanticipated. So this would simply say that the point at which the \nsubsidy begins has to be immediately so we won't go too far in the \nfuture.\n  Those amendments will be introduced tomorrow, and we hope to be able \nto debate those on the floor with this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator for his leadership. And when we \ntalk about a 1-year or 2-year extension, it is important to note that \nwe are talking about the next 10 years. Let's say I qualify for the \nproduction tax credit--I am a wind developer this year, which means I \nget that credit for the next 10 years. That is why the 2-year extension \nof the wind production tax credit really spends tax dollars over the \nnext 11 years when you count both those years. It totals $13 billion. \nWe throw dollars around so much here, it is hard to get a sense of how \nmuch $13 billion is. In 2012 we spent $10 billion government-wide on \nall of energy research. It would be much better to use these dollars to \nreduce the debt or to use some of it for clean energy research. We need \nlow-cost, clean, cheap energy. In my view, energy research is a much \nbetter use of taxpayer dollars, when they are available, than long-term \nsubsidies. After nearly twenty-two years and eight renewals, the wind \nPTC has been around for far too long.\n  Ronald Reagan was right. I hope to prove him wrong on this one--that \nthe wind PTC finally comes to an end.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator.\n  I have just one other point. The second amendment, as I mentioned--\nand the Senator mentioned that this 2-year extension leads to another \n10 years in subsidies. Depending on when they actually start \nproduction, it could be another 20 years. So it really distorts our \nbudget process, our appropriations and authorizations and everything \nelse, for a longer period of time than it should.\n  I thank the Senator for his work and look forward to hopefully seeing \nthese amendments debated.\n  I yield the floor, unless the Senator has any closing remarks.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No, I do not. I guess, in summary, after nearly 22 \nyears, it is time for wind production to step out on its own in the \nmarketplace. Let's save $13 billion, and let's stop distorting the \nmarketplace and undercutting nuclear plants as well as coal plants, and \nlet's stop destroying the environment in the name of saving the \nenvironment.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord following our colloquy an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal of \nMay 7, 2014, entitled ``Wind-Power Tax Credits Need To Be Blown Away.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Wall Street Journal, May 7, 2014]\n\n              Wind-Power Tax Credits Need To Be Blown Away\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       The U.S. Senate is poised to resurrect Washington's most \n     conspicuous, wasteful taxpayer subsidy--the wind-production \n     tax credit.\n       This giveaway expired in December. Yet on April 3 the \n     Senate Finance Committee gave it new life by approving a $13 \n     billion, two-year renewal within a package of 55 ``tax \n     extenders.'' Once again, Washington is proving Ronald \n     Reagan's observation that ``the nearest thing to eternal life \n     that we'll ever see on this Earth is a government program.''\n       The wind-production tax credit was first enacted in 1992. \n     At the time, wind-power was considered a kind of ``infant \n     industry,'' needing help to bring its technology up to speed \n     and lead to lower costs. The tax credit has since been reborn \n     eight times, even though President Obama's Energy Secretary \n     Stephen Chu in 2011 said that wind power is a ``mature \n     technology.'' A mature technology should stand on its own in \n     the marketplace.\n       The 2.3-cent tax credit for each kilowatt-hour of wind-\n     power electricity produced is sometimes worth more than the \n     energy it subsidizes. Sometimes in some markets, for example \n     in Texas and Illinois, the subsidy is so large that wind \n     producers have paid utilities to take their electricity and \n     still make a profit.\n       The wind-production tax credit should not be renewed for \n     three principal reasons:\n       1. It wastes money. The proposed two-year extension would \n     cost taxpayers nearly $13 billion over the next 10 years, \n     according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation. \n     In 2013, when Congress renewed the subsidy for one year, the \n     cost was nearly $12 billion over 10 years. This is more than \n     the federal government spends on energy research in one year.\n       A better use of taxpayer dollars would be to reduce the \n     ballooning federal debt or to invest in research to find new \n     forms of cheap, clean, reliable electricity. For example, \n     what about a substantial cash prize from the U.S. Department \n     of Energy for creating a truly commercial use for carbon \n     captured from coal and natural-gas plants? Such a discovery \n     would be the Holy Grail of clean energy--permitting the use \n     of coal world-wide to produce an abundant supply of cheap, \n     clean, reliable electricity to reduce poverty while \n     protecting the environment.\n       2. The wind subsidy undercuts reliable ``baseload'' \n     electricity such as nuclear and coal. Let's say it's 3 a.m.in \n     Chicago. The wind is blowing, which it usually does at night \n     when consumers are asleep and don't need as much electricity. \n     Because of the subsidy, wind producers can pay utilities to \n     take their power and still make a profit.\n       But the electricity generated from coal and nuclear \n     plants--which are hard to turn on and off--becomes less \n     economical. As a result, utilities have an incentive to close \n     these ``baseload'' plants. Negative pricing tied to wind \n     power, along with the low price of natural gas, is causing \n     utilities to close nuclear plants. The Center for Strategic \n     and International Studies says that as many as 25% of our \n     country's 100 nuclear plants might close over the next 10 \n     years.\n       On April 28, environmental groups, including the Center for \n     Climate and Energy Solutions and Nuclear Matters, announced \n     they held an event in Washington at the National Press Club--\n     that they were concerned about losing clean nuclear power, \n     which provides 60% of America's air-pollution-free \n     electricity. And, in a country that consumes 20% of the \n     world's electricity, relying on windmills when nuclear power \n     is available is the energy equivalent of going to war in \n     sailboats when nuclear ships are available.\n       These are the consequences of government subsidies that \n     pick winners and losers in the marketplace.\n       3. Wind-power subsidies destroy the environment in the name \n     of saving the environment. The wind turbines that generate \n     power in this country do not resemble the charming, \n     picturesque windmills that dot the Dutch landscape. Instead, \n     they are 20 stories high. Their blinking lights can be seen \n     for miles. Their noise disturbs neighbors. Their transmission \n     lines scar neighborhoods and open spaces.\n       In the Eastern U.S., onshore wind turbines work best on \n     ridge tops. You would have to stretch these giant windmills \n     the length of the Appalachian Trail, from Georgia to Maine, \n     to equal the power produced by eight nuclear-power plants. \n     And since wind turbines produce power only when the wind \n     blows (about one-third of the time), even if you built that \n     many windmills, you'd still have to build nuclear or other \n     power plants to produce reliable electricity for computers, \n     jobs and homes.\n       After nearly 22 years, eight resurrections and billions of \n     taxpayer subsidies, it's time to let the marketplace rule and \n     allow wind power to rise or fall on its own. Save our money, \n     save our nuclear plants and save our mountaintops.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the so-called tax extenders bill is \nthe subject of discussion--55 provisions in the Tax Code to be extended \nthat have expired or are expiring. The wind production tax credit is \none of those. I hope the majority leader will do what the Senate should \ndo, which is to allow those of us who have amendments--like the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I, who have offered two amendments related to the wind \nproduction tax credit--to have our say on behalf of the people of \nTennessee and Arizona and the American people and to not impose the gag \nrule on the American people, which has become the practice here in the \nSenate.\n  The only reason we are really here is to have a say and to have a \nvote on behalf of the people who have elected us. If an important bill, \nsuch as the tax extenders bill, comes forward and we have a $13 billion \nexpenditure that Americans feel strongly about, we ought to have a \nvote. We ought to have a say.\n  So I hope very much, as we move forward, the majority leader will \nbring us back to the time when the Senate offered a chance to have a \nvote, to have a say on behalf of the people of the United States. We \nmight not win our vote, we might lose our vote, but we will have had \nour say.\n  This is the body in the American constitutional framework that has \nbeen described in the most recent history of the Senate as the one \nauthentic bit of genius in the American system of government. That is \nbecause we have to have consensus before we move ahead,\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\nand you only govern a complex country such as this by consensus. That \nis what 60 votes is about. That is what debate is about. We have gotten \nfar away from that--far away from that.\n  So this would be a good time to drop this notion of the gag rule on \nthe American people, this business of cutting off amendments, cutting \noff debates, and say: We welcome amendments. We welcome debate. We will \nvote them up, we will vote them down, pass them in a responsible way, \nand we will go on to the next one.\n  So it is my hope that Senator Flake's amendments, which I am proud to \ncosponsor--both of them--will be one of several amendments on the tax \nextenders bill to be allowed a vote when that bill comes up.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                             Russia-Ukraine\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, a number of people have asked me to \ncomment about the situation since President Putin has moved \naggressively with regard to Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, which has \ntherefore brought about some retaliation of sanctions by the United \nStates against Russia.\n  We are now hearing comments--a number of troubling statements--coming \nout of Russia by the Deputy Prime Minister, who has the responsibility \nfor defense and aerospace, regarding the U.S. development of rockets \nthat can again take Americans, on American rockets, to and from the \nInternational Space Station. He has made a sarcastic comment, something \nto the effect of, well, how do the Americans think they are going to \nget to the space station--on a trampoline? And then most recently a \nstatement having been issued in his name that the Russian rocket \ncompany will not sell the very efficient and very energetic Russian \nrocket engine, the RD-180, to the United States for military purposes.\n\n  This is a very complex issue. It affects not only our military access \nto space, it affects our civilian access to space. I will see if I can \ndissect this in about 4 minutes, as a number of people have asked me \nabout this. This will be an issue, for example, next week in the markup \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee of the Armed Services Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  First, let's go back and see the history. How do we have this \nrelationship with Russia and what is it?\n  In the midst of the Cold War, when there were the two super powers, \nthe Soviet Union and the United States decided to cooperate in space in \nthe civilian program. In the midst of the Cold War, a Russian Soyuz and \nan American Apollo spacecraft--Apollo-Soyuz as it is known--\nrendezvoused and docked, and the crews lived together in space for 9 \ndays in 1975.\n  By the way, those two crews led by General Alexsei Leonov of the \nSoviet Union and Gen. Tom Stafford, U.S. Air Force, NASA astronaut, \nApollo 10 that went to the Moon--they are close personal friends and \nhave seen each other over the course of the years many times.\n  In 1985 I had the privilege as a young Congressman to take a \ndelegation to the Soviet Union on the occasion of the 10th anniversary \nof Apollo-Soyuz, with our Apollo astronauts joining in Moscow with the \nSoviet cosmonauts. So there is a long history.\n  But now fast forward to, I believe, the year 1991 and the complete \ndestruction of the old Soviet Union. All the satellite states went \nelsewhere. By the way, this was in August and September of 1991, \ninterestingly, after a delegation of American astronauts and Soviet \ncosmonauts in April of 1991 all joined together out at Star City where \nthey train their cosmonauts, and then we all went in a Soviet military \nplane out to Kazakhstan to the launch site on the occasion of the 30th \nanniversary of the launch of the first human into space--a Russian, \nYuri Gargarin. A few months later, the Soviet Union disintegrated.\n  So the United States had a choice to make: All of those very bright, \nvery effective Russian scientists in their defense program and in their \nspace program--and often their civilian space program was directly \nlinked to their Soviet military program--where were all those \nscientists going to go? We didn't want them to go to Iran, North Korea, \nand China.\n  So I believe Senator Sam Nunn, a Democrat, and Senator Dick Lugar, a \nRepublican, led the effort to put together the Nunn-Lugar bill, which \nstarted sending American assistance to try to stop the scientists from \nfleeing into other hands and especially to corral all of the nuclear \nweapons the Soviet Union had, and that was done very effectively.\n  Then when Russia opened its former Soviet closed doors, we found out \nRussian scientists and engineers had manufactured this exceptionally \nefficient and powerful engine, kerosene and LOx--liquid oxygen--called \nthe RD-180. As a result, we worked out a deal between American \naerospace companies and the Russian company Energomash, where instead \nof these engines going all across the world, we were going to use them \ntogether. So the United States through its rocket manufacturers--I \nbelieve Pratt & Whitney--got the license to this and the plans to the \nengine, but they also had an agreement that they would buy these from \nthe Russian rocket manufacturer.\n  Today that engine is a staple and necessary engine in our stable of \nhorses to get into space, both military and civilian, because it is the \nmain engines on what we use today, the Atlas V rocket. This is a proven \nrocket. It has had an unblemished record, and that unblemished record \nhas been something close to, if not over, 100 straight flights without \na flaw. It is being planned in the future by Boeing to put a Boeing \nspacecraft on top of that rocket for humans to go to and from the space \nstation. Another company called Sierra Nevada has created a smaller \nwinged spacecraft also for humans--not unlike the space shuttle but \nmuch smaller--that will go on top of the Atlas V. They, along with a \nthird competitor, SpaceX, which has built its own rocket called the \nFalcon 9, with its spacecraft the Dragon capsule--those three will \ncompete to see if one or all three will deliver humans--American and \nRussian--to the International Space Station in the future instead of us \nhaving to rely, after we shut down the space shuttle, on the only \nmanned, human-tested rocket to get us to and from the space station \nnow, which is the Soyuz, the Russian rocket that launches from \nBaikonur, Kazakhstan.\n  If this isn't confusing enough, the Deputy Prime Minister--provoked \nbecause the United States has responded to President Putin's \naggression--says he is going to stop selling the Energomash rocket to \nthe United States for military purposes.\n  The question is, Is he going to continue to sell that rocket engine \nfor civilian purposes--which I just outlined in this competition that \nis coming up--and if this is accurate and it holds, what to do for the \nUnited States?\n  We have several options.\n  First of all, we have a 2-year supply of these engines on the shelf. \nIf in 2 years we think the Russians are not going to continue to sell \nthis--and, by the way, this is a real jobmaker for Russians and a \nmoneymaker for them. The aerospace industry in Russia wants to continue \nto sell this engine, but if the politics get in the way and they cut it \noff, then what is the United States to do? We have to figure that out. \nRight now there is a study going on in the Department of Defense as to \nhow we would handle it. We have a 2-year supply. One of the options \nthey will look at is stretching that out over time, putting some of \nthose payloads on other rockets. Some of those payloads can go on the \nvery successful Falcon 9, but there are heavier payloads that cannot go \non the Falcon 9 that could go on the Atlas V. But if the Atlas V is not \nflying, they will have to go on a more expensive and heavier lift, \nDelta IV Heavy. So we see how complicated this gets.\n  Then the question is, If they are not going to sell these engines for \nmilitary purposes, can we bank on it that they would sell these engines \nfor NASA civilian purposes? That is a big question mark.\n  So one of the issues in this DOD study is going to be can we \nmanufacture since we have the plans. We don't know the answer at this \npoint. It is an extremely complicated metallurgy process which they \nhave perfected in all of those years in the old Soviet Union. We would \nhave to start flat-footed, even though we have the plans,\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nand figure out how to do all the design equipment, all the processing \nequipment, and then try to get the engines ready--and at some point \nwhat would a follow-on engine look like?\n  That is about the best I can summarize the situation, and we are \ngoing to have some major decisions to make, depending on what we see in \nthe DOD study.\n  First of all, we are going to have to know how we have assured access \nto space for defense purposes for the national security of this \ncountry.\n  Secondly, we are going to have to have assured access to space for \nthe civilian program so this incredible International Space Station \nthat we have built with 15 nations, including the Russians, who have \nbeen a major part--how we are going to keep that operating and get \nAmericans to and from it because the Russians cannot operate the space \nstation by themselves.\n  In the first place, a lot of the Russian commands to their own \nmodules actually are commands that go through the Johnson Space Center \nin Texas. Secondly, the Russians depend on all the electricity that is \ngenerated on the International Space Station from the American \nelectrical systems. So we are going to have to continue to operate it \ntogether. The Deputy Prime Minister implied that; that he would \ncontinue to do that through year 2020, but the space station is going \nto have a life--and should have--well into the decade of the 2030s.\n  These are the questions we are going to have to answer and they are \ngoing to have to be answered in the near future. In part, some of them \nare going to have to be answered next week as we start to mark up the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I wanted to give the Senate, and all of those in the press who have \nbeen asking me, the best of what I could conclude at this point and \nthen we will see what develops. There was the new development, as I \nmentioned yesterday, where the Deputy Prime Minister said they will not \nsell the RD-180 to America for military purposes. If that holds, then \nwe have to swing into action pretty quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                               EXPIRE Act\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Madam President. I rise to talk about the \nlegislation we are considering, the so-called EXPIRE Act, and we want \nto make sure that as we are focusing on the policy--and I will get to \nthat in a moment--we highlight for emphasis that this was a measure \nthat came out of the Senate Finance Committee in a bipartisan fashion. \nIn fact, it was unanimous coming out of the committee.\n  We had a good discussion and debate about various tax provisions that \nwe wanted to extend for 2 more years, and because of that there was a \ngreat interest in the subject matter. Rarely have we seen the kind of \nbipartisan support that we have seen in the committee for these tax \nprovisions, and I think that bipartisanship will continue as we move \nforward with the legislation on the floor.\n  The bill came out of our committee recently and it does enjoy \nbipartisan support. I wish to concentrate on the small business \nprovision. As you know, if you went down the list of these extensions \nof tax provisions generically known as tax extenders, you could cover a \nhuge array of subjects by virtue of the whole bill. I am going to focus \nfor a couple minutes on the small business provisions.\n  We often hear from small business owners--and I hear it all the time \nin Pennsylvania and I am sure others hear it in their home States as \nwell--about the lack of certainty. Frequently, business owners say they \ndon't have certainty about where their business will go next because of \nwhat Washington has not been getting done. One of the reasons it is so \nimportant to get this bill passed in a bipartisan fashion--that alone \nis a measure of certainty for folks seeing so much partisanship here, \nbut also giving a timeframe of 2 years helps alleviate uncertainty as \nwell.\n  It is an especially urgent issue when it comes to small business \nowners. They don't often have the capacity to go out and hire a lot of \nexperts to help them with compliance, to help them understand or deal \nwith on a regular basis tax provisions or substantial changes in health \ncare and public policy. So having a measure of certainty is a \nsignificant issue in the life of a small business owner.\n  All too often we minimize the impact of tax incentives by failing to \nrenew critical provisions in a timely manner. Business owners need that \nbasic certainty, which is why the work we have done on small business \nissues is particularly significant. I am proud of the work Senator \nCollins of Maine and I have done to introduce legislation which would \nallow small businesses to plan for capital investment that is so vital \nto job creation. This commonsense proposal would introduce certainty to \nbusinesses, especially small businesses, increase economic activity and \nthe pace of job creation. A number of the provisions in the bill that I \nhave worked on with Senator Collins are in the EXPIRE Act, the \nlegislation we are dealing with on the floor.\n  I believe we have to create a favorable environment in order for \nbusinesses to make investments that create jobs and grow the economy. \nSmall businesses are vital to our economy. That said, I am not sure we \noften fully understand how significant an impact small business has on \nthe country, when we consider that small firms comprise more than 98 \npercent of all employers. Nearly half of the Pennsylvania workforce is \non their payroll, to get a sense of the dimensions, reach and scope of \nsmall businesses in a State such as Pennsylvania, but of course that is \ntrue across the Nation.\n  Small firms nationally employ just over half of the private sector \nworkforce, according to the Small Business Administration. Small \nbusinesses also have led the charge to put America back to work. \nAccording to the SBA, small businesses have created 64 percent of the \nnet new jobs over the past 15 years. Again, we sometimes don't fully \nappreciate the impact of small business. The most recent monthly \nemployment report by the payroll processor ADP showed that small- and \nmedium-sized firms accounted for more than 80 percent of the job growth \nin January of this year. So a short-term recent number of job creation, \nsmall business is accounting for 80 percent of that, but even when we \nlook at a longer period of time, over the past 15 years, small business \nis creating 64 percent of the net new jobs. So we need to do everything \nwe can in the Senate and the House to invest in strategies that will \nhelp small businesses so they can grow and invest.\n  Unfortunately, many tax provisions affecting small businesses have \nrecently been enacted on an unpredictable and temporary basis. That is \nan understatement. When we talk about certainty or uncertainty, this is \npart of what we are talking about. This uncertainty directly and \nsubstantially hinders economic growth and job creation. When businesses \ndon't know how their investments will be taxed, they cannot make long-\nterm planning decisions with confidence. You don't have to be a small \nbusiness owner to understand that it is especially difficult for a \nsmall business owner to hire a legion of lawyers, accountants or other \nprofessionals to help them. Sometimes a small business owner does \neverything. You know the old expression ``chief cook and bottle \nwasher.'' They do everything. They don't have the luxury of hiring a \ncompliance team for every issue, and it is especially difficult in this \nuncertain environment. So this uncertainty about tax policy \ndisproportionately harms these small businesses.\n  We often say these are the firms that are the backbone of the \nAmerican economy. Yet they don't have the luxury that larger firms do \nto have a team of experts around them or a team they can retain. The \nNational Federation of Independent Business says that compliance costs \nare 67 percent higher for small firms than larger ones. The Small \nBusiness Administration claims that tax paperwork is the most expensive \npaperwork burden on small businesses, at $74 an hour. So they are \npaying $74 an hour in terms of tax compliance paperwork, and their \noverall compliance costs are 67 percent higher than large firms.\n  This legislation includes several provisions intended to immediately \nreduce the uncertainty about the Tax Code and encourage businesses to \ngrow and invest and hire. These measures have bipartisan support and \nadopt proposals\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nfrom both parties. One measure includes a 15-year straight-line \ndepreciation schedule for restaurant leaseholds and retail \nimprovements. In April last year Senator Cornyn from Texas and I \nintroduced a bill that contains this provision which has bipartisan \nsupport. If a restaurant wanted to add a new room with 5 or 10 tables \nin a service space, that is a pretty big investment. They have to \nbuild, grow, and spend a lot of money to do that. There is a \ndepreciation benefit provided to that business which historically has \nbeen over the course of 39 years. Recently we shrunk that timeframe \ndown to 15 years. Instead of giving little, tiny slices of \ndepreciation, the benefit is more substantial over the course of 15 \nyears, and the bottom line is we want it to stay at 15 years and not go \nback to the 39 years. I am not sure what the benefit would be if \nsomeone added a couple of tables to their restaurant in 2014 and had to \nwait 39 years to reap that benefit.\n  So the legislation Senator Cornyn and I have would maintain that 15-\nyear cost recovery provision and make it permanent. The bill addresses \nthis, albeit for a 2-year timeframe instead of the current year. We \nknow this faster so-called cost recovery is directly reflected in the \ncompany's bottom line and frees cash that can be used to expand \noperations and hire more workers. It stands to reason if you have a \ngreater tax benefit, you have more dollars in your hand, so to speak, \nand as a restaurant owner you can hire more workers in the near term. \nSo maximizing certainty within the Tax Code is an expressed benefit for \nthese small businesses.\n  A study from the National Restaurant Association found that \nuncertainty over depreciation and other tax provisions forced \nrestaurants to forgo improvement projects that would have produced \napproximately 200,000 jobs nationwide. I would submit that if that \nnumber were cut in half it would be a significant number, but their \nestimate is that in essence we are forgoing 200,000 jobs because of tax \nuncertainty.\n  Another provision of the bill that we are debating and discussing \nwould make permanent the maximum allowable deduction under section 179, \nexpensing rules. Section 179 allows taxpayers to deduct certain capital \nasset purchases in the year they make the purchase. This type of \nexpensing provides an important incentive for businesses to make \ncapital investments. Without it taxpayers would have to depreciate \nthose asset purchases over multiple years, getting a much more short-\nterm benefit because of that tax provision. This maximum allowable \ndeduction under 179 has changed three times in the past 6 years. That \nis one of the best examples of uncertainty, when things keep changing \nand the numbers keep changing. One year they can take advantage of one-\nhalf million dollars of benefit if they bought new equipment, for \nexample.\n  What we want to do--I think what is the best policy is to set it at a \nfairly high level, I would argue one-quarter of a million dollars----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. That is section 179, \nand that is another issue addressed in the bill.\n\n  The third provision is the so-called bonus depreciation, which helps \nbusinesses in much the same way the expensing rules do. The bonus \ndepreciation allows companies to expense half of the cost of qualifying \nassets that they buy and put into service in the same year. I won't go \nthrough all the numbers, but we have heard from companies across the \nboard about that provision as well.\n  Whether it is provisions that help restaurants, whether it is to help \nbusinesses that want to make capital purchases, or whether it is \ncompanies that benefit from another year of a tax benefit, this bill \nallows us to give a measure of certainty for at least 2 years to these \nbusinesses and especially those that are small businesses.\n  I believe this is one of those times where we can fulfill what a lot \nof people have asked us to do. They have asked us on a daily basis to \nwork together to create jobs. This legislation, which is bipartisan, is \none way to come together in a bipartisan fashion to create jobs and \ngive certainty to help our small businesses and to work together--\nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to give voice to the thousands \nof Nebraskans who have contacted my office and continue to contact my \noffice with their concerns about health care.\n  In 2009 the President made all the Americans a promise. He said:\n\n       No matter how we reform health care, we will make this \n     promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you \n     will be able to keep your doctor, period.\n\n  Five years later, it is becoming clear that the President's assurance \nwon't hold true. Many of the millions of Americans who were forced to \nsign up for ObamaCare-approved health plans are now having trouble \nfinding a doctor or hospital they like that will accept their new \ninsurance.\n  On May 12 the New York Times reported:\n\n       In the midst of all the turmoil in health care these days, \n     one thing is becoming clear: No matter what kind of health \n     plan consumers choose, they will find fewer doctors and \n     hospitals in their network--or pay much more for the \n     privilege of going to any provider they want.\n\n  Despite higher rates, new ObamaCare plans include fewer in-network \ndoctors and hospitals than the older health care plans. This diminished \naccess to health care is a serious problem for Americans who live in \nrural areas with fewer primary care physicians, forcing some people to \ndrive hours just to see a doctor who will accept their insurance.\n  I have received letters, emails, and phone calls from over 18,000 \nNebraskans who keep saying the same thing: The promises of ObamaCare \nare not being kept.\n  For example, Karen and her husband from Kearney essentially lost the \ndoctors they had and liked when they received a notice in the mail \nindicating that the health care providers they have relied on for years \nwill no longer accept this new insurance.\n  Here is another example my office received. Douglas, another \nconstituent from Kearney, wrote:\n\n       ObamaCare has done one thing, and one thing only, it has \n     threatened my wife and the life of my son.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Because of age, and the ACA, my son's doctors retired or \n     quit practicing, and also because of my son becoming an \n     adult, we had to find new doctors. We haven't been denied \n     insurance, but we have been denied doctors. We ended up \n     begging and pleading with doctors to care for my son. [We \n     were] turned down by nine or ten.\n\n  I offered a commonsense proposal called the FAIR Act. It would delay \nthe tax on the uninsured anytime the employer mandate is delayed. \nObamaCare is picking winners and losers. The big and powerful get help \nwhile the vast majority of Nebraskans and millions of Americans are \nleft behind. My bill will level the playing field, giving all Americans \nthat ``fair shot.'' I hope we have the opportunity to debate and vote \non my commonsense bill here in the Senate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in a quorum call.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, according to a recent National Federation \nof Independent Business study, ObamaCare and its tax increases will \nresult in the reduction of up to 285,000 private sector jobs. Let's say \nthey are wrong. Let's say they are exaggerating. After all, the NFIB \nhas not exactly been supportive of ObamaCare. Let's say it is 250,000 \nor 225,000. Let's say it is 200,000. I think that any piece of \nlegislation that causes one job to be lost is something we should take \na second look at, let alone 285,000 jobs.\n  Even though the administration has moved the goalpost more than 20 \ntimes in terms of how Obamacare is enacted, it clearly has hurt far \nmore than it has helped. The majority leader famously said that all the \nstories that have been stated on this floor have been horror stories \nthat are not true, but these are\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\nreal stories. These are people who have contacted my office and talked \nto me personally. They have written letters and sent emails. They are \nsimply saying: Here is my experience.\n  Once in a while I come to the floor so I can verbalize the \nexperiences of the people I represent.\n  Kelly from Fort Wayne, IN, received a letter from her insurance \ncompany that said her provider would change her policy due to the \nAffordable Care Act. Her new policy failed to cover her lifesaving \nmedication, increasing her monthly costs by over 400 percent compared \nto what she had paid with her previous plan. She said: What am I \nsupposed to do? This medication I have is lifesaving. It is no longer \ncovered by my insurance plan. And the insurance company has indicated \nthat this is the result of the implementation of ObamaCare.\n\n  Bruce from Jasper, IN, had to drop his insurance policy and enroll in \na new plan that increased his monthly premium by 70 percent. Bruce \nsaid: I can't afford this. I am paying a lot of money already. Seventy \npercent. I thought the President said this won't cost me a penny more, \nperiod. I am sure the President regrets using ``period'' because period \nmeans final, no discussion, no debate--trust me, you won't have to pay \none penny more.\n  I talked to Bruce in Jasper, and he is paying 70 percent more.\n  Traveling across Indiana, I hear these stories from Hoosiers over and \nover, men and women business owners who are reducing hours, laying off \nhard-working employees, or closing the doors because of this law's \ncostly requirements. Most importantly, they are very seriously \nconsidering dropping any employer-offered coverage whatsoever. They are \nreducing their workforce, if it is possible, to below 29 hours a \nworkweek so they don't have to provide insurance.\n  At one national chain, they have stated publicly that they have put \nall of their thousands of employees on 29-hour workweek schedules so \nthey don't have to subject them to the restrictions imposed upon them \nunder the ObamaCare act.\n  I don't know how many of these stories we have to share before we try \nto make some reforms, replacements, or find positive solutions to the \nproblems we face. Republicans have met in caucus. We have some \nalternatives. We would like to have them considered.\n  This leads me to my second point. It is clear now that we are not \ngoing to be allowed to offer any solutions, any reforms, any changes to \nany legislation as long as we are here in this session of Congress. We \nhave been allowed nine amendments in the last 10 months. The minority \nin the House of Representatives has been allowed to offer over 125 \namendments in the last 10 months.\n  People are saying: Wait a minute, I thought in the House the majority \nrules.\n  They have a Rules Committee. They decide that maybe they will get one \namendment or two amendments. Don't expect to be able to offer \namendments if you are in the minority in the House of Representatives.\n  They say: We won the election. We are the majority.\n  That is how the House works. I served in the House. I served in the \nminority for 8 years. I am trying to remember if I was ever allowed \namendments. Sometimes our caucus was allowed an amendment.\n  I came to the Senate and people asked: What is the difference?\n  I said: The difference is night and day. Any Senator can offer any \namendment to any bill at any time.\n  Then Democratic majority leader, George Mitchell, was following a \nprecedent that had lasted for more than 200 years. The greatest \ndeliberative body in the world deliberated. And, yes, we were here late \nhours in the evenings sometimes when a Member said: Wait a minute, I \nhave one more amendment. That person was allowed to offer that \namendment. We spent many nights into the dark hours working through a \nbill, but the process worked. That was honored by Republican leaders \nand Democratic leaders. Only now, at this second iteration of mine--it \nseems like a bad dream, actually--do we have a leader who has basically \nsaid: I am not allowing you any amendments. I don't want to force any \nvotes.\n  That is not what the Senate was designed to be. That is not what it \nhas been traditionally. Yet here we are facing yet another piece of \nlegislation that looks the same as every other piece of legislation we \nhave been faced with this year. The majority leader will use a \nprocedure called filling the tree. The majority leader is using \nprocedures to shut down the minority, to gag us. It is a gag order by \nthe majority leader. He is basically saying: You don't have the \nprivilege under my leadership of representing the people in your State \nwho voted for you to come here to offer their wishes and their desires \nand amendments to reform a piece of legislation. I am not giving you \nthat opportunity.\n  That is what the majority leader is saying over and over.\n  Now, if a Member is in the majority, I suppose he or she can get \ntheir changes modified and moved into the bill that the majority leader \nbrings to the floor. But then he turns to the other side and says: You \ndon't count, none of you. All 45 of you, all 45 Republican Senators \nhere, don't count.\n  This is a Senate run by 55 people under the dictatorship of the \ncurrent majority leader, who simply has thrown a gag order on any \nRepublican because they are afraid to debate and vote on measures they \nthink might negatively impact them, even though they are many times \nbipartisan-led amendments--amendments supported by Members on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  We said: OK, he is turning down anything we offer, but what if we \noffered it with the support of a Member from the other side?\n  He turns that down too, so he shuts down his own Members.\n  It is beyond my comprehension, having served here before and seen the \nSenate under the leadership of Democratic leaders who caused this body \nto function in a way where everybody had a voice. We didn't always win \nour amendments. We were in the minority. We mostly lost our amendments, \nbut we had a chance to offer them. We had a chance to debate them and \nto try to persuade Members to join us. Sometimes we were fortunate to \npersuade those Members. Other times they were bills and amendments \nfashioned together with Democrats and Republicans, brought to the floor \nin tandem, voted on, and passed, and they were constructive changes. \nToday, it is, shut up, sit down, don't offer amendments, I am not \ngiving you anything. It defies the history of this place, the tradition \nof this place, and it has turned us into the world's least deliberative \nbody, not the most deliberative body. There is no deliberation here.\n  It appears the only way to change this is for the voters to go to the \npolls and say: Let's get the Senate back to what it is supposed to be.\n  Let's get to a place where we are not afraid to stand up and take a \nstand. Let's not be afraid to consider amendments and to say if it \npasses, it passes, and if it loses, it loses, but at least Members had \nthe opportunity to state their positions and the opportunity to \nrepresent the wishes of the people who sent us here.\n  We are sitting around here being able to do nothing--nothing--because \nthe majority leader said: You are in the minority. I am running this \nplace. It is a one-man show. I am throwing a gag order over all of you, \nand we are shutting it down.\n  Now we are coming to the tax extenders. There are good provisions in \nthe bill, there are mediocre provisions, and there are some that \nprobably shouldn't be in there. But shouldn't this be debated? This \nimpacts our economy and impacts our future. There are many things in \nthe tax extenders bill that is coming before us--including research \ncredits and other things that stimulate the economy--some that I think \nare good and some things that I think are bad. Shouldn't we have the \nopportunity to try to support the good or eliminate the bad or at least \nmake an effort at that? Yet once again it hasn't happened yet. The \npattern has been laid. The majority leader will say: No, you are not \ngoing to have any amendments. We are going to shut this down, and you \nare going to do it our way.\n  Apparently, that is the way the majority leader has decided he is \ngoing to run the Senate. He makes all kinds of false excuses as to why \nhe has to do what he does, but none of them hold water. I regret that. \nI think it has turned this place into a dysfunctional\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nbody, and I think the burden of responsibility for that falls directly \non the shoulders of the majority leader.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today, as my \ncolleague from Indiana has, because the same things he is hearing about \nat home in Indiana--stories from real people and how their lives have \nbeen impacted by the health care law--are stories I am hearing at home \nevery weekend in Wyoming.\n  I think it is astonishing that the majority leader would come to the \nfloor of the Senate and say these stories we are coming to the floor \nwith are made up, he said, out of whole cloth. These are real people in \nour communities who have been impacted by the health care law in ways \nthat have been very detrimental to their lives, their livelihood. \nPeople have had their hours cut. Their take-home pay is less. They are \nfinding they are having to pay a lot more for insurance. A lot of times \nit is insurance they don't really want or need or will ever use but the \nPresident says they have to buy. They have lost policies that have \nworked well for them.\n  I got a recent email from a gentleman, a family in Powell, WY, a \ncommunity in Park County. He writes: Now that ObamaCare has been deemed \nto be the most successful government program of all time, let me tell \nyou what it has done for retired middle-class Wyoming citizens like \nmyself.\n  Of course, he said he was not serious when he said ``the most \nsuccessful government program of all time.'' He probably heard the \nPresident talking about it. He probably heard the President of the \nUnited States tell Democrats who voted for this health care law to \nforcefully defend the law and be proud of it. I haven't heard Members \nwho voted for this actually come to the floor to any degree to \nforcefully defend and be proud of the law because they know the side \neffects of the law have been devastating--devastating to families, \ndevastating to people and their paychecks, and devastating to health \ncare in this country.\n  So back to what my constituent from Powell, WY, said: Health care \npremiums of nearly $2,000 a month.\n  The President said: Oh, no, premiums will drop by $2,500 a year.\n  This gentleman said: Health care premiums of nearly $2,000 per month, \nscheduled to go to at least $2,000 or more per month in July--in \nparentheses, ``unbelievable.''\n  He then says: Middle-class citizens like my wife and myself, not \nqualifying for ObamaCare subsidies, having to consider becoming \nlawbreakers by forgoing health insurance for ourselves or at least one \nof us--in parentheses, ``probably myself because I am the healthier of \nthe two''--and paying the fine.\n  He then said: If we do No. 2 above--about disobeying the law and \npaying the fine--we will have to look into seeking cheaper care outside \nthe United States, probably Mexico, for serious problems.\n  Is that what the President of the United States intended, to have \npeople seek care in Mexico because they can't afford the Obama health \ncare law and the mandates and all of the insurance that they don't \nneed, don't want, won't use, and can't afford? It is not what the \nPresident promised the American people. He said if they like what they \nhave they can keep it. But, of course, that was deemed the lie of the \nyear.\n  So I guess that is how the American people view the President of the \nUnited States now and can't really consider his comments to be \ncredible. So when he says forcefully defend and be proud of the health \ncare law, I think the American people realize that the President has \nsold the law to them under false promises and the Democrats are clearly \nnot standing up and defending what they know is hurting their \nconstituents. The President is in his bubble, and he hears only what he \nwants to hear. But I think Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, \nwho go home and listen to people, know these stories are true, unlike \nwhat the majority leader says--that they are just made up.\n  The gentleman goes on to say: I could look into residence in another \nState to see if health care insurance is available cheaper. I don't \nknow if it is or not, but I understand that Wyoming has the highest or \nnear highest health insurance premiums.\n  Then he ends by saying: Is this what Obama and the Federal Government \nconsider fair?\n  The President goes on TV and says that everybody ought to have a fair \nshot. Is this what the President of the United States considers fair? \nIs this what he means by a fair shot? People all across the country are \ngoing to be asking themselves that question as they take a look at the \nimpact of this health care law on their own lives, their own families, \nthe ability to keep their doctors. We know many people have lost the \ndoctor they like in the sense that they can't go to that doctor. They \nknow they can't go to the same hospital. We know many were not able to \nkeep the insurance they had. We know many have had hours cut.\n  In an effort to try to help people who didn't have insurance, I think \nthe President of the United States and Democrats should not have hurt \nso many individuals across the country, so many people who already had \ninsurance. There may be people who are newly insured, but there are \nalso people who are newly uninsured, and it is because of the \nPresident's health care law. Are there side effects? You better believe \nit. They are harmful. They are costly. Many families have been \ndevastated by the health care law.\n  I have another letter from a family in Lingle, WY. This is somebody \nwho knows I am a doctor, knows my record of treating patients around \nWyoming and working with families all across the State. She said: I \nknow you're interested in the number of people who are uninsured after \nthe rollout of the ACA. She said: My husband and I started \ninvestigating the ACA in October. The Presiding Officer will remember \nthey opened the exchanges in October. The President, right before that, \nsaid it was going to be easier to use than Amazon and cheaper than your \ncell phone bill. She said: So we started investigating in October, and \nwe were finally able to establish an account in March.\n\n  That is what the American people think about the capability of this \ngovernment and this administration. You start working on something in \nOctober, and you finally establish an account in March because of the \nincompetence of a bureaucracy and an administration that says one \nthing, does another, promises something, and delivers something very \ndifferent.\n  She said: We found that our premiums would be one-third of our annual \nincome--one-third of our annual income--with a $6,000 copay and a \n$12,000 deductible.\n  Those are the numbers--one-third of their annual income, a $6,000 \ncopay, a $12,000 deductible--and the majority leader comes to the floor \nand says we are making this stuff up. These are letters from our \nconstituents, people who live in our States, people whom we see on \nweekends when we go home.\n  She goes on to say: We have been uninsured for 7 years due to the \ncosts, which we are told is due to our age, even though we are in good \nhealth. So as of today we are still uninsured.\n  So they started in October, finally established an account in March, \nand as of the date this was written in April, they were still \nuninsured.\n  She said: We don't have any idea what will happen if one of us gets \nsick or has an accident. How will we pay the bills?\n  Then she finishes by saying: Keep fighting for the people of Wyoming. \nAs a doctor, you know what a precarious position we are in.\n  I wish the President of the United States and the majority leader \nwould realize what a precarious position they have placed the American \npublic in--an American public who knew what they wanted with health \ncare reform. They wanted the care they need, from a doctor they choose, \nat lower cost. That is not what they got. They got more mandates, more \nexpensive care, higher deductibles, higher copays. Many people had \ntheir policies canceled.\n  We know with the 30-hour work rule communities are cutting the hours \nof workers so their take-home pay goes down. We are not talking about \nbusinesses here, although it is happening in the business world as \nwell. It is also happening in communities--school districts that are \nsaying: Well, we are going to have to cut the hours of substitute \nteachers, we are going to have\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nto cut the hours of the school bus drivers, of the coaches, of a number \nof part-time workers. Why? Because of the health care law.\n  These are side effects of the law. They are harmful. They are \nexpensive. They have an impact on people's lives to a point that I \nthink the President wants to ignore because the President is hoping \npeople on his side of the aisle will forcefully defend and be proud of \na law that there is little to be proud of that really is not able to be \ndefended because the implications of the side effects have been \ndevastating to many, and especially to Americans who have gotten their \ninsurance canceled and find their only choice is more expensive \ninsurance, higher copays, and higher deductibles. But for families all \nacross the country, when a mother finds she cannot take her child to \nthat pediatrician--the one who has known that child since the baby was \nborn--now, because of the health care law, she cannot take her child to \nthat pediatrician, they cannot go to the hospital in their community; \nthey have to drive distances, instead, because of the health care law, \nwhich was intended to help people but has ended up hurting, in my \nopinion, more people than it has helped.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak with regard to \nObamaCare. The good Senator from Wyoming made compelling points, as did \nthe Senator from Indiana before him.\n  What I would like to do is to start for a minute by reading from some \nletters I have received from constituents in my State with regard to \nObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. These are from hard-working \npeople who are trying to figure out what to do about their health \ninsurance with ObamaCare in place. I think really those are the voices \nthat speak louder than any others--the voices of people from across \nthis great country who live in all of our States--and they are writing \nto Members of this body and say: Hey, here is what I am experiencing. \nSo this is not just coming down and expressing an opinion on the \nAffordable Care Act. This is what people are saying. This is what they \nare telling us. I think it is very important we take the time to listen \nand to understand the very real difficulties they are having with \nsomething that is so vitally important to all of us, and that is health \ninsurance.\n  I would like to start by reading some of these letters. The first one \nis from somebody who lives in the Fargo area. They start out:\n\n       I live in West Fargo and my Employer is based out of South \n     Dakota.\n       In 2011 I obtained my own Family Health Care Insurance due \n     to a job change and my new employer's Health Care coverage \n     seemed excessive. In doing this I found coverage as follows:\n\n  So they signed up for a policy that is an 80/20 copay, with a $1,000 \ndeductible, with a $4,000 out-of-pocket maximum, with monthly premiums \nof just over $800--$809. That was provided through Blue Cross Blue \nShield.\n  The individual goes on to write:\n\n       At the time this was more than $300 less costly than my new \n     employer's monthly premium for similar coverage.\n       I recently received a notice from [Blue Cross Blue Shield] \n     that my coverage will be discontinued on May 1st, 2014 due to \n     the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  So they received a notice that their insurance is being discontinued \ndue to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n       Listed below are the options which are most similar to my \n     current coverage:\n\n  Now, instead of an 80/20 copay, it is a 70/30 copay, so the copay is \nhigher. There is a $2,000 deductible. So instead of a $1,000 \ndeductible, that doubled. Now it is a $2,000 deductible. There is a \n$9,000 out-of-pocket maximum, compared to what this individual had \nbefore, which was a $4,000 out-of-pocket maximum. So it more than \ndoubled the out-of-pocket maximum. There is a monthly premium of \n$1,625. That is compared to an $809 premium. So the premium doubled. So \nfor a higher copay, for a higher deductible, for a higher out-of-pocket \nmaximum, they are paying double the premium. If they wanted to go to \nanother policy, it was an even higher deductible.\n  The individual goes on to say:\n\n       We are NOT eligible for Tax Credits because my employer \n     offers affordable health coverage.\n\n  So because the employer offers a policy, this individual is not \neligible for any tax credits.\n\n       At this point my best option is to obtain my employer's \n     health coverage. However Open enrollment is not until August \n     2014.\n\n  So the individual has to wait until August.\n\n       My HR department along with my current Insurance Specialist \n     has contacted [Blue Cross Blue Shield] and asked that this be \n     considered a ``Life Changing Event'' so I can join the \n     employer plan by the May 1st deadline. They will not classify \n     it as such. I asked if I could pay some type of early sign on \n     fee. They indicated that is not an option.\n       So if I cannot join my employer's plan, my BEST options for \n     coverage are those options listed above--\n\n  The ones I just read--\n\n     which are at best a 37% increase--\n\n  ``[A]t best a 37% increase''--\n\n     in monthly premium with a 110% or more increase in deductible \n     and out of pocket max.\n\n  So let me say that one more time. This individual's best options now \nwith the Affordable Care Act are a 37-percent increase in the monthly \npremium, with a 110-percent or more increase in the deductible and the \nout-of-pocket maximum.\n  Then the individual finishes:\n\n       Do you see my frustration?\n\n  This is just one of the letters we have received, but it is \nrepresentative of so many others.\n  How can that be an affordable care act? How is that affordable care?\n  Here is another one.\n\n       My insurance premium tripled for less coverage. I thought \n     our insurance was supposed to stay the same if we had it. . . \n     . Please put a stop to it! It isn't right to make people pay \n     for something they may not be able to afford. I already had \n     health insurance! I also send money to my sister to help with \n     her baby. Now I won't be able to do that.\n\n  That is another letter--a real person, a real situation.\n  Here is one:\n\n       To Our Elected Representatives; We petition you not as \n     Democrats, Republicans, Independents or members of any \n     special interest group, but as concerned taxpayers. We urge \n     of all of our elected representatives to vote against this \n     administration's health care plan. The nonpartisan \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost will \n     be more than $1 trillion over 10 years and we know from \n     experience that it will cost far more than any government \n     estimate.\n\n  Well, these stories go on, and I know I have colleagues who are \nwaiting to speak, as well, during this time slot. So rather than \ncontinue to go through these letters--and I have many more; I brought \nmore than I anticipated reading today--I will come back again and read \nsome more of these.\n  But I want to conclude with what I believe is the right approach, and \nI think it is something Republicans are talking about and have been \ntalking about and will continue to talk about. So when we come down and \nsay the Affordable Care Act is not working, do not just take our word \nfor it. Listen to the people from across this country who are writing \nto us and telling us their very real stories. Sometimes you hear: Well, \nbut you don't have a solution. That is wrong. We do. We absolutely have \na solution, and we have talked about it over and over on this floor and \nin every other venue where someone is willing to listen.\n  We need to implement a comprehensive approach, and we need to do it \non a step-by-step basis so people understand it and know exactly what \nwe are putting in place. It needs to be an approach that empowers \npeople to make their own choices--their own choices--about their health \ncare insurance and their health care providers. Again, I want to repeat \nthat: They choose their own policy and their health care providers.\n  It includes market-based reforms that promote competition, that will \nhelp increase choice, not reduce choice, and competition that will help \nbring prices down, not see them continue to spike higher. It includes \naspects such as tort reform, to reduce the cost of health care. It \nincludes allowing insurance companies to sell policies across State \nlines. It includes expanding health savings accounts, so individuals \ncan combine high-deductible health care policies with a tax-deductible \nsavings account. It includes reform of Medicare and Medicaid, to give \nStates more control and to encourage the kind of reforms that will \nimprove service, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.\n  That is the kind of approach that truly serves the American public. \nThat\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nis the kind of approach we will continue to work, on behalf of the \ncitizens of our respective States in this great Nation, to put in \nplace.\n  With that, I see my esteemed colleague from the great State of \nMississippi is in the Chamber. I yield for the good Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, my impressions of the so-called Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act are that it is too costly, too \ncomplex, and too intrusive.\n  Small business owners in my State have been particularly vocal about \nhaving to choose between making payroll or paying the increasing costs \nof insurance.\n  Many small business owners would like to provide health insurance for \ntheir workers but are finding the premium costs are just too expensive. \nA small business owner in Hattiesburg, for example, who in the past \npaid 100 percent of the premiums for his employees was recently \ninformed of a 21-percent increase in these costs. He is having to \nchoose between reducing staff or shifting the health insurance costs to \nhis employees.\n  Another constituent from Southhaven reported to me that his son's \nwork hours were cut to fewer than 30 per week so that his employer \nwould not be forced to purchase insurance coverage. With his hours \nreduced, he cannot afford the private insurance that he had hoped to be \nable to purchase.\n  The administration has struggled to implement several of the health \ncare law's mandates. Billions of dollars have been spent on a flawed \nenrollment system that has not made significant progress in reducing \nthe number of uninsured Americans. The stories I have heard from my \nState confirm for me that the Affordable Care Act is an unfixable and \nexpensive mess, and it should be repealed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \ncase involving ObamaCare and an Idaho resident. She has asked me to \nstate her case. It is one of many such cases that I have. I did not \npick this one because it is the most egregious or anything else. I \npicked it because this is an effect that ObamaCare is having on \nordinary American people, people who deserve better, people who deserve \na government that will help them and will leave them alone when leaving \nalone is the right thing to do.\n  She writes to me and says that her husband's company will no longer \nbe offering health insurance next year. Of course, that is the result \nof ObamaCare. We have all heard the reasons why many companies are \nabandoning offering health care to their employees. Be that as it may--\nand there is a lot of reasons for that, none of which are good--these \npeople are caught in this spot.\n  Right now, through her husband's business, they are paying $700 a \nmonth. They get 80-percent coverage for that $700 a month. Their \ndeductible is $2,500 each. They are told, through the exchange, through \nwhich they have shopped in Idaho, that the new coverage they are going \nto get is going to cost them $1,400 a month. So that is exactly double \nwhat they are paying now.\n  One would think you would get double benefits, right? Wrong. Because \nof the government involvement in this, instead of 80-percent coverage, \nthey are going to get 70-percent coverage. Instead of a $2,500 \ndeductible, they are going to have a $5,000 deductible.\n  Well, who are these people? They are ordinary, regular American \npeople. They are 60 years old. They do not qualify for a tax subsidy. \nThey tell me that now the cost of their health insurance is going to be \nthree times what they are paying for the cost of their house. They told \nme: Senator, we are not extravagant people. We live in a 1,400-square \nfoot house. We do not take vacations, never bought a new car, raised \nour kids, and saved for their educations. Both of us went to college.\n  They talk about how they taught their children to pay their taxes and \nto work hard and be contributing members of society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Republicans has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time do we have on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats control the next 45 minutes.\n\n\n                         College Affordability\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this week Democrats are going to \ncontinue the conversation about college affordability. I was joining \nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, \nAl Franken of Minnesota and many others--in fact, 24 others, to \nintroduce the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.\n  Why are we talking about student loans? Ask working families; ask \ntheir kids why we are talking about it. Because there is more student \nloan debt in America today than there is credit card debt. It is huge. \nIt is growing. If you finished college a few years back like me and had \na student loan that worried you, you would not believe what students \nare facing today.\n  The average student coming out of college: $25,000 in debt. Imagine \nsitting down at the desk in the college admissions office at age 19 as \nthey push the papers across the desk to you and ask you to sign up for \n$10,000, $15,000 or $20,000 in loans so that you can start your class \non Monday. There you sit with $20,000 in loans to start your class on \nMonday. You are 19 years old.\n  Wait a minute. Mom and dad have to cosign them with you. That is not \nunusual. So now it is a family debt. I had a press conference in \nChicago on Monday. This wonderful woman came in and told the story \nabout how she and her husband with two sons were determined to get them \nboth through college. But she has not been able to do it. Do you know \nwhy? Because the first son took 5 years. She and her husband had to \nborrow the money to get him through school--good schools. But it is so \nmuch debt for their family that they cannot even consider allowing \ntheir other son to start college yet. He is waiting for his turn.\n  That is where we are in America today when it comes to college \neducation. If you did not happen to be wealthy or so smart that you get \neverything paid for, and you are stuck in the middle with working and \nmiddle-income families, you are facing debt challenges families have \nnever seen in the history of the United States.\n  There are 1.7 million Illinoisans--that is more than 10 percent of \nour population or almost 15 percent of the population of the State of \nIllinois--who have outstanding student loan debt--15 percent. That is 1 \nout of 6, 1 out of 7 people in my State with student loan debt.\n  Nationally, there are 40 million borrowers with more than $1 trillion \nin student loan debt. On the average, graduates of the class of 2012 \nleft with $28,000 in debt. But the individual debts are often much \nhigher. I have had students whom I have invited to come to my Web site \nand tell me their story. It is heartbreaking.\n  These students have debt of over $100,000 with a bachelor's degree. \nGod forbid they went to one of those for-profit colleges or \nuniversities. You know the ones I am talking about. They are the ones \nthat absolutely inundate you with advertising.\n  You cannot get on a CTA train or bus in Chicago without getting hit \nbetween the eyes with all of these for-profit colleges, for-profit \nschools. The biggest ones: The University of Phoenix, Kaplan, DeVry, \njust to mention a few. It is a different category. These are not the \npublic colleges and universities. They are not even private colleges \nand universities. They are for-profit schools.\n  Believe me, they make a profit. What is the difference between for-\nprofit schools and community colleges, the University of Illinois, \nDePaul University, Georgetown University? The difference is this. As a \ncategory, for-profit colleges and university have 10 percent of the \nhigh school graduates going to school, like the ones I mentioned. But \nthey receive 20 percent of the Federal aid to education. Why? They are \nso darned expensive. That is why. The\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\nstudents who sign up for these schools--these glamorous schools with \nall of the marketing--end up signing up for more debt than you can \nimagine--twice the debt of students that go to most other schools.\n  But here is the kicker. Here is the one the for-profit colleges and \nuniversities do not want to talk about: 46 percent of all the student \nloan defaults or student loan failure to pay off their loans--46 \npercent of them--students from for-profit colleges and universities.\n  Set that aside for a minute. As awful and scandalous as that is in \nthis country--the exploitation of these students and their families by \nschools which many times offer worthless diplomas, worthless degrees, \nand absolutely no ticket to a job--as bad as that is, let's talk about \nthe bigger picture, 90 percent of the other college students and what \nthey are facing.\n  They are borrowing money right and left. They are sinking themselves, \nand many times their families, more deeply in debt than they ever \nimagined, and they have no idea what they are getting into. You see, \nstudent loan debts are not like other debts. It is not like you \nborrowed money for a house, a car, a boat or a temporary loan to get \nby. Student loan debt is one of the few debts in America not \ndischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  What does that mean? No matter how bad things get for you or your \nfamily, no matter what economic tragedy comes your way, if you end up \nin bankruptcy court and try to clear the table and start over, you will \nnever, ever be able to discharge your student loan debt.\n  Oh, there is an extreme circumstance when you can. It is so extreme \nit almost never happens. So a student loan debt is a debt for a \nlifetime. You will either pay it off or you will carry it to the grave. \nThey actually execute--these debt collectors--on grandmothers on Social \nSecurity. I am not making it up. Grandma wanted to help her \ngranddaughter. She cosigned a student loan. The granddaughter dropped \nout of school, never paid back the loan, defaulted. They went after \ngranny's Social Security check on the student loan. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  That is why we have to change it. That is why the Democrats have come \nforward on this side of the aisle. We are waiting for our first \nRepublican to join us, to do something about refinancing college debt \nin America, to at least bring down the interest rates, to allow \nstudents to consolidate their loans at lower interest rates, so that \nthey will pay less in interest.\n  That poor family I told you about from Chicago where the mother came \nand testified, they could not let the second son start college because \nthey had never paid off the debt on the first son and could not see how \nthey would. Year after year they were churning thousands and thousands \nof dollars into payments all retiring interest and not retiring the \nprincipal. The interest just keeps piling up. God forbid you miss a \npayment. It is awful.\n  The bank on students refinancing bill, which Senator Elizabeth \nWarren, Jack Reed, and myself are bringing to this floor, will help \ncurrent borrowers take advantage of what we have in low interest rates \nright now. Those with Federal loans can refinance at the lower rate, \nthe same rate as students who are taking out their first loans this \nyear: 3.86 percent for undergraduate Direct Loans; 5.41 percent for \ngraduate loans; 6.41 percent for PLUS loans taken out by the student's \nparents.\n  Now, you are going to say: Those are not rock-bottom interest rates. \nBelieve me, they are a bargain in every category here against what \nthese students are facing today in paying off old debt. Many students \nwill find their interest rate on their loan cut in half. What does it \nmean? Those of us who borrowed some money in life to buy a home or buy \na car, a change in the interest rate of 3 or 4 percent gives you a \nchance to finally start reducing the principal. That is what we want to \ndo, so that this debt can be put behind these people.\n  Those who have private loans, many of which have sky-high interest \nrates, few protections for borrowers, at least in the version of the \nbill we have introduced, can refinance into Federal loans with lower \nrates and stronger consumer protections. You ought to hear what these \ncollection agencies do to students and their families when they do not \npay on these loans. You think you have had some problems on the \ntelephone with people calling and harassing you. They never quit. They \nneed their money. They want their money. They will not let you go no \nmatter what your circumstances.\n  This bill will allow young people to lower their payment by hundreds \nof thousands of dollars a year. They have a chance to actually get \nahead on their debt. What is more, the bill we are offering is fully \npaid for. Here is how we pay it. You know the name Warren Buffett, \nthird or fourth wealthiest man in America. I happen to know him. He \ncomes by and has lunch with us from time to time and talks about \nbusiness and investments.\n  But the one thing he wanted to talk about the most was something that \nhe thinks is fundamentally unfair. Do you know what it is? Warren \nBuffett came in here and said: Why is it that Warren Buffett, the \nbillionaire, has a lower income tax rate than his secretary?\n  Why? It is not fair. And it isn't fair. Because when profits in \nlife--his income in life--come from capital gains, it is treated at a \nlower tax rate than ordinary income, which his secretary receives.\n  So Warren Buffett has said: For goodness' sake, I shouldn't pay a \nlower tax rate than my secretary.\n  So we put in what is called the Buffett rule, so there will be at \nleast a minimum income tax charge for millionaires so they pay at least \nas much of an income tax rate as their secretaries. Does it sound \nradical? I don't think so. I think it sounds reasonable and so does Mr. \nBuffett.\n  We take the revenue that comes in from charging the millionaires--\nthat we just talked about under the Buffett rule--and we apply it to \nthe refinancing of college debt. That is how we achieved this. That is \nhow we get it done.\n  This bill would help people such as Grace Steging. She is from \nChampaign and just recently wrote me a letter. She took out a $33,000 \nFederal student loan to get a degree in special education, and she is \njust completing her first year as a teacher in a low-income school \ndistrict in Central Illinois. In her letter she said: ``I am shocked \nand distressed at the way my student loan debt continues to multiply \neven through I graduated a year ago.''\n  She tells me she made her payments faithfully each time every month, \nbut even so her payments continue to rise as the interest rate accrues. \nIt is a shame that even with a degree from a respected school and a \ngood, secure job, Grace can't save money and she can't keep up with her \nstudent loans. She wrote and said:\n\n       Senator, I am not a banker or a businessperson, I was born \n     to teach. . . . Shall I teach my students to follow their \n     dreams or to follow the money?\n\n  It is a good question. Reasonable borrowing has always been part of \ngetting a higher education for many Americans. I know this story \npersonally because I was a beneficiary.\n  The National Defense Education Act was passed in this Chamber in \n1958, when Congress was scared to death. Scared by what? Scared by a \nbasketball-size satellite that the Russians had launched called \nSputnik, and it was beeping as it went around the world. We thought it \nwas the end of life as we knew it because we knew the Russians had the \nbomb. Now they were in outer space and we weren't--1957.\n  So this Chamber met with the House and said we have to do something. \nOne of the first things we are going to do, we are going to get more \nAmericans in college. We need better trained, better educated Americans \nto fight the Soviets and to make sure we don't lose the space battle.\n  Along came the National Defense Education Act, and it opened the door \nfor me to borrow the money to go to college and law school and pay it \nback over 10 years with 3 percent interest.\n  I paid it back. I didn't think I could because it seemed like a huge \namount of money at the time. I will not tell you the amount because it \nwill date me, but I will tell you today students don't face the same \ncircumstances. The debt they face is so dramatic.\n  Jon and his wife from Chicago recently contacted my office. They both \nwent to great, not-for-profit public\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nschools for their undergraduate studies. Jon went on to law school. His \nwife went on to medical school.\n  Jon is a first-year lawyer in a firm. His wife is in her second year \nof medical residency. They received good educations from respectable \nschools and now they have jobs in their fields.\n  Let me tell you what else they have. They have a combined student \ndebt, Jon and his wife, of $300,000 on student loans. They pay $1,300 a \nmonth in student loan payments. Thankfully, they will participate in \nthe Federal income-based repayment program, which moderates their \npayments, but here they are, just starting out, maybe with a family and \na $300,000 debt.\n  How can they buy a house? They have explored it. No bank will come \nnear them to even loan them the money for a house. That, to me, is what \nis disgraceful--not only that these students end up coming out of \nschool in debt, they are postponing their lives. They are postponing \nmarriage, children, homes, and cars.\n  Many of them are moving right back in with mom and dad in that \nbasement apartment, because dad just came out of retirement to help \nthem pay off the loan. I am not making this up. These are real stories \nthat I run into.\n  One of the other ones I mentioned earlier, Hannah Moore--or at least \nI want to make a reference to Hannah Moore. I spoke about her on the \nfloor. She is from Chicago and what a sweet young lady. She made a \nfatal mistake. She went to one of these for-profit colleges in Chicago \ncalled the Harrington College of Design--great advertising if you have \nseen it. Do you know what her reward for pursuing the American dream by \nseeking a college education at this for-profit school was? It was \n$124,570 in student debt, much of it in private loans for what is \nbasically a worthless--worthless--diploma from a for-profit college.\n  Her story isn't unique. I just saw her last Monday and her debt has \ngone up. It is now over $150,000. This poor, attractive, smart, and \ndetermined young woman doesn't know where to turn. Her life looks like \na brick wall when she looks ahead. I think she is 30, maybe 32.\n  Can you imagine. This is what she has in store, having thought she \ndid the right thing, went to that college and got this degree which she \nthought was worth something. It turned out it wasn't.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank in New York warns us student debt isn't just \na student problem, it is a national problem. It threatens Americans in \nterms of investing in our future, investing in homes, investing in \nbusinesses, and it even threatens their future retirement security. \nHannah's father had to come out of retirement to help pay off the \nbills.\n  In addition to last week's refinancing proposal, Senators Warren, \nJack Reed, and I have several proposals to address student debt and \ncollege affordability, a bill that would give colleges financial \nincentives not to overload students with debt.\n  We have also introduced the Student Loan Borrowers' Bill of Rights \nAct. I think there ought to be an open, complete disclosure to students \nabout the debt they are getting into. If there is a better alternative, \ntaking government loans that you can consolidate at a lower interest \nrate as opposed to a private loan which rips you off with a high \ninterest rate--some of this is very basic.\n  Senator Harkin and I introduced a bill to bring better coordination \nand focus to Federal oversight for for-profit colleges and \nuniversities. It is called the Proprietary Education Oversight \nCoordination Improvement Act. It is a long title for a bill that \nbasically is trying to come to grips with the scandalous behavior of \nfor-profit colleges and universities.\n  For too many young Americans, the promise of a fair shot at \naffordable college education has become a long shot. That is not the \nAmerican way. We want to have an educated generation prepared to lead \nthis country. They cannot do that saddled with debt and going to \nworthless schools.\n  It is time for this generation to step up, allow these students to \nrefinance their debt to get their lives back in order and to start \nlooking ahead with some promise and hope and get their parents out from \nunder the debt burden they assume with their kids. Stop the rip-offs \nthat are coming from these for-profit colleges and universities and put \nan end to some of the rip-offs, even by semigovernment agencies.\n  All of these things have to come to an end, and it will only happen \nif we do it--and it will only happen if we do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  I hope my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, \nwill join our efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. COONS. I come to the floor to speak about a real opportunity that \nwe have this week in this Congress and in this Senate to come together \nin a bipartisan way to adopt measures that will actually create jobs \nand help grow our economy.\n  This week we are considering tax extenders, a package of bills that \ncan do a lot of good for the middle class, our economy, and our Nation. \nTogether, various proposals in the tax extenders would spur investment \nin manufacturing, clean energy, and innovation, make it easier for \nfamilies to afford a home or to send their children to college, open \ncareer pathways for veterans, and bring investments in jobs to \ncommunities in need. They recently passed by a voice vote out of the \nFinance Committee in the Senate, sending an important signal that we \ncan come together, Democrats and Republicans, to move our economy \nforward.\n  I mentioned innovation and manufacturing in particular as two of the \npolicies this broader package helps promote. I would like to discuss \ntwo important bipartisan policies in this package, bills that have been \nrolled into the extenders package that can do a lot of good for \nstartups and for innovative small manufacturers and for firms that \ninvest heavily in the research and development that is needed to yield \ngroundbreaking discoveries and steadily grow manufacturing employment \nin the United States.\n  R, research and development, is the cornerstone of any competitive \ncompany, and I would suggest country. In the 21st century for us to \nhave and sustain an innovative economy, it is certainly the cornerstone \nof our Nation's future. That is why, for a number of years, bipartisan \nmajorities in Congress have supported the R tax credit so innovative \ncompanies are incentivized to keep investing in critically needed R, \nin new ideas, and in new products, but there has long been a problem \nwith the structure of the R credit. It doesn't reach early stage \nstartup companies, those that are most innovative and those that have \nthe greatest promise to grow.\n  As the GAO has reported, over half of the current R credit goes to \nfirms making over $1 billion. Although they are important as well, it \nhas become clear we are missing an opportunity to incentivize the most \ninnovative, smallest startup companies, especially in manufacturing, an \nindustry that I know invests a huge amount in R but has had a \nchallenging environment competitively and globally in the past decade \nbecause the R credit is a credit and not a tax--and is a credit only \nif you have a tax liability, only if your company is profitable. A \npreprofitable company can't access it.\n  If you are a small business that pays AMT, while there are many \ncredits you could claim, the R isn't one of them, even though it is \nso important to our commitment. This leaves out firms at the early \nstage, where they are facing the highest risk of failure but who are \nalso the kind of technology-focused, early stage, high-growth, high-\npotential businesses that have generated more net jobs than any other \narea of our economy in this century.\n  These firms, that are sometimes called gazelle firms, are young \ninnovative businesses with the potential to explode in size and create \nhundreds or thousands of jobs. Think of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in \na California garage starting what would become Apple or think of Rick \nBirkmeyer or Ray Yin in Delaware, my home State.\n  Rick Birkmeyer is an entrepreneur who has started a number of \nsuccessful biotech companies in the Delaware region. He is someone with \na reputation as a leader in his field. Even so, raising capital for a \nnew startup venture is always a challenge. Rick today is the founder of \nCD Diagnostics, a leader in biomarker research and biochemical\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\ntest development that makes tests to tell if a joint is infected or \nmerely irritated. These tests would help orthopedic surgeons determine \nif surgery is needed and avoid a great deal of expensive and sometimes \nunnecessary exploratory procedures. The company is only a few years old \nand began with one employee. Today they have 82 and believe they will \nhave well over 170 in just 2 more years.\n  Exponential hockey stick-like growth such as this is great, but if he \nand his company were able to use the R credit before they reach \nprofitability, they would be able to hire more people, grow more \nquickly by investing in equipment, and get products to market faster.\n  Another young Delaware company that would benefit from the tax credit \nis ANP of Newark, DE. I sat next to its CEO Ray Yin at the Wesley \nCollege graduation this weekend, where he gave the keynote address. \nRay's company, ANP, began with just one employee--him. Today it is a \nleader in making nanotherapeutics and in biodefense technology that is \naffordable, wearable, and easy to use, whether testing against \nbiochemical agents in the war setting or food-borne illnesses or water \ncontamination at home.\n  Both of these two companies make terrific, compelling, technology-\nbased products, have managed their cash well, and are great examples of \nhow to run a startup. But for each of them they went through a very \ndemanding period from their first capital investment to when they had \nreliable revenue coming in. That is often called the valley of death or \nthe gap between launch and sustainability. They would be farther along, \nmore mature, and more robust if they had been able to access the R \ncredit with their early expenditures.\n  Over the past few years I have been working diligently with a group \nof fellow Senators, Republicans and Democrats, to find ways that we \ncould work together to reshape and target a portion of the R credit \nto make it accessible to these sorts of early stage companies.\n  I want to give particular credit to Republican Senator Mike Enzi of \nWyoming, who has been tireless and thoughtful. We have not always \nagreed--we come from quite different political perspectives--but his \ninvestment of time and thoughtfulness in crafting the final outcome of \nthe Startup Innovation Credit Act is worthy of thanks and a compliment.\n  Senator Schumer on the Finance Committee has helped move the R \ncredit revision forward into the tax extenders package.\n  Manufacturing Jobs for America is a broader initiative that more than \n26 Senators have participated in that includes more than 33 bills. This \nbill, the Startup Innovation Credit Act, is one of them, one of many \nbipartisan bills that can help manufacturers to grow, can help them to \ninvest, and can help them get through a critical, early stage period.\n  Mr. Pat Roberts, Republican Senator of Kansas, has also worked with \nme, as well as with Senators Enzi and Schumer, on a revision to the R \ncredit that isn't available to firms, mostly small businesses, that pay \nthe AMT, so we changed that as well. Both of these provisions have been \nadopted into the tax extender package.\n  I also wanted to mention the first one I referenced, the Startup \nInnovation Credit Act, was also supported and has been moved forward \nwith contributions by Senators Rubio, Blunt, Stabenow, Moran, and \nKaine.\n  This is a terrific way for us to find a path forward for companies \nthat are still too early in their development to pay employment taxes \nbut to use a fix that allows them to claim the R credit against \nemployment taxes when they aren't yet paying income taxes.\n  This kind of credit has been used before in States such as Iowa, \nArizona, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. And they have been \ngame changers--helping new firms to open their doors, to hire more \nworkers, and to keep their doors open. By allowing companies to claim \nthe R credit against either the AMT or their payroll tax obligations, \nwe don't pick winners and losers and we don't focus on a specific area \nof the economy or technology. What we are doing instead is supporting \nany private sector firm that invests in research and development. It \nmeans cash in the pockets of small startup companies, which can make a \ncritical difference, especially when financing and credit are tight.\n  Together, these bipartisan proposals can do a lot to put more \nAmericans to work today unleashing the innovations that will create the \njobs of tomorrow. I believe the Federal role in research and innovation \nis fundamental. It is also bipartisan.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \npartnership and collaboration. I specifically thank the chair of the \nFinance Committee Senator Ron Wyden for his leadership in ensuring that \nthe tax extenders package is available for us to consider now on the \nfloor, that these provisions were included, and for his support for \nmoving forward on these vital job-creating proposals.\n  Now let's work together in this Chamber to move across the finish \nline and get the job done so America can get more of our best people to \nwork.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Supporting Law Enforcement\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize the men and \nwomen of law enforcement across this Nation in the annual police week \nceremonies. From last night's candlelight vigil to tomorrow's wreath-\nlaying ceremony, we here in the Capitol offer our gratitude, our \nthanks, and our support to the men and women of law enforcement and \ntheir families.\n  I wish to comment for a few moments today on how difficult it was \nearlier today to be a Member of this body as two different Senators, \nwho are strong supporters of law enforcement, came to this floor in an \nattempt to move forward important pieces of legislation only to have \nthat effort blocked.\n  Earlier today Senator Patrick Leahy, the President pro tempore and \nthe chair of the Judiciary Committee, came to the floor to seek \nunanimous consent to move forward the Federal bulletproof vest \npartnership reauthorization bill that came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland came to the floor to seek \nunanimous consent to move forward with the bipartisan Blue Alert bill. \nI am a cosponsor of both bills. Both have very broad support within the \nlaw enforcement community, and both are bipartisan bills. Yet, in each \ncase, one Senator--one Senator--objected to our proceeding to \nconsideration of these bills.\n  I want to share with those of us here in the Chamber that earlier \ntoday, at a hearing in the Judiciary Committee considering again the \nvalue and the impact of the Federal bulletproof vest partnership, we \nhad a chance to hear from Officer Ann Carrizales from Texas, who gave \nriveting, moving testimony about how a bulletproof vest, provided to \nher by her smalltown department in Texas, saved her life when she was \nshot at point-blank range in a routine traffic stop very early in the \nmorning. Today her husband would be a widower and her daughter an \norphan were it not for this vital Federal-State-local partnership that \nhas provided more than 1 million bulletproof vests over the many years \nit has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\n  With us this morning were two Delaware Capitol police officers, \nSergeant Mike Manley and Corporal Steve Rinehart. With them as well was \nChief Horsman of the capitol police department. Both of these brave \nofficers were on duty in the lobby of the New Castle County courthouse \nlast year when a gunman entered the chamber and started firing at \nrandom. They were both shot, and they both survived because of \nbulletproof vests provided to them in part through this Federal-State \npartnership.\n  We cannot let down the men and women of law enforcement. We should \nnot let partisan politics and ideology in this Chamber prevent us from \nmoving forward in a bipartisan way to deliver the officer-safety \ninvestments and improvements that have already cleared the Judiciary \nCommittee, that already have bipartisan support from both sides of the \naisle, and allow one individual to continue to hold up these important \nbills.\n  It is my call to my colleagues that we work tirelessly together to \nmake sure we overcome this needless obstruction and move forward this \nweek to honor the service and sacrifice of those 268 law enforcement \nofficers whose names have been added to the memorial this year and the \nhundreds of\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\nthousands of others who even today, even tonight will be on patrol \nkeeping America safe.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Crisis in Ukraine\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, one of the protagonists of Leo Tolstoy's \nepic ``War and Peace'' is the iconic Russian general Mikhail Kutuzov. \nKutuzov was brought out of retirement to be the commander in chief of \nRussian forces during Napoleon's invasion, and his unorthodox strategy \nconfounded and frustrated his superiors and his underlings alike. He \nbecomes convinced, as Tolstoy depicts, that Napoleon will lose the war \nby overextending his army. He believes by playing the long game he will \nexhaust and defeat the seemingly invincible, unstoppable French army.\n  Tolstoy creates a fictionalized version of Kutuzov, of course, but \none of the most famous passages from ``War and Peace'' is worth \nrepeating here today. Speaking of those who doubt his strategy, Kutuzov \nsays:\n\n       Patience and time are my warriors, my champions.\n\n  Again, quoting from the book:\n\n       He [Kutuzov] knew that an apple should not be plucked while \n     it is green. It will fall of itself when ripe, but if picked \n     unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree is harmed, and your \n     teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman, Kutuzov \n     knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the \n     whole strength of Russia could have wounded it.\n\n  Whether or not this famous Russian general ever shared this exact \nsentiment, it is representative of a time when the Russians better than \nanyone on Earth knew how to play the long game. How times have changed.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have listened in agony to my Republican \nfriends criticizing the Obama administration for having no coherent \npolicy regarding the current crisis in Ukraine. I come to the floor \ntoday to rebut that argument and also to add a few suggestions on how \nthe administration's policy can be enhanced.\n  I certainly understand the Republicans' frustrations. News of the \nongoing daily drama in Ukraine dominates the national news. Russia \nseems omnipresent, manipulating events on the ground by the hour, and \nthere clearly has not been a proportional pound-for-pound response from \nthe United States or the collective West. This frustration is fed by \nmemories of the Cold War--obsolete, even ancient memories given how \nfast the world has changed since 1991. But the President's critics, \nfueled by these largely irrelevant memories, insist that when Russia \nacts, we must meet fire with fire--crippling unilateral sanctions \nimmediately, lethal arms for Ukrainian military, new missile capacity \nin Eastern Europe.\n  The problem is that this is a strategy for 1964, not 2014. Russia \nsimply doesn't matter to us in the same way it used to. They are a \nsecondary world power whose power is diminishing. Their demographics \nare catastrophic, their economy can't survive the inevitable global \nenergy revolution, and their endemic corruption is going to rot their \nsociety from inside out. The invasions of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine \nare signs of Russian weakness, Russian insecurity, not Russian \nstrength.\n  Last fall, two former Russian Republics, Georgia and Moldova, refused \nRussian overtures to join their nascent economic union and inked \npreliminary agreements to join the European Union. Ukraine, at the last \nminute, bowed to Russian bullying and refused to ink the same deal, but \nit set off a series of events that pushed Russia's man in Kiev out of \noffice.\n  In a panicked reaction, Russia invaded, and the consequences have \nbeen devastating. Russia's economy is in free fall, with nearly $70 \nbillion of capital leaving the country in just the last few months \nalone. No major institutional investors will touch Russia today with a \n10-foot pole. To make matters worse, Russia has been kicked out of the \nG8 and generally has become an international pariah, not allowed at the \ntable with major powers. Russia is increasingly isolated at the United \nNations. And things are going to get even worse as the Europeans use \nthis crisis as a wake-up call to make themselves truly energy \nindependent of Russian energy and also to reinvigorate NATO.\n  In ``War and Peace,'' Kutuzov goes on to say this of his critics:\n\n       They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and \n     we shall see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances! What \n     for? Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. \n     They are like children from whom one can't get any sensible \n     account of what has happened because they all want to show us \n     how well they can fight. But that's not what is needed now.\n\n  The story of ``War and Peace'' and the Russian-French war is not \nentirely a useful parallel to the current crisis in Ukraine or to the \nproper response of the United States. What is needed now is much more \nthan just patience and time. But our response needs to be proportional \nto our Nation's national security interests, not proportional to \nRussia's actions in their backyard. That is why the administration is \nright to strongly support this new Ukrainian Government without \noverreacting in a way that could compromise our relationship with other \nnations or make the situation worse, not better, on the ground in \nUkraine.\n  I would like to take a few minutes this evening to lay out what a \ncoherent, thoughtful approach to the crisis might look like and how, in \nfact, the actions of the Obama administration largely follow this \npretty simple outline.\n  First, as Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenuk has been quick to \ntell visiting dignitaries, the most important help the United States \ncan provide is economic assistance, conditioned on necessary reforms to \nshow the Ukrainian people that a Western-oriented government can \ndeliver prosperity to their country.\n  Russia has effectively invented a new form of warfare that is based \non gradual provocation, where Putin uses psychological methods, \nintimidation, bribery, and propaganda to undermine resistance so that \nfirepower is rarely needed to get his way. But of course these tactics \nonly work on vulnerable countries with weak economies and a \nsusceptibility to Russian overtures of economic overlordship and \ncorruption. So the best way to repel Russian provocations is to \nstrengthen the Ukrainian economy and government institutions both for \nthe short and long run. The $1 billion in loan guarantees authorized by \nCongress and the $17 billion loan approved by the IMF and brokered by \nthe United States are an important part of that process, and the \nconditions imposed--which include a floating exchange rate, steep \nincreases in gas tariffs, and budget reductions over the next several \nyears--represent some of the tough medicine necessary to get Ukraine \nback on its feet.\n\n  The United States hasn't sat on the sidelines when it comes to \neconomic aid to Ukraine. We have led from day one, and the results are \nimpossible to deny.\n  Second, let's recognize what military assistance makes sense and what \nmilitary assistance does not make sense. It makes sense to shore up our \ntreaty obligations in Eastern and Central Europe by positioning more \ntroops in places such as the Baltics and Poland and Romania. Just in \ncase the Russians were thinking of trying to use these types of \ndestabilizing tactics in NATO countries, make them think twice. But \nremember that Ukraine is not a NATO ally; we have no obligation to \ndefend their sovereignty, and it is totally unrealistic and indeed \nirresponsible to think that we can make up for decades of military \nneglect and mismanagement inside Ukraine with a few million dollars of \naid today.\n  Ukraine doesn't need more small arms. Their problem isn't that they \ndon't have them; their problem is that they don't know how to shoot \nthem. There is no way the Ukrainians can effectively utilize more \nsophisticated weaponry like anti-tank and anti-aircraft artillery. The \nonly way they could do that is with military advisers standing side by \nside with Ukrainians, and there is really no appetite here in the \nUnited States to commit personnel to a ground war in Ukraine.\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\n  To be clear, I don't offer these cautions because of a danger of \nprovoking Russia with an influx of U.S. arms. Russia is going to do \nwhat Russia is going to do in Eastern Ukraine regardless of what small \ninvestment the United States makes today in Ukraine.\n  But I do worry that since any lethal assistance from the United \nStates would have little to no effect on the ability of Ukraine to \nrepel a Russian invasion, a Russian victory over the Ukrainian army, \nbacked by U.S. weapons, would then be sold by Putin to his public as a \nRussian military triumph over the United States. That is a truly bad \noutcome, but that shouldn't stop us from more quickly delivering \nnonlethal support to help bolster the Ukrainian military in the short \nterm--reasonable support such as body armor and communications \nequipment--that balances our limited direct interest in Ukraine with \nour humanitarian interest in saving lives. There is a middle ground \nbetween just sending a handful more MREs and sending tanks or automatic \nweapons, and we have had ample time to explore those options.\n  Over the medium and longer term we need to work with Ukraine to \nrebuild its military institutions that were neglected for so many years \nby its leaders who were pilfering from the state rather than providing \nfor the country's defense forces.\n  Third, focus, focus, focus on the May 25 elections. The Russians \noccupy dozens--not thousands--of buildings in Eastern Ukraine. They \nhave no hold or influence on other sections of the country near and to \nthe west of Kiev.\n  As part of the international effort, the United States has committed \nmillions of dollars and thousands of hours of manpower into making sure \nthe May 25 election is held in a free and fair manner. The Russians \nwill likely do everything possible to stop this election from coming \noff. As of today they effectively have no straw man in the race, and so \nmore likely than not the result will be a victory for a free, whole, \nsovereign Ukraine and a damaging blow to Russia's claims that Ukraine \ncan't govern itself. Our State Department representatives in Ukraine \nare working feverishly to help Ukraine conduct this election, and we \nhave helped deploy unprecedented resources from the OSCE to make sure \nRussia cannot dislodge this election from occurring. That is American \nleadership happening right now on the ground in Ukraine.\n  Fourth, let's be crystal clear on what will lead to the next logical \nlevel of U.S. sanctions, which would be industrywide, sectoral \nsanctions against the Russian economy. We have moved deliberately so \nfar because, wisely, President Obama has desired to move in relative \nconcert with our European allies. But it is increasingly clear to me \nand to many others that Europe is simply not prepared to move at the \npace necessary to send a strong message to Russia about the \nconsequences of their continued aggression.\n  So having primarily mounted a defense of the administration's policy \nin Ukraine so far today, I would make one additional, significant \nsuggestion for amendment of this policy. I believe the highest levels \nof American foreign policy leadership, from the President, to the Vice \nPresident, to the Secretary of State, should make it clear today to \nRussia, right now, that if the May 25 elections do not occur in a free \nand fair manner, we will hold Russia--and only Russia--responsible \nbecause if not for their interference, there can be no explanation for \nwhy these elections could not come off properly.\n  Further, we should make it clear that if the May 25 election is not \nallowed by Russia to be conducted according to OSCE electoral \nstandards, the United States will immediately impose sectoral sanctions \non the most important Russian industries, including but not limited \nto the Russian banking, energy, and raw materials sectors.\n\n  Hopefully, significant Russian interference in the elections would \nprompt Europe to act with us in order to protect our most important \ndemocratic values, but we can't wait for them any longer. Let's make it \ntotally, completely, unequivocally clear today that if the May 25 \nelection doesn't occur, the United States will move toward industry-\nlevel sanctions against Russia.\n  This is and can be a coherent, thoughtful U.S. strategy toward the \ncrisis in Ukraine: Support Ukraine economically. Strengthen NATO. Don't \noverreact with reckless military aid to the Ukrainians. Do everything \npossible to make the May 25 election a success. Be clearer than current \npolicy on what will trigger sectoral sanctions by the United States. \nAnd then act if Russia doesn't listen.\n  I get it that this isn't all my Republican colleagues desire when it \ncomes to U.S. policy toward Ukraine, but overreacting to this crisis is \njust as bad, if not worse, than doing nothing. I was in Kiev at the \nvery beginning, standing on stage at the Maidan with Senator McCain, \nurging the Ukrainian people to demand more from their government. I was \nhere, advocating for a robust U.S. response to support these \nprotesters. I believed, as I still believe, the United States should be \nplaying an active role in this crisis, and I was making this argument \nbefore anyone else in this Chamber. But this isn't the Cold War. This \nis a fight in Russia's backyard, and the cold hard reality is that the \nstakes are just simply greater for Moscow than they are for us. And the \nworld is no longer organized around who is with the United States and \nwho is with Russia. The foundational paradigms of global security now \nare about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't. Who is allied with \nthe Shia and who is allied with the Sunni. Where are the Islamist \nterrorists organizing and who is helping them.\n  I don't mean to say that unchecked Russian action doesn't have global \nconsequences. It does. China, for instance, is certainly watching to \nsee if nations pay a price when they reset their borders through \naggression rather than through diplomacy. But we ultimately won the \nCold War by playing the long game. We knew that if we held true to \ndemocratic and free market values, the world would notice that an \nalliance with us was far more beneficial than an alliance with the \nSoviet Union. That, in fact, is the very reason for the current crisis. \nThe Ukrainian people revolted because they saw the value of a Western \neconomic and political orientation. We didn't need to use intimidation \nor bribery or little green men; we just showed them that our stuff is \nbetter.\n  Of course, the irony is that the Russians used to be the kings of the \nlong game. Kutuzov let Napoleon march into Moscow after clearing out \nthe city and leaving only about 10,000 people behind. He strung out the \nFrench army and left it ultimately helpless.\n  We don't have to resort to the drastic tactics of this old savvy \nRussian general. There are actions we can take and have taken to \nsupport Ukraine and send a message to Russia. But we shouldn't \noverinflate our national security interests in this crisis. We simply \ndo not need to win every battle to win the war. And this body, the U.S. \nSenate, built by our Founding Fathers to see and play the long game for \nAmerica, should understand this fact. We aren't the Russians in 1812. \nWe must engage in a robust policy toward Ukraine that is much more than \nsimply time and patience, but that doesn't mean there aren't some \nimportant lessons to be learned.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               EXPIRE Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass \nthe tax extenders package that the Senate Finance Committee put forward \nwhich would reinstate a number of tax provisions to help with job \ncreation and to especially help homeowners and workers get back on \ntheir feet.\n  Yesterday I spoke to United Egg Producers which consists of a group \nof many family farmers and some larger farmers. My State is No. 2 in \nthe country in egg production, second only to the State of Iowa. I \ntalked to Tom Hertzfeld, Jr., and his son Jordan, who are third and \nfourth generation egg farmers in Grand Rapids, OH, a community not too \nfar from Toledo in northwest Ohio.\n  The farm has been in the family since 1959. They produce about \n100,000 dozen eggs every day. It is a technical business. The eggs go \nfrom the chicken to\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\nthe carton and then into the customers' hands. The production equipment \nrequires major investment. So when farmers like Tom need to buy new \nequipment, build new barns, and acquire more property, they should be \nable to accelerate their writeoffs. Bonus depreciation and section 179 \ngives our small businesses the capital to invest in tools that are \nimportant for them to expand, hire people, and make their communities \nmore prosperous.\n  As we help existing businesses expand, we need to focus on reviving \nindustries, especially manufacturing. We know wealth is created when we \nmake it, mine it or grow it. We do all three of those in a significant \nway in my State. Ohio is the Nation's third largest manufacturing \nState, only behind California, which is three times our population, and \nTexas, which is twice our population.\n  The new markets tax credit will help revitalize communities hit hard \nby shuttered factories by leveraging tens of billions of dollars in \nprivate investments. We know what the new markets tax credit has done \nfor development in areas that are generally a little poorer than most. \nWe want to be able to target manufacturing too, and that is what our \nManufacturing Communities Investment Act does. Last year, for instance, \nin Portage County, the community of Streetsboro lost 300 jobs after \nCommercial Turf Products shut its doors. Under the Manufacturing \nCommunities Investment Act, the city could access financing to bring \nnew manufacturing businesses back to Streetsboro.\n  For those workers who have lost their jobs and benefits, the health \ncoverage tax credit, or the HCTC, needs to be extended. The HCTC \npreserves a program that Ohioans--such as the Delphi salaried retirees \nwho worked hard and played by the rules--know, understand, and trust.\n  Extending the tax credit for 2 years is fiscally responsible. We \nshould improve the HCTC and make it permanent, as I have proposed in \nthe legislation that I have introduced with Senators Rockefeller, \nStabenow, Hirono, and Donnelly. At the very least we should renew this \ncritical tax credit.\n  Earlier this year I traveled across Ohio and met with homeowners such \nas Hattie Wilkins from Youngstown, OH. She was laid off, fell behind on \nher mortgage, and began the foreclosure process. Her bank--because it \nwas in their interest too--forgave the $35,000 she still owed, but \nHattie and thousands of homeowners across the country face higher taxes \nif we don't move to extend the Mortgage Forgiveness Tax Relief Act.\n  In many ways it is a phantom income. If it is a short sale or they \nget a principal reduction--as I was discussing with Ohio realtors \ntoday--the homeowners never really get the money for it, but they are \nhit with the tax bill as if they had gotten that income. We have \nextended this tax forgiveness, if you will, in the past because Members \nof both parties recognize there is still a critical need for it.\n  All of these items--as part of the tax extenders package--help create \njobs, put money in homeowners' pockets, pay for health insurance, and \nallow people to stay in their homes. As I said, it also creates jobs \nand is good for our communities. It is important that we pass the tax \nextenders package as soon as possible in this Chamber.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                               EXPIRE Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a couple of minutes now to \nunderscore the importance of the Senate passing the EXPIRE Act now, and \nin particular to highlight what the cost of inaction would be if the \nSenate fails to act.\n  This legislation is critically needed because it is an essential tool \nto prevent a tax increase and particularly the kind of tax increase \nthat will harm our ability to create more good-paying jobs--high-\nskilled, high-wage jobs. These are the jobs tied to innovation.\n  Without this legislation, for example, what we would have is a new \ntax on innovation because we wouldn't renew for a period of 2 years, as \nwe work on tax reform, the research and development tax credit. This \ncredit is absolutely essential because it is what is used by the \nemployers who are coming up with innovative approaches to create more \nlong-term employment for our country. This credit is used to help pay \nthe wages for those kinds of innovation-oriented jobs. Without this \nlegislation, we would have in this country a tax on innovation. I don't \nthink that is where this country wants to go.\n  It will be harder without this legislation to have employers hire \nveterans--veterans who are now coming out in throngs to job fairs in \ncities across the country. Employers will find it even harder to assist \nthem in terms of finding employment.\n  Without this legislation, when an underwater homeowner gets hold of a \nlife raft that keeps them in their homes when their lender works with \nthem to try to work out an arrangement to reduce their obligation, \nreduce their debt, that underwater homeowner would be taxed on phantom \nincome. So right when that underwater homeowner is trying to get their \nhead above\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\nwater, without this legislation the Tax Code would shove them back \nunderwater once more. I don't think that is where our country wants to \ngo.\n  I don't think our country wants to give a back of the hand to \nmillions of students already up to their eyeballs in debt. Without this \nlegislation, they would have to go even deeper into debt.\n  Producing clean energy will become more expensive, risking the kind \nof high-tech jobs the Congress wants and is working in a bipartisan way \nto protect.\n  So with the EXPIRE Act we can address all these issues, bring greater \ncertainty to our economy, put an expiration date on the broken tax \nsystem, and lay the foundation for working on tax reform and moving \naway from what has been a long run of stop-and-go tax extender \npolicies. We ought to get away from that, and the point of this \nlegislation is, between now and the end of 2015, to work on \ncomprehensive bipartisan tax reform.\n  A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have talked \nabout their interest in this and that they wish we were doing \ncomprehensive reform. I think colleagues have heard me say on the floor \nof the Senate I'd much prefer to be doing comprehensive tax reform, but \nwhen Chairman Baucus went to China, it became clear to me it wasn't \ngoing to be possible to get comprehensive tax reform done in this \nsession.\n  What I sought to do is to make sure we wouldn't do further harm to \nmiddle-class families, and small businesses, and those who are creating \nthe innovative jobs. That is why we need this legislation and need to \nuse the legislation when it passes as a bridge to tax reform.\n  The bill is called the EXPIRE Act. People have often said: What does \nthat mean? It is not just what it means--the bill actually does expire. \nI have indicated to my colleagues on the Finance Committee that this \nwill be the last extenders bill on my watch. We are not going to have \nany more of them on my watch. We are going to move to create a \nstronger, better, more pro-growth, fair tax system, which allows us to \nbe more competitive in a tough global economy and create good-paying \njobs. The tax reform process is not going to be a walk in the park, but \nit is only going to grow harder if the Senate fails to pass the EXPIRE \nAct first.\n  We have had bipartisan proposals in the past. Our former colleague \nSenator Gregg worked with me for 2 years, and we sat together on a sofa \nalmost every week for 2 years to create what is the first bipartisan \nFederal income tax reform bill in three decades. With his retirement, \nthankfully Senator Coats and Senator Begich stepped in. So we know it \ncan be done, but that task will simply be harder if the Senate fails to \npass the EXPIRE Act.\n  The first thing people are going to say is: If the Senate couldn't \ndeal with these extenders on a temporary basis, how in the world will \nthe Senate be able to take up comprehensive tax reform?\n  Fortunately, at a time when many think Washington is utterly broken, \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, was willing to \nwork with me and meet me halfway in terms of producing a comprehensive, \nbipartisan effort to move forward on these extenders. It wasn't easy, \nbut it got done, and it got out of the Finance Committee with an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote. The bill may not be perfect, but the \ncommittee got it done with the kind of bipartisan approach Americans \nwant to see more of. I hope the Senate will want to do the same thing. \nI was encouraged by the procedural vote we had earlier this week.\n  So with tonight's developments, I simply underscore the importance of \npassing the EXPIRE Act. I hope Senators on a bipartisan basis will join \nme in supporting the legislation. It is going to meet urgent needs of \nour people now, and if we can get it passed and signed into law \nquickly, it will allow us to turn our attention exclusively to the kind \nof tax overhaul that is long overdue. That can bring Democrats and \nRepublicans together, as we saw several decades ago when progressive \nDemocrats and conservative Republicans joined together for tax reform. \nWe can go to that agenda as soon as we address the immediate needs \nbehind the urgent requirement of enacting the extenders bill quickly.\n  I hope we will see the Senate do that in the next few days ahead.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly on the Finance Committee--\nDemocrats and Republicans--for the good and cooperative bipartisan \nwork.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the Fraternity of the Desert Bighorn in Southern Nevada.\n  The Fraternity of the Desert Bighorn was established in 1964, and in \npartnering with local, State, and Federal wildlife organizations and \nagencies, they have played a vital role in the restoration of the \niconic desert bighorn sheep in Nevada. These incredible animals are a \nsymbol of our State's unique wildlife habitat, geography, and climate. \nIn the Sloan Canyon and Gold Butte areas of Southern Nevada, ancient \npetroglyphs and rock art dating back thousands of years depict the \nbighorn sheep and tell the story of its important contributions to our \nState's history and culture. The desert bighorn is a noteworthy part of \nNevada's mountainous landscapes and was officially named the State \nanimal in 1973.\n  Following westward expansion in the 1800s, bighorn sheep populations \nstruggled to survive against the spread of disease from domestic \nlivestock and the loss of water resources and habitat. By the 1960s, \ndesert bighorn sheep populations, once in the tens of thousands in the \nUnited States, dropped to an estimated 6,700 to 8,100. However, the \ncommitment of organizations like the Fraternity of the Desert Bighorn \nto species restoration has helped to more than double the bighorn sheep \npopulation throughout the United States.\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\n  The fraternity has worked hard to promote responsible management of \nthe desert bighorn and its habitat. By building and maintaining \nhundreds of water development projects, fighting disease, and educating \ndomestic sheep herders on the importance of maintaining strict \nseparations between bighorn sheep and domestic herds, the fraternity \nhas provided necessary water resources to Southern Nevada wildlife and \nensured a healthy bighorn sheep population for future generations.\n  I commend the Fraternity of the Desert Bighorn on their 50th \nanniversary, and I wish them the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3021-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MIRA BALL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate \nmy good friend, Mira Ball. On June 5, Mira will receive the Midway \nCollege Legacy Award for her many contributions and years of service to \nMidway College, located in Midway, KY.\n  Mira is the first ever recipient of this award, which will be given \nout at the Inaugural Spotlight awards in June. The purpose of the \nLegacy Award is to recognize ``a person or persons that have impacted \nMidway College over a period of many years by giving time, service, \nsupport and/or resources.'' With such a description, it's no wonder \nthat Mira was the first in line to receive it.\n  Mira's contributions to Midway College, which is Kentucky's only \nwomen's college and a leader in degree programs for men and women, are \naplenty. She has served on the board of trustees since 1990, became the \nfirst woman to chair the board in 1997, and was honored to be elected a \nlife trustee in 2000. Last year, she served as interim chair while the \ninstitution was in a transitional period.\n  Even with her devotion to Midway College, Mira has amazingly found \ntime to pursue a multitude of other interests and causes. She became \nthe first woman president of the Lexington Chamber of Commerce in 1991 \nand was also the first woman to chair the University of Kentucky board \nof trustees, a post she occupied from 2007 to 2010. If you hadn't \nnoticed, my friend Mira has never been afraid to be the first to do \nanything.\n  Additionally, Mira has been one of our State's strongest advocates \nfor education reform, and she currently serves on the endowment board \nof Kentucky Educational Television, KET. She is also an involved member \nof the Calvary Baptist Church and is an active philanthropist to health \ncare and education groups.\n  Somehow, amidst this seemingly endless stream of extracurricular \nactivities, Mira carves out some time for her day job. She serves as \nthe chief financial officer for the very successful Ball Homes LLC \nhomebuilders, which she runs with her husband, Don, and their three \nchildren--Ray Ball, Mike Ball, and Lisa Ball Sharp. In addition to \ntheir children, Mira and Don have seven grandchildren--making for a \nwonderful family that is undoubtedly her biggest achievement of all.\n  Mira's tireless efforts to better the lives of others deserve the \nrecognition of this body. Thus, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues \njoin me in honoring Mira Ball, and congratulating her for being the \nfirst-ever recipient of the prestigious Midway College Legacy Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3021-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3021-S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, 26 years ago Members of Congress decided \nto designate May as National Foster Care Month. Since then, the U.S. \nCongress, the Children's Bureau at the Department of Health and Human \nServices, and the National Foster Parent Association have worked \ntogether to recognize the work of foster families, social workers, \nfaith-based and community organizations, and others who are improving \nthe lives of foster youth across the country and to encourage all \nAmericans to participate in efforts to serve these children throughout \nthe year.\n  I have come to the floor today, alongside my esteemed colleague and \ncochair on the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, to recognize the foster \nparents, social workers, and advocates from my home State of Louisiana \nand around the country who play an essential role in the lives of \nchildren in foster care throughout the United States. I also want to \nacknowledge the leaders of the House Caucus on Foster Youth--\nRepresentative Karen Bass, Representative Tom Marino, Representative \nMichele Bachmann, and Representative Jim McDermott--who already have or \nwill soon speak on the floor, as well, to commemorate National Foster \nCare Month.\n  Each day 691 new children enter the foster care system because of \nabuse or neglect. Each week 4,852 children find themselves on the \nbeginning of their journey through ``the system.'' Over 79,000 children \nwill call this system home for more than 3 years, and more than 23,400 \nyoung adults will ``age out'' of the system without a safe, permanent \nfamily. Of those that age out, studies indicate that only 25 percent \nhave a high school diploma or GED, less than 2 percent finish college, \nover half experience homelessness, and nearly 30 percent have been \nincarcerated.\n  As I have long said, governments do many things well, but raising \nchildren is not, and will never be, one of them. Our foster care system \nshould be temporary--it is a temporary place where children should go \nto be protected and nurtured until they can be returned to their birth \nfamily, be placed with extended family, or be connected with an \nadoptive parent or parents. Unfortunately, all too often this is not \nhow it happens. Forty percent of those eligible for adoption will wait \nover 3 years in foster care before being adopted. Even worse, 23,000 \nyouth--25 percent of those eligible for adoption--``age out'' or \nemancipate from the system each year. We cannot rest until our Federal \nand state governments are 100 percent successful at connecting these \nchildren--who have been placed under the government's care due to no \nfault of their own--with permanent, safe, and loving families.\n  It is our responsibility to find homes for the huge numbers of \nabandoned and orphaned children in the United States. For this reason, \nI created a new pilot grant in the fiscal year 14 Omnibus to enable \nStates to initiate intensive and exhaustive child-focused recruitment \nprograms, proven to increase adoptions out of foster care 3 to 1. The \n$4 million dollars that I secured for this program will enable States \nto move foster youth eligible for adoption into permanent families at a \nmuch higher rate than traditional recruitment strategies. This is \nbecause these grants will provide social workers with the resources, \ntime, and mandate to actually open up the file of youth in care and \nidentify the names and contact information of parents, relatives, \ncaregivers, and other significant adults in that child's life. This \nintense review, often called ``case mining,'' is key in locating a \ncaring adult able to commit to reunification, adoption or legal \nguardianship for foster youth.\n  There are many other strategies that our government can implement to \nincrease permanency for foster children. Just last week the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, led by executive \ndirector Kathleen Strottman, hosted a policy focused briefing to \neducate congressional staff about how postadoption services are cost-\neffective and enormously beneficial alternatives to children reentering \nfoster care or having their adoptions dissolved. The Federal Government \nspends an average of $27,236 annually for each child in care covered by \nFederal funding--and much more for those in group homes or residential \ntreatment centers--compared to $5,043 for a child receiving adoption \nassistance covered by Federal funding adoptions. There currently is no \nFederal funding stream dedicated exclusively to postadoption services. \nWe as legislators must consider ways in which we can increase the \noverall resources dedicated to post-adoption.\n  As I have stated, it is our responsibility to invest in initiatives \nthat are proven to be successful in finding permanent solutions for our \nnation's foster children. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor S. \nRes. 442, ``Recognizing National Foster Care Month as an opportunity to \nraise awareness about the challenges of children in the foster care \nsystem, and encouraging Congress to implement policy to improve the \nlives of children in the foster care system.''\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\n  I yield my time to my esteemed colleague and co chair of the Senate \nCaucus on Foster Youth, Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak today about \nthe foster care system and the impact the system has on the lives of \nfar too many children, young adults, and families.\n  Currently, more than 400,000 children across the United States are in \nthe foster care system. From its inception, the foster care system was \ndesigned to be a safe and temporary place of transition for kids who \nhave nowhere else to go. Of those currently calling the foster care \nsystem home, 79,000 will stay in foster care for more than 3 years. \nMore than 23,400 will age out of foster care without finding an \nadoptive family or a permanent place to call home.\n  Furthermore, youth who age out of the foster care system experience \nunique struggles that extend beyond the usual anxieties of trying to \nestablish a life after high school. In fact, only one quarter has \nearned a high school diploma or GED, while less than 2 percent finish \ncollege. Worse yet, more than 50 percent will experience homelessness \nand nearly 30 percent will have spent time behind bars.\n  That is why we recognize May as National Foster Care Month. Senator \nLandrieu and I have introduced a resolution to shed light on the many \nyoung faces that seek a permanent home and family. We also set aside a \nmoment to recognize the countless number of people who work tirelessly \nfor youth in foster care.\n  Stability comes from a much larger community than just a family. \nStability comes from the teacher who sees the student at the desk near \nthe back of the classroom who needs a little extra help and guidance. \nStability comes from the friends and neighbors who take it upon \nthemselves to invite the new face in the neighborhood to join in a game \nof basketball or swimming. Stability comes from the social workers who \nwork tirelessly to help resolve the issues at home foster youth face \nor, if necessary, they help find a permanent home that will offer \nwarmth and happiness. And most importantly, stability comes from the \nfamilies who are willing to take a child or group of children into \ntheir home, to provide a safe and nurturing environment so that they \nhave a chance to grow and thrive.\n  I call upon my colleagues to support S. Res. 442 recognizing National \nFoster Care Month as an opportunity to raise awareness about the \nchallenges of children in the foster care system and encouraging \nCongress to implement policy to improve the lives of children in the \nfoster care system. The resolution also recognizes foster youth \nthroughout the United States for their courage and resilience as they \nmove through their personal trials and challenges. We also seek to \napplaud the youth who have moved on from the foster care system but \nremain active to serve as advocates and role models for those who \nremain in the system.\n  However, while we seek to applaud and commend those who continue to \nbe a beacon of hope for these youth, the resolution is also intended to \nreaffirm the need to continue to improve the outcomes for all children \nin the foster care system. Every child deserves the stability and \ncertainty that a loving, permanent home and family can provide.\n  Congress has been working to improve the lives of all those touched \nby the foster care system. That has included providing support to \nvulnerable families, with the hope of safely keeping families intact \nwhile they work through difficult times. We have promoted policies that \nencourage reunification of families when they successfully address \nissues that make homes safe and nurturing for children. We have helped \ncreate incentives to promote adoption when reunification isn't \npossible. For those who age out of the foster care system without a \npermanent place to call home, we have been working to make the \ntransition to adulthood more certain.\n  That is why in 2009 Senator Landrieu and I launched the bipartisan \nSenate Caucus on Foster Youth. The caucus works to provide an outlet \nfor Members and staff to provide educational opportunities in order to \nhelp shape meaningful policy that works to bring children and families \ntogether.\n  The caucus has created a gateway for grassroots coalitions of \nfamilies, foster youth, child welfare advocates, court representatives, \nand social workers to locate policymakers who are actively fighting and \nsupporting tools to improve the lives of all children and families. The \ncaucus has created an avenue for all stakeholders to help identify \nbarriers that block foster kids from finding a permanent, loving home \neither through adoption, guardianship, or reunification with their \nbirth family.\n  The caucus is currently offering a series of opportunities designed \nto introduce Members and staff to the issue of child welfare financing. \nThe meetings have been designed to provide a collegial environment to \nbuild a base of knowledge for those less familiar with the issue and to \nhelp those who have been working on the issue for many years.\n  So far this spring, we have had a chance to hear from specialists and \nexperts about the early history of child welfare and how it has \ndeveloped into the programs that we see today. We are studying how the \ncurrent system is structured, how we can improve it, and how we can \nbetter incentivize States to find permanent placements for foster \nyouth.\n  In the past, we have studied and acted to improve the educational \nstability of the students. There are numerous cases of children who \nmove from school to school within a given year. Just as they have an \nopportunity to form a series of friendships, they are ushered on to \nanother school to begin the process yet again. Beyond the problems of \nbuilding meaningful relationships, many foster youth have to worry \nabout how their credits transfer from one school to the next. Many \nstudents are required to take a class numerous times in multiple \nschools because of varying requirements. Oftentimes, this creates a gap \nthat extends the amount of time it takes a student to fulfill the \nrequirements to complete school.\n  Another issue that comes up is sex trafficking. Youth in the foster \ncare system can be susceptible to domestic sexual predators who offer \nthem financial assistance and emotional bonds.\n  Just recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, rescued 18 \nminors from forced prostitution around the time of the Super Bowl. Of \nthe 18 minors, 3 were from the foster care system. I sent a letter to \nthe FBI to ask the agency to explain how underage victims are treated \nonce they are rescued from forced prostitution. From my inquiry so far, \nit seems the FBI has taken positive steps, including making clear that \nthose who are forced into prostitution are victims, not criminals. The \nFBI also has a coordinated effort that has recovered a number of \njuvenile victims. But it is important to track what happens to victims \nafter rescue. Are they getting the protections and services they need \nto stay safe or are they ending up back in dangerous situations? If \nthey came from foster care, did the system fail to protect them?\n  The Senate Finance Committee approved a bipartisan bill in December \nto improve the foster care system. The bill seeks to protect foster \nyouth and to encourage officials to better prevent, identify, and \nintervene when a child becomes a victim of trafficking.\n  Our caucus has taken a lead in educating the public about this issue. \nWe heard from two incredibly brave survivors of trafficking who had \nbeaten the odds, escaped ``the life,'' and are now working as mentors \nwith other girls who have been trafficked or are at risk of being \ntrafficked.\n  The caucus has raised a number of other important issues, and we have \ninvited youth to share their personal experiences. They are the \nexperts, and we can learn from them.\n  I am glad to report the caucus is gaining strong support from across \nparty lines and regional areas of the country. I am glad that we have \nhad nine new members this year, including Senators Crapo, Scott, Kaine, \nWarner, Klobuchar, Inhofe, Wicker, Heitkamp, and Johanns.\n  We will continue working to keep the national spotlight on the \nchallenges confronting foster youth. Every child deserves the stability \nand certainty that a loving, permanent home and family can provide. I \nthank my colleagues for their support in this endeavor.\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3023-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       POTTAWATTAMIE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Pottawattamie County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Pottawattamie County worth over $24 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $65 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memories of working together have to include \nthe Pottawattamie County Preschool Initiative plan was developed to \ndramatically expand preschool for more than 250 unserved children, \nseveral affordable housing and main street reconstruction projects, as \nwell as work on transportation infrastructure and airport improvements. \nWhile I have worked to secure more than $2.8 million for the \nPottawattamie County Preschool Initiative, as part of the private-\npublic partnership, the Iowa West Foundation also committed $7 million \nfor the early learning initiative. This is the type of investment Iowa \nneeds to ensure a brighter economic future for every student. I look \nforward to learning how this program has impacted students in \nPottawattamie County.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Western Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of \nPottawattamie County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding \nthat has leveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a \nwhole ripple effect of positive, creative changes. For example, working \nwith mayors, city council members, and local economic development \nofficials in Pottawattamie County, I have fought for over $16 million \nto reconstruct the Avenue G viaduct, over $2.5 million for affordable \nhousing projects, and secured $2 million to make sure the airport got \npriority for a new runway through the Federal Aviation Administration, \nhelping to create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Pottawattamie County has received $5.1 million in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Pottawattamie County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $168,650.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Pottawattamie \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1.5 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Pottawattamie \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing more than $5.6 \nmillion for the Community Health Center.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nPottawattamie County, both those with and without disabilities. And \nthey make us proud to be a part of a community and country that \nrespects the worth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Pottawattamie County, during my time in Congress. In \nevery case, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in \nPottawattamie County, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, \nof course, this work is never complete. Even after I retire from the \nSenate, I have no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, \nfairer, richer Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the \nopportunity to serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3023-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3023-S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HARRISON COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance,\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\npassing the Americans with Disabilities Act and spearheading successful \nfarm bills. But I take a very special pride in projects that have made \na big difference in local communities across my State.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Harrison County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Harrison County worth over $3.6 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $6.8 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be its \nsuccessful use of several Main Street Iowa grants for facade \nrestoration and other building renovations in downtown Woodbine, and \nredevelopment of the Moore's Block in Dunlap.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This is not just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nWoodbine and Dunlap to use that money to leverage other investments to \njumpstart change and renewal. I am so pleased that Harrison County has \nearned $148,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Harrison County has received over $3.35 million in Harkin \ngrants. Similarly, schools in Harrison County have received funds that \nI designated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $20,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Harrison County has received more than $3.5 from \na variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Harrison \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1.19 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Major Susan \nAller-Schilling, a devoted and history-making member of the Nevada \nHighway Patrol, NHP.\n  Major Aller-Schilling has served with Nevada's Department of Public \nSafety for more than 16 years. Rising to the rank of lieutenant before \ntransferring to the NHP, Major Aller-Schilling is the first female \ntrooper in the agency's history to achieve the ranking title of major.\n  Supporting Nevada's citizens through a tireless dedication to their \nsafety, Major Aller-Schilling has served a vast majority of the State \nfrom Las Vegas to Reno, where she has diligently performed as an \noperations commander since last year. As a major, she will oversee more \nthan 2,560 sworn and civilian personnel.\n  Today, the NHP boasts well over 300 commissioned officers, each \ndedicated to ensuring safe, economical, and enjoyable use of the \nhighways. Protecting citizens and assisting law enforcement agencies \nthroughout our State and the Nation are just a few of the services \nthese servicemen selflessly provide.\n  Aligned with the NHP's mission of protecting safety, Major Aller-\nSchilling's loyalty and dedication to community well-being has been \ndescribed as exceptional. Her example of hard work and dedication to a \ncause greater than herself is demonstrated by this elevation of her \nrank--the first of its kind.

Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \nsesquicentennial of Georgia's Battle of Kennesaw Mountain that took \nplace on June 27, 1864, and was an important moment in the Civil War's \nAtlanta campaign.\n  The Civil War had been underway for more than 3 years when GEN \nWilliam T. Sherman began his movement south of Chattanooga, TN. \nSherman's troops moved south following the general path of the Western \nand Atlantic Railroad. By mid-June, both the Union and Confederate \narmies were in the vicinity of Kennesaw Mountain. Both sides had to \nstruggle with a common enemy--rain--that continued for 2\\1/2\\ weeks. \nFrom June 4 through June 18, 1864, southern GEN Joseph E. Johnston \nsurprised Sherman by defending a line running from Lost Mountain to \nBrushy Mountain. A series of attacks on this line forced Johnston to \ndraw back to the Kennesaw line on June 19, 1864. Using Kennesaw \nMountain as the anchor for\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nhis line, Johnston's forces prepared a strong defensive position \nblocking the likely avenues of approach Sherman would use to continue \nhis advance toward Marietta and subsequently to Atlanta.\n  Following a tactical approach that had been successful throughout the \nspring, the Union army moved some of its forces to the Confederates' \nleft flank. The Confederates countered and moved one of their corps \nfrom the right to the left of their line. Acting without orders from \nJohnston, John Bell Hood ordered his forces to attack the Union troops. \nCharging across Valentine Kolb's fields, the Confederates met a \ndevastating combination of artillery and infantry fire from entrenched \nUnion troops. This caused the Confederates to retreat and dig in. \nAlthough the attack led to costly casualties for the Confederates it \nprevented the Union from advancing toward Marietta. It also forced \nSherman to change tactics and order a frontal assault on June 27, 1864.\n  Sherman's troops bombarded the Confederate positions on the morning \nof June 27 and then advanced along the base of Kennesaw Mountain. The \nConfederates repulsed this diversionary attack. Rough terrain and a \nstubborn defense obstructed the Union assault at Pigeon Hill that \nsubsequently fell apart after a couple of hours. At Cheatham Hill, the \nheaviest fighting occurred along a stretch in the Confederate line \ndubbed ``Dead Angle'' by Confederate defenders. Union troops made a \ndesperate effort to storm the Confederate trenches. However, the rough \nterrain and intense Confederate fire combined to defeat the Union army. \nWithin hours, the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain was over. Union \ncasualties numbered some 3,000 men while the Confederates lost 1,000, \nmaking it one of the bloodiest single days in the campaign for Atlanta.\n  In 1899, a lieutenant of the 86th Illinois Infantry purchased 60 \nacres at Cheatham Hill, the site of the most deadly encounter at \nKennesaw Mountain. The land was later transferred to the Kennesaw \nMemorial Association, which received $20,000 from the State of Illinois \nto construct a monument on Cheatham Hill to honor the soldiers of the \n86th Illinois Regiment who died there. On June 27, 1914, the 50th \nanniversary of the battle, a marble monument was unveiled and dedicated \nto those fallen men. In 1917, the land was deeded to the United States \ngovernment and 9 years later, in 1926, the U.S. Congress passed a law \nthat placed the area under the protection of the War Department.\n  In 1935, legislation was passed creating Kennesaw Mountain National \nBattlefield Park on the original 60 acres purchased by the lieutenant \nof the 86th Illinois Infantry. Today, the Kennesaw Mountain National \nBattlefield Park consists of nearly 3,000 acres where visitors enjoy \n19.7 miles of trails and can see historic earthworks, cannon \nemplacements, interpretive signs, and three monuments representing \nStates that fought in this momentous battle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3025-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ARAGON, GEORGIA\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the \nCentennial of the city of Aragon, GA, on July 23, 2014.\n  During the past 100 years, Aragon has seen both good times and \ndifficult times. Through periods of growth, economic struggle and \nsocial change, the leaders and residents of Aragon have upheld their \ncommitment to remaining a city.\n  The origin of the city's name of Aragon has been widely disputed by \nhistorians. Some claim that Aragon was named after the Hotel Aragon \nlocated on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, GA, where some of the mill \nowners stayed when visiting the area. Others believe the city was named \nfor the mineral aragonite that was mined nearby.\n  The city of Aragon was founded in 1899 in Polk County, GA. The city \ncharter was adopted on July 23, 1914, and was approved by Georgia \nGovernor John M. Slaton. The first three commissioners were Fred O. \nMyers, J.H. Arnold and R.L. Huckabe.\n  The city was established in 1898 in northwest Georgia following the \nconstruction of a mill by Wolcott and Campbell of New York. Over the \nyears, numerous additions and improvements were made to the mill, which \nemployed hundreds of workers and contributed to the livelihood of many \nfamilies in the community. The mill closed for good in 1994 and \nremained empty until 1998 when it was purchased by brothers Brian and \nKirk Spears and used as a production facility for pillows and wooden \npallets until August 6, 2002, when fire engulfed and decimated the \ncomplex.\n  At the time of this centennial celebration, the local government is \nvested in Mayor Ken Suffridge and Councilmen Curtis Burrus, Mayor Pro \nTem Duel Mitchell, Kevin Prewett and Hunter Spinks. They are dedicated \nto ensuring the city and its citizens are ready for tomorrow's \nchallenges, and remain loyal to its motto, ``A Proud Past With A \nPromising Future.''\n  I congratulate the residents of Aragon, GA, on their centennial year \nand wish them great success with observances that raise awareness of \nand appreciation for the city of Aragon's contributions to the \ndevelopment and vitality of Polk County, GA. I hope that residents will \nuse this year as an opportunity to learn more about the rich history of \ntheir community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3025-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING CONCERNS OF POLICE SURVIVORS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nachievements of Ms. Vivian E. ``Bo'' Smith-Tallan. During her years of \nservice, Ms. Smith demonstrated tireless dedication to her country, and \nspecifically to Fairchild Air Force Base and the greater Spokane area.\n  Ms. Smith-Tallan, who hails from Maryland, entered the Air Force in \n1976 directly out of high school. She retired from the Air Force as a \nmaster sergeant after serving for 20 years on active duty. Ms. Smith-\nTallan completed a degree in law enforcement and is a graduate of the \nSpokane County Police Academy. Prior to her present position, she was a \npolice officer with the Medical Lake Police Department and bailiff for \nthe Airway Heights courts system.\n  While on Active Duty in the law enforcement career field, Ms. Smith-\nTallan served in numerous capacities including gate guard, patrolman, \ninvestigator, pass and registration noncommissioned officer in charge, \nand flight chief. Her talent earned her a selection as the first female \nmotorcycle patrolman. In 1992 she was assigned as the treaty compliance \nsuperintendent and finalized Fairchild Air Force Base's role under the \nSTART Treaty in which B-52s were removed from assignment to the base. \nFrom there she was assigned as the wing protocol superintendent until \nher retirement from Active Duty in 1996.\n  Ms. Smith-Tallan then began serving at Fairchild Air Force Base as a \nDepartment of Defense civilian. Through the following 18 years she led \nan office of 12 airmen as the wing chief of protocol and public \nrelations, consistently ensuring that Fairchild presented a welcoming \nand professional environment to visitors and the local community.\n  As chief of protocol she planned, evaluated, and led the \narrangements,\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\nprotocol and coordination for dignitaries visiting the wing. She \ndeveloped and executed itineraries compatible with the scope of the \nvisit, to include social events, ceremonies, briefings, lodging, \ntransportation, courtesy and office calls, and tours. She planned and \nsupervised countless renderings of honors, awards, promotions, \nretirements, change of command ceremonies, dining outs, airshows, \nintra-service competitions, parades, and other recognitions.\n  As chief of public relations, Ms. Smith-Tallan planned, organized and \ndirected the activities of the 92nd Air Refueling Wing Public Affairs \noffice to provide installation-level multimedia activities composed of \nmedia, community relations, photography and videography. She developed \nthe community relations program and ran the Honorary Commanders and \nEagles program to ensure continual outreach of installation commanders \nwith civic leaders. Ms. Smith-Tallan also served as the wing foreign \ndisclosure officer.\n  Ms. Smith-Tallan consistently goes above and beyond, as exemplified \nby her multiple Civilian of the Year and Civilian of the Quarter \nawards, an Exemplary Civilian Service Award, and many more awards she \nreceived while serving on Active Duty. Her record of achievement would \nnot have been possible without the love and support of her husband, \nRobert ``Bob'' Tallan. We thank her family for sharing her with us. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me \nin congratulating Ms. Smith-Tallan on her 38 years of outstanding \nservice. For her commitment to the people of Fairchild Air Force Base \nand the greater Spokane area, she is worthy of the highest \npraise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3026-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING BEST BATH SYSTEMS\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, too often we think of business \nowners as only being concerned with profit. However, countless \nenterprises have been started based on an idea or a goal to solve a \nproblem or to improve peoples' lives, and often times this is inspired \nby a need of someone close. It is a privilege to recognize such a \ncompany, Idaho's own Best Bath Systems, Inc.\n  Gary Multanen founded Best Bath Systems in 1971 with the goal of \ndesigning and producing baths and showers to help those with special \nneeds. Mr. Multanen was especially motivated to find a solution to his \nmother's difficulty in using conventional tubs. Over the years, Best \nBath Systems has created improvements for nearly every conceivable part \nof a shower or tub, and has been a leader for walk-in tub design.\n  It is one thing to tout Mr. Multanen as being an innovator, but the \nreal proof is in the demand from bath product sellers across the \ncountry. With $20 million in sales last year to a network of 490 \ndealers across North America, Best Bath Systems has clearly earned a \nreputation for quality. In addition to making bath products that help \npeople meet their basic needs, Best Bath Systems also does well by \ntheir employees, providing a profit-sharing program.\n  The Small Business Administration recognized Best Bath Systems' \nimpressive track record and named Mr. Multanen and his family the 2014 \nIdaho Small Business Person of the Year and is sharing their \naccomplishments at the National Small Business Week events being held \nthis week in Washington. This award celebrates their continued sales \ngrowth, superior customer service, and commitment to their community.\n  Best Bath Systems has been an active fixture in the Caldwell and \nBoise communities for a long time with Mr. Multanen serving on the \nboards of Boise City Parks & Recreation and the Treasure Valley Air \nQuality Council. In addition, since 2000, Best Bath Systems has a built \nrobust relationship with the Idaho Small Business Development Center, \nSBDC, where Mr. Multanen currently serves as the chairman of the \nadvisory council and uses his business' success story with the SBDC to \nmotivate other Idaho entrepreneurs. Concern for the environment is also \npart of Best Bath Systems' community commitment. Best Bath Systems' \n106,000 square foot facility in Caldwell, ID uses just 28 percent of \ntheir Federal emissions allowance, and they have promoted similar \nstandards for the industry through their trade association, which Mr. \nMultanen co-founded.\n  I wish to congratulate Mr. Multanen on being named the 2014 Idaho \nSmall Business Person of the Year and everyone at Best Bath Systems for \ntheir 43 years of sales, innovation, and bettering the quality of life \nfor many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3026-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HALEKULANI'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, Halekulani is a globally acclaimed \nluxury resort on Waikiki beach, and it is synonymous with the gracious \nhospitality of Hawaii. This hotel traces its roots back over 100 years, \nwhen ancient Hawaiian fishermen named this beachfront area Halekulani, \nwhich means ``house befitting heaven.''\n  Since its humble beginnings as a collection of guest bungalows in \n1917, Halekulani has provided the highest standards of excellence and \npersonalized service, while practicing the aloha spirit of Hawaii.\n  Through the years, Halekulani has hosted celebrated authors, poets, \nentertainers, dignitaries, and guests from around the globe, all the \nwhile providing an ``oasis of tranquility'' in the heart of Waikiki.\n  This year, Halekulani will celebrate its 30th year since reopening in \n1984 following a property-wide renovation.\n  Halekulani continues to build upon its legacy and rich tradition of \ngracious hospitality and sets a high standard for luxury destination \nresorts in Waikiki. Today, it remains one of the most acclaimed \nindependent luxury hotels in the world, with an international \nreputation for its award-winning service.\n  Over the past 30 years, Halekulani has provided unique guest \nexperiences through its support of local culture and the arts \ninstitutions in Honolulu, including the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra, the \nHonolulu Museum of Art, the Bishop Museum, and the Hawaii International \nFilm Festival, offering its international guests special access to some \nof Honolulu's finest arts and cultural attractions. In addition, \nthrough Halekulani's dedicated support of education and humanities \ncauses in the local community, Halekulani has established itself as a \ndedicated and responsible corporate citizen of Hawaii.\n  I congratulate Halekulani on its 30th anniversary and for its \ncontinued commitment to offering the highest quality of hospitality. \nHalekulani has helped make Hawaii one of the best leisure and business \ndestinations in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3026-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3026-S3028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-5730.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. RISCH:\n  S. 2335. A bill to exempt certain 16- and 17-year-old children \nemployed in logging or mechanized operations from child labor laws; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, Senator Crapo and I would like to introduce \nthe Youth Careers in Logging Act. Small family logging companies, much \nlike family farms, rely on younger family members to help make their \ncompanies successful. The agriculture industry enjoys exemptions from \nchild labor laws to allow for family members to learn the trade and \ncarry on the family business. This bill will provide those same \nbenefits for the logging industry.\n  The logging industry is struggling to recruit young employees. This \nindustry, like many others, has an aging work force that will soon \nretire. Modern mechanized machinery opens up opportunities for a new \ntech-savvy generation of loggers if we give them the chance.\n  There are 400 independent logging contractor businesses in Idaho, \nmost of which are family owned and operated. Current labor laws do not \nallow the children of these family owned businesses to work and learn \nin the same profession as their parents.\n  Should the Youth Careers in Logging Act be enacted, starting at the \nage of 16 young adults will be allowed to operate safe and modern \nmachinery. These young loggers will help Idaho and the country to \ncreate healthy, fire resilient forests and bring much needed natural \nresources into our marketplace to help make paper and build homes.\n  By passing this legislation, Congress can help young adults earn good \nwages through hard work in the great outdoors that will create a \ngeneration of young Americans that understand the value of a great work \nethic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Franken, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Begich, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Pryor):\n  S. 2337. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to inter in national cemeteries \nindividuals who supported the United States in Laos during the Vietnam \nWar era; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I have come to the floor today to \nreintroduce a piece of legislation that I feel is long overdue. The \nHmong Veterans' Service Recognition Act is a bill to authorize the \ninterment in national cemeteries of Hmong veterans who served in \nsupport of U.S. forces during the Vietnam War. Thousands of members of \nthe Hmong community fought for America during Vietnam yet they enjoy no \nrights as veterans. The Hmong veterans are requesting to be buried in \nnational cemeteries and I, along with a bipartisan group of colleagues, \nSenators Franken, Klobuchar, Feinstein, Begich, Whitehouse, and Pryor, \nbelieve this is an appropriate honor.\n  To preserve Laos's neutrality during the Vietnam War, the U.S., \nSoviet Union, North Vietnam, and ten other countries signed the 1962 \nGeneva Declaration prohibiting all foreign military personnel from \nLaos. While the U.S. and other countries withdrew all military \npersonnel, the North Vietnamese Army blatantly violated the Geneva \nDeclaration by keeping thousands of troops in Laos. Using Laotian \nterritory to circumvent borders, these NVA forces posed a direct threat \nto America's military position in South Vietnam. Unable to be present \nin Laos, but needing to counteract the NVA, America required a covert \nmilitary force. The Hmong were ideal candidates for America's secret \nwar--they were renowned as being brave fighters who knew the rocky \nmountain terrain of Northern Laos well.\n  All told, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency conducted covert \noperations in Laos which employed some 60,000 Hmong volunteers in \nSpecial Guerilla Units. The Hmong Fighters interrupted operations on \nthe Ho Chi Minh trail and assisted in downed aircraft recovery \noperations of American Airmen. In Laos, they valiantly fought the \nVietnamese and Laotian Communists for over a decade and were critical \nto America's war efforts in Vietnam. In all, over 35,000 Hmong lost \ntheir lives by the end of our involvement in Vietnam.\n  Since the end of the Vietnam War, thousands of Hmong and Lao families \nhave resettled around the United States to become legal permanent \nresidents or United States citizens and have greatly contributed to \nAmerican society. There are currently over 260,000 Hmong people in \nAmerica. According to the 2010 Census, the heaviest concentrations are \nin California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Michigan, \nColorado, Georgia, Oklahoma, Oregon, and my home State of Alaska.\n  Of the Hmong who became U.S. citizens, approximately 6,000 veterans \nare\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\nstill with us today, and they deserve the choice to be buried in \nnational cemeteries. This concept is not without precedent. Currently, \nburial benefits are available for Philippine Armed Forces veterans who \nanswered the call to serve during World War II, just like the Hmong. \nThis legislation would not grant the small group of Hmong veterans full \nveteran benefits, but would simply authorize their interment in \nnational cemeteries across the Nation. A small, but deserved token of \nappreciation and an appropriate honor for their sacrifices towards a \ncommon goal of democracy and freedom in the world.\n  This new legislation is improved from the previous version, S. 200, \nin that it connects with Public Law 106-207: The Hmong Veterans' \nNaturalization Act of 2000 which acknowledges Hmong Special Guerilla \nUnit's contributions during Vietnam and provides a path to validation \nof a Hmong veteran's service for the purpose of naturalization. Public \nLaw already recognizes the service of Hmong Special Guerilla Unit \nveterans for the purpose of naturalization, so it is a natural \nconnection to afford them burial rights as well.\n  Hmong-Americans who fought and risked their lives in secret for \nAmerica deserve the same public respect and honor we give the men and \nwomen they served with and rescued. I believe it's time to honor the \nservice and sacrifice of Hmong Special Guerilla Unit Veterans by \nallowing them to be buried alongside their brothers in arms in our \nnational cemeteries. Again, I appreciate the support of my colleagues \nfrom across the aisle for this legislation and look forward to working \nwith them and others in the Senate to finally getting this approved \ninto law this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct to require States with failed American Health Benefit Exchanges to \nreimburse the Federal Government for amounts provided under grants for \nthe establishment and operation of such Exchanges; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor to address \nremarks made by the majority leader. Just yesterday the majority leader \ncame to the floor and said the Republicans were ``going quiet'' on \nhealth care. Senator Reid said ObamaCare is no longer high on the \nRepublicans' radar screen. Yesterday I said that it was certainly still \nvery high on my radar screen and that Republicans have every intention \nof continuing to focus on the Democrats' health care law and all of its \nharmful side effects.\n  Americans all across the country have been feeling those damaging \nside effects of the President's health care law, and the side effects \nare getting worse. Hard-working middle-class families who didn't want \nthis health care law in the first place are facing higher premiums. \nThey are facing smaller paychecks. They are facing fewer jobs, fewer \ndoctors, and many other problems as a result specifically of the \nPresident's health care law.\n  Today I want to talk about another side effect of the law; that is, \nthe millions, if not billions, of taxpayer dollars that have been \nabsolutely wasted by bureaucrats who set up State health insurance \nexchanges that have failed. Under the health care law, States could \nchoose to set up their own exchange or to use the Federal exchange. \nStates got Federal grants to help plan which one they would do. If a \nState decided to set up its own exchange, it got even more money from \nWashington to cover the costs.\n  So how much money are we talking about? Well, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, the Federal Government has awarded \ngrants of over $7.4 billion as of this March.\n  People all across the country know the Federal exchange was an \nabsolute train wreck when it was launched. In one State after another, \nthe State exchanges also have been collapsing and costing taxpayers a \nfortune. Now some of those States have absolutely given up. They have \ndecided they want to scrap their own systems and go into the Federal \nexchange after all--an option they had at first, but they decided to go \nfirst to the State exchange and now it has failed. What they have done \nis they have spent a lot of taxpayer money--money Washington sent to \nthem. Where is the money? The money is gone. Their system doesn't work, \nand now what they want to do is have a fresh start.\n  President Obama says Democrats should forcefully defend and be proud \nof the law. I want to see where the people are now coming to the floor \nto forcefully defend and be proud of this health care law.\n  I ask the President--is he proud that these ObamaCare exchanges are \nfailing all across the country? Are Democrats who voted for this health \ncare law ready to forcefully defend all the taxpayer dollars that we \nnow know have been wasted? Democrats don't want to talk about the law's \nexpensive side effects or about the Americans harmed by the law.\n  Republicans have been offering solutions. Today Senator Hatch and I \nare introducing legislation that would address these State failures and \nprotect taxpayers. After all, that is what Americans want. They want \naccountability for their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill, \ncalled the State Exchange Accountability Act, says that if the State \ngot Federal money to set up its own exchange and later decided to give \nup and move back on to the Federal exchange, it would have to pay back \nthe money. It is that simple. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay twice for \nthe mistakes of incompetent State bureaucrats who couldn't set up a \nworking health care exchange. States would have 10 years to pay back \nthe grants. They would have to pay them back in full. I know State \nbudgets are tight, so they wouldn't have to come up with the whole \namount all at once. They would pay back 10 percent of the total each \nyear for the next 10 years. These States that walk away from their \nexchanges are conceding that they wasted the money they received, and \nit is only fair that these States should repay the American taxpayers.\n  The failure of these exchanges and the money squandered on them was a \nside effect of the health care law. Democrats told States they could \nset up these exchanges and Washington would pay the bill. So some \nStates didn't really care what it cost. They didn't care if the work \nwas being done well or even done at all. As far as they were concerned, \ndon't worry, whether it works or not it is somebody else's money.\n  Well, this bill I am introducing today tells these State \nbureaucracies that it is time for them to care about the money they \nhave wasted. This won't fix all of the harmful side effects the \nDemocrats created with the health care law, but it is a start, and it \nis the right thing to do.\n  If you want a sense of how big the problem is, look at an article \nthat ran in Politico on Monday this week. The headline is ``Four States \nin a Fix Over Their Troubled Exchanges.'' The article talks about four \nState exchanges\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\nthat basically embraced ObamaCare: Massachusetts, Maryland, Nevada, \nOregon. It says that these four State exchanges spent at least $474 \nmillion and ``are now in shambles.''\n  Look at it--Maryland, $118 million; Massachusetts, $57 million; \nNevada, $51 million; for Oregon, $248 million of taxpayer money from \naround the country was sent to Oregon for programs that are now in \nshambles. So now some of these States want even more money to fix what \nhas gone wrong in the first place.\n  According to Politico, Maryland spent $118 million to set up its own \nexchange, and State officials did such a bad job that they are now \nplanning to scrap the whole thing and use software from Connecticut's \nexchange. Massachusetts spent $57 million. Politico called the program \nin Massachusetts ``fatally crippled.'' Nevada spent $51 million. \nPolitico says salvaging that exchange ``would be a huge feat.'' Oregon \nspent $248 million to set up its own exchange. It was such a \nspectacular failure that CNBC ran a headline on May 5 stating ``FBI \nprobing Oregon's ObamaCare exchange.'' The FBI is probing the exchange. \nThe State plans to use the Federal exchange from now on, getting rid of \ntheir State exchange. That is the kind of double-dipping our bill goes \nafter.\n  Why should Democrats in Washington, DC, be telling taxpayers across \nAmerica that they have to pay for the failures of State officials in \nMassachusetts, Nevada, Maryland, Oregon, and other States that may find \nthemselves in the same situation?\n  Democrats have said and the President continues to say that he wants \neveryone to have a fair shot. Are Americans from other States who have \nto pay higher taxes because of these failed exchanges getting a fair \nshot? Well, they are not.\n  Our bill will start to give a fair shot to Americans who don't want \nto pay twice to bail out incompetent State bureaucrats. It will give a \nfair shot to Americans who want to reclaim some of their hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  This is just one of many ideas Republicans have offered and will \ncontinue to offer to create a patient-centered approach to health care. \nThe plans we have offered will solve the biggest problems families \nface, which is the cost of care and access to care, problems that seem \nto have been ignored when Democrats forced this law through Congress. \nThat means measures that would allow small businesses to pull together \nin order to buy health insurance for employees. Small businesses \ndeserve a fair shot. It means letting people shop for health insurance \nthat works for them and their families--not what the government says is \nbest for them but what they say is best for themselves and their \nfamilies. People deserve a fair shot at buying a plan that is best for \nthemselves and their families. It means adequately funding State high-\nrisk pools that help people get insurance--people who have disease, \npeople who are sick--without raising the costs for healthier people. \nThese are just a few of the solutions Republicans have offered and \ncontinue to offer to give Americans real health care reform and a real \nfair shot, health care reform that gives people the care they need from \na doctor they choose at lower costs, without all of the harmful and \nexpensive ObamaCare side effects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3032-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 445--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CANCER RESEARCH \nAND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SCIENTISTS, CLINICIANS, AND PATIENT ADVOCATES \n   ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE DEDICATED TO FINDING A CURE FOR \n CANCER, AND DESIGNATING MAY 2014 AS ``NATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 445\n\n       Whereas in 2014, cancer remains one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2014, more than 1,600,000 individuals in the \n     United States are expected to be diagnosed with cancer and \n     more than 585,000 individuals in the United States are \n     expected to die from the disease;\n       Whereas 1 in 2 men in the United States will be diagnosed \n     with cancer during his lifetime, and 1 in 3 women in the \n     United States will be diagnosed with cancer during her \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas 77 percent of individuals diagnosed with cancer are \n     over the age of 55;\n       Whereas cancer accounts for approximately 1 in every 4 \n     deaths, is the second most common cause of disease-related \n     death in the United States, and is projected to become the \n     number 1 disease-related killer of individuals in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas racial and ethnic minorities, as well as low-income \n     and elderly populations, continue to suffer \n     disproportionately in cancer incidence, prevalence, and \n     mortality;\n       Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 \n     diseases that collectively represent--\n       (1) the leading cause of death for individuals in the \n     United States under the age of 85; and\n       (2) the second leading cause of death for all individuals \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas cancer is expected to cost the United States \n     economy an estimated $216,000,000,000 in 2014, and the \n     economic burden of cancer is expected to rise as the number \n     of cancer deaths increases;\n       Whereas the United States investment in cancer research has \n     yielded substantial advances in cancer research and has saved \n     many lives;\n       Whereas scholars estimate that every 1 percent decline in \n     cancer mortality saves the United States economy \n     $500,000,000,000;\n       Whereas advancements in understanding the causes, \n     mechanisms, diagnoses, treatment, and prevention of cancer \n     have led to cures for many types of cancer and have converted \n     other types of cancer into manageable chronic conditions;\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for all types of cancer \n     was greater than 65 percent in 2011, improving between 1981 \n     and 2011, and more than 13,700,000 cancer survivors were \n     living in the United States in 2011;\n       Whereas therapy and effective screening tools for some \n     types of cancer remain elusive, and some cancers, including \n     pancreatic, liver, lung, ovarian, and brain cancer, continue \n     to have extraordinarily high mortality rates and 5-year \n     survival rates that are typically less than 50 percent;\n       Whereas partnerships among research scientists, the general \n     public, cancer survivors, patient advocates, philanthropic \n     organizations, industry, and Federal, State, and local \n     governments have led to advanced breakthroughs, early \n     detection tools that have increased survival rates, and a \n     better quality of life for cancer survivors;\n       Whereas precision medicine holds great promise in treating \n     cancer; and\n       Whereas advances in cancer research have had significant \n     implications for the treatment of other costly diseases, such \n     as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, \n     and macular degeneration: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of cancer research and the \n     invaluable contributions of researchers in the United States \n     and around the world who are dedicated to reversing the \n     cancer epidemic;\n       (2) designates May 2014 as ``National Cancer Research \n     Month''; and\n       (3) supports efforts to establish cancer research as a \n     national and international priority to eventually eliminate \n     the more than 200 diseases that collectively represent \n     cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3032-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3032-S3033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3065.

Res. 314\n\n       Whereas an estimated 35,000,000 people are living with HIV/\n     AIDS in 2013;\n       Whereas the 2001 United Nations Declaration of Commitment \n     on HIV/AIDS Global mobilized global attention and commitment \n     to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and set out a series of national \n     targets and global actions to reverse the epidemic;\n       Whereas the 2011 United Nations General Assembly High Level \n     Meeting on AIDS addressed the progress of intensified efforts \n     to eliminate HIV and AIDS, including redoubling efforts to \n     achieve by 2015 universal access to HIV prevention, \n     treatment, care, and support, and to eliminate gender \n     inequalities and gender-based abuse and violence and increase \n     the capacity of women and adolescent girls to protect \n     themselves from the risk of HIV infection;\n       Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n     Malaria was launched in 2002 and, as of November 2013, \n     supported programs in more than 140 countries that provided \n     antiretroviral therapy to 6,100,000 people living with HIV/\n     AIDS and antiretrovirals to 2,100,000 pregnant women to \n     prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS to their babies;\n       Whereas the United States is the largest donor to the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria;\n       Whereas for every dollar contributed to the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria by the United States, an \n     additional $2 is leveraged from other donors;\n       Whereas the United States hosted the Global Fund's Fourth \n     Voluntary Replenishment Conference on December 2-3, 2013;\n       Whereas the United States President's Emergency Plan for \n     AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), introduced by President George W. Bush \n     in 2003, remains the largest commitment in history by any \n     nation to combat a single disease;\n       Whereas, as of the end of September 2012, PEPFAR supported \n     treatment for 5,100,000 people, up from 1,700,000 in 2008, \n     and in 2012, PEPFAR supported provision of antiretroviral \n     drugs to 750,000 pregnant women living with HIV to prevent \n     the transmission of HIV from mother to baby during birth;\n       Whereas PEPFAR directly supported HIV testing and \n     counseling for more than 46,500,000 people in fiscal year \n     2012;\n       Whereas considerable progress has been made in the fight \n     against HIV/AIDS, with total new HIV infections estimated at \n     2,300,000 in 2012, a 33-percent reduction since 2001; new HIV \n     infections among children reduced to 260,000 in 2012, a \n     reduction of 52 percent since 2001; and AIDS-related deaths \n     reduced to 1,600,000 in 2012, a 30-percent reduction since \n     2005;\n       Whereas increased access to antiretroviral drugs is the \n     major contributor to the reduction in deaths from HIV/AIDS, \n     and HIV treatment reinforces prevention because it reduces, \n     by up to 96 percent, the chance the virus can be spread;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) has revised its \n     guidelines for determining whether HIV positive individuals \n     are eligible for treatment, thereby increasing the number of \n     individuals eligible for treatment from about 15,000,000 to \n     28,000,000;\n       Whereas 9,700,000 people in low- and middle-income \n     countries had access to antiretroviral therapy by the end of \n     2012, an increase of nearly 20 percent in a year;\n       Whereas an estimated 50 percent of those living with HIV do \n     not know their status, according to a 2012 UNAIDS report;\n       Whereas sub-Saharan Africa remains the epicenter of the \n     epidemic, accounting for 1,200,000 of the 1,600,000 deaths \n     from HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas stigma, gender inequality, and lack of respect for \n     the rights of HIV positive individuals remain significant \n     barriers to access to services for those most at risk of HIV \n     infection;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama voiced commitment to \n     realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation and his \n     belief that the goal was within reach in his February 2013 \n     State of the Union Address;\n       Whereas the international community is united in pursuit of \n     achieving the goal of an AIDS-free generation by 2015;\n       Whereas international donor funding has held steady since \n     2008 and countries affected by the epidemic are increasingly \n     taking responsibility for funding and sustaining programs in \n     their countries, currently accounting for approximately 53 \n     percent of global HIV/AIDS resources;\n       Whereas December 1 of each year is internationally \n     recognized as World AIDS Day; and\n       Whereas, in 2013, World AIDS Day commemorations focused on: \n     ``[g]etting to zero: zero new HIV infections, zero \n     discrimination, zero AIDS-related deaths'': Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World AIDS Day, \n     including getting to zero through zero new HIV infections, \n     zero discrimination, and zero AIDS-related deaths;\n       (2) applauds the goals and approaches for achieving an \n     AIDS-free generation set forth in the PEPFAR Blueprint: \n     Creating an AIDS-free Generation;\n       (3) commends the dramatic progress in global AIDS programs \n     supported through the efforts of PEPFAR, the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNAIDS;\n       (4) urges, in order to ensure that an AIDS-free generation \n     is within reach, rapid action towards--\n       (A) full implementation of the Global Plan Towards the \n     Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and \n     Keeping Their Mothers Alive to build on progress made to \n     date; and\n       (B) further expansion and scale-up of antiretroviral \n     treatment programs, including efforts to reduce disparities \n     and improve access for children to life-saving medications;\n       (5) calls for scaling up treatment to reach all individuals \n     eligible for treatment under WHO guidelines;\n       (6) calls for greater focus on HIV/AIDS vulnerabilities of \n     women and girls, including more directed efforts to ensure \n     that they are connected to the information, care, and \n     treatment they require;\n       (7) supports efforts to ensure inclusive access to programs \n     and human rights protections for all those most at risk of \n     HIV/AIDS and hardest to reach;\n       (8) encourages additional private-public partnerships to \n     research and develop better and more affordable tools for the \n     diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and cure of HIV;\n       (9) supports continued leadership by the United States in \n     bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to fight \n     HIV;\n       (10) encourages and supports greater degrees of ownership \n     and shared responsibility by developing countries in order to \n     ensure sustainability of their domestic responses; and\n       (11) encourages other members of the international \n     community to sustain and scale up their support for and \n     financial contributions to efforts around the world to combat \n     HIV/AIDS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/14/senate-section/article/S3044-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING REGRET OF THE SENATE FOR THE PASSAGE OF SECTION 3 OF THE \nEXPATRIATION ACT OF 1907 THAT REVOKED THE UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP OF \n                  WOMEN WHO MARRIED FOREIGN NATIONALS\n\n  Mr. REID.
