Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 236, H.R. \n3204, the drug compounding legislation.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (H.R. 3204) to amend the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to human \n     drug compounding and drug supply chain security, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID.

The bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n\n\n                    Condolences to the Inhofe Family\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my condolences to Jim Inhofe, the \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma, and his wife Kay on the loss of their son \nPerry. The entire Senate family was saddened to hear of Dr. Inhofe's \ndeath. He was a young man, 52 years of age, killed in a plane crash \nearly Sunday.\n  Flying airplanes is in the blood of Jim Inhofe and his family. I \ntruly care a lot about Jim Inhofe. He and I are unquestionably friends. \nWe may not agree on all political issues, but we agree we are friends.\n  I have had the good fortune of working to get to know this good man. \nI have helped him when I could, and he has helped me when he could. We \nare able to put all the disagreements to one side and look at each \nother for what we are outside of our politics.\n  I have confidence that he is going to do well. He is a man of great \nfaith, and I feel comfortable that he will be able to work his way \nthrough this loss.\n  (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                            Filipino Typhoon\n\n  Madam President, my heart also goes out to the residents of the \nPhilippines who were drastically affected by this terrible storm that \nhit one or two or three of their islands over the weekend. The \nPhilippines has 7,000 islands.\n  The heavily populated area of Manila was not hit--at least not very \nbadly. We know there are thousands of Filipinos dead and missing. \nRelief and construction efforts will be long and difficult. My thoughts \nare with the approximately 3\\1/2\\ million Filipino Americans who are \nliving with us--including in Nevada about 100,000 Filipino Americans. \nThey are involved in so many important endeavors, such as the health \ncare field, business field, and hotel business.\n  They may not have lost family members, but they are a community that \nis concerned with what is going on in the Philippines. I was happy to \nhear the administration has already moved in with support and aid for \nthis beleaguered nation.\n\n\n                            DC Circuit Court\n\n  Madam President, later today we are going to again attempt to break a \nfilibuster on the highly qualified person who has been asked by the \nPresident to serve on the DC Circuit. It is often said the DC Circuit \nis the second highest court in the land after the Supreme Court, and \nthat is true. It is unfortunate the Republicans have chosen to \nfilibuster a nomination of yet another talented female jurist and \ndedicated public servant to fill a vacant seat on this court.\n  The nominee, Georgetown law professor Nina Pillard, has argued nine\n\n[[Page S7938]]\n\ncases before the Supreme Court and briefed more than a score of cases. \nIn one case she argued before the Supreme Court, it involved a male \nemployee of the State of Nevada who was fired after taking unpaid leave \nto care for his wife who was sick. It was an important case, a landmark \ncase. The Court ruled 6 to 3 in favor of her client, upholding an \nimportant protection under the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  Support for Professor Pillard's nomination is bipartisan--at least \noutside the Senate. Yet Senate Republicans seem poised to block \nconfirmation of this eminently qualified woman for a blatantly \npolitical reason: deny President Obama his constitutional right to \nappoint judges.\n  The DC Circuit is currently operating with a very bad ratio. We have \nthree vacancies on this very important court. For the Republicans to \nnow claim we don't need 11 judges is a little strange because that is \nnot what they said when President Bush was President. When he needed \nthese vacancies filled, they were filled. They happily filled the 9th, \n10th, and 11th seats on the DC Circuit--the same three seats President \nObama seeks to fill--even though the court had a significantly smaller \ncaseload at the time. The Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was \none of the judges confirmed to the DC Circuit during George Bush's \nPresidency.\n  Since a Democrat was elected to the White House, Republicans have \nblocked two exceedingly qualified female nominees to the DC Circuit, \nCaitlin Halligan and Patricia Millett. In the last 19 years, five men \nhave been confirmed to the DC Circuit and one woman.\n  Today the Senate has an opportunity to help shape a court that better \nreflects our country, so I hope they will not block another qualified \nfemale nominee for nakedly partisan reasons. The least Senate \nRepublicans owe Professor Pillard is the same fair confirmation process \nChief Justice Roberts enjoyed when he was nominated to the DC Circuit.\n\n\n                            Drug Compounding\n\n  Madam President, should Republicans block her confirmation, as I fear \nthey will, the Senate will then vote on cloture on the motion to \nproceed to a bill to enhance safeguards at compounding pharmacies which \ncreate custom-tailored medication for patients with unique health \nneeds.\n  This bipartisan legislation will ensure drugs manufactured in \nfactories and mixed in pharmacies across the country are safe for \nconsumers. The measure will also implement tracking of medicines from \nthe factory to the drug store itself.\n  Last year unsanitary conditions at a compounding pharmacy led to a \nfungal meningitis outbreak that killed 64 people and very badly \nsickened more than 750 others. Contaminated medicine mixed at that \npharmacy was sent to 75 medical facilities in 23 States and given to \n14,000 patients. The facility in question was actually skirting \nexisting law and acting as a large-scale drug manufacturer rather than \ncreating custom medications for individuals using products manufactured \nby other companies.\n  By avoiding stricter regulations on drug manufacturers, companies \nsuch as this one boost their profits by putting patients at risk. This \nlegislation will end this dangerous practice and ensure that drugs \nmanufactured and mixed in America are completely safe from the assembly \nline to the drug store.\n  This bill could pass the Senate right now, but it has been stalled by \nRepublicans for more than 1 month. This legislation truly is a matter \nof life and death.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Madam President, we must finish this legislation quickly so we can \nwrap up consideration of the crucial Defense authorization bill before \nThanksgiving.\n  I put Senators on notice last week and the week before that we are \ngoing to do whatever it takes to accomplish exactly that in order to \nfinish this bill--even if it means working this coming weekend and \nhopefully not the next weekend but possibly that too.\n  Further, we must ensure that debate on the Defense authorization bill \nis about our Nation's defense and not extraneous issues. No Senators \nshould be allowed to jump the line and get a vote on his or her own \namendment by threatening delay action on the underlying bill, nor \nshould the Senate waste time debating amendments that are not relevant \nto defense.\n  This measure ensures the safety of this Nation and is dedicated to \nservicemembers, and it is more important than any one Senator's or \nSenators' parochial or political pet issues.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                   Heartfelt Sympathy to the Inhofes\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I will start with a word of sympathy \nabout the heartbreaking loss of Perry Inhofe, the son of our colleague, \nJim Inhofe, killed in a plane crash on Sunday. Of course, we are all \nthinking of Jim and Kay, and the heartfelt prayers of the entire Senate \nfamily are with them and the entire Inhofe family at this very, very \ndifficult time.\n\n\n                               DC Circuit\n\n  Madam President, despite the repeated promises of President Obama, \nmillions of people are losing their health insurance--health insurance \nthey very much liked and were assured they could keep. It has been \nreported that so far 3.5 million Americans have lost their health \ninsurance under ObamaCare. That includes over a quarter of a million in \nmy State of Kentucky, a third of a million in Florida, and almost a \nmillion people in California.\n  This is a serious problem the President and congressional Democrats \nneed to do something about. The obvious answer is repeal, but in the \nmeantime the legislation offered by Senator Ron Johnson would help \nAmericans keep the plans they have and like. If the President and \nSenate Democrats are serious about helping the millions of Americans \nwho have unexpectedly lost their insurance over the past several weeks, \nthen they should support it.\n  Unfortunately, they appear ready to ignore the problem. Rather than \nfocusing on keeping their commitment to the American people, they are \nfocusing on issues that appeal to their base. Rather than change the \nlaw that is causing so many problems for so many, they want to change \nthe subject.\n  According to a recent press report, our Democratic friends want to \ndivert as much attention as possible away from the problem-plagued \nObamaCare rollout at this formative stage of the 2014 campaign, which \nbrings us to the vote we are going to have later today.\n  We will not be voting on legislation to allow Americans to keep their \nhealth insurance if they like it, as they were promised again and \nagain; rather, we will be voting on a nominee to a court that doesn't \nhave enough work to do. A court that is so underworked, it regularly \ncancels oral argument days. It is a court whose judges tell us that if \nany more judges were put on the court, there wouldn't be enough work to \ngo around. It is a court that is less busy now than it was when Senate \nDemocrats pocket-filibustered President Bush's nominee to the court, \nPeter Keisler, for 2 whole years--2 long years. And it is less busy \nbased upon the very standards Democrats themselves set forth when they \nblocked Mr. Keisler's nomination for 2 years. By the way, it is also \nless busy now than it was then, according to an analysis provided by \nthe chief judge of that court.\n  The Senate ought to be spending its time dealing with a real crisis, \nnot a manufactured one. We ought to be dealing with an ill-conceived \nlaw that is causing millions of Americans to lose their health \ninsurance. Instead, we will spend our time today on a political \nexercise designed to distract the American people from the mess that is \nObamaCare rather than trying to fix it.\n  If our Democratic colleagues are going to ignore the fact that \nmillions of people are losing their health insurance plans, they should \nat least be working with us to fill judicial emergencies that actually \nexist rather than complaining about fake ones. There are nominees on \nthe Executive Calendar who would fill actual judicial emergencies, \nunlike the Pillard nomination.\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\nSome of them, in fact, have been pending on the calendar longer than \nthe Pillard nomination. But rather than work with us to schedule votes \non those nominations in an orderly manner, as we have been doing all \nyear long, the majority prefers to concoct a crisis on the DC Circuit \nso it can try to distract the American people from the failings of \nObamaCare.\n  Unfortunately, our friends appear to be more concerned with playing \npolitics than actually solving real problems. So I will be voting no on \nthis afternoon's political exercise. I hope the Senate in the future \nwill focus on what the American people care about rather than spend its \ntime trying to distract them.\n\n\n                 Congratulating Archbishop Joseph Kurtz\n\n  Finally, I congratulate Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, the Catholic \narchbishop of Louisville, on his election as president of the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops. Archbishop Kurtz is not a native \nKentuckian--he is originally from Pennsylvania--but we have adopted him \nas one of our own since he was appointed head of the Louisville \nArchdiocese in June 2007. I wish him all the best as he seeks to \npromote the church's mission in the United States.\n  Congratulations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/12/senate-section/article/S7939-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in \nopposition to the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination for the DC \nCircuit nominee Cornelia Pillard. Although her record makes clear that \nher views are well outside the mainstream on a host of issues, I am not \ngoing to focus any attention on those concerns today. I am going to \nfocus instead on the standard the Democrats established in 2006. Based \non that standard, the court's caseload makes it clear that the workload \nsimply doesn't justify additional judges, particularly when those \nadditional judges cost approximately $1 million per year per judge.\n  I have walked through these statistics several times now, and I am \nnot going to go in depth again. The bottom line is the data \noverwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the DC Circuit is \nunderworked. Everyone knows this is true. That circuit does not need \nany more judges. Take, for instance, the appeals filed and appeals \nterminated. In both categories the DC Circuit ranks last, and in both \ncategories the DC Circuit is less than half the national average. To \nprovide some perspective on this point, compare the DC Circuit to the \nEleventh. After another judge took senior status about a week ago, both \nthe DC Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit have eight active judges. If we \ndon't confirm any more judges to either court, the numbers remain the \nsame as last year. The Eleventh Circuit will have 875 appeals per \nactive judge compared to the 149 appeals filed per active judge in DC, \nwhich also has 8 active judges. Again, that is 875 cases for the \nEleventh compared to 149 for DC.\n  Some might argue that we shouldn't look only at active judges because \nthose averages will change if and when we confirm more judges to the \nEleventh Circuit. Suppose we fill each judgeship on the Eleventh \nCircuit and each judgeship on the DC Circuit, as the Democrats want to \ndo. If we fill them all, there would be 583 appeals filed per judge for \nthe Eleventh Circuit and only 108 for the DC Circuit. The Eleventh \nCircuit, then, would have over five times the caseload. This is why \neveryone who has looked at this objectively understands that the \ncaseload for the DC Circuit is stunningly low. That is why current \njudges on the court have written to me and said things such as this--\nand I will quote from one of the letters: ``If any more judges were \nadded now, there wouldn't be enough work to go around.''\n  Some of my friends on the other side recognize that the DC Circuit's \ncaseload is low, and they claim then that the caseload numbers don't \ntake into account the ``complexity'' of the court's docket. They argue \nthat the DC Circuit hears more administrative appeals than other \ncircuits do, and they claim these administrative appeals are more \ncomplex. This argument is nonsense, and I will tell my colleagues why \nit is nonsense.\n  I have heard my colleagues argue repeatedly that the DC Circuit's \ndocket is complex because 43 percent of the docket is made up of \nadministrative appeals. But, of course, that is a high percentage of a \nvery small number. When we look at the actual number of those so-called \ncomplex cases per judge, the Second Circuit has almost twice as many as \nthe DC Circuit. In 2012 there were 512 administrative appeals filed in \nDC. In the Second Circuit, there were 1,493 compared to that 512.\n  We can look at this differently as well. In DC there were only 64 \nadministrative appeals per active judge. The Second Circuit has nearly \ntwice as many per judge with 115. Again, that is 64 administrative \nappeals per active judge in the DC Circuit as opposed to the Second \nCircuit, which has almost twice as many with 115.\n  So this entire argument about complexity is what I already called \nit--nonsense--and the other side knows it, and if they don't know it, \nthey ought to know it.\n  Let me raise another question regarding caseload. If these cases were \nreally that hard, if these cases were really so complex, then why in \nthe world would the DC Circuit take the entire summer off? I am not \ntalking about just a couple of weeks in August; they don't hear any \ncases for the entire summer. The DC Circuit has so few cases on their \ndocket that they don't hear any cases from the middle of May until the \nsecond week of September. This past term, the last case they heard \nbefore taking the summer off was May 16. The court didn't hear another \ncase until September 9--4 months later.\n  The bottom line is everyone knows this court doesn't have enough \ncases as it is, let alone if we were to add more judges. That is why, \nwhen we ask the current judges for their candid assessment, they write: \n``If any more judges were confirmed now, there wouldn't be enough work \nto go around.''\n  While I am discussing the caseload issue, I will remind my colleagues \nof a little bit of history that is very pertinent to this debate. In \n2006 the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee blocked Peter Keisler's \nnomination to the DC Circuit. They blocked Mr. Keisler's nomination \nbased upon--my colleagues can guess it--the court's caseload. Since \nthat time, by the standard set by the other side, the court's caseload \nhas declined sharply.\n\n  We did not set this standard. The Democrats set that standard. I \nrecognize that the other side wants to rewrite history. They try to \ncompare John Roberts' second nomination to the circuit, which passed \nfairly easily, with the current nomination. What they conveniently \nforget in a misleading way is that they blocked Keisler's nomination \nafter Roberts' nomination.\n  I recognize the other side hopes we on this side will forget they \nestablished these rules and these precedents. I recognize the other \nside finds those rules very inconvenient today. But these are not \nreasons to ignore rules and precedents they established. There is \nsimply no legitimate reason the other side should not embrace those \nvery same rules, those very same standards they established in the year \n2006.\n  So under that standard established by the Democrats in 2006, then, \nvery simply, these nominations are not needed. According to the current \njudges themselves, these judges are not needed. According to the chief \njudge of the DC Circuit, who happens to be a Clinton appointee, the \nsenior judges are contributing the equivalent of an additional 3.25 \njudges. So, as a result, the court already has the equivalent of 11.25 \njudges, and that is beyond even the authorized number.\n  It seems pretty clear the other side has run out of legitimate \narguments in support of these nominations. Perhaps that is why, then, \nthey are resorting to such cheap tactics.\n  Over the last couple days, I have heard my colleagues on the other \nside\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\ncome to the floor and actually argue that Republicans are opposing the \nnominee because of her gender. That argument is offensive. But, you \nknow, it tends to be very predictable. We have seen this before. When \nthe other side runs out of legitimate arguments, their last line of \ndefense is to accuse Republicans of opposing nominees based upon gender \nor race. It is an old and it is a well-worn card, and they play it \nevery time.\n  The fact is--and this is why it is offensive to me--I voted for 75 \nwomen nominated to the bench by President Obama, as well as a host of \nother nominees of diverse backgrounds. Those are the facts. But the \nother side is not concerned with facts. They are more interested in \ncoarse rhetoric as well as demagoguery, and it is very unfortunate. \nThose types of personal attacks on Members of the Senate are beneath \nthis institution.\n  Given there is no legitimate reason to fill these seats, why is the \nother side pushing these nominations so aggressively? And this is \nreally the bottom line. But you can also ask, why waste $3 million a \nyear of taxpayers' money for reasons that are not legitimate, \nparticularly in violation of the constitutional checks and balances?\n  As to these other reasons, we do not have to guess. We know the \nreason. We have all heard the President pledge repeatedly: If Congress \nwill not act, I will. What he means, of course, is that he will rule by \nexecutive fiat. He will not go to Congress. He will not negotiate. He \nwill go around this constitutionally elected body whose constitutional \npowers are to make law. That is not his power. He does not need \nlegislators, then, to enact legislation. He will just issue executive \norders or issue new agency rules. Why bother with us pesky Senators and \nMembers of the House when you can make laws with a stroke of the pen? \nIn effect, the President is saying: If the Senate will not confirm who \nI want when I want them, then I will recess-appoint them when the \nSenate is even in session. If Congress will not pass cap-and-trade fee \nincreases, then I will go around them. And I will do the same thing \nthrough administrative action at the Environmental Protection Agency. \nIf Congress will not pass gun control legislation, then I will issue \nexecutive orders.\n  That is what the President means when he says: If Congress will not \nact, I will. But remember, we have a system of checks and balances. \nUnder our system, when the President issues orders by executive fiat, \nit is the courts that provide a check on his power. It is the courts \nthat decide whether the President is acting unconstitutionally.\n  So the only way the President's plan works is if he stacks the deck \nin his favor. The only way the President can successfully bypass \nCongress is if he stacks the court with ideological allies who will \nrubberstamp those executive orders.\n  There is no big secret here. The other side has not been shy about \nthis strategy. Here is how the Washington Post described this strategy:\n\n       Giving liberals a greater say on the D.C. Circuit is \n     important for Obama as he looks for ways to circumvent the \n     Republican-led House and a polarized Senate on a number of \n     policy fronts through executive order and other \n     administrative procedures.\n\n  Here is how another high-profile administration ally put it:\n\n       There are few things more vital on the president's second-\n     term agenda. With legislative priorities gridlocked in \n     Congress, the president's best hope for advancing his agenda \n     is through executive action, and that runs through the D.C. \n     Circuit.\n\n  So the President is willing to waste $3 million of taxpayers' money a \nyear--and every year--in order to bypass Congress and make sure his \nexecutive orders do not lose in court. Every Member of this body should \nfind that very troubling.\n  Finally, I want to mention a couple points on the so-called Gang of \n14 agreement, which argument comes up quite frequently here on the \nfloor, even though it is going back to the 109th Congress.\n  First, by the very terms of that agreement, it applied only to those \n14 Senators for that specific Congress, the 109th.\n  Second, even though that agreement, by its own terms, expired at the \nend of the 109th Congress, just last week one of the Members who was \nactually in the Senate back in 2005 determined that these nominations, \nin his judgment, constituted ``extraordinary circumstances,'' which \nthose two words implied that a filibuster would be justified.\n  And third, in 2006, after the so-called Gang of 14 agreement, Senate \nDemocrats created a standard that we call the Keisler standard. They \nblocked Peter Keisler based on caseload, after the so-called Gang of 14 \nagreement. Peter Keisler waited in committee for over 900 days for a \nvote, a vote that never came.\n  These are the rules established by the other side. And now, when they \nare on the receiving end of those same rules, they want those rules \nchanged. We do not intend to play by two sets of rules around here.\n  And that brings me to the constant threat from the majority about \nchanging the rules on the filibuster. I have been in the minority for a \nnumber of years. I have also had the privilege of serving in the \nmajority for a number of years. Many of those on the other side who are \nclamoring for rules changes--and almost falling over themselves to do \nit--have never served a single day in the minority. All I can say is \nthis: Be careful what you wish for.\n  I have come to the conclusion that if the rules are changed, at least \nwe Republicans will get to use those new rules when we are back in the \nmajority. Republicans had the chance 7 or 8 years ago to change the \nrules, and we decided, out of respect for the integrity of this \ninstitution, not to change them. I am glad we did not. And I would \nimagine we would not be the first to change them in the future.\n  Remember, it was the Democrats who first used the filibuster to \ndefeat circuit judges. It was the Democrats who first used the caseload \nargument to defeat circuit judges such as Peter Keisler. So if the \nDemocrats are bent on changing the rules, then I say go ahead. There \nare a lot more Scalias and Thomases out there whom we would love to put \non the bench. The nominees we would nominate and confirm with 51 votes \nwill interpret the Constitution as it was written. They are not the \ntype who would invent constitutional law right out of thin air.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the Pillard nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have high hopes that the Senate will \nsoon vote to enact the Drug Quality and Security Act, the so-called \ncompounding and trace and track bill. This legislation helps ensure the \nsafety of compounded drug products. It also secures the pharmaceutical \nsupply chain.\n  I am pleased to report that it is the product of excellent bipartisan \ncollaboration on the HELP Committee, where I worked very closely with \nour ranking member, my good friend Senator Lamar Alexander. It also \nreflects productive conversations with our colleagues in the House, \nincluding Chairman Upton and ranking member Waxman of the House Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  The House passed this bill on September 28. Now it is our turn to do \nour part. Title I of the bill addresses drug compounding. This is \nbasically what happened here just over a year ago, when we were shocked \nto learn one of the worst public health crises that we have experienced \nin recent years was a meningitis outbreak that claimed the lives of 64 \nAmericans and sickened 651 people in 20 States.\n  You can see the hardest hit were the home State of Senator Alexander, \n153; Indiana, 93; Michigan, 264; Virginia 54, New Jersey, 51; Florida \n25. Twenty States. A lot of people got really sick. I will be talking \nin a moment about those that still linger today.\n  What this outbreak did is it brought attention to the legal and \nregulatory gaps that allowed owners and managers at the New England \nCompounding Center to disregard basic procedures to ensure that the \nproducts they were manufacturing were sterile and safe.\n  This gross negligence had heart-breaking consequences for families \nnationwide, patients that were sick--patients such as Karina Baxter, \nwhose\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\nthree adult children--Anita, Andrew, and Brian--lost their mother, and \nwhose community lost a dedicated math teacher and tutor when she died \nof this meningitis outbreak at age 56.\n  Dawn Elliot, from Indiana, who used to scuba dive in her free time is \nnow in unrelenting pain and has had to give up her job and deplete her \nsavings.\n  Evelyn Bates, from Michigan, who was diagnosed last November, \ncontinues to struggle with tremendous pain every day, and her daughter \nhad to quit her job to take care of her.\n  Dennis Blatt lives on the West Virginia-Ohio border with his wife and \nthree young children. They have had to watch their father go from being \nan involved parent with a steady income to a man whose daily life \nfeels, in his own words, like a ``slow, tortuous death.''\n  These meningitis outbreaks linger on. It also has a personal \nsensitivity to me. My older brother some years ago went deaf at a very \nyoung age because of meningitis. So it has lingering effects for a \nlifetime. That is what happened a little over a year ago. Although we \nknow that it was not just an isolated incident, we know it was the \nbiggest.\n  This chart is somewhat hard to read. It shows--going clear back to \n2001--that we have had 4, 11, 64, 18. In other words, every year we \nhave had some results we have noted from compounding that made people \nsick or cause deaths. So this has been ongoing for a long time.\n  It is just that what happened a little over a year ago in Tennessee \nand in these other States was that the dam broke. It is beyond all \ncomprehension how many people got sick and died. So again, in response \nto these facts, beginning last year Senator Alexander and I convened \nthe members of the HELP Committee, with assistance from Senator Franken \nand Senator Roberts, in an effort to identify the gaps in current \npolicy, to solicit stakeholder views, to craft bipartisan legislation \nto better ensure the quality of compounded drug products.\n  We formally solicited three rounds of public comment. We held two \npublic hearings before marking up the bill last May. Then over the \nsummer we worked with our colleagues in the House to craft a package \nwith strong bipartisan and bicameral support.\n  Now, the compounding provisions in this bill are an unqualified step \nforward from current law and practice. Basically, what this bill does \nin the compounding in title I--I will get to title II in a second--it \ndistinguishes compounders engaged in traditional pharmacy practice from \nthose making large volumes of compounded drugs without individual \nprescriptions.\n  So those who wish to remain in traditional compounding, that we might \nknow where they are making small amounts for a certain type of illness \nor for a certain hospital--that sort of thing--they stay under the \nState boards of pharmacy as they are in current law.\n  An entity that neither stays within those limits of traditional \npharmacy compounding nor registers as an outsourcing facility, if they \ndo not do one of those two, then they are illegally selling unapproved \ndrugs.\n  So that is what it does. It distinguishes. It defines the Food and \nDrug Administration's role in the oversight of these outsourcing \nfacilities. They will be subject to FDA oversight in much the same way \nas traditional drug manufacturers are today.\n  FDA will know who these outsourcers are and what they are making, \nreceive adverse event reports about compounded drugs, and have \nauthority and resources to conduct risk-based inspections. In other \nwords, the lines of responsibility are more clearly defined.\n  I give much credit to my friend from Tennessee for continuing to work \non who is raising the flag, who has the flag, and who is responsible, \nbecause we found out there was a confusing mess for everybody about who \nwas responsible and who was not. Thanks to Senator Alexander, we have \ncleared that up in this bill.\n  The bill offers providers and patients better information about \ncompounded drugs, and it directs FDA to make a list of FDA-regulated \noutsourcer facilities that will be available on their Web site. It \nrequires detailed labeling of compounded drugs and prohibits false and \nmisleading advertising. Finally, it clarifies current Federal law \nregarding pharmacy compounding. It strikes the unconstitutional \nprovisions that were in current law which led to a lot of this mess. We \nhad different courts in different parts of the country interpreting it \ndifferently. So anyway, we resolve that patchwork and apply a uniform \nstandard nationwide.\n  Now, that is title I. Title II of the bill is the track and trace \nprovisions. Basically, this committee, again working in a bipartisan \nfashion a little over a year ago--as you may remember--brought an FDA \nuser bill to the floor, passed and signed by the President. That \ncleared up the upstream part of where drugs come from; in other words, \nfrom the initial--from the plant derivation to the distilling of a \nproduct to everything--all the way up to the manufacturing. So now we \nhave a much better regulation, a clearer picture of drugs that come \nfrom China and Indonesia and the U.S.--no matter where they come from, \nup to the manufacturing standpoint.\n\n  What we did not have at that time was a real understanding of or an \nagreement on how to control it from the manufacturer down to the \nconsumer. So our committee got involved. Again, Senator Alexander was \nhelping to lead the way with Senator Bennet and Senator Burr--almost 2 \nyears working on this issue. So now we have this system. I think this \nchart shows it. As I said, everything up to the manufacturer we took \ncare of in the FDA user bill.\n  Now this bill takes care of everything from the manufacturer down to \nthe dispenser; that is, down to the consumer. So no matter where the \ndrug goes, whether it goes directly from a manufacturer to a wholesaler \nto a dispenser, or whether it goes from here to a secondary wholesaler, \nanother secondary wholesaler, and another secondary wholesaler, we \nfound that in this country there is a patchwork, all kinds of different \nways for a drug to get from a manufacturer down to a consumer.\n  So Senator Burr, Senator Bennet, Senator Alexander, and our staffs \nworked together to get this picture put together and to have a track \nand trace so that we can track the drug. No matter how it goes, we can \ntrack it and we can trace it. That will come into being over 10 years \nwith electronic interoperable product tracing.\n  You might say that 10 years is a long time. I would point out that \nthe House had 27 years. They agreed with us and made it 10 years. But \nthat is for electronic interoperability. Beginning in January 2015, \nthey will have to start paper tracing. So there will be paperwork, but \nit will take 10 years to get it all at a unit-level and all electronic \nand interoperable. You can understand, it takes a long time; different \nmanufacturers and different suppliers have different systems. So these \nwill be worked in over that period of time.\n  But we will have tracing after January, 2015. It establishes \nnationwide drug serial numbers and requires a pathway to unit-level \ntracing, as I said. It strengthens licensure requirements for wholesale \ndistributors and third-party logistic providers. Again, there was a lot \nof hodgepodge of different kinds of licensures for wholesalers. We \nstrengthened that. Then, as I said, we have a nationwide serial number \nestablished for that. That will come 4 years after the date of \nenactment. That will serialize drugs in a consistent way across the \ncountry.\n  Again, this is a bill that many might say is long overdue. Better \nlate than never. I am sorry it took a terrible calamity such as the \noutbreak of meningitis to get us to really focus on this and move it. \nBut it did. I think this is a good example of where the Congress can \nwork in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion. I met Chairman Upton on the \nHouse side earlier this year to talk about a pathway of getting this \ndone. In fact, what we are working on here is the House bill. The House \npassed it by unanimous consent. If you have been reading much about the \nHouse, you know they do not do a lot by unanimous consent. That just \nshows you how much work went into the bill and how it was done in a \ntrue bipartisan, bicameral fashion. So the House passed it by unanimous \nconsent. Now we have it. I daresay, but for a Senator, one person, we \nprobably would have passed it by unanimous consent here.\n  I have not found anyone who is opposed to this bill and who does not \nrecognize that this is well supported. We\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\nhave a plethora of people and industry and consumer support: American \nPharmacists Association, American Public Health Association, \nBiotechnology Industry Organization, plus a lot of the big \npharmaceutical manufacturers and some of the small pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers. Everyone recognizes that we need a better system to \nclearly outline who the traditional compounders are and who the \noutsourcers are, to give the FDA clear-cut authority over one segment, \ngive the States the clear-cut authority over the other segment. As I \nsaid, if you do not fall into one of those two, you are outside the \nlaw. So it really does clear it up. This will ensure the quality and \nsafety of the drugs on which patients rely.\n  We have a cloture vote later today. I am hopeful we will have a good \nstrong vote on cloture on this bill. As I said, I honestly can say \nstanding here I have not heard one Senator from either side of the \naisle tell me or inform my staff that they were opposed to the bill as \nsuch.\n  I hope we have a strong vote. I am going to yield the floor and again \npay my compliments and my highest respect to Senator Alexander for his \nleadership. His State was hit very hard. I know he is very sensitive to \nthat. I know from my talks with him that it pained him a great deal to \nsee so much suffering and death in his own State. Senator Alexander got \non top of this and pulled us all together and basically said: We have \nto get it done.\n  So I thank Senator Alexander very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On behalf of the people of Tennessee, whom I \nrepresent, and the American people, as well, I wish to thank the \nSenator from Iowa for his leadership on these two bills, but \nparticularly on the compounding pharmacy bill.\n  Our differences of opinion in the Senate are well advertised on \nObamaCare, on debt, on Syria, and on a whole variety of matters. In \nfact, one would say the reason we exist is to debate the big issues \nthat haven't been resolved somewhere else.\n  There is another aspect of the Senate that is rarely well advertised, \nand that is when we get a result. Sometimes the results take a long \ntime, involve a lot of people, and are very difficult to reach, and \nthat is the case with this bill. Had not Senator Harkin been patient, \nas well as aggressive at the same time, in working with Republicans and \nDemocrats and with Members of the House, we would not have reached this \npoint today.\n  It is important to call the attention of the American people to this \nresult, these two pieces of legislation. One makes it clear who is in \ncharge, as Senator Harkin said, who is on the flagpole when it comes to \nmaking sure the sterile drugs that are injected into your back--because \na person has back pain--are safe so that they don't end up with a \nhorrible death from fungal meningitis. Who is responsible for \npreventing that?\n  The second bill is how are we going to make sure the 4 billion \nprescriptions we have every year in this country are safe, that they \nare not stolen, and that they do what they are supposed to do. How are \nwe to make sure we can track them all the way from the manufacturer to \nthe pharmacy who dispenses them?\n  We have been working on these bills for 2 years. Lest anyone think \nthat because it was a voice vote in the House and because we are close \nto unanimous consent in the Senate that it was easy to do, it is not \nthat easy to do. In fact, it is worth going through how this happened \nbefore I say just a word to add to what the Senator said about the \nimportance of bills.\n  The FDA became involved in the fungal meningitis issue in September \nof 2012, 1 year ago, after reports from Tennessee that fungal \nmeningitis was tied to a sterile compounded drug. This hits home to \nmany Americans because a great many Americans have been injected in \ntheir necks, their backs, or their feet with a drug that is supposed to \nbe sterile. If it is not, it could have terrible consequences.\n  Immediately, Senator Harkin called a hearing. November 15, 1 year \nago, we had our first hearing. Within 6 months we released draft \nlegislation to address the compounding pharmacy issue. We then had a \nhearing on that legislation. Then we passed the legislation after a lot \nof comment, all in the open. Everyone had a chance to weigh in. We \npassed it unanimously.\n  This committee on which we serve, Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, probably reflects the widest span of ideological differences \nwe have in the Senate. The Republicans can be very conservative and the \nDemocrats can be very progressive or very liberal, so one would think \nit would be hard to get a unanimous agreement, but we did.\n  The House went to work and came up with their own version of the \nbill, taking our work into account. We then worked with them through \nthe summer to reach an agreement on how to reconcile the two. The House \npassed it by a voice vote and sent it to us. Today we have a piece of \nlegislation that has been hot-lined. That means that both sides have \nsent it around to every single office. All but one Senator have agreed \nwe can pass it by unanimous consent. The Senator has that right, as I \nhave that right, the Senator from West Virginia, and the Senator from \nIowa has that right, and sometimes we exercise that right. Later this \nafternoon we will be having a cloture vote, a vote to move to this \nbill. That cloture vote is going to succeed. There will be a sufficient \nnumber of Republican votes and a sufficient number of Democratic votes \nto say we are ready to deal with this.\n  Why are we ready to deal with this? Because Commissioner Hamburg of \nthe Food and Drug Administration told us at our hearing what would \nhappen if we don't. She said:\n\n       We have a collective opportunity and responsibility to help \n     prevent further tragedies. If we fail to act, this type of \n     incident will happen again. It is a matter of when, not if, \n     I'm afraid. If we fail to act now, it will only be a matter \n     of time until we're all back in this room asking why more \n     people have died and what could have been done to prevent it.\n\n  No one is saying this legislation is going to guarantee that there \nwill never ever be a tragedy again, but it will help prevent future \ntragedies. It will take up the responsibility she challenged us to do. \nWe have spent 1 year on it, so many people have been involved, and it \nis time we move to do it. My hope is that after the cloture vote \ntonight, very soon thereafter, after everyone has had a chance to speak \nand say what they have to say, that we can pass this by unanimous \nconsent, send it to the President, and say to the American people that \nour differences are well advertised, but our results can be equally \nimportant. We can pass a piece of legislation which, when taken with \nthe track-and-trace legislation which accompanies it, affects the \nhealth and safety of every single American, period. I know the people \nof Tennessee would welcome a prompt solution to this, and this is what \nI hope we have.\n  Senator Harkin, as he often does, spoke in very personal terms about \nthis legislation. I want to tell one story from Tennessee so we know \nwhat we are talking about.\n  Diana Reed, 56, of Tennessee, had tried massage and acupuncture, but \nneither eased her neck pain. One of the potential causes for her pain \nwas an injury sustained while helping her husband, who has Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, in and out of the wheelchair. Diana Reed was healthy, either \nran or swam every day, in addition to becoming Wayne's arms, legs, and \nvoice, according to her brother, Bob.\n  She decided to try a series of epidural steroid injections for her \nneck problems before her health insurance ran out after losing her job \nat a nonprofit group. This decision ended her life on October 3 of last \nyear. She began receiving injections August 21, with a total of three \nscheduled, one every 2 weeks. She felt pain and nausea for a full day \nafter the first two injections. After the third she began having \nheadaches.\n  September 23, she finally agreed to go to a doctor and was quickly \ndiagnosed with meningitis. While she remained stable for a few days and \nwas mostly concerned about her husband's well-being--remember, he has \nLou Gehrig's disease--and getting home to him as soon as possible, she \ntook a turn for the worse. Her speech began to slur, she had trouble \nseeing, and eventually she had a stroke. One day later she was in a \ncoma.\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\n  One thousand people packed Otter Creek Church for her funeral, among \nthem the alumni of a childcare learning center for inner-city \npreschoolers that she and her husband had founded. The autopsy found \nfungal meningitis at the injection site and in Mrs. Reed's brain.\n  Mr. Reed has a rare form of ALS that worsens more slowly, and his \nmind has not been affected. Diana Reed would help him get in and out of \nbed, the shower, and his wheelchair. She became more instrumental in \nhis accounting business as his speech worsened. After her death, \nmembers of their church brought meals, did laundry, and the church \naccepted donations to hire help to assist Mr. Reed with his personal \ncare.\n  This is only one story of the tragedy that the Commissioner of the \nFDA says will happen again if we don't act. We believe this bill will \nhelp to prevent such a tragedy. Steroid injections last year were meant \nto ease the pain of hundreds of Americans, and for many Tennesseans, \ninstead, it became their worst nightmare. These vials of compounded \nmedicine were contaminated. Sixty-four Americans, including sixteen \nfrom my State, died from the outbreak. It is a horrible way to die.\n  When the HELP Committee held its first hearings on this tragic \noutbreak in November of last year, we looked at how could this possibly \nhappen. It became clear that these contaminated vials were produced in \na facility that was nothing like a traditional pharmacy, a corner \ndrugstore, if you will. It operated more like a manufacturer, but it \nwas unclear which regulator was in charge. Was the State in charge or \nwas the FDA in charge? I made it clear at the beginning of the hearing \nthat my priority was to find a way to clarify who is accountable for \nlarge-scale drug compounding facilities, who is on the flagpole for \noverseeing the safety of drugs made in these facilities.\n  I used the example of Hyman Rickover and the nuclear Navy in the \n1950s. Admiral Rickover was doing something new. He was doing something \ndangerous, potentially dangerous. He was putting reactors on submarines \nand ships, and no one knew quite how that was going to work.\n  What did he do about it? Admiral Rickover hired the captain. He \ninterviewed the captain and said: First, you are responsible for your \nship; and, second, you are responsible for the reactor. If there is \never a problem with the reactor, your career is over.\n  The U.S. Navy has never had a death on a nuclear ship as a result of \na reactor problem because everyone knew, after Admiral Rickover made \nthose decisions, who was on the flagpole.\n  There should be no confusion, after this bill is passed and signed by \nthe President, who is on the flagpole for a particular facility that \nmakes sterile drugs. We should be able to walk into any one of our \n60,000 drugstores, pharmacies, our doctors' offices, or pain clinics, \nand not have to worry about whether the medicines we get there are \nsafe. The bill we are voting on represents that year of work we talked \nabout to find a solution.\n  Today we have drug manufacturers on the one hand and traditional \npharmacies, the corner drugstore, on the other. This legislation \ncreates a new, voluntary third category which we call an outsourcing \nfacility. If a drugstore chooses to be in this category, they follow \none nationwide quality standard, and the FDA is responsible for all the \ndrugs made in that facility. FDA is on the flagpole.\n  What is the advantage of this? First, it eliminates the confusion, it \neliminates the finger pointing. If, Heaven forbid, this should happen \nagain, it will be clear whose fault it was, who didn't do their job of \nregulating.\n  Second, it provides an option available to doctors and hospitals who, \nif they wish, can choose to buy all their sterile drugs from a facility \nregulated by the FDA.\n  Outsourcing facilities are subject to regular FDA inspections. The \nNew England compounding center that caused these problems was not \ninspected by the State or the FDA from 2006 to 2011. Outsourcing \nfacilities must report the products made at the facility to the FDA. \nThe New England center that caused the problems was making copies of \ncommercially available drugs, which is illegal. Outsourcing facilities \nmust report to FDA when things go wrong with a product. Currently, \nlarge-scale compounders don't have any required reporting to FDA if \nthey know about a problem with a product.\n  Finally, outsourcing facilities, this new category, must clearly \nlabel their products so patients know it is compounded rather than FDA \napproved. Traditional pharmacy compounders will continue to be \nprimarily regulated by the States, but for outsourcing facilities, the \nFDA is in charge.\n  During our discussions we heard a lot about drug shortages. The \nSenator from Iowa and I worked especially to deal with that. We tried \nto address it where appropriate in this legislation. We know that \ncompounded products aren't the answer to drug shortages. We don't want \ncompounded products to be the backup solution to drug shortages; we \nwant a better answer than that. We recognized the problem and tried to \naddress it.\n  Because of heroic reactions of State officials with the Tennessee \nDepartment of Health, more people didn't become sick from the outbreak \nlast fall. I don't intend to sit through another hearing where FDA can \npoint the finger at someone else instead of taking responsibility or \nclaim it doesn't have enough authority, and if we pass this \nlegislation, FDA won't be able to.\n\n  This legislation also establishes clear rules for outsourcing \nfacilities and puts FDA on the flagpole for drugs made in those \nfacilities.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote this afternoon to move to the bill, \nand then shortly after that we will be able to move to approve it, as \nthe House did.\n  Just one other comment, Mr. President. The chairman, the Senator from \nIowa, and Senator Burr, Senator Bennett, and others have been working \nfor at least 2 years on this form of legislation we call track and \ntrace. It has been through vetting. I think everybody has had a chance \nto read it and to make a suggestion about it. There have been many \nchanges and adjustments to make sure it works.\n  Here is the problem. In the United States today, we have about 4 \nbillion prescriptions written every year. We don't have a uniform \nsystem to track and trace these drugs once they leave the manufacturer, \nwhich makes it easier for counterfeits and substandard products to \nenter the market and puts patients at risk. The laws governing the \ntracking of drugs haven't been updated since 1988. In the last 2 years \nalone there have been three cases of counterfeit Avastin--a cancer drug \nbeing distributed in the United States to physicians and patients--\nwhere the counterfeit did not contain any of the active ingredient.\n  We have seen an increase in drug theft. We have no way of knowing if \nand when these drugs are resold in the U.S. supply chain. In 2009 \ninsulin stolen from a truck much earlier was sold by pharmacies, and \nthe insulin was ineffective due to improper storage. Stealing drugs has \nturned into a big business, and without assurance that drugs are stored \nunder certain conditions and handled correctly throughout the supply \nchain, the drugs may not work.\n  This legislation would set up a system over time--10 years--where \nproducts that are stolen could be flagged as such, preventing \ndistribution to patients. It represents a consensus on establishing a \nnational system for all prescription drugs to have a specific serial \nnumber on the bottles. That means wholesalers, repackagers, and \npharmacies will be able to check the serial number on the bottle with \nthe manufacturer to see whether that number was assigned by the \nmanufacturer. The serial number will not only help prove it is not \ncounterfeit, but the information can also be used to determine whether \nanything else has been reported about that bottle, including whether \nthe product was stolen.\n  This won't happen overnight. Creating a system that traces 4 billion \nprescriptions, made by over 80 manufacturers on over 3,600 \nmanufacturing lines, that are dispensed to patients through a variety \nof ways will take some time. But the path laid out for us over a number \nof years will ensure that the U.S. drug supply chain is secure and that \nconsumers receive drugs that work.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Iowa, as I have already, for his \nleadership on these two extraordinary pieces of legislation; Senator \nBurr and Senator Bennet on the track-and-trace legislation; and Senator \nRoberts and\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\nSenator Franken worked hard on compounding legislation.\n  Let me end where I began. The FDA Commissioner challenged us. She \nsaid that if we don't act, this tragedy will happen again. We have an \nopportunity to act tonight. I hope we do. The families who were \ndevastated by this tragedy because of contaminated sterile injections \nthat caused fungal meningitis in many of our States, especially in \nTennessee, expect us to act. If we do, it will not be as well \nadvertised as the differences of opinion we can have in the Senate, but \nit will demonstrate how, when we work together over a period of a \ncouple of years, we can take a very big piece of complex legislation--\nin fact, two--that affects the health and safety of every American and \ncome to a consensus that takes a large step forward.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, back in 2005, before some of the current \nmembership of the Senate was even here, we had a very important \ndevelopment when it came to judicial nominations and the advice-and-\nconsent function of the Senate. Never, before the Presidency of George \nW. Bush, had nominees to the Federal court been filibustered; that is, \na 60-vote threshold been imposed as opposed to a 51-vote threshold, \nwhich is, of course, what the Constitution says--requiring a majority \nof the Senate. But there was an impasse. A number of judges at the \ncircuit court level and district court level were locked down in this \nimpasse. But, as so often happens around the Senate, a gang broke out. \nA gang was created. Seven Republicans and seven Democrats got together \nand helped us work through this impasse, and they did so by adopting a \nnew Senate precedent which says, in essence, there will be no \nfilibusters of Federal judges absent ``extraordinary circumstances.'' \nYes, you may say that is a broad standard, and it is somewhat \nsubjective, admittedly so, but the point was that the default position \nwould be that Federal judges would get up-or-down votes and there would \nnot be the resort to the 60-vote threshold absent extraordinary \ncircumstances. But the point is that has now become the precedent, \nbasically the rule by which the Senate operates when it comes to \nFederal judicial nominations, and it is a precedent that has been \nupheld and respected by both sides of the aisle ever since President \nObama took office.\n  This afternoon we will be voting on a second nominee to the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals, a court some have called the second most \nimportant court in the Nation because, situated as it is in the \nDistrict of Columbia, here in Washington, most of the judicial review \nof administrative decisions goes through this court at the appellate \nlevel, and because the Supreme Court only considers roughly 80 cases a \nyear, for all practical purposes the DC Circuit Court becomes the last \nword on judicial review on many important decisions, particularly those \ninvolving agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or \nmatters of national security or reviewing the regulations associated \nwith the financial services industry, such as Dodd-Frank and the like--\na pretty important court.\n  Well, unfortunately, the majority leader and the President have \ndetermined that they are going to try to jam through three new judges \non the DC Circuit Court of Appeals even though these judges are clearly \nnot needed and there is demand elsewhere around the country where the \nworkload is far heavier. But because of the special significance of the \nDC Circuit Court of Appeals, there is a conscious effort being made to \npack that court with three additional judges it does not need in order \nto change the current division--four to four--in a court where \nRepublican Presidents appointed four, Democratic Presidents appointed \nfour. So it is an evenly balanced court.\n  As I said, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals does not need any more \njudges. So why in the world, in a time when we are looking to make sure \nevery penny goes as far as it can and we are not spending money we do \nnot have, would you want to appoint three new judges to a court that \ndoes not need any new judges?\n  Well, here is the number: Since 2005 the total number of written \ndecisions per active judge actually has gone down. As of September 2012 \nboth the total number of appeals filed in the DC Circuit and the total \nnumber of appeals ended in the DC Circuit per active judge were 61 \npercent below the national average.\n  So you might ask yourself, if it carries a 61-percent reduced \ncaseload compared to the rest of the country, why don't we put the \njudges where President Obama can nominate them and the Senate can \nconfirm them in places where they are actually needed rather than this \ncourt?\n  Well, because of the reduced caseload and the lack of work for the \njudges to do on the DC Circuit, one DC Circuit judge recently told \nSenator Grassley, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n``If any more judges were added now, there wouldn't be enough work to \ngo around.'' Again, why in the world would President Obama insist and \nMajority Leader Reid insist on us confirming judges who are not needed \nwhen there is not enough work to go around if they were?\n  Well, my friends across the aisle continue to say that all they care \nabout is filling judicial vacancies, but the majority leader has made \nit clear that his real objective is to switch the majority when the \ncourt sits en banc. For example, ordinarily, circuit courts sit on a \nthree-judge panel, but in important decisions you may have the entire \ncourt sit en banc or all together. And the objective is clear that the \nmajority leader wants to stack it in favor of President Obama's \nnominees, to transform it into a rubberstamp for the President's big-\ngovernment, overregulatory agenda.\n  Indeed, despite all the victories the administration has won before \nthis court, it is apparently not good enough. This administration has \nwon several high-profile victories--in environmental cases, for \nexample--but they are still upset with the court because it actually \nruled against President Obama on cases related to corporate governance, \nemissions controls, recess appointments, and nuclear waste. So our \ncolleagues are not content to have a court that is balanced and decides \ncases on a case-by-case basis they want to stack the court in a way \nthat is a rubberstamp for the President's agenda.\n  But here are some examples of the cases the court has decided \nrecently. In 2011 the DC Circuit told the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to follow the law--believe that or not--to follow the law \nand conduct a proper cost-benefit analysis before adopting its \nregulations. That is what the law required. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission ignored the law, and the DC Circuit said ``follow the law'' \nand reversed the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  In 2012 the court rejected an Environmental Protection Agency rule \nthat went far beyond the limits of the Clean Air Act. These regulatory \nagencies have a lot of power and a lot of authority, but it all springs \nfrom a legislative enactment by Congress. That is the source of their \npower and their authority, and in this case it was the Clean Air Act. \nThe court said the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded the limits \nof its authority based on the law that Congress wrote and the President \nsigned into law.\n  Then, in 2013, President Obama violated the Constitution, the court \nsaid, by making recess appointments when the Senate was not actually in \nrecess. This is a very important power that goes back to President \nWashington that makes sure that when Congress is in recess there is \nstill a way for the President to fill vacancies. But that was in the \nold days when Congress would basically leave town for months at a time. \nIn this case, President Obama essentially decided he did not want to \nwait around for the advice-\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nand-consent function or the confirmation function that is given in the \nConstitution to the Senate, and he jammed these nominees through using \nwhat he called his ``recess appointment'' power.\n  Well, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals said: That is unconstitutional. \nMr. President, you cannot do that. The law does not allow it.\n  But that is another reason why, I suggest, the President is eager to \nstack this court with people he believes will be more ideologically \naligned with his big-government agenda.\n  Then there was one more decision this past August that I will \nmention. The court reminded the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of its \nlegal requirement to make a final decision on whether to use Yucca \nMountain as a nuclear waste repository. That sounds kind of arcane, but \nit is very important--certainly to the people of Nevada and to the U.S. \nnational security interests when you talk about a safe and secure \nlocation to put nuclear waste.\n  I would submit that all of these were commonsense rulings for which \nthere is a very sound and broad legal basis, and the court was doing \nwhat all courts are supposed to do; that is, uphold the law. \nApparently, the administration does not think this court should be in a \nposition to do that, and they do not think they should have to be in a \nposition to follow the law. They do not seem to care that the DC \nCircuit Court has ruled in favor of the administration on things such \nas stem cell research, health care, greenhouse gas regulation, and \nother hot-button issues. They do not seem to care that the court's \neight active judges are evenly split between Republican and Democratic \nappointees. In their view, by upholding the law the DC Circuit has been \ninsufficiently supportive of the Obama agenda, so now they are \nattempting to pack the court with three unneeded judges in order to \nstack it in the administration's favor.\n  I said last week that my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, has \noffered a commonsense alternative. It is a good compromise, and we have \ndone it before. It would actually reallocate two of these seats on the \nDC Circuit that are unneeded to other courts in the country where they \nare needed. What makes more sense than that? We have done that once \nbefore. We took one of these positions from the DC Circuit and \nreallocated it to the Ninth Circuit, where they needed judges before. \nWe ought to be putting the resources where they are actually needed, \nnot stacking them in a court where the resources are not needed in \norder to pursue an ideological end.\n  Unfortunately, our friends across the aisle--the majority leader and \nothers--have rejected the Grassley compromise and pushed ahead with \ntheir court-packing maneuver. Given their stated desire to make the DC \nCircuit a liberal rubberstamp, Democrats have created an extraordinary \ncircumstance that justifies the filibuster under the 2005 precedent \nbrought about by the Gang of 14 that I started off with. I wish we had \nresolved this sooner. I wish my friends across the aisle would give \nserious consideration to the Grassley proposal. But for now, I am \nafraid we have reached an impasse, and so we will be voting on this \nnomination this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PILLARD TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Cornelia T.L. Pillard, \nof the District of Columbia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  Mr. DURBIN. A few moments ago the Republican whip, Senator Cornyn of \nTexas, came to the floor to oppose the nomination of Nina Pillard to \nthe DC Circuit Court. Sadly, this did not come as a surprise. It is now \nclearly a political strategy on the other side to block President \nObama's nominees for this important court. There are three vacancies on \nthe DC Circuit. Most people view it as the second most important court \nin the land, next to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The court has eight active judges. It is authorized to have 11. When \nthere are vacancies in our Federal judiciary, the President has a duty \nto fill them. President George W. Bush made six nominations for the DC \nCircuit during his Presidency. Of those six nominees, four were \nconfirmed. President Obama, by contrast, has made five nominations for \nthe DC Circuit and so far only one has been confirmed, a well-qualified \ngentleman, Sri Srinivasan. Two of President Obama's nominees have been \nfilibustered by the Senate Republicans: Caitlin Halligan and Patricia \nMillett, two exceptionally well-qualified women.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made it clear they \nintend to filibuster two more equally well-qualified nominees: \nGeorgetown law professor Nina Pillard and DC District Court Judge \nRobert Wilkins.\n  This disparity is very obvious for anyone who cares to compare. \nPresident Bush: Six DC Circuit Court nominees; four of them confirmed. \nPresident Obama: Five DC Circuit Court nominees; four of them likely \nfilibustered by the Republicans.\n  This is a troubling contrast. There is no question President Obama's \nnominees have the qualifications and integrity to serve on this \nimportant court. There are absolutely no--underline no--extraordinary \ncircumstances that justify filibustering these nominees. Just a few \ndays ago when the Senate Republicans filibustered Patricia Millett, one \nof the most distinguished nominees to ever come before the Senate, they \nignored the obvious: She has argued 32 cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Is someone literally going to come and say, oh, but she is not \nqualified to serve in a Federal court.\n  Not only that, she had the overwhelming endorsement of Solicitors \nGeneral of both political parties. Clearly, she is well qualified and \nhas bipartisan support for the job. But it was not good enough for the \nother side of the aisle. They filibustered her, stopping her \nnomination.\n  For those who are new to the Senate, the filibuster is an old trick, \nan old procedural gambit. What happens is that well-qualified people, \nand many times substantive legislation, are held up indefinitely or \nstopped with the use of a filibuster. To do it to an amendment or a \nbill is bad enough, to do it to a human being is something we should \nthink long and hard about. Her nomination, the nomination of Patricia \nMillett, was supported by Democratic and Republican Solicitors General. \nThey characterized her as ``brilliant'' and ``unfailingly fair-\nminded.''\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\n  Ms. Millett deserved an up-or-down vote on the merits. I doubt there \nwould have been many, if any, on the other side of the aisle who would \nhave voted against her. There is no question she would have served with \ndistinction as a Federal judge. It is a shame she is being \nfilibustered.\n  Technically, her nomination is still hanging by a procedural thread, \nI guess, for the possibility of being reconsidered. But when we hear \nthe statement just recently made by the senior Senator from Texas, it \ngives us scant hope of her successful nomination being approved by the \nSenate.\n  Now we are considering another well-qualified nominee to the DC \nCircuit, Nina Pillard. Ms. Pillard is a distinguished law professor at \nGeorgetown. She is also one of the most talented appellate attorneys in \nAmerica. She has served with distinction in the Solicitor General's \noffice and in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. She has \nargued nine cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. She \nhas written briefs on many more, including U.S. v. Virginia, the \nlandmark equal protection case that opened the doors of the Virginia \nMilitary Institute to female students.\n  There is no question that Ms. Pillard has the intellect, experience, \nand integrity to be an excellent Federal court judge. She has received \nstrong letters of recommendation from Republicans and Democrats, from \nlaw enforcement and law professors.\n  It is no secret that she has written a number of academic articles in \nwhich she argued for gender equality, that men and women be treated \nfairly and the same under the law in America. Some find this radical \nthinking. Most Americans believe it should be the law of the land. But \nlaw professors are supposed to take part in debates and advance \nacademic discourse. That is their role. Also, issues of gender equality \nare important in America. Do we not want our daughters to have the same \nopportunities as our sons?\n  We should want to have our finest legal minds contribute to this \nconversation about gender equality. We should not penalize them for \ndoing so. Some have dismissed her nomination because she has spoken out \nabout equality when it comes to men and women in America. That is \nshameful.\n  Ms. Pillard also made clear at her nomination hearing she understands \nthe difference between being a professor and a judge. When Ms. Pillard \nhas stood in judgment of others, as she has done when she served on the \nABA reviewing committee for then-Judge Sam Alito in 2005, she has been \nfair and impartial. She probably does not share the views of Alito, but \nher committee give him a rating of unanimously ``well qualified.'' That \nrating helped send him off to the Supreme Court.\n  I think Viet Dinh, former Assistant Attorney General for the Office \nof Legal Policy under George W. Bush, helped clarify who Nina Pillard \nis with a letter he sent in support of her nomination. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       I know that Professor Pillard is exceptionally bright, a \n     patient and unbiased listener, and a lawyer of great judgment \n     and unquestioned integrity.\n\n  I would go on to say, I know Professor Dinh is a very conservative \nperson. Yet listen to how he concluded his endorsement of Nina Pillard:\n\n       She is a fair-minded thinker with enormous respect for the \n     law and for the limited, and essential role of the federal \n     appellate judge--qualities that make her well prepared to \n     take on the work of a D.C. Circuit judge. I am confident that \n     she would approach the judicial task of applying law to facts \n     in a fair and meticulous manner.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to give this well-qualified nominee the chance \nfor a vote on the merits before the Senate.\n  Some may argue there are three strikes against Professor Pillard for \nthis DC Circuit, and apparently there are.\n  First, she is an overwhelmingly well-qualified woman. Those \nnominations are not faring well with the other side of the aisle \nrecently.\n  Secondly, she has argued that men and women deserve equal and fair \ntreatment in America. That does not sit well with some on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  Third, this is a critically important court. There are some who are \ndetermined to maintain these vacancies even at the expense of \nexceptionally well-qualified nominees.\n  I know my Republican colleagues like to argue: We should not confirm \nnominees to the court because they just do not work hard enough over \nthere. But does anyone truly believe this caseload argument would stop \nthe Republicans if they were in the White House trying to fill the same \nvacancies?\n  We do not have to guess at the answer to that question, we know it. \nThe fact is, the DC Circuit's caseload is actually greater now than it \nwas when John Roberts was confirmed to be the ninth judge on that \ncircuit in 2003. Judge Roberts was confirmed by a voice vote. The \nargument about not enough work in the court did not seem to come up \nwhen it was a Republican nominee for a similar vacancy.\n  My Republican colleagues have been eager to confirm nominees for the \n9th, 10th, and 11th seats on the DC Circuit when a Republican President \nhas been making the nomination. But when it comes to President Obama's \nDC Circuit nominees, it looks as though we will see four times as many \nfilibusters as we do confirmations.\n  The bottom line is this: Under the law, there are supposed to be 11 \nactive judges on this circuit. Three vacancies exist. The President has \nthe responsibility to fill them. President Obama's nominees are well \nqualified. No one questions that. But they are being filibustered by \nSenate Republicans.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues change their minds about these \nfilibusters and agree to give these nominees an up-or-down vote. These \nnominees have done nothing to deserve the filibuster. They deserve to \nbe judged on the merits.\n  Let me close by saying that we have gone through this debate for a \nlong time on both sides, arguing that well-qualified nominees deserve \nan up-or-down vote. There have been times when some people have \nquestioned the whole process that would allow this basic unfairness for \nnominees to the bench that we are seeing happen with the DC Circuit. We \nhave gone from the brink of talking about changing the rules of the \nSenate, and usually at the very last moment we will step up and try to \nwork out our differences in a fair fashion between the two parties, \nagreeing that certain nominees will move forward and certain nominees \nwill not.\n  But I will tell you, as I have said to my friends on the other side \nof the aisle, there comes a tipping point. There reaches a point where \nwe cannot allow this type of fundamental unfairness and injustice to \noccur. It is not fair to those nominees who submit their names in good \nfaith, willing to serve on these important judicial assignments and to \ngive their best talents and to show their integrity in the process and \nthen to be given the back of the hand by a Republican filibuster on the \nfloor of the Senate. It reaches a point where we cannot continue to do \nthis.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle who have said we \nshould not change the rules of the Senate, it is time for them to show \ncommon sense and to show a basic sense of fairness when it comes to \nthose nominees. I hope that when this matter comes before the Senate, \nmy Republican friends across the aisle will relent, will not stop this \ngood nominee from her opportunity to serve.\n  I hope we can find her nomination and the others who are pending \nmoving forward in a way that is befitting of this great institution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are once again taking an unnecessary \ncloture vote on an unnecessary nomination to a court that needs no more \njudges. The only reason for either this nomination or this cloture vote \nis deliberately to provoke a confrontation that the majority hopes will \nbe to their partisan political benefit. Perhaps they want to use a fake \ncharge of obstruction to again push for rigging the confirmation \nprocess through the so-called nuclear option. Perhaps they want to give \ntheir allied grassroots groups something with which those groups can \nraise money. Or perhaps the majority wants to use this to distract from \ndisasters like the implementation of Obamacare.\n  One thing is for sure, this confrontation is not happening because \nRepublicans are genuinely obstructing needed nominations. President \nObama has appointed more than twice as many judges so far this year \nthan at the beginning of either President Bush's or\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\nPresident Clinton's second term. President Obama has already appointed \nnearly one-quarter of the entire Federal judiciary.\n  Whatever the reason, this stunt will only end up further politicizing \nthe confirmation process and undermining the independence of the \njudiciary. As I outlined in the National Law Journal over the weekend, \nit would be hard to make a clearer case that the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the DC Circuit needs no more judges. Since 2006, when Democrats \nsaid that this court needed no more judges, new appeals are down 27 \npercent, cases scheduled for argument are down 11 percent, and written \ndecisions per active judge are down 18 percent. The DC Circuit, as it \nhas for years, ranks last among all circuits in virtually every measure \nof caseload.\n  Consider just a brief comparison with the next busiest circuit. In \nthe Tenth Circuit, new appeals are 87 percent higher, terminated \nappeals are 131 percent higher, and written decisions per active judge \nare 150 percent higher.\n  In 2006, Democrats also opposed more DC Circuit appointments because \nmore pressing ``judicial emergency'' vacancies had not been filled. \nJudicial emergencies are up 90 percent since then, and the percentage \nof those vacancies with nominees is down from 60 percent to just 47 \npercent.\n  No matter how you slice it, dice it, or spin it, the DC Circuit has \nenough judges while other courts need more. Democrats have not yet said \nthat the standard they used in 2006 to oppose Republican appointees was \nwrong, nor have they explained why a different standard should be used \ntoday to push Democratic appointees.\n  The better course would be to stop these fake, partisan \nconfrontations and focus on nominees to courts that really need them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will conclude this debate with the \nfollowing points:\n  First, under the Democrats' standard from 2006, the DC Circuit needs \nno additional judges. This is why current judges have written things \nlike: ``If any more judges were confirmed now, there wouldn't be enough \nwork to go around.''\n  Second, the President has made clear on a host of issues, such as \ncap-and-trade fee increases, that he will simply go around Congress \nthrough administrative action rather than do the hard work of passing \nlegislation. That is why he wants to stack the deck on this court with \ncommitted ideologues, as Professor Pillard appears to be. It seems the \nPresident is confident Professor Pillard would be a reliable rubber \nstamp, considering she is outside the mainstream on a host of issues, \nincluding religious freedom, abortion, and abstinence-only education.\n  So I agree with those Democrats who said during the Bush \nadministration: ``The Senate should not be a rubber stamp to this \nPresident's effort to pack the court with those who would give him \nunfettered leeway.''\n  There is simply no justification for spending $1 million per year for \nthese lifetime appointments given the lack of workload under the \nDemocrats' standard from 2006.\n  Accordingly, I urge a ``no'' vote on the cloture motion.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, here we go again. For the third time this \nyear, we are debating whether to end a Republican filibuster and allow \na confirmation vote for a highly qualified woman to the DC Circuit. In \nMarch, it was Caitlin Halligan. Last month, it was Patricia Millet. \nToday, it is Nina Pillard. The qualifications of each of these nominees \nsurpass those of many other attorneys who have been confirmed to the \nFederal bench. These are three women who have earned their way to the \ntop of the legal profession. They are recognized by legal scholars, \npractitioners, and men and women alike as being at the top of the \nprofession. It appears Senate Republicans are going to continue to \nlaunch filibuster after filibuster at these stellar nominees.\n  Like Caitlin Halligan and Patricia Millett, I am confident Nina \nPillard would be confirmed if Republicans would stop filibustering and \nallow an up-or-down vote on her nomination. She would get well over the \nnumber needed. If Republicans vote in lockstep to continue their \nfilibuster against Nina Pillard, then Senate Republicans will have \nblocked three outstanding women in a row from being confirmed to what \nis considered the second highest court in our country.\n  Senate Republicans have an opportunity to make this right by voting \nto end the filibuster of Nina Pillard's nomination today, and by voting \non the nomination of Patricia Millett once the majority leader brings \nit again before the Senate as he said he intends to do. Confirming \nthese two highly qualified nominees is the right thing to do and it \nwill make history, once these two extraordinary women are confirmed, \nthe DC Circuit will be the first Federal appellate court in our country \nto have an equal number of women serving as judges as men.\n  Wouldn't that be nice? The DC Circuit would actually reflect the \nproportion of women in this country. It would be a nice move. Despite \nhaving filled nearly half of law school classrooms for the last 20 \nyears, women are grossly underrepresented on our Federal courts. What \nkind of message are Senate Republicans sending by refusing to even \nallow a vote on three of the most qualified female attorneys in this \ncountry?\n  When Senate Republicans talked about seating John Roberts on one of \nthese seats on the DC Circuit, every Republican and every Democrat \nsupported him. That was no problem for them. Of course, John Roberts \nwas nominated by a Republican President.\n  We now have women nominees who are equally well qualified, and they \nare filibustered. Of course, they were nominated by a Democratic \nPresident. I guess if you are a Republican and nominate a qualified \nman, this nominee can be confirmed easily. If you are a Democrat \nnominating an equally qualified woman, this nominee will be \nfilibustered. What does this say to people in law school? What does it \nsay to our country? What does it say about the impartiality of our \nFederal bench? We need women in our Federal courts. A vote to end this \nfilibuster is a vote in the historic direction of having our Federal \nappellate courts more accurately reflect the gender balance of our \ncountry.\n  Nina Pillard is a stellar nominee. She is an accomplished litigator \nwhose work includes 9 Supreme Court oral arguments and briefs in more \nthan 25 Supreme Court cases. She drafted the Federal Government's brief \nin United States v. Virginia, which after a 7-to-1 decision by the \nSupreme Court made history by opening the Virginia Military Institute's \ndoors to women students and expanded educational opportunity for women \nacross this country.\n  As a father who loves his daughter and his three granddaughters, I \nwant to see us start paying attention to the fact that we have both men \nand women in this country. After Nina Pillard's work in U.S. v. \nVirginia, hundreds of women have had the opportunity to attend VMI and \ngo on to serve our country. Josiah Bunting III, the superintendent of \nVMI when female cadets were first integrated into the corps, has since \ncalled VMI's transition to coeducation ``one of its finest hours.'' And \nit was. But it needed somebody like Nina Pillard to bring a case to the \nSupreme Court so they could have their finest hour.\n  Nina Pillard has not only stood up for equal opportunities for women \nbut for men as well. In Nevada v. Hibbs she successfully represented a \nmale employee of the State of Nevada who was fired when he tried to \ntake unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act to care for \nhis sick wife. In a 6-to-3 opinion authored by then-Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist, the Supreme Court ruled for her client, recognizing \nthat the law protects both men and women in their caregiving roles \nwithin the family.\n  Nina Pillard has also worked at the Department of Justice's Office of \nLegal Counsel, an office that advises on the most complex \nconstitutional issues facing the executive branch. Prior to that \nservice, she litigated civil rights cases at the NAACP Legal Defense &\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\nEducation Fund. At Georgetown Law School--a law school this chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee loves, having graduated from there--Nina \nPillard teaches advanced courses on constitutional law and civil \nprocedure, and co-directs the law school's very prestigious Supreme \nCourt Institute.\n  She has earned the American Bar Association's highest possible \nranking--Unanimously Well Qualified--to serve as a federal appellate \njudge on the DC Circuit. She also has significant bipartisan support. \nViet Dinh, the former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of \nLegal Policy under President George W. Bush, has written that:\n\n       Based on our long and varied professional experience \n     together, I know that Professor Pillard is exceptionally \n     bright, a patient and unbiased listener, and a lawyer of \n     great judgment and unquestioned integrity Nina . . . has \n     always been fair, reasonable, and sensible in her judgments . \n     . . She is a fair-minded thinker with enormous respect for \n     the law and for the limited, and essential, role of the \n     federal appellate judge--qualities that make her well \n     prepared to take on the work of a D.C. Federal Judge.\n\n  Former FBI Director and Chief Judge of the Western District of Texas, \nWilliam Sessions, has written that her ``rare combination of \nexperience, both defending and advising government officials, and \nrepresenting individuals seeking to vindicate their rights, would be \nespecially valuable in informing her responsibilities as a judge.''\n  Nina Pillard has also received letters of support from 30 former \nmembers of the U.S. armed forces, including 8 retired generals; 25 \nformer Federal prosecutors and other law enforcement officials; 40 \nSupreme Court practitioners, including Laurence Tribe, Carter Phillips, \nand Neal Katyal, among others.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a list of those letters of support \nfor Ms. Pillard printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Nina Pillard's nomination does not rise to the level of an \nextraordinary circumstance, which was what the Gang of 14 decided \nshould be the standard for filibustering nominees back in 2005. \nAccording to a Senate Republican who still serves today:\n\n       Ideological attacks are not an `extraordinary \n     circumstance.' To me, it would have to be a character \n     problem, an ethics problem, some allegation about the \n     qualifications of the person, not an ideological bent.\n\n  There is no reasonable interpretation of that definition in which one \ncould find an extraordinary circumstance with Nina Pillard. She has no \ncharacter problem, no ethics problem, and most importantly, she has \nextraordinary qualifications.\n  Rather than debate the merits of President Obama's well-qualified \nnominees to the DC Circuit--because it would be impossible to debate \nthem, as they are so well qualified--Senate Republicans have made clear \nthat partisanship is more important to them than the Federal judiciary, \nthe administration of justice, and the needs of the American people. \nWith the exception of Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, every \nsingle Republican Senator voted to filibuster Patricia Millett's \nnomination, arguing that we should not fill existing vacancies because \nsuddenly they are concerned about the need for these existing \njudgeships. We know this is just a pretext for two reasons. First, they \nhad no such concerns about the unique caseload of the DC Circuit when a \nRepublican was in the White House and nominated judges to the 9th, \n10th, and 11th seat. In fact, they filled the seat for this court that \nJohn Roberts was unanimously confirmed to when there was a lower \ncaseload. Now, when we have a superbly qualified woman, suddenly she \nhas to be filibustered.\n  And second, if Republicans actually cared about the cost of hampering \nour Government's functions they would not have shut down our Federal \nGovernment, which cost billions of dollars and set back our recovering \neconomy. Avoiding the needless shutdown of our Government would have \npaid for all these Federal courts for years. So do not stand up and say \nwe do not want these women on this court. Be honest about it. Do not \ngive me a lot of folderol about numbers and expenses and everything \nelse, because that is all it is: it is folderol.\n  In 2003, the Senate unanimously confirmed John Roberts by voice vote \nto be the ninth judge on the DC Circuit--at a time when its caseload \nwas lower than it is today--and, in fact, his confirmation marked the \nlowest caseload level per judge on the DC Circuit in 20 years. Not a \nsingle Senate Republican raised any concerns about whether the caseload \nwarranted his confirmation, and during the Bush administration, they \nvoted to fill four vacancies on the DC Circuit--giving the court a \ntotal of 11 judges in active service. Today there are only eight judges \non the court. What has changed? It is not the caseload--that has \nremained fairly constant over the past 10 years. In fact, the cases \npending per active judge are actually higher today than they were when \nPresident Bush's nominees were confirmed to the DC Circuit. The only \nthing that has changed is the party of the President nominating judges \nto the court.\n  We also should not be comparing the DC Circuit's caseload with the \ncaseload of other circuits, as Republicans have recently done. The DC \nCircuit is often understood to be the second most important court in \nthe land because of the complex administrative law cases that it \nhandles. The court reviews complicated decisions and rulemakings of \nmany Federal agencies, and in recent years has handled some of the most \nimportant terrorism and enemy combatant and detention cases since the \nattacks of September 11. So comparing the DC Circuit's caseload to \nother circuits is a false comparison, and those who are attempting to \nmake this comparison are not being fully forthcoming with the American \npublic.\n  The DC Circuit should be operating at full strength, as it was when \nPresident Bush left office. Republicans supported this for President \nBush but do not for President Obama. That is shameful. That is wrong. \nThere are currently three vacancies and President Obama has fulfilled \nhis constitutional role by nominating three eminently qualified \nnominees to fill these seats. Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and \nRobert Wilkins would fill the ninth, tenth, and eleventh seats on the \nDC Circuit. These are the same seats that were filled during President \nBush's tenure when the caseload was lower. Do not give me balderdash; \nlet us deal with reality. Let us judge each nominee based on his or her \nqualifications and not hide behind some pretextual argument that most \nAmericans can see through.\n  If the Republican caucus continues to abuse the filibuster rule and \nobstruct the President's fine nominees to the DC Circuit, then I \nbelieve this body will need to consider anew whether a rules change \nshould be in order. That is not a change that I want to see happen, but \nif Republican Senators are going to hold nominations hostage without \nconsideration of nominees' individual merit, drastic measures may be \nwarranted. I hope it does not come to that. I hope that the same \nSenators who stepped forward to broker compromise when Republicans shut \ndown the government will decide to put politics aside and vote on the \nmerits of these exceptional nominees. I also hope the same Senators who \nhave said judicial nominations ought not be filibustered barring \nextraordinary circumstances will stay true to their word. Let us not \nhave a double standard where one President is treated one way and \nanother is treated differently. For the sake of justice in this \ncountry, for the sake of the independence of our Federal judiciary, let \nus stop the filibuster and consider Nina Pillard's nomination based on \nher qualifications. Let us treat her with the decency that she \ndeserves. This Nation would be better off having her serve as a judge \non the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n  I have argued cases before courts of appeal. I know how important it \nis to the administration of justice. I know how important it is for \nlitigants who enter the courtroom not caring whether they are \nRepublican or Democrat, whether they are plaintiff or defendant, \nwhether the State or respondent. I know how important it is to have \nqualified judges. I call on the few Senators in this body who have \nargued cases before courts of appeals or before the U.S. Supreme Court \nto stop this game-playing with our Federal judiciary. Our independent \njudiciary is a model for the rest of the world. We must stop \npoliticizing it, and stop using feeble, wrong, and misleading excuses. \nLet us start doing what is right for the country for a change. Stop the \nbumper sticker slogans. Stop the rhetoric that interferes with reality. \nLet us start doing what is right.\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\n  Would this not be a refreshing change in this country? I saw a poll \nthis afternoon that showed the Congress at a 9 percent approval rating, \nand I would like to find out who those 9 percent are. Would it not be \nnice if the American people actually saw us doing what is best for \nAmerica, and stopped this pettifoggery? Let us do what is right for \nAmerica.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Letters Received in Support of Cornelia Pillard\n\n       June 4, 2013--William T.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof honoring our Nation's veterans for their service and sacrifice. I \nhope every American found a moment this weekend to reflect on what \nveterans have done for us and for our Nation as a whole.\n  We are now 238 years removed from our Nation's first war, the \nRevolutionary War. Brave Americans have fought to defend this Nation in \nwars large and small, from the World Wars to Vietnam to Iraq, and \neverything in between. Our Nation still has some 54,000 troops in \nAfghanistan, and we all pray for their safe return as we draw down our \nforces over the next year.\n  In each incarnation, brave men and women, often barely old enough to \nvote, went to war, and returned as veterans. A common thread that binds \neach generation served by our veterans is that solemn pledge so \nperfectly articulated by President Lincoln: ``Let us strive . . . to \ncare for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his \norphan.''\n  Living up to Lincoln's words has been the duty of every generation. \nOur veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the most recent to \nexperience the deep-seated physical, emotional, and mental wounds of \nwar.\n  In recognition, we cannot simply commemorate our veterans' service, \nbut must express our gratitude through action. Supporting and \nstrengthening our veterans' access to health care, education, job \ntraining, housing, and other services is every bit about keeping this \npromise.\n  Here in Congress, we hold in our hands the legislative powers to \nimprove the treatment, benefit, and assistance programs that already \nexist and the power to create new programs to meet the changing needs \nof our veterans and their families. We in Congress have a heightened \nobligation to service the needs of our veterans.\n  I am committed to that promise. We know that veterans face \nunnecessary delays in claims processing and reimbursement. I have \nworked hard to cut down on the backlog and encourage the VA to address \nthis impending problem.\n  In Chicago, the VA is rolling out a new electronic records system, \nand the backlog is dropping. As chairman of the Senate Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have also included increased funding to \nthe Department of Defense to ensure the speedy transfer of \nservicemember medical records, and I will continue to work with the \nchairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee to alleviate the claims \nprocessing backlog.\n  New medical challenges are also facing our veterans. In an age where \ndoctors are better able to save the soldier's life on the battlefield, \nmore soldiers are returning home with loss of limbs. To assist these \nveterans, I introduced legislation to make sure that the VA and our \ncolleges and universities work together to ensure the next generation \nof orthotic and prosthetics professionals will be there for these \nwounded warriors. I'm happy to say that Senate Veterans Affairs \nChairman Sanders is working with me on this, and we hope to get this \nprogram signed into law later this year.\n  I was also proud to lead the fight for what is now the VA's \ncaregivers program. It provides the families of severely disabled Iraq \nand Afghanistan war veterans with the support they deserve to care for \ntheir loved ones.\n  Treating and attending to a wounded veteran is an incredibly \ndemanding job--often best served by a family member--and the \ncaregiver's program ensures that these families have the training and \nfinancial support necessary to care for our wounded heroes.\n  I am proud to say there are now hundreds of veteran caregivers in \nIllinois and thousands nationwide taking part in this program--and \nloving it.\n  We have come a long way in supporting our veterans over the years and \nresponding to their changing needs, yet our work is far from done.\n  On Veterans Day in 1961, President Kennedy stood at Arlington \nNational Cemetery, in view of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. \nOn that day he said: ``In a world tormented by tension and the \npossibilities of conflict, we meet in a quiet commemoration of an \nhistoric day of peace. In an age that threatens the survival of \nfreedom, we join together to honor those who made our freedom \npossible.''\n  Today, some 52 years later, we too stand together to honor, to \ncommemorate, and to remember the proud ranks of veterans who have \ndefended America and her ideals in every corner of the globe. I am \nproud to stand for our Nation's veterans and their families every day, \nbut I am especially proud to celebrate them each year on Veterans Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/12/senate-section/article/S7950-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING GERARDO HERNANDEZ\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthe life of Gerardo Ismael Hernandez, a loving husband and father and \nrespected homeland security agent who was dedicated to protecting the \nsafety of the American people. Tragically, Agent Hernandez was struck \ndown by a gunman at Los Angeles International Airport on November 1, \n2013, becoming the first Transportation Security Administration officer \nkilled in the line of duty since the agency's creation. He was 39 years \nold.\n  A graduate of Los Angeles High School, Gerardo Hernandez was born in \nEl Salvador and came to Los Angeles with his family at age 15. The \nyoungest of four brothers, Gerardo worked hard to succeed and always \nwanted to give something back to his country. He went to work for TSA \nin June 2010 and became a behavior detection specialist at LAX. He was \ndevoted to his job, his country, and his beloved family.\n  Gerardo met his future wife, Ana Machuca, when he was 19 years old. \nMarried in 1998, the young couple settled in Porter Ranch, CA and were \nproud parents to a daughter and a son. His friends and colleagues \nremember him as a devoted husband and father and a wonderful friend \nwith a great sense of humor who frequently went out of his way to help \nothers.\n  Agent Gerardo Hernandez, like all those who serve in law enforcement \nand homeland security, put his life on the line to protect and serve \nhis community. His commitment to public safety and to the citizens he \nprotected will never be forgotten.\n  On behalf of the people of California, whom he served so well, I send \nmy gratitude and deep sympathy to his friends and family. We are \nforever indebted to Agent Hernandez for his courage, service, and \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/12/senate-section/article/S7950-4", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/12/senate-section/article/S7950-5", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7950-S7951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/12/senate-section/article/S7951-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n IRAN THAT WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12170 ON NOVEMBER 14, 1979--\n                                 PM 24\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin the 90-day period prior to the anniversary date of its \ndeclaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and \ntransmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to \ncontinue in effect beyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to increase \nconsumer choice and competition in the online video programming \ndistribution marketplace, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, two decades ago, Congress passed the \nCable Television and Consumer Protection Act of 1992 in part to stop \ncable companies from leveraging their market power to block competition \nfrom satellite television providers. Congress did so with the \nrealization that market forces alone did not act to create true \ncompetition in video services, mainly because the entrenched interests \nheld dominant control over the content necessary for new services to \ncompete effectively. As a result, regulation in the name of competition \nwas necessary to empower consumers and facilitate the development of \nnew innovative video services. Twenty years later, DirecTV and Dish \nNetwork have become the second and third largest pay TV providers in \nthe Nation, respectively.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, the Consumer Choice in \nOnline Video Act, builds upon the legacy, and the promise, of the 1992 \nCable Act. More needs to be done.\n  Simply put, the video marketplace today, even with a variety of cable \nand satellite television providers, still is one of ever-escalating \nrates and of limited choice in terms of programming packages. Consumers \nfind themselves paying more and more each year for their pay TV \nservice, and those yearly rate increases often far exceed inflation. \nEven though consumers have at their fingertips hundreds of channels of \nprogramming, most homes watch very few of those channels and would \nprefer to have more choice in what they pay for each month.\n  We have all heard the familiar complaint that we have five hundred \nchannels, but there is nothing to watch. My\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\nlegislation aims to enable the ultimate a la carte--to give consumers \nthe ability to watch the programming they want to watch, when they want \nto watch it, how they want to watch it, and pay only for what they \nactually watch.\n  Key to that goal is online video. The Internet has revolutionized \nmany aspects of American life, from the economy, to health care, to \neducation. It has proven to be a disruptive and transformative \ntechnology. It has forever changed the way Americans live their lives. \nConsumers now use the Internet, for example, to purchase airline \ntickets, to reserve rental cars and hotel rooms, to do their holiday \nshopping. The Internet gives them the ability to identify prices and \nchoices and offers an endless supply of competitive offerings that \nstrive to meet individual consumer's needs.\n  But that type of choice, with full transparency and real competition, \nhas not been fully realized in today's video marketplace. The core \npolicy question is how to nurture new technologies and services, and \nmake sure incumbents cannot simply perpetuate the status quo of ever-\nincreasing bills and limited choice through exercise of their market \npower.\n  Broadband-based online video today stands at a crossroads. It \npromises to become the video delivery platform that can truly bring \nconsumer-centric video services to the marketplace. Consumers clearly \nhave an appetite for online video and the choice and flexibility it \naffords, and innovative companies have risen to tap into that demand. \nBut their ability to fully compete and maximize the benefits of \nbroadband-based online video have been compromised.\n  Consumers do not really care whether they access their favorite video \nprogramming through a traditional cable line, fiber, satellite, or \nbroadband wireless technology. What they are most frustrated by today, \nthough, is that some cable or broadcast programming is sometimes not \naccessible in an ``over the top'' online format, or that their \nexperience with online video is somehow degraded. And disturbing \nreports suggest that one of the reasons that the consumers have these \nexperiences is due to anticompetitive activity on the part of incumbent \nmedia companies and broadband providers.\n  As both the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, and the \nDepartment of Justice have noted, the nature of broadband-delivered \nvideo makes it uniquely susceptible to anticompetitive activity. Online \nvideo distributors do not own their distribution platform, and their \nviability depends on the ability to acquire sought-after programming \nfrom content companies on competitive terms. Yet, given their \nrelationships with both content companies and Internet service \nproviders, traditional cable and satellite providers have the incentive \nand ability to try to limit the growth of innovative, competitive \nonline video distribution companies.\n  Press reports make clear that video marketplace incumbents are using \ntheir market positions to limit online video companies from entering \nthe market and competing on a level playing field. Incumbent media \ncompanies, who control both the delivery platform and the content \nnecessary for a robust online video service, are putting up barriers to \nprotect their current services from new competition. Other reports \nindicate that some pay-TV operators are offering incentives to media \ncompanies that agree to withhold content from Web-based entertainment \nservices.\n  My legislation would bar these and other anticompetitive practices in \nthe online video marketplace, while offering regulatory parity to \nonline video services that offer services similar to those presently \nprovided by cable and satellite companies. It also would remedy \nlingering issues surrounding the regulatory treatment of online video \nservices by the FCC. Finally, the bill would empower consumers with \nmore information about their broadband Internet service, and give the \nFCC the authority to oversee the use of metered broadband Internet \nbilling practices that could be used to stifle use of data-intensive \nonline video services.\n  I offer this legislation to begin an overdue conversation about the \nbest way that Congress can protect and promote a consumer-centric \nonline video marketplace. I recognize that this bill is not perfect. \nThat is why I invite discussion and comments from my colleagues and \nothers on ways to improve it as we move forward. While I am sure that \nwe can find ways to improve this legislation, we should not stand aside \nin the name of the free market while the innovation and choice that can \ncome from online video for West Virginia and around the country is \nstifled.\n  It is time for Congress to act to maximize the promise of today's \nonline world, and improve the consumer experience in the video \nmarketplace. Consumers must be able to benefit from online video's \npromise of decreased costs for video services, more choice over the \ntypes of programming that their families consume, and higher-quality \nvideo content that educates and entertains. I strongly believe that the \nbreathing room provided to online video distributors by my legislation \nis one of the keys to fostering a consumer-centric revolution in the \nvideo marketplace.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1680\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Online video distribution has the potential to increase \n     consumer choice in video programming, lower prices for video \n     services, bring innovative services to the video distribution \n     marketplace, and disrupt the traditional multichannel video \n     distribution marketplace.\n       (2) Evolving consumer demand, improving technology, and \n     increased choice of viewing devices can make online video \n     distributors stronger competitors to multichannel video \n     programming distributors for an increasing number of viewers.\n       (3) Unlike traditional multichannel video programming \n     distributors, online video distributors do not own \n     distribution facilities and are dependent upon Internet \n     service providers (many of which are affiliated with \n     multichannel video programming distributors) for the delivery \n     of their content to viewers.\n       (4) Internet service providers' management and pricing of \n     broadband services affects online video distributors. Because \n     online video distribution consumes significant amounts of \n     Internet bandwidth, Internet service providers' use of usage-\n     based billing practices can negatively impact the competitive \n     position of online video distributors and the appeal of their \n     services to consumers.\n       (5) Internet service providers that are affiliated with a \n     multichannel video programming distributor or an online video \n     distributor have an increased incentive to degrade the \n     delivery of, or block entirely, traffic from the websites of \n     other online video distributors, or speed up or favor access \n     to the content and aggregation websites of their affiliates, \n     because online video distributors pose a threat to those \n     affiliates' video programming distribution businesses.\n       (6) Similarly, multichannel video programming distributors \n     who are affiliated with Internet service providers, online \n     video distributors who are affiliated with Internet service \n     providers, or video programming vendors with significant \n     market power have the incentive and ability to use their \n     competitive position to engage in unfair methods of \n     competition meant to hinder competition from online video \n     distributors.\n       (7) Growth of online video distribution alternatives also \n     will depend, in part, on the distributor's ability to acquire \n     programming from content producers. Without access to content \n     on competitive terms, an online\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\n     video distributor suffers a distinct competitive harm.\n       (8) Some traditional multichannel video programming \n     distributors have admitted to taking steps to limit the \n     ability of online video distributors to access content or \n     otherwise effectively compete in the video distribution \n     marketplace.\n       (9) Traditional multichannel video programming distributors \n     and even other online video distributors have the incentive \n     and ability to convince their video programming vendor \n     partners not to sell content to online video distributors or \n     to sell content to them at competitively-disadvantageous \n     prices, terms, and conditions. They also have the incentive \n     and ability to retaliate against a video programming vendor \n     that sells content to an online video distributor.\n       (10) Traditional multichannel video programming \n     distributors have the incentive and ability to use their \n     relationships with manufacturers of television sets, set-top \n     boxes, and other customer premises equipment to favor their \n     own services over offerings from online video distributors.\n       (11) There is a substantial governmental and First \n     Amendment interest in--\n       (A) requiring Internet service providers to provide \n     consumers with accurate information about their Internet \n     service, and to ensure that data usage monitoring systems are \n     accurate, effective, and not used for an anticompetitive \n     purpose;\n       (B) promoting a diversity of views provided through \n     multiple technology media;\n       (C) promoting the development of online video distribution \n     platforms and fair competition amongst all distributors and \n     vendors of video programming;\n       (D) preventing Internet service providers that are \n     affiliated with a multichannel video programming distributor \n     or an online video distributor from discriminating against \n     unaffiliated content and distributors in its exercise of \n     control over consumers' broadband connections;\n       (E) encouraging and protecting consumer choice and \n     innovation in online video distribution, including with \n     respect to distribution of broadcast television content; and\n       (F) providing consumers with the ability to choose to \n     receive local broadcast television content from various \n     markets.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) consumers should be fully informed about the terms and \n     conditions related to the purchase of Internet service from \n     an Internet service provider;\n       (2) usage-based billing systems used by an Internet service \n     provider should not be used in a way that harms development \n     and use of high-bandwidth consuming Internet applications and \n     services that might compete with that Internet service \n     provider's own services;\n       (3) the availability of a diversity of views and \n     information should be promoted to the public through various \n     video programming distribution platforms, including those \n     providing service by utilizing the Internet or other IP-based \n     transmission paths;\n       (4) existing multichannel video programming distributors \n     and video programming vendors should not have or exercise \n     undue market power with respect to online video distributors; \n     and\n       (5) Internet service providers should not hinder through \n     anticompetitive behavior the ability of online video \n     distributors to provide services to their subscribers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide \nenhanced penalties for marketing controlled substances to minors; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce, along \nwith Senator Grassley, the Saving Kids From Dangerous Drugs Act of \n2013.\n  For years, law enforcement has seen drug dealers flavor and market \ntheir illegal drugs to entice minors, using techniques like combining \ndrugs with chocolate and fruit flavors, and even packaging them to look \nlike actual candy and soda. This bill would address this serious and \ndangerous problem by providing stronger penalties when drug dealers \nalter controlled substances by combining them with beverages or candy \nproducts, marketing or packaging them to resemble legitimate products, \nor flavoring or coloring them, all with the intent to sell the drugs to \nminors.\n  Recent media reports demonstrate the need for this legislation. In \nJanuary of this year, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized THC-\nladen soft drinks, cookies, brownies, and candy from two phony medical \nmarijuana dispensaries in my home state of California that grossed an \nestimated $3.5 million annually. The names of the products seized show \nhow the purveyors of these drugs marketed them under names that \nresembled popular soda and candy products: bottles were labeled ``7 \nHigh,'' ``Dr. Feelgood,'' and ``Laughing Lemonade''; cookies and \nbrownies had such names as ``White Chip Hash Brownie'' and ``Reese's \nCrumbled Hash Brownie''; and candy was named ``Jolly Stones THC \nMedicated Hard Candies'' and ``Stone Candy.''\n  Less than two weeks ago, police seized more than 40 pounds of THC-\nlaced candy from a campus apartment at West Chester University, outside \nof Philadelphia. This candy was vividly colored, in a virtual rainbow \nassortment--pink, yellow, orange, blue, and red. When college students \nare peddling these drugs, it is not hard to see how minors can become \ntargets of the operation.\n  Many recent incidents involve methamphetamine, a drug whose users \nface a ``very high'' risk of ``developing psychotic symptoms--\nhallucinations and delusions,'' according to a recent Harvard Medical \nSchool publication. A 2007 article in USA Today entitled ``DEA: \nFlavored meth use on the rise'' stated that ``[r]eports of candy-\nflavored methamphetamine are emerging around the nation, stirring \nconcern among police and abuse prevention experts that drug dealers are \nmarketing the drug to younger people.'' In March of last year, police \nin Chicago warned parents about a drug that ``looks and smells like \ncandy,'' called ``strawberry quick'' or ``strawberry meth.'' Because of \nthe drug's similarity to candy, police urged parents to tell their \nchildren not to take candy from anyone, not even a classmate.\n  Regrettably, this is a problem that has persisted for many years, \nwith drug dealers trying various methods to lure kids to try many \ndangerous drugs. The dealers' logic is simple: the best way to create a \nlife-long customer is to hook that person when he or she is young. \nAccording to an Indiana sheriff quoted in a 2007 article entitled \n``Fruity meth aimed at kids,'' flavoring a drug like methamphetamine \nmakes it ``more attractive to teens, because it takes away meth's \nnormally bitter taste, and some dealers will tell potential users this \nmeth is safer, and has less side effects.''\n  That is why the practice of flavoring or coloring drugs to entice \nyouth is so dangerous--it deceives the young customer into believing \nthat he or she is not actually ingesting drugs, or at least not \ningesting drugs that are as potent as non-flavored drugs. One in three \nteens already believes there is ``only a slight or no risk in trying \n[methamphetamine],'' according to the 2007 National Meth Use & \nAttitudes Survey. When you flavor methamphetamine or market it as candy \nor soda, the number of teens who believe that the drug is not harmful \nis surely higher.\n  The size and sophistication of some of these operations is \nparticularly alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale \nmarijuana cultivation and production facilities in Emeryville and \nOakland, California. Thousands of marijuana plants, and hundreds of \nmarijuana-related soda, candy, and other products were seized from the \ndrug dealers' facilities. The products were designed and packaged to \nlook like legitimate products, including an item called ``Munchy Way'' \ncandy bars.\n  Similarly, in March of 2008, Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, \nagents seized cocaine near Modesto, California, that was valued at \n$272,400; a significant quantity had been flavored like cinnamon, \ncoconut, lemon, or strawberry. After that raid, one DEA agent stated \nthat ``[a]ttempting to lure new, younger customers to a dangerous drug \nby adding candy `flavors' is an unconscionable marketing technique.''\n  I completely agree. That is why we need to act now to stop those who \nalter drugs to make them more appealing to youth.\n  Under current federal law, there is no enhanced penalty for a person \nwho alters a controlled substance to make the drug more appealing to \nyouth. Someone who alters a controlled substance in ways prohibited by \nthe legislation we are introducing today would be subject to an \nadditional penalty of up to ten years, in addition to the penalty for \nthe underlying offense. If someone is convicted of a second offense \nthat is prohibited by the act, that person would face an additional \npenalty of up to 20 years.\n  This bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you \nflavor or candy up your drugs to try to entice our children, there will \nbe a very heavy price to pay. It will help stop drug dealers from \nengaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if they \ndon't.\n  The Senate passed a similar version of this legislation in the 111th \nCongress, but it was not considered in the House. This year, I am \npleased to have the support of many of the leading national law \nenforcement organizations as we try to get this bill over the finish \nline: the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Major County \nSheriffs' Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the National HIDTA Directors Association,\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\nand the National District Attorneys Association have endorsed the \nlegislation.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of Calendar Nos. 239 and 240, which are post \noffice naming bills en bloc.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills \nen bloc.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I speak today in strong support of \nS.1512, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 1335 Jefferson Road in Rochester, NY, as the \n``Specialist Theodore Matthew Glende Post Office.''\n  Specialist Glende's story reminds us that no gesture of thanks can \nadequately reflect the sacrifices made by our troops each and every \nday. I would like to tell you about one amazing New Yorker. Specialist \nGlende grew up on Park Avenue in Rochester, NY, graduated from McQuaid \nJesuit High School in Brighton, and enrolled in ROTC as soon as he \nentered Niagara University. Three years into his college career and \nROTC training, he learned that upon graduation his rank would be a \nLieutenant in the Reserves. But his desire to serve on active duty in \nthe Infantry was such that he left school a year early and enlisted in \nthe Army, determined to work his way up. He served in a unit stationed \nin Italy, and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2012.\n  In late July of last year, Specialist Glende and his unit came under \nattack by enemy forces. Some soldiers were wounded, and while the \nattack continued to rage around him, Specialist Glende went above and \nbeyond the call of duty to help rescue these wounded soldiers and get \nthem to safety. Tragically, he sacrificed his life in the process. \nSpecialist Glende's family was told that he saved five soldiers from \ndeath before he was killed.\n  The Federal Government should go to any length to salute heroes like \nSpecialist Glende for their courage under fire. Specialist Glende gave \nhis life for our great Nation, and we are now working to ensure that \nhis memory serves as an example of impeccable character and exceptional \npatriotism.\n  He was steadfastly loyal and dedicated to his family, his young wife, \nand his country. I am humbled to be honoring his memory and paying \ntribute to his brave and heroic sacrifice with\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\nthis legislation to dedicate the Rochester Main Post Office at 1335 \nJefferson Road as the Specialist Theodore Matthew Glende Post Office.\n  Growing up on Park Avenue in Rochester and attending McQuaid Jesuit \nHigh School in Brighton, he was known as ``Matt'' to his family and \nfriends. Later, when he met his future wife Alexandra while working \nalongside her at the Pittsford Wegmans grocery store, she would call \nhim ``Theo.'' But with the dedication of this Post Office, he will be \nremembered by his thankful hometown community once and for ever as \n``Specialist Glende.''\n  Ms. WARREN.
