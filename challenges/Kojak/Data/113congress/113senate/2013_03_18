Madam President, I want to advise everyone as to what is \nhappening with our effort to keep the government running. On Thursday \nwe recessed for the weekend so negotiators could attempt to reach an \nagreement on a finite list of amendments to consider today. The bill \nmanagers, Senators Shelby and Mikulski, have worked very hard, and they \nhave made progress over the weekend. They have condensed the number of \namendments that are being seriously talked about. I commend them and \ntheir staff for all their efforts. I have spoken to both of them this \nmorning; they have not yet reached an agreement. I think they are \ngetting close--or at least I hope that is the case. Just before coming \nin here, I spoke to one of the staff members, and he is reaching out to \nSenator Shelby's staff before presenting it to the two Senators for \ntheir approval.\n  Frankly, I had trouble getting both sides to agree on a finite list \nof amendments. There were a lot of amendments that people wanted, but \nhe objected to this and she objected to that. There is still hope that \nwe can have a limited number of amendments and vote on those so we can \nmove to final passage of the bill. One way or another, we have to move \nforward on this bill.\n  On Wednesday I filed a motion to invoke cloture on the pending \nsubstitute amendment and the underlying bill. On Thursday we postponed \nthat cloture vote, anticipating that an agreement would be reached and \nthat we could consider amendments today. Absent an agreement, we will \nvote on a cloture petition tonight. It is in the interest of all \nSenators that we move forward with this important legislation. The \nHouse is waiting on our action. There is a great deal of work to do on \neither side of the aisle before March 27 kicks in.\n  Also, the more time we spend on this continuing resolution, the less \ntime we will have to vote on amendments to\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\nthe budget resolution. As a reminder, the budget resolution cannot be \nfilibustered, but there is 50 hours of debate allowed. We must reserve \ntime this week to consider a number of amendments on the budget. After \nall 50 hours expires, there will be unlimited amendments. So this is \ngoing to be a very full week. Senators should expect to work into the \nnight as well as some late votes.\n  We will stay as long as it takes to complete work on both the \ncontinuing resolution and the budget resolution even if that means \nworking on the weekend and into the Easter and Passover recess. I \nunderstand that Passover is on Monday, so if we don't finish over the \nweekend, we would have to come back after Passover, which would be \nterribly unfortunate, but we need some cooperation from Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. I am hopeful and confident we can get there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1874-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

I need to repeat my request, Madam President, just in \ncase. I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending amendment \nand call up amendment No. 43.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to talk about this amendment. I \nhope there is still a way I might be able to offer it. If I am not able \nto offer it as an amendment to this bill, I intend to offer it as a \nbill to become part of the ongoing laws that govern these kinds of \nactivities. I would also say--and I have said to many people--I have \ngreat expectations for the chairman of our committee, Chairman \nMikulski. I understand she is trying to work out how to make the work \nof the Senate happen, and I think she is going to be vigilant and \ndetermined in leading us back toward the normal appropriations process. \nI am proud to be a member of her committee, and I do believe she and \nSenator Shelby, the ranking Republican, are going to be insisting the \nSenate get back to the way it should do business. I look forward to \nworking with her to solve the problems we are solving this week and the \nproblems we need to solve before October 1, when the new fiscal year \nbegins.\n  Let me say a few words about this moment we find ourselves in, and \nthat there is no question that government spending is out of control. \nWe have increased spending 19 percent since 2008. The Federal debt has \nskyrocketed to almost $17 trillion now. In 1981, when Ronald Reagan was \nsworn in as President, as part of his inaugural address we were \napproaching the first $1 trillion in debt in the history of the \ncountry. The illustration he gave in that speech was: If you had a \nstack of thousand-dollar bills 4 inches high, you would be a \nmillionaire, but the stack to have $1 trillion would have to be \nstacked--those dollar bills--67 miles high. Now we are 67 miles high \nwith thousand-dollar bills, not of dollar bills, and if every 4 inches \nof that were $1 million, we are 67 miles high times almost 17. And that \nis unacceptable.\n  The President's own budget office has made more than 200 \nrecommendations of ways we could find savings through making government \nmore efficient. More importantly, the Government Accountability Office \nhas identified 51 areas where programs are inefficient, ineffective, \nand overlapping, leading to billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer \nmoney. There is simply no reason the government should stop providing \nessential services--which is what I want to talk about--because we are \ncutting 2\\1/2\\ percent of the budget through these line-by-line cuts \nthat, by the way, wouldn't happen if we would budget at or below the \nnumber the law now says is the maximum dollar we can spend in any \nyear--this year or for the next 9 years. This doesn't have to happen at \nall. But if it does happen, there is no reason we should have to be \ncurtailing essential services.\n  The Budget Control Act didn't fail to adequately plan for how to \nprotect these essential services. On other days, when the government is \nnot functioning at a full level, there have been many ways found to see \nthose employees got to work. In fact, according to several letters from \nthe Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies have actually \nbeen instructed not to plan for sequestration. A few days ago, I was on \nthe floor with a letter from the Office of Management and Budget from \nSeptember 28 of last year, 2 days before the new spending year starts, \nand the letter said: Spend your money as though the law will not be \nobeyed. Spend your money as though the sequestration law will never go \ninto effect. Spend your money as though the Budget Control Act will be \nchanged.\n  Of course, now we are halfway into the fiscal year and everybody has \nbeen spending as though the law isn't the law and suddenly we have \nthese problems that are much bigger than they would have been if we had \ndealt with them over 12 months, but now we are trying to deal with them \nover a handful of months. Furlough notices are being made in a sweeping \nfashion. They are threatening day-to-day services that protect life and \nsafety.\n  Every service the Federal Government provides doesn't affect life and \nsafety. I am not saying every Federal job is subject to this amendment \nor every Federal job is critical for everything that happens every day. \nI recently sent the Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary Vilsack, a \nletter urging him to use his authority to minimize the impact of \nsequestration as it relates to food safety and inspection services, the \nso-called FSIS. The letter came out right after the USDA said they \nwould be laying off people for as many as 15 days in the last 4 months \nor so of the spending year--the 4 months that would end at the end of \nSeptember. It is estimated these food inspector furloughs would lead to \nthe closure of nearly 6,300 facilities across America for the day the \nfood inspectors don't show up.\n\n  If you happen to work somewhere for the FDA, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, supervisor, they can show up whenever they want to, and \nthey do that periodically. They can do that as a surprise visit. They \ncan do lots of things. But in the facilities that are supervised by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, that inspector has to be there every \nday and every minute of every day for those workers in Missouri or \nWisconsin or Maryland or anywhere to work.\n  I have been to a lot of these meat, poultry, and egg facilities, \nbecause we\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\nhave 146 of them in our State. These are hard jobs. These people are \nnot showing up to work every day because they like to have somewhere to \ngo. The fact is hundreds of workers, in fact, thousands of workers, \ncould not show up for work on a given day and because the USDA \ninspector doesn't show up, they don't get paid for that day, and their \nfamilies will suffer needlessly because we couldn't figure out how to \nprioritize what was necessary for those people to go to work. That is \nunacceptable to me.\n  As a result of these furloughs, the estimate is that nearly 500,000 \nworkers will lose $400 million in wages over the course of this month. \nWhen that inspector doesn't show up, or the two inspectors don't show \nup at that plant that day, none of the many people who work there--and \nthere might be a thousand people working at that plant that day--can \nwork, none of them get paid, none of them produce the food that a few \nmonths later or a few weeks later or a few days later won't show up on \nthe grocery store shelves in the country. And that is a problem too, \nbut the problem I am concerned about is the working families who are \naffected here as well as the working families who later will see their \nmeat, poultry, and egg prices go up because the supply is that much \nless than it otherwise would have been.\n  In his response to my letter, Secretary Vilsack claimed that ``When \nCongress drafted the Budget Control Act of 2011 directing Federal \nagencies to reduce their spending at specified levels, it included no \nexemption for essential employees such as FSIS inspectors.'' So today I \nwish to introduce the amendment the chairman has objected to--and I \nwill introduce in the next few days a piece of legislation exactly like \nthe amendment--and will continue to look for ways to add this amendment \nto this legislation.\n  What this amendment would do is give the administration the \nflexibility it claims it doesn't have. In doing so, this amendment will \nensure essential Federal employees continue to provide vital services, \nsuch as meat inspectors, control tower operators, and border security \nguards. And here is how we would do it. In April of 2011, the Office of \nPersonnel Management sent a detailed memo--this is President Obama's \nOffice of Personnel Management--to each Federal agency outlining which \nFederal employees would be exempted from furlough during a potential \ngovernment shutdown. It is my belief that the administration may still \nhave this ability. But if they do not have it, I want to give it to \nthem and I want to give it to them exactly as they themselves said it \nshould be applied in April of 2011: Those employees are considered \nessential ``to ensure the safety of life and protection of property,'' \nbased on language contained in this act.\n  My amendment would apply identical language used during government \nshutdown scenarios to the sequester. It defines an essential employee \nas an employee that performs work involving the safety of human life \nand the protection of property as determined by the head of the agency. \nThis is the same language not only used in April of 2011 but used in \nguidance from the Clinton administration in preparation for the 1995 \ngovernment shutdown, the last time when the government really did shut \ndown.\n  These people showed up. These people were told to report to work. And \nif it was good enough for President Clinton to tell them to report to \nwork, if it was good enough for President Obama in April of 2011 to \ntell them to report to work, it should be good enough now for the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Transportation and the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, and anyone else where these people are \nbeing furloughed to do so.\n  This provision provides agencies with funding flexibility so that \nessential services are maintained, while nonessential employees are \nfurloughed. I think we could do this--and with the chairman's help, we \nwill do this--in the committee, I would hope, without having furloughs \nnecessary in the future. But this amendment would solve the problem of \nessential employees that both President Clinton and President Obama \nthought was important to deal with the last two times a similar topic \ncame up.\n  I would also like to mention the second amendment, which I am not \noffering, so it doesn't need to be objected to. Senator Pryor and I \nhave an amendment that may approach this in a different way--at least \nfrom the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug \nAdministration Subcommittee. He is the chairman and I am the ranking \nmember of that appropriations subcommittee, and I hope we can find a \nsolution here.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate on the continuing resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss the \ncontinuing resolution we will vote on perhaps today or tomorrow.\n  This bill is much more than a continuing resolution and includes five \nseparate appropriations bills. Our country now faces a $16.6 trillion \ndebt, which is more than $52,000 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica. It is time for Congress to go back to the business of voting \non and passing annual budget resolutions, authorization bills, and \nappropriations bills, instead of a huge Omnibus appropriations bill \nsuch as the one before us today.\n  This continuing resolution includes numerous examples of egregious \nporkbarrel projects as well as billions in spending that was never \nauthorized by the appropriate committee and not requested by the \nadministration. The American taxpayer expects more and deserves more \nthan what we are giving them in this bill.\n  One unfortunate example of Congress overstepping in this CR is the \nongoing inclusion of an appropriations rider that prohibits the Postal \nService from moving to 5-day mail delivery. This congressional mandate \nwas put in place in 1984, and it is a roadblock, keeping the Postal \nService from transforming the way it delivers mail while still being \nable to provide universal service. The Postal Service lost $1.3 billion \nin the first quarter of this year and recorded a loss of $15.9 billion \nin fiscal year 2012. So what are we telling them to do? Business as \nusual.\n  With the reality that the Postal Service will continue with \ndevastating and unsustainable losses, the Postmaster General announced \nlast month that the Postal Service would move to 5-day mail delivery \nlater this year, which he estimates will save $2 billion annually. \nHowever, some in Congress who have decided they know better than the \nleadership of the Postal Service are moving to prohibit the Postal \nService from modernizing and transforming the way it does business.\n  Congress must accept the fact that the Postal Service's current way \nof doing business is no longer viable. We now correspond by e-mail. We \nnow correspond by different methods. It was terrible when the bridle-\nand-saddle business went out on the advent of the automobile. Things \nand times have changed. A huge percentage of the mail delivered today \nis what we call junk mail advertising. It is no longer the primary way \nAmericans--and people in the world, for that matter--communicate. The \nAmerican public conducts business in a different way than even 5 years \nago. We have to allow the Postal Service to adapt to changing times in \norder to have a Postal Service in the future, and this includes 5-day \nmail delivery.\n  The Postal Service loses $1.3 billion in the first quarter, $15.9 \nbillion last year, and do we come up with a fix for it? Do we address \nthe issue? Of course not. There is nothing in this bill that would \nchange that debt. There is nothing in this legislation that fixes the \nbroken Postal Service. But there is a prohibition from them going to 5-\nday mail delivery which would save $2 billion. Now, you still have \nabout $13.9 billion left over, if it is like last year.\n  So here we are telling the Postal Service they can't go to 5-day \ndelivery, but we have no fix for this problem.\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\nAnd who picks up the tab? Obviously, eventually it is the American \ntaxpayer. No wonder they view us with certain disdain.\n  In addition to this rider, the bill includes porkbarrel spending for \nthings such as--and I am not making them up. Here we are with this debt \nof $16.6 trillion, and we are going to spend $65 million for the \nPacific Coast salmon restoration for States, including the State of \nNevada. I am not making that up, $65 million for the Pacific Coast \nsalmon restoration, including in Nevada--a program that even President \nObama mocked in his 2011 State of the Union Address; $14.7 million for \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture Watershed Rehabilitation Program, \nwhich the administration has suggested eliminating for years--$993,000 \nin grants to dig private wells for private property owners; $10 billion \nfor the U.S. Department of Agriculture's high energy cost grants \nprograms that go to subsidize electricity bills in two States: Alaska \nand Hawaii; $5.9 million for the USDA's economic impact initiative \ngrants.\n\n  The economic impact initiative grants have become slush funds for \nlocal governments to do such things as rehab an exercise room, renovate \na museum on the Pacific Island of Palau, and buy kitchen equipment for \ncity government offices.\n  Now I would like to talk a bit about defense spending. This is \nprobably the most painful part of my comments, and I will explain why \nlater on.\n  Defense spending includes over $6 billion in unrequested or \nunauthorized funding for programs for the Department of Defense. At a \ntime when the Department of Defense is facing the impact of \nsequestration, on top of the $487 billion in cuts directed by the \nPresident, we can't afford to spend a single taxpayer dollar on \nprograms that are not a priority for the Defense Department and our \nnational security.\n  The following things are beginning to happen now that the Department \nof Defense is under sequestration: The Navy was unable to deploy the \nUSS Truman, an aircraft carrier, to the Middle East at a time when the \ncentrifuges in Tehran are spinning; 80 percent of the Army's \nnondeploying brigades have reduced readiness; Army base operations have \nbeen reduced 30 percent; the Navy is reducing flying hours on deployed \ncarriers in the Middle East by 55 percent and shut down all flying for \nfour of the nine carrier air wings. If funding is restored, returning \nto normal readiness will take 9 to 12 months and cost two to three \ntimes as much.\n  The Air Force is delaying planned acquisition of satellites and \naircraft, including JSF and the AC-130J, which will increase the future \ncost of these systems. And the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps has \nsaid:\n\n       By the end of this year, more than 50 percent of my \n     tactical units will be below minimal acceptable levels of \n     readiness for deployment to combat.\n\n  My friends, here we are spending money on this kind of junk, on this \nkind of pork, while the Commandant of the Marine Corps says by the end \nof this year more than 50 percent of his combat units will be below \nminimal acceptable levels of readiness for deployment to combat? In \nwhat kind of parallel universe are we residing?\n  Instead of trying to remedy these drastic reductions to our military \nstrength, the appropriators are willing to overstep the authorizers and \ndefense leadership and provide increased funding for nonessential \nprograms that are clearly not a national security priority. The Armed \nServices Committee went to great lengths last year to authorize defense \nspending for the most critical national security requirements as \nproposed by the President and defense leadership.\n  Last week I offered an amendment, which was approved by a very narrow \nmargin, that removed funding in the bill for civilian infrastructure--\nnot military infrastructure, mind you, civilian infrastructure--for \nGuam. This earmark for Guam directly contravened the explicit direction \nprovided by the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives in the conference report on the fiscal year 2013 \nNational Defense Authorization Act and, in my opinion, is a clear \nexample of abuse of the appropriations process. I say to my colleagues, \nwe are not going to stand for it. I say to my friends on the \nAppropriations Committee, we will not stand for this.\n  Funding for the STARBASE Program. This ``nice to have but not \nnecessary to have'' program will receive $5 million. According to its \nWeb site, STARBASE focuses on elementary students, primarily fifth \ngraders. The program's goal is to motivate these students to explore \nscience, technology, engineering, and math as they continue their \neducation. Military volunteers apply abstract principles to real-world \nsituations by leading tours and giving lectures on the use of STEM in \ndifferent settings and careers.\n  I am sure that is a nice thing to happen. I am sure STARBASE is nice \nso that fifth graders are able to hear from members in the military. \nMeanwhile, we can't deploy an aircraft carrier. With a war going on, a \nbudget crisis at our doorstep, this is how we elect to spend our \ntaxpayers' defense money.\n  Another example is $11.3 million in increase for the Civil Air \nProgram or CAP. CAP is a volunteer organization that provides aerospace \neducation to young people, runs a junior cadet program, and assists, \nwhen possible, by providing emergency services. Its members are hard \nworking. We are grateful for their voluntarism.\n  This year, as in the past, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nauthorized the President's request for CAP funding. However, CAP is an \nauxiliary and should not operate to the detriment of the U.S. Air \nForce. To succeed at their missions, the Air Force must be able to fly \nand train at locations such as Luke Air Force Base, which is threatened \nwith reduced flight hours and the closure of two local control towers \nthat could impact air safety around the base. By diverting additional \nfunds--not the primary funding but additional funds--to the Civil Air \nPatrol from Air Force operations and maintenance accounts which pay for \nthe training and flight operations that keep the Air Force in the sky, \nwe are imposing greater risk on our men and women in uniform.\n  The bill includes $154 million for Army, Navy, and Air Force \n``alternative energy research'' initiatives. This type of research has \nyielded such shining examples as the Department of the Navy's purchase \nof 450,000 gallons of alternative fuels for $12 million, which is over \n$26 per gallon. Alternative energy research might be necessary, but \nshouldn't the Department of Energy do it? Why should the Department of \nDefense do it, when we cannot fly our airplanes?\n  Section 1822 prohibits the retirement of the C-23 Sherpa aircraft. \nThe Army is currently retiring or divesting the remainder of its fleet \nof old, limited-duty C-23s, all of which are flown by the Army National \nGuard. The Army neither wants nor needs these aircraft. The Air Force \nneither wants nor needs these aircraft. Last year the Congress granted \nthe Army authority to give these planes to any State Governor who \nwanted them. Guess what. No takers. Now we prevent the Army from \nretiring these limited-utility aircraft.\n  Another provision provides $15 million for an ``incentive program'' \nthat directs the Department of Defense to overpay on contracts by an \nadditional 5 percent if the contractor is a Native Hawaiian-owned \ncompany. If there were ever an example of the special interest pork \nbarrel spending that goes on in this body and infuriates the American \npeople, it is this--$15 million of Americans' tax dollars is going to \nany Native Hawaiian-owned company to give them an additional 5 percent \nif they are a contractor. Here we are, spending all our time trying to \neliminate the waste and inefficiency in defense contracting, and we are \nnow spending $15 million to overpay them if--if they are a Native \nHawaiian-owned company.\n  It will make it easier for the Department of Defense to enter into \nno-bid contracts for studies, analysis, and unsolicited proposals. The \nlanguage in the bill makes it ripe for wasteful spending and earmarks \nfor pet projects. For example, the Department of Defense may eliminate \ncompetition and use a no-bid contract for a ``product of original \nthinking and was submitted in confidence by one source.'' If there were \never an example of how pork barrel and earmark spending begins--``for a \nproduct of original thinking and was submitted in confidence by one \nsource.''\n  Another section requires the Secretary of the Air Force to continue\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\nprocuring C-27J Spartan aircraft despite the Air Force's intent to end \nproduction and divest these aircraft, and $24 million to continue \ndevelopment on ACS, which was a canceled Army reconnaissance aircraft \nprogram.\n  Another goody for defense contractors: There is a recurring provision \nin the bill that allows Alaska Native corporations to circumvent the \nrules of the Office of Management and Budget that would otherwise \nrequire them to follow an open and fair competition process in order to \nobtain Department of Defense contracts.\n  The Department of Defense has a history of awarding billions of \ndollars in large, sole-source, no-bid contracts to Alaska Native \ncorporations abusively. This matter has been well documented by the \nSenate subcommittee on contracting, the inspectors general of the \nDepartment of Defense and the Small Business Administration. The \nWashington Post ran a series on the Alaska Native corporation \ncontracting. Last year the Government Accountability Office found that \nthe Department of Defense expeditiously awarded two $500 million, 10-\nyear contracts using this same provision in a past appropriations bill.\n  Several of us on the Armed Services Committee and the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee have been trying to ensure \nthat contracts to ANCs undergo extra scrutiny. It does not help that \nthis bill is working against the American taxpayer while Congress \nshould be working to make sure the Department of Defense acquires what \nit truly needs as economically as possible through competition.\n  There is $48 million in funding for the Defense Department to do \nresearch dealing with Parkinson's disease, neurofibromatosis, and HIV/\nAIDS research. This research is important. It has no place in a \nDepartment of Defense bill. It should be funded by the National \nInstitutes of Health, not the Department of Defense.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a long list of unspecified and \nunauthorized and unnecessary and wasteful pork printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Additional DoD funding above the requested and authorized \n     levels include:\n       $18 million for unspecified ``industrial preparedness''\n       $567 million for ``unrequested'' medical research\n       $9 million for unspecified radar research\n       $48 million for computing research\n       $20 million for university research initiatives\n       $45 million for IMPACT AID to civilian elementary and \n     secondary schools\n       $139 million for CH-47 helicopter procurement and \n     modifications\n       $110 million to modify National Guard UH-60 helicopters\n       $199 million for new National Guard UH-60 helicopters\n       $300 million for new Patriot Missile systems\n       $100 million for National Guard Humvees\n       $66 million for laser range finders\n       $605 million to procure 11 additional F-18 aircraft\n       $79 million for a Navy Reserve C-40 aircraft--the military \n     version of a Boeing 737\n       $130 million for two KC-130J aircraft\n       $55 million for one C-130J aircraft (amount)\n       $126 million for two HC-130J aircraft\n       $126 million for two MC-130J aircraft\n       $107 million for RQ-4 unmanned aerial vehicles\n       $62 million for Air National Guard F-15 aircraft radar \n     upgrades\n       $189 million for 17 additional SM-3 missiles\n       $7 million for Civil Air Patrol program increase\n       $27 million for Army, Navy, and Air Force nanotechnology \n     research\n       $26 million for materials research\n       $71 million for one additional V-22 Osprey aircraft\n       $80 million for additional Marine UH-1Y and AH-1Z Cobra \n     helicopters\n       $20 million for upgrades to SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters\n       $15 million for ``weapons and munitions technology''\n       $20 million for ``electronics and electronic devices''\n       $13 million for ordnance research\n       $13 million for military clothing technology\n       $39 million for Army, Navy and Air Force battery research\n       $19 million for ``missile and rocket technology''\n       $20 million for university research initiatives\n       $9 million for unspecified radar research\n       $32 million for a bone marrow registry program\n       $7 million for a ``tactical athlete program''\n       $10 million in small business giveaways as part of the \n     Littoral Combat Ship program\n       $15 million in small business giveaways as part of the \n     Virginia class submarine program\n       $15 million in small business giveaways as part of the \n     Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft program\n       $10 million in small business giveaways as part of the MK-\n     48 torpedo program\n       $80 million for the Space Based Infrared System satellite \n     program\n       $9 million for directed energy technology\n       $20 million for the Air Force's manufacturing technology \n     program\n       $105 million for the Operationally Responsive Space program\n       $25 million for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle \n     Program\n       $35 million for the Space Test Program\n       $20 million to research ``anti-tamper technology''\n       $20 million for the Air Force to research coal-to-liquid \n     fuel.\n       $8 million to modify Navy Close-In Weapons Systems\n       $778 million for advance procurement funding for one \n     Virginia class submarine\n       $1 billion for one additional Arleigh Burke class destroyer\n       $263 million for advance procurement of one Amphibious \n     Transport Dock ship\n       $13 million for submarine research and technology\n       $40 million for shipyard capital investments\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is disgraceful. I see that my colleague from Texas is \nwaiting to talk. This is absolutely unbelievable. All of this long list \nof billions of dollars of spending can only be considered as how \nobscene it is by listening to what the impacts of sequester have \nalready been on the men and women in the military.\n  Sequester so far canceled four brigade exercises of training of the \nArmy--that has been canceled. It reduces the base operations, the \nnormal day-to-day operations of the base, by 30 percent; cancels half a \nyear of helicopter and ground vehicle depot maintenance; stops postwar \nrepair of 1,300 vehicles and 17,000 weapons. It reduces the readiness \nof the Army's nondeploying brigades and stops tuition assistance for \nall Active-Duty and Reserve men and women in the Army.\n  In the Navy, it cancels several submarine deployments; reduces flying \nhours on deployed carriers in the Middle East by 55 percent--and \nbelieve me, my friends, unless they are able to operate and train, they \nare not safe and they are not capable. It reduces the western Pacific \ndeployed operations by 35 percent; nondeployed Pacific ships lose 40 \npercent of their steaming days; reduces Middle East, Atlantic, and \nMediterranean ballistic missile defense patrols. It shuts down all \nflying of four of our nine carrier air wings--that has been shut down 9 \nto 12 months. It will take 9 to 12 months to restore normal readiness \nat two to three times the cost. It cuts all major exercises that are \ngoing on and defers emergent repairs; the USS Truman deployment to the \nMiddle East delayed indefinitely; the Eisenhower carrier deployment \nextended indefinitely; the USS Nimitz and Bush carrier strike force \nwill not be ready for scheduled 2013 deployments.\n  The Air Force--likely to prevent the Air Force's ability to achieve \nthe 2017 goal of being fully auditable; over 420 projects at 140 \ninstallations across the Air Force are canceled; affects runway repairs \nand critical sustainment projects; delays planned acquisition of \nsatellites and aircraft; reduces flying hours for cargo, fighter, and \nbomber aircraft.\n  In the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps is unable to complete the \nrebalancing of Marine Corps forces to the Asia Pacific region. It will \ncause 55 percent of the U.S. Marine Corps aviation squad to fall below \nready-to-deploy status. Over half of the aviation squadrons in the U.S. \nMarine Corps are not ready to deploy. The U.S. Marine Corps will not be \nable to accomplish planned reset of equipment returning from overseas. \nDepot-level maintenance will be reduced, delaying reset ability by 18 \nmonths and reducing readiness of nondeployed forces. Facilities will be \nfunded at 71 percent of the requirement.\n  Most important--maybe Members of Congress do not have a lot of \ncredibility. Maybe that is understandable. I will leave that up to the \nAmerican people to judge. I do think we respect the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps and what he had to say. I repeat:\n\n       By the end of this year, more than 50 percent of my combat \n     units will be below minimum acceptable levels of readiness \n     for deployment to combat.\n\n  Over the weekend, there was a gathering in our Nation's Washington, \nDC, area of a group of our conservative\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\nAmericans and members of the Republican Party, and references were made \nto people who were too old and moss-covered, that we need new and fresh \nindividuals and ideas and thoughts. I agree with all of those--every \nbit of those recommendations and comments that were made.\n  But there is a little bit of benefit of having been around for a \nwhile. My friends, I will tell you right now, I have seen this movie \nbefore. I saw it after the Vietnam war. When the Vietnam war was over, \nAmericans were war-weary. We had been driven apart in a way that was \nalmost unprecedented in our history--certainly maybe as far back as our \nCivil War. America was torn apart.\n  The first casualty of that was our military. Our military was cut and \ncut and cut, to the point where, in 1979, I believe it was, the Chief \nof Staff of the U.S. Army came before Congress and testified. It was \nkind of a seminal moment. He told the Congress and the American people \nthat we had a ``hollow Army'' that would be unable to defend this \nNation adequately.\n  It also happened to coincide with when a group of brave Americans \nwere being held hostage in the Embassy in Tehran, made famous by a \nfantastic movie called ``Argo.'' Along came a guy named Ronald Reagan \nwho promised that we would restore our military, that we would restore \nour capability, that we would make America the leader in the world \nagain, and a simple phrase called ``peace through strength.''\n  I want to tell you what we are doing with this sequestration. What we \nare doing with this sequestration is an exact replay of what we did \nafter the Vietnam war. I understand that the American people are war-\nweary. I understand that there are savings that can be made--large \nsavings made in our defense spending. But to do it like this puts the \nsecurity of this Nation in jeopardy.\n  We are blessed with the finest military ever in our history. I say \nthat with great respect to my predecessors who fought in previous wars. \nOur All-Volunteer Force is the best this Nation has ever produced. It \nis the best of America. We all know that. Do you know what is happening \nto them right now? I will tell you what is happening to them right now \nbecause I talk to them all the time. They don't know where their next \ndeployment is going to be. They don't know if they are going to be \nadequately trained to defend this Nation. They have lost confidence--\nthey have lost confidence in the leadership of this Nation. And the \ngood ones, the really good ones, are getting out. They are not going to \nstay in a military in which they believe there is no future and they \nare unable to defend this Nation. I tell my colleagues that. Ask anyone \nin the military today--junior officer, senior officer, senior enlisted \nperson--and they will tell you they are disgusted with what is going \non.\n  The least we can do is give them the ability to train and to operate \nto defend this Nation. This sequester and this legislation we are \nconsidering is a direct contradiction to everything we have said and \npromised them that we would do for them when they agreed as a volunteer \nto serve this Nation. It is a shameful period in the history of this \nCongress, the Presidency, and the way we have gone about this business. \nWe will maybe--very likely--pay a very heavy price.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, President Obama recently told the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives that we do not have a spending \nproblem. Last week he told ABC News that we do not have an immediate \ncrisis in terms of the debt. These comments indicate that the President \njust does not seem to understand the negative impact of $16.5 trillion \nin debt on our economy.\n  For that matter, based on the new budget, Senate Democrats do not \nseem to get it either. Not only would the budget that was passed out of \nthe Senate Budget Committee last week raise taxes by an additional $1.5 \ntrillion, it would also increase Federal spending by roughly 60 percent \nand increase our national debt by $7.3 trillion.\n  I should say that as bad as it is, the budget that was passed out of \nthe Budget Committee last week represents progress. How could I \npossibly say that? Because it has been 1,419 days since the Senate has \npassed a budget under Democratic control. So I guess we could say \nactually passing a budget out of the Budget Committee and having the \nbudget come to the floor this week represents progress.\n\n  The reason I said Democrats have raised taxes again--or proposed an \nadditional revenue increase in this budget--is because they already did \nso previously by $1 trillion with the passage of ObamaCare. In my \nexperience, ObamaCare is unique compared to other legislation we have \npassed here. We passed it in 2009 and early 2010. Many of its \nprovisions have yet to even kick in, and some of the provisions--\nincluding the tax increases--will not kick in until 2014. As I said, it \nwill raise taxes by an additional $1 trillion.\n  Earlier this year--we know as a result of the fiscal-cliff vote at \nthe end of December--there was an additional $620 billion tax increase \nat that time, but apparently that was not enough. There is an important \nlesson here. For those who believe that bigger and more government is \nthe answer to every problem that confronts our country, more taxes is \nnever enough. In fact, the Leviathan is insatiable.\n  This debate comes down to a basic philosophy in how we should govern \nourselves as a free people. Our friends on the other side of the aisle \nseem to be focused incessantly on the government and growing the \ngovernment in the hope that if the Federal Government spends enough \nmoney--even if the money is borrowed from our creditors--some of that \nmight trickle down into the private sector economy. Meanwhile, this \nside of the aisle fundamentally believes it is the job creation in the \nprivate sector which helps grow the economy and creates opportunity and \nprosperity. We look for ways to rein in wasteful Washington spending to \na more sustainable level so it stops hampering private sector \ninvestment and job creation.\n  I wish to ask President Obama: If we don't have a spending problem, \nwhy is it we have accumulated more than $6 trillion in additional debt \nsince you took office about 4 years ago? If we don't have a spending \nproblem, why is it we still have $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities \nbecause of programs that literally are not funded into the future? Why \nis it that today we are spending more than $200 billion a year on \ninterest payments on the debt? We cannot borrow $16.5 trillion interest \nfree. Even at the low interest rates we have today, we are paying $200 \nbillion a year on interest on that debt.\n  Is the President arguing we should postpone measured spending cuts \nand measured entitlement reforms until we have experienced a full-blown \nEuropean-style meltdown? I hope not. I don't think so because that \nwould be grossly irresponsible. I will remind the President and his \nallies that after $4 trillion in deficits--that would be the annual \ndifference between what we bring in and what the government spends. \nAfter four times in a row of deficits that are more than $1 trillion, \nafter more than $1.6 trillion in tax increases, after hundreds of \nbillions of dollars worth of new regulations, our country is mired; we \nare mired in the longest period of high unemployment since the Great \nDepression. That is a direct consequence of this huge debt and our \ncreditors' lack of confidence that we are actually serious about \ndealing with it.\n  Indeed, many workers have simply given up on finding work, which is \none reason why our labor force participation rate is now at a 32-year \nlow. Unemployment is almost 8 percent, but that doesn't take into \naccount the millions of people who have simply given up looking for \nwork after a long period of unemployment.\n  Since June 2009 when the recession officially ended, median household \nincome has fallen by more than $2,400. So instead of treading water, \nthe average American family is seeing their buying power decrease by \nmore than $2,400 since 2009. At the same time they are finding that not \nonly are their taxes going up with the return of the payroll tax to its \nprevious level, but they are finding their costs for gasoline, food, \nand the other necessities of life are going up. Does this sound like an \neconomy that can stand another massive tax increase? I don't think so.\n  President Obama said to ABC News that we should not try to balance \nthe\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\nbudget ``just for the sake of balance.'' Well, once again, the \nPresident was knocking down a straw man. We weren't talking about doing \nsomething symbolic; we were talking about doing something real, \nsomething that would benefit the economy and job growth and getting \npeople back to work instead of dependency, which I know none of them \nwant. We see more and more people on food stamps, more people receiving \ndisability benefits, and more people on unemployment. These are people \nwho would like to get back to work and regain their sense of dignity \nand self-sufficiency, but because the economy is growing so slowly, \nthey cannot do that. We believe that balancing the budget and reducing \nour debt burden is absolutely essential to long-term economic growth--\nlong-term economic growth--which creates more jobs, more taxpayers, and \npeople who are actually putting money into the Treasury to help us \nbalance our deficits.\n  We also believe that balancing the budget and reducing our debt \nburden is essential to saving important programs our seniors depend \nupon, such as Medicare and Social Security. If we want to remain an \nopportunity society with high levels of upward mobility--something we \ncall the American dream--we must act sooner rather than later. The \nlonger we delay, the more expensive and the more difficult the \nchallenge of fixing these problems will become. Again, the basic \nquestion is: Are we more concerned with growing the job-creating \nprivate sector or with growing the Federal Government?\n  The budget that passed out of the Senate Budget Committee--along a \nparty-line vote with strictly the votes of Democrats--last week makes \nit clear they are ultimately more concerned with growing the Federal \nGovernment. We will have a chance on the floor of the Senate this week \nfor Democrats and Republicans alike to offer amendments and get votes, \nwhich I think will provide a lot of clarity to the contrasting \napproaches of the major political parties.\n  We have simply had the weakest economic recovery since the Great \nDepression, and so it is now time to do something different. I cannot \nrecall who the original author was of the saying that the definition of \ninsanity is to do the same thing over and over again and to expect \ndifferent outcomes. Well, if that is the definition of insanity, that \nis what is happening here in the U.S. Congress. It is time to put \neconomic growth ahead of government growth.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to bring my colleagues up to \ndate on where we are. Right now the vice chairman of the committee, \nSenator Shelby, and I are in conversation on some possible agreements \nwe could make on the outstanding amendments so we can get them down to \na manageable list. We are waiting for his arrival. He was at the \nairport, and we have been in communication. Our conversations have been \nconstructive. When Senator Shelby arrives, we look forward to perhaps \npresenting something to the Senate that will give us a clear path on \nspecific amendments.\n  While we are waiting for that, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business about some very sad events that occurred in Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, over the weekend, we in Maryland were \nsaddened by three separate yet poignant deaths.\n  CPT Sara Cullen, one of our very own--a wonderful woman who served in \nthe U.S. military--died in Afghanistan. Kristina Quigley, a young woman \nwho showed enormous promise, was killed in an awful bus crash. She was \nthe lacrosse coach at Seton Hill. Also, someone beloved to so many of \nus, Larry Simns, was the head of the watermen's association. For those \nwho are from different parts of the country, they are called \nfishermen's associations. For people who enjoy Maryland crabs and \noysters, they are harvested by the men who sail the Chesapeake Bay in \nopen waters. The head of their association was Larry Simns.\n  I wish to talk briefly about all three.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Foreces\n\n                      Captain Sara Knuston Cullen\n\n  Captain Cullen died on March 11 from a crash in a UH-60 Black Hawk \nhelicopter in the Kandahar Province in Afghanistan. It was during a \ntraining mission in a very heavy rain. She was assigned to headquarters \nand the combat aviation brigade. She was a wonderful woman with \nenormous promise. She was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy. She \ngraduated from West Point in 2007, and she got married very recently to \nanother pilot, Chris Cullen.\n  I want to comment that we in Maryland mourn the loss of Captain \nCullen. She was well known and well regarded here locally in Carroll \nCounty. She went to a school called Liberty High School. Isn't that a \ngreat name? She wanted to go to West Point. She was not nominated by me \nbut by another member of the Maryland delegation. We try to share that \nresponsibility in order to maximize our talent. I know the gentlelady \nfrom Hawaii does that as well. We have so much talent in Maryland, we \ndon't want to waste one nomination, so we all work together.\n  By all accounts, Captain Cullen was on her way to being an \noutstanding officer with a deep commitment to her country. Friends and \nfamily of hers in Eldersburg, a community in Carroll County where she \ngrew up, said she was dearly loved.\n  ``She was always looking for the next adventure, the next challenge, \nand the next task to being a better person,'' said her best friend \nKatie Owens.\n  NATO told us of the crash last week, and I was mortified about this \nover the weekend. On behalf of all of Maryland, we want to extend our \ncondolences to her husband, to her family, and to her parents, who \nobviously gave her a great home and saw to her education. It is a sad \nday when we lose somebody in Afghanistan, and it is a very sad day for \nthose of us in Maryland.\n\n\n                      Remembering Kristina Quigley\n\n  We also remember another wonderful woman by the name of Kristina \nQuigley. Kristina Quigley grew up in a community called Dundalk. \nDundalk is a blue-collar suburb outside Baltimore City. She went to \nDundalk High School and then to Duquesne and then, because she was a \ngreat athlete, she went on to a sports career in college at Duquesne \nand then fulfilled a dream of hers to be a coach.\n  On a road trip of the college women's lacrosse team, there was a \nterrible accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The bus went off the \nroad and she was, obviously, sitting in a place where she received one \nof the first impacts. She was only 30 years old. She was married with a \nyoung child. She was 6 months pregnant at the time of the accident. Her \nunborn child perished as well.\n  This is very sad. There were many who were injured on this bus. \nSeveral were from Maryland who were also members of the team, and the \nassistant coach is also from Maryland. The assistant coach is from \nBaltimore. There were 23 students on board when this happened in \nCumberland County. We are now awaiting details. We are now awaiting the \ninvestigation. But it is a very sad day when this promising young woman \nwith the world ahead of her who, by all accounts, was not only an \nathlete who could teach athletics, but she was an inspirational leader. \nGirls and young women just loved her. Lacrosse is a tough sport to \nplay. They were on their way to a great game. Seton Hill is a great \nCatholic college. There was excitement on the bus, anticipation, and we \nare sorry about this terrible tragedy.\n  Again, we extend our heartfelt condolences to her parents who live in \nBaltimore and to her husband who lives on the Seton Hill campus.\n\n\n                        Remembering Larry Simns\n\n  In addition, because each one has a story, is my own pal and good \nfriend Larry Simns. Larry Simns was a great Marylander. His official \nname was Lawrence Simns, Sr., and he passed away Thursday. He fathered \nthree children. He had 5 stepchildren, 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-\ngrandchildren. He was a friend to a host of people up and down the \nChesapeake Bay. If you were involved in cleaning up the bay or\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nmaking sure the people who live alongside the bay had jobs, you knew \nLarry Simns. He was a true champion. For me, he was a wonderful adviser \non how we could clean up the bay but ensure that our watermen could \ncontinue to work on the bay.\n  We have been plagued over the last several years with the declining \nof our species, including our crabs and our oysters. If we want to save \nthem, it means rules and regulations. If my colleagues know our \nwatermen, they know they are kind of like the Wild West guys who want \nto ride the range. They don't like rules and regulations. They are not \nrules and regulations kind of guys, but they also know we have to be \nable to save the species.\n  For decades Larry himself saw the bay's declining health: poor water \nquality, fewer fish and crabs, barren oyster reefs. Then he worked with \nme to help the watermen navigate through these tough environmental \nfactors, tough economies, and stiff regulations. He did not have an \neasy job, but he approached it with such tenacity, such persistence, \nand in such a way where he spoke with humility about what God had given \nus, this spectacular Chesapeake Bay, and how we had to preserve it and \nthe jobs. He became an unlikely spokesman because, he said: I am not \nmuch for words; you know me. We did know him and he spoke eloquently \nfor these men and women.\n  I worked very hard with the watermen on how we could help them clean \nup the bay, along with Senator Cardin and the Members of the House \ndelegation, and worked with our watermen and worked with our scientists \nstudying the bay so we could make sure we could preserve the \nlivelihoods and heritage of the bay and the men who work on it. \nFortunately, working together, we were able to do many wonderful \nthings. But we could only do it because Larry Simns was such a great \nadvocate.\n  We are going to miss him. I just can't believe Larry will not be with \nus anymore. When I first came to the Senate--now over 20-some years \nago--Larry was one of the first to reach out to me, to help me learn \nthe ways of the watermen, learn what they were up against, including \ntough weather, harsh working conditions, escalating fuel prices, \nbecause our men and women go out on those waters using boats that \nconsume diesel oil, and, again, the declining species. But working \ntogether, we were able to accomplish a lot.\n  So I wish to say to his family: Thank you for lending Larry to us, \nbecause he spent much time in government meetings, regulatory hearings, \nsitting with me at Fisherman's Inn or pulling the watermen together for \na roundtable so we could talk things over to find a sensible center to \npreserve their jobs and still have the smart science and smart \nregulations. We want to thank Larry for all the time he put in, taking \na very green Senator--and by green I don't mean only in the \nenvironmental sense but as a new Senator--and helping me learn the ways \nof the people because we want to preserve their way of life.\n  It is a sad day. It is a sad day for all of us. So when Memorial Day \ncomes and the restaurants open and piles of Maryland crabs start coming \nin and the restaurants start serving the steamed crabs and so on, I \njust want to say this: Larry, wherever you are, whenever I pound the \ncrab claw, I will be thinking of you and all you meant in terms of what \nwe did to be able to create jobs, clean up the environment, and be able \nto keep our way of life going on the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The Presiding Officer can see we had three great Marylanders, each \ndoing a very different thing. But what I am so proud of with Captain \nCullen, Larry Simns, and Kristina Quigley is that each in their own way \nwas trying to make a difference, one to protect America, the other to \nprotect jobs and a way of life on the Chesapeake Bay, and the other to \ninspire young women not only to be ready for the playing fields of \nlacrosse but for the playing fields of life. All three in their own way \nwere inspirational leaders. All three in their own way made a \ndifference in the lives of the people I came in contact with. I wish to \nsay God bless them and God treat them kindly and may their souls rest \nin peace.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask there be order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. Everyone has to look at this from way up high and understand \nhow much has been accomplished during the last week. Senator Mikulski \nand Senator Shelby have worked very hard to change the bill that came \nfrom the House of Representatives, and they have done a good job, a \nreally good job. People have requested further changes to the bill, and \nwe have tried hard. I say ``we,'' I have gone to Senator McConnell many \ntimes, Senator Mikulski, Senator Shelby, and others trying to come up \nwith some way to move forward on this legislation.\n  There is a big spotlight on the Senate to see if we can do something. \nWhatever we come up with, what Mikulski and Shelby, what they have come \nup with, it is not perfect. I could improve it. The Senator from \nTennessee could improve it. Anyone in this body could improve what they \ndid, but they did the best they could--and it was hard.\n  Both of these Senators gave up things that help them in their States. \nThey worked together on Commerce-State-Justice for many years. They \nknow that subcommittee better than anyone has ever known that \nsubcommittee. They both have many issues within their States that are \naffected by that subcommittee, but they gave that up for the greater \ngood.\n  I am asking Senators here to give up a few things for the greater \ngood, to try to allow us to get this done. The reason this is important \nis it will allow us to go forward and start having appropriations \nbills. We changed the rules at the beginning of the year to make it \neasier to go to certain bills, and what we had in mind was \nappropriations bills.\n  It has been hard to come up with this. I repeat, is it really, really \ngood? No, probably not. But it is not bad.\n  I hope we could approve this unanimous consent request. We would have \nnine votes on matters that people believe are really important. There \nare other people who have things that are just as important, but this \nis legislation, the art of compromise.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the two cloture motions \nbe withdrawn; that the following amendments be in order to the \nMikulski-Shelby substitute: Coburn No. 69, Coburn No. 93, Coburn No. 65 \nas modified with the changes that are at the desk, Coburn No. 70 as \nmodified with the changes that are at the desk, Inhofe No. 72 as \nmodified with changes that are at the desk, Grassley No. 76 as modified \nwith changes that are at the desk, Mikulski-Shelby No. 98, Leahy No. \n129 as modified with changes that are at the desk, and Pryor-Blunt No. \n82; that no other first-degree amendments to the substitute or the \nunderlying bill be in order and no second-degree amendments be in order \nto any of the amendments listed above prior to the vote; that there be \n30 minutes equally divided between the two leaders or their designees \nprior to votes in relation to the amendments in the order listed; and \nthat upon the disposition of Leahy No. 29 as modified, the Durbin \nsecond-degree amendment to Toomey amendment No. 115 be withdrawn; that \nall the amendments be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Toomey amendment No. 115; \nthat upon disposition of the Toomey amendment, the Senate proceed to \nvote on the Mikulski-Shelby substitute amendment, as amended; that if \nthe substitute amendment, as amended, is agreed to, the Senate proceed \nto vote on passage of the bill, as amended.\n  It is my understanding that the Toomey amendment has a point of order \nagainst it; is that right? I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I reserve the right to object. I have \nfiled an amendment. I filed it last week. It\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nis a reasonable amendment that both sides have been aware of. It is one \nthat is also germane. It is to strike funding, $380 million in funding \nfrom the continuing resolution for a missile defense program that will \nnever protect a single warfighter. It is a medium extended air defense \nsystem. In fact, it has been called a missile to nowhere, and my \namendment would transfer those funds to operation and maintenance so \nthey could be used for our warfighters, particularly as sequestration \nis pending, for real purposes instead of a program we will never \nrealize anything from, that would protect our warfighters. I reserve \nthe right to object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Do you object?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has not objected; is that right?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is over with. There has been \nobjection. I regret the Senator has objected to this reasonable \nrequest. It really is reasonable. I understand how strongly the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire feels about the issue. I am aware of the issue. I \nunderstand it very well. I have talked to a number of Senators. I can't \nget them to agree to this. They may be wrong, she may be right. She may \nbe wrong, they may be right. I cannot make that decision. I cannot go \nforward if somebody doesn't agree to this.\n\n  Putting together a unanimous consent agreement like this, as I \nindicated, certainly has not been easy. The people I have empathy for \nare these two Senators here. They are veteran legislators. They have \ndedicated a large part of the last 2 weeks to this legislation.\n  We could have an alternative. We could just vote for what the House \nsent us. All the work they have done--down the drain. There are scores \nof Senators--and I say that plural--scores of the 100 Senators who have \nbenefited from the work they have done. It has helped them in their \nStates. It has rearranged things. What they have done does not spend \nany more money. We are spending the same amount of money the House did. \nBut the House was very emphatic that they would not allow flexibility \non nondefense matters. They have some control over what we do.\n  I just think it is such a shame that there is an objection preventing \nthe Senate from being able to consider these amendments. There are nine \namendments. This is a must-pass measure so we will need to move this \nSenate bill through the Senate back to the House to avoid the \ngovernment shutdown. I think it is a shame, but that is where we are.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, \nbe recognized for up to 5 minutes, and the Senator from Alabama be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes prior to the vote on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, had the Senator from New Hampshire not \nobjected to the previous request for unanimous consent, I would have \nobjected. I want to use this moment just to point out that an amendment \nthat is, in my view, so critical to the air safety of our country, the \ntraveling public's ability to feel secure and safe in their travel, was \nnot included in the request for unanimous consent. This is an amendment \nthat would transfer money to allow the air traffic control tower \nprogram to continue.\n  While the majority leader has requested that there be magnanimity, \nthat there be reasonableness, in my view, in the absence of this \namendment being included, come April 7 those air traffic control towers \nare closed. And even I, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, \nwill have no ability to reverse course once they are closed. So this \nprogram faces an immediate deadline.\n  Had the Senator from New Hampshire not objected previously to the \nunanimous consent request, I would have on that basis. I have no \nobjection to the request that time be given to the chair and the \nranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my consent has been agreed to. In response \nto my friend from Kansas, everyone can give a heart-rending speech. We \nhave tens of thousands of children who will not able to go to Head \nStart. I think that is pretty compelling. There are many other people \nin this body who could give a tearjerker--just like the Senator tried \nto do.\n  This is about compromise. We are trying to work through this so we \ncan continue to fund the government and set up a pattern in this \nCongress so we can have appropriation bills for 2014.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). Is there objection to the \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to ask all of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to vote for cloture on the Senate bill. I want \nto say to my colleagues, we have come very far on this bill, and as of \nThursday we had 126 amendments. I love the Senate. We love to talk, and \nwe love to amend. Everyone has, in many instances, outstanding ideas to \nimprove the bill. We are now at the point where we have dueling \namendments. We have matters of policy to discuss, but we are now at the \npoint where the bill must come to a close, and that is why we proposed \nthis limited number of amendments. Some of my colleagues have \namendments on the issue related to flexibility.\n  If I could ask the Senator from Kansas a question, it is not that we \ndispute what the Air Force is going to face or what our poultry farmers \nare going to face. Both sides of the aisle--whether it is Blunt of \nMissouri, Isakson of Georgia, Pryor or Boozman of Arkansas, or Mikulski \nand Cardin of Maryland, chicken is the mainstay of our eastern shore. \nWe are all facing this.\n  In my original underlying bill, I had a 1-percent transfer authority \nsubject to the approval of Congress that would have solved all of these \nproblems. It was the other Chamber--and even those on the other side of \nthe aisle--that insisted I remove that from this bill. For all of those \nwho wanted flexibility, I wanted to fix it. We could not fix it. \nBelieve me, I wanted to fix it. Each and every one of these individual \namendments has merit in and of itself.\n  We are now at the point where we have to decide whether we want the \nSenate bill to stand and be voted on with further amendments subject to \nthe Parliamentarian determining what is germane and therefore eligible \nfor consideration or do we want the House bill? It is as simple as \nthat.\n  We have come so far. I want to thank the vice chairman, Senator \nShelby, his staff, and all the clerks on the other side of the aisle \nfor working so assiduously.\n  We have to decide: Do we want to make the perfect the enemy of the \ngood? Do we want to have a bill that substantially improves the House \nbill? It does not accomplish every objective we want, but, in fact, \ndoes do several things.\n  No. 1, it would avoid a government shutdown. Say what, Senator \nMikulski? Avoid a government shutdown? We could show that we could \nactually govern and that we could actually pass a bill that I believe \nthe House will accept as well. Hallelujah. That in and of itself would \nbe a major accomplishment. We would have taken the House bill and we \nwould have made substantial improvements that I think both sides of the \naisle agree are important. We could get that done. The question is: Can \nboth sides of this Chamber take yes for an answer? If we take yes for \nan answer, again, we avoid a government shutdown. We will show we can \ngovern and make substantial improvements not only in the areas of \ndefense and national security, but in other areas where people protect \nus, such as border control and food safety. Do we get what we want? No. \nBut we do get a bill that we can feel has made a major accomplishment.\n  I could go through this item by item. I have a speech that would take \nme 20 minutes to go through. I am not going to go through it. What I am \ngoing to say to my colleagues is: Both sides of the aisle have worked \ntogether for the common good in such areas as the security of our \ncountry, meeting compelling human needs, and investments in research \nand technology. I think we ought to say yes and vote to move to cloture \non the Senate bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, to some extent, I want to repeat what \nSenator Mikulski just said. No. 1, this would avoid a government \nshutdown. That should appeal to everybody. I think it appeals to the \nAmerican people. It should appeal to everybody in this body tonight.\n  No. 2, it enforces the Budget Control Act and sequester levels. I \nwill say it again. It enforces the Budget Control Act and sequester \nlevels. Granted, perhaps not everything is ideal, but what is here? \nThere will be ample time to address some of the issues. Some of the \nissues that have been raised are bona fide issues that we were unable \nto address for one reason or another in this process. But I assure my \ncolleagues--and I have been working with my colleagues and with Senator \nMikulski's Democratic colleagues--that if we do not move forward, I am \nafraid there may be no future appropriations bills, which is not good \nfor anyone in this legislative process.\n  We have lurched from crisis to crisis. The CR is running out. What we \nare asking to do is to fund the government until September 30.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture and move this process \nforward.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to follow up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. To be clear, the first vote is on the cloture for the \nSenate bill. If this vote on cloture fails, we will go to the House \nbill. We have two choices tonight; we have two paths which we can go \ndown. We can go down the Senate path, which is bipartisan in its \napproach. It is a good and solid bill, but if it goes down, we will \nimmediately go to cloture on the House bill. If that passes, then \nessentially everything that we as U.S. Senators have worked on will be \nrubberstamping what the House sent us. So the path and choice are ours.\n  I intend to vote aye on the Senate bill and I urge all of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle to follow my lead. I know Senator \nShelby feels the same about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report----\n  Mr. MORAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No further debate is in order.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the Mikulski-Shelby substitute amendment No. 26, as \nmodified, to H.R. 933 a bill making appropriations for the Department \nof Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other departments \nand agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for \nother purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara A.

Rockefeller IV, Charles E. Schumer, \n           Carl Levin, Thomas R. Carper, Richard J. Durbin, Maria \n           Cantwell\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nMikulski-Shelby substitute amendment No. 26, as modified, offered by \nthe Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, to H.R. 933, making appropriations \nfor the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \nother departments and agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2013, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by Reid on \nbehalf of Senators Shelby and Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Graham).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 63, nays 35, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 38 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--63\n\n     Alexander\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Cowan\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Graham\n     Lautenberg\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes and that following my remarks \nSenator Moran be granted up to 10 minutes and then Senator Boxer be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n      Tenth Anniversary of the United States-Led Invasion of Iraq\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this month we mark the 10th anniversary of \nthe United States-led invasion of Iraq. With more veterans per capita \nthan nearly any other State, Montanans proudly answer when duty calls.\n  The Book of John, chapter 15, verse 13 says: ``Greater love hath no \nman than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''\n  On this anniversary, we remember the Montanans and all Americans who \nlaid down their lives in the name of freedom.\n  On my family ranch near Wolf Creek, MT, there is a willow tree that \nsways in the wind and stretches in the Sun.\n  On July 29, 2006, my nephew, Marine Cpl Phillip Baucus, was killed \nduring combat operations in Iraq's Al Anbar Province. He was just 28 \nyears old.\n  He was laid to rest on the same mountain where my father lies, the \nsame ranch where he had married his lovely Katharine less than 1 year \nearlier.\n  Phillip was a bright and dedicated young man. He was like a son to \nme.\n  My brother John and I planted that willow tree on the ranch in memory \nof Phillip. We also planted a pine tree nearby.\n  I am not the only Montanan who has grieved. Forty Montanans have lost \ntheir lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. We grieve for them all. We miss \nthem all.\n  We must honor their courage by living up to the ideals they died to \ndefend. We must also honor their sacrifice by supporting the troops who \ncome home forever changed. Thousands come home with traumatic brain \ninjuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other injuries.\n  Make no mistake, we have taken important steps to see that veterans \nreceive the care they need when they come home. We have worked for a \nstrong post-9/11 GI bill to ensure thousands of veterans can go to \ncollege. We also fought to make sure the VA is fairly and adequately \nsupporting our\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\nstudent veterans. Yet it remains a disgrace that unemployment rates \namong veterans exceed that of nonveterans.\n  In Montana, unemployment among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans stands \nat 17.5 percent. That is the fourth highest rate in the country.\n  Since the Iraq war began, I have hired veterans to help draft \npolicies that honor the sacrifices of our military. My staff has worked \nwith me to draft the original tax credit for businesses that hire \nveterans. I am very honored to see that has been adopted by this \nCongress and by the President.\n  We spearheaded efforts to improve mental health screenings for all \nbranches of the military based on Montana's strong model for catching \nthe warning signs of PTSD. We started that in Montana. It is now \nincorporated as national defense policy.\n  In the last 10 years, our Nation has also been fighting terrorists in \nAfghanistan. As we reflect on the costs of the war in Iraq, we know \nthat now is the time for Afghans to take responsibility for their own \ncountry.\n  In 2013, $97 billion will go to the war in Afghanistan alone. Do you \nknow that the money that is being spent in both Iraq and Afghanistan is \nenough to double the number of public elementary schools in the United \nStates and rebuild the American Interstate Highway System five times \nover? Dollars spent daily in Afghanistan need to be spent on nation \nbuilding here at home.\n  While I am proud that we are closer than ever to bringing all of our \ntroops home, it is not enough to just bring them back. We need to and \ncan be doing a better job making sure our troops are ready to compete \nand win on the homefront. That means making sure that the day they are \ndischarged from the service, they can transfer skills earned from the \nmilitary into the civilian workforce.\n  My first order of business this year was to declare war on veterans \nunemployment. Troops who are trained to do a job in the military should \nget civilian credentials at the same time. They should not have to get \nrecredentialed and retrained when they get home. If they got \ncredentialed in the military, that should be sufficient for driving \ntrucks, et cetera. The effort is already underway for EMTs and \ntruckdrivers, but my VETs Act goes even further to cover military \npolice, firefighters, and air traffic controllers. In 2011, 1,000 Iraq \nand Afghanistan veterans were unemployed in Montana, 240,000 unemployed \nnationwide. With 34,000 troops scheduled to come home from Afghanistan \nnext year, the time to get serious about tackling veterans unemployment \nis now.\n  We will never forget the Montanans we have lost in combat in the \nMideast over the last 10 years. They had big dreams. They looked \nforward to long, happy lives. They were volunteers. They were sons and \ndaughters. They had children. They had dear friends. They grew up in \nsmall towns, such as Fairfield, Sand Springs, Philipsburg, and Wolf \nCreek. We hear their voices at Little League games, in the babbling \ncreeks of Montana, in the rustling of willow trees we planted to \nremember them. We remember them in our hearts and in our deeds. \nPresident Lincoln concluded his second inaugural address with a call \nfor the Nation to ``care for him who shall have borne the battle and \nfor his widow and his orphan.'' Lincoln's charge remains our sacred \nduty today. The 40 Montanans we remember today left behind 28 children \nwho will be growing up without them.\n  I also applaud a group of patriotic Montanans who are working to make \nsure those children can get a college education in Montana. Grateful \nNation Montana is a proud example of answering the call to serve, \nserving those who proudly served us. Their mission is to provide \ncollege scholarships at Montana schools for the sons and daughters of \nour fallen heroes.\n  We must remember our vets. To all of our veterans and families of \nveterans who made the ultimate sacrifice, we want them to know they are \nnot alone.\n  Let's recommit ourselves to making sure our veterans come home safely \nto good-paying jobs and a nation that honors their sacrifices.\n\n\n                            National Ag Week\n\n  I would like to speak on another important issue in my home State as \nwe mark National Ag Week. President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, \n``Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and you're a \nthousand miles from the corn field.'' Truer words were never spoken to \ndescribe the divide of how agriculture is viewed between Washington, \nDC, and Montana.\n  Agriculture is a central part of who we are as Montanans. Fifty \npercent of Montana's economy is tied to ranching and farming, \nsupporting one in five jobs in Montana.\n  I had the privilege to grow up on a ranch outside of Helena, MT, near \nWolf Creek, MT. It taught me firsthand the values of hard work, faith, \nfamily, and doing what is right. Those are the values I take with me to \nwork every day.\n  Paul Harvey, who got his start in broadcasting in Montana, said it \nbest in his poem ``So God Made a Farmer\":\n\n       God looked down on the Earth he created and said, I need a \n     caretaker for this world I have made, and so God made a \n     farmer.\n\n  So as part of trying to bridge that divide between Washington, DC, \nand Montana, I honor the strong legacy of farming and ranching families \nin Montana by celebrating National Ag Day. For those Montana families \ninvolved in agriculture, it is so much more than a livelihood, it is a \nway of life. I am honored to represent so many ranchers, so many \nfarmers from Montana who have dedicated their lives to the land and \nprovide a service from which everyone in the world benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. The bill we are debating, the so-called continuing \nresolution, spends slightly more than $1 trillion between now and the \nend of the fiscal year. As those who were either on the floor or \nwatching a few moments ago discovered, the opportunity to amend this \nbill in even a minor fashion, although, in my view, an important \nfashion, was denied.\n  So the Senate, in passing the CR, will spend more than $1 trillion, \nand we have had the opportunity to vote on two amendments, potentially \nthree. That is the total extent to which 100 Senators representing \nmillions of Americans have had the chance to influence the outcome, the \ncontent of a significant bill that spends lots of money.\n  The amendment I have been trying to offer, in my view, is an \nimportant one.\n  One of the things the administration announced following \nsequestration was that the control tower program, which provides about \n179 air traffic control towers across the country, would be eliminated. \nThat certainly is of importance to those who fly. It is important to \npeople in our States, rural America. But this is not just a rural \nissue. These control towers are located in large cities across our \ncountry.\n  I have been trying to fathom why the Department of Transportation \nwould, in a sense, single out this program. It is hard for me to fathom \na good answer to that question.\n  As close as I can come is there are those in Washington, DC, who wish \nto demonstrate we can't cut a dime. We can't cut $85 billion from \nFederal spending, a $3.6 trillion spending program. We can't eliminate \n28 days of spending at all. To prove that point, they apparently wish \nto single out programs which are the most important to Americans.\n  The idea we would put at risk an air traffic control tower program \nwhich is so important to the flying and traveling public is amazing to \nme. Again, it is not I think that the sequestration and the 5-percent \ncut in this program could not be handled by the Department of \nTransportation, but that is not what the Department of Transportation \nis doing.\n  In fact, the amendment which I hope to offer continues the \nsequestration and reduces the program spending by 5 percent. What the \nDepartment of Transportation is doing is eliminating the program, \nreducing the spending in this program by 75 percent.\n  Again, I can't figure out why this program of such importance would \nbe treated in this fashion unless there are those who simply wish to \ndemonstrate anytime we attempt to reduce spending--it is actually not \neven reducing spending; sequestration reduces the increase in spending. \nThe only thing I can think of is there are people who wish to \ndemonstrate here we cannot do that without having huge consequences to \nthe safety and security of Americans. In my view, that concept \ncertainly is false. We can find savings, but\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nbeyond that it is a dangerous game to play in trying to prove a point \nwe can't cut spending by putting at risk those who utilize air traffic \ncontrol towers.\n  My frustration is increased by the fact we are spending all this \nmoney and the bill comes to the floor. I serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I ought to have the opportunity to deal with this bill in \nthe committee on which I serve. This hasn't happened.\n  I think what is my next opportunity, since I didn't have one as a \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee? Maybe I ought to find \ncolleagues from across the aisle, from around the country, rural, \nurban, Republican, Democrat, who would understand the value of this \nprogram. I did this and we found 23 sponsors of this amendment. We \ncould probably find more. The point I wish to make this evening is 13 \nof those 23 are Democrat sponsors.\n  This place ought to function. We have been asked, why can't we work \ntogether? Why can't we find bipartisan ways to work together, 23 \nSenators, where 10 Republicans and 13 Democrats come together to say, \nyes, this needs to pass? Yet I have had no opportunity to offer that \namendment. Numerous Members of the Senate from both sides of the aisle, \nbut especially Democratic Senators, visit with me on the Senate floor \nsaying, why can't you get this amendment made in order? It is a good \namendment.\n  I don't have a good answer for that question.\n  We have worked hard with the chairperson and the ranking Republican \non the committee. We have worked across the aisle and worked with the \nleadership, attempting to clarify how important this amendment is. Yet \nwe will spend more than $1 trillion. However, one amendment, which \ntransfers $50 million from two accounts, from unencumbered balances and \nfrom research funds, to keep the air traffic control program alive and \nwell, is not in order.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, my hope was I could \nsolve this problem in the normal appropriations process. We spoke about \nthis tonight. The majority leader spoke about getting back to the \nregular order and working on appropriations bills. Presumably sometime \nthis week--although as a result of this amendment not being made in \norder, it will be later in the week than expected--we will get to the \nbudget. Presumably we will pass a budget and go through the \nappropriations process.\n  The problem is I, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, and my \ncolleagues who care about this program, who serve on this committee and \nwho serve in the Senate, will have no opportunity to save this program. \nThe Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, is going to terminate this program on April 7. By the \ntime we ever get to regular order, if and when we do, the program will \nbe eliminated. We will have lost the only opportunity, which is now on \nthis continuing resolution, to make certain this program remains in \nplace.\n  If we do what we ought to do here, come together and find a solution, \nreach bipartisan agreement, we ought to have the opportunity to address \n$50 million out of a more than $1 trillion bill. The idea we would pass \na $1 trillion appropriations bill, with only allowing two, maybe three \namendments, is something which again suggests we do not have our order \nin the appropriate place.\n  This is certainly important to folks across the country, and it is \nsomething which deserves attention and deserves a vote. It is something \nthe American public ought to insist we not play the game of whether we \ncan cut anything and put their safety at risk.\n  My plea to my colleagues tonight, having voted to advance this bill \nand cloture has been granted, which means no amendments are in order, I \nwould ask our colleagues to realize the importance of this amendment \nand potentially others. Other Members of the Senate wish to offer \namendments to establish and prove our priorities and, as the majority \nleader, demonstrate we can govern. The majority leader spoke about \nproving to the American people we can govern by passing this bill. It \nseems to me governing is something more than passing a continuing \nresolution without the opportunity for Members of the Senate to make \ntheir imprint on behalf of their constituents, and in my case Kansans, \non behalf of the American people.\n  The air transportation system is essential to local communities and \nit is vital to our economic engine. It matters across the country. This \namendment, if I am allowed to offer it, would continue access to the \nsystem which has worked so well for so many communities across our \ncountry. My plea is between now and when the 30 hours runs on the \npostcloture debate of this bill, there are those in the Senate who will \nwork with me and others to see the amendment process works and we \nreturn to the days in which a Senator has the ability to influence the \noutcome of important pieces of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                    Sequester and Climate Disruption\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about a \nvery important issue called climate change or climate disruption.\n  Before I do, I wish to address the issue my colleague has raised. He \ndid not want to stop debate on the continuing resolution bill because \nhe wanted to offer an amendment to ensure we cut somewhere as well as \nkeep the FAA able to keep open air traffic control towers.\n  As someone who fought a partial government shutdown which shut down \nthe FAA, my friends on the Republican side--my friend wasn't here \nthen--I can tell you I was instrumental in making sure we passed that \nFAA authorization bill. It was a great bill.\n  It breaks my heart to see this sequester in action. This is not the \nway to govern.\n  I respect my colleague's point of view. He has a right to his \nopinion, but to say this is the only opportunity to stop the sequester \nis absolutely incorrect. The President has said he is ready to sit down \nwith the Republicans, pass a balanced plan which would fix the \nsequester, get the FAA back up to snuff, take care of all of our \nproblems which were caused because of the sequester, deficit reduction, \nand balance our budget. If this happens, this sequester will end not \nonly for the FAA--my friend is right, this is ridiculous--but for the \n70,000 children who are being cut out of Head Start. Why isn't there \nmore discussion about that when we know every dollar invested in a \nchild in Head Start saves $10 because they get that head start in life?\n  Where is the outrage of the 421,000 fewer HIV tests? This is a public \nhealth emergency when 421,000 people can't get their HIV test. They \ndon't know if they are HIV positive and could spread the virus. This is \nwhat is happening with this sequester.\n  There are 10,500 teacher positions lost and 2,700 will lose title I \nfunds, which amounts to 1 million children who will lose special \nreading help because of the sequester.\n  I think we all agree the sequester is no way to govern. We can get to \na balanced budget without a sequester. We did that under Bill Clinton. \nWe had a balanced approach. We made investments in our people, we cut \nout unnecessary spending, and we had a fair Tax Code.\n  I could go on with the problems. There are 25,000 fewer women who \nwill not receive breast cancer screening. I could offer an amendment on \nthat. I want to offer an amendment on that. I understand we need to \nkeep the government running, and that is what this continuing \nresolution does.\n  I praise the Republicans on the other side who crossed over to vote \nwith Democrats. Thank you very much for seeing we can't turn this bill \ninto everyone's favorite amendment to restore something which is cut \nbecause of the sequester, which none of us ever thought was going to \nmove forward.\n  I want to repeat this. My friend speaks about the FAA. I agree with \nhim. I hope he would agree with me on Head Start, on teachers, on title \nI, on HIV tests, and on breast cancer screenings. What about the $540 \nmillion which is cut from the Small Business Administration loan \nprogram which is so critical to our small businesses and job creation? \nThere are 600,000 children losing their nutrition assistance because of \nthe sequester.\n  Let's all agree. The sequester is bad, and we need to stop it. Why \nnot do it in the right way, which is to sit down with the President, \nensure we can get the deficit reduction the sequester is\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nbringing in in a better way. He is offering this. He is offering a \nbalanced plan. All of these cries about, oh, they are cutting this, \nthat, and the other--it is all bad. Sequester is not the way to budget \nor to govern.\n  We have 1 week to keep this government open. The House has told us \nnot to start a series of amendments or we are never going to be able to \nkeep the government open. Let's do our work and keep this as clean as \nwe can. Let's make sure we all listen to our President, who was \nreelected in a huge victory. He said he wanted to move us toward \nbalance with a balanced plan, cuts in spending, new revenues. Patty \nMurray's budget, the Democratic budget, does that.\n  I am very pleased we are moving toward keeping this government open. \nThis is the basic thing we need to do--keep this simple and move on.\n  As you know, I am the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. It is a joy for me to have that job, truly. My whole life I \nhave cared about environment and about infrastructure. The way the \nSenate works, they put those two together. Not only am I able to speak \nabout clean air, safe drinking water, cleaning up Superfund sites, and \nprotecting the health of our families, but I also get to talk about \njobs which are created when we build roads, highways, and water \nsystems.\n  There is something which does not bring us together on that \ncommittee, and that is the issue of climate change. What I have decided \nto do is come down to the floor every Monday possible when the floor is \navailable to speak a few minutes about the devastating consequences of \nunchecked climate disruption. I wish to discuss and put into the Record \nevery week the latest scientific information. On March 4 I began these \ntalks and spoke about a front-page story in USA Today which spotlights \nthe impacts of climate change unfolding around us. The story is the \nfirst in a year-long series called ``Why You Should Sweat Climate \nChange.'' It describes how climate disruption is happening all around \nus. Last week I discussed a report entitled ``The 2013 High Risk \nList,'' which was a GAO study, Government Accountability Office study, \nwhich said climate disruption is leading to intense weather events, \nsuch as Superstorm Sandy, which threaten, our Nation and the finances \nof our Nation. Plus, I told colleagues of an Oregon State study which \nappeared in Science which said that we have had the warmest decade in \nover 11,000 years--the warmest decade in over 11,000 years. Now, not 11 \nyears, not 1,100 years, but 11,000 years. So Earth to my Republican \ncolleagues, please wake up to this fact and let's do something about \nit.\n\n  Today I want to talk about the impact of unchecked climate change on \nthe health of our people. This is a statement made by Dr. Cecil \nWilson--and let's look at this chart--the former president of the AMA, \nthe American Medical Association:\n\n       The scientific evidence clearly indicates that our climate \n     is changing, air pollution is increasing, weather is becoming \n     more extreme, and with these changes come public health \n     consequences.\n\n  That is why our President made a finding there actually is a danger \nto public health. It is called an endangerment finding for a reason. It \nis putting our people in danger. Wake up, colleagues. Please, wake up \nbefore it is too late.\n  The fact is the Bush administration found--and we got this through \ndocumentation--that climate change was a threat. The CIA has found that \nclimate change is a threat. The defense establishment has found that \nclimate change is a threat. The only place that doesn't seem to get \nexcited about it is right here, in a bipartisan way, in the Senate.\n  Again, we know temperatures are continuing to increase. The Draft \nNational Climate Assessment of January 11, 2013, said this:\n\n       Heat caused by climate disruption is especially harmful to \n     our children.\n\n  Now I want to talk to colleagues who might just be listening. They \nmight not be because it is 7:20 at night, but if they are, you all say \nyou want to protect our kids. You all love your children and your \ngrandchildren and your nieces and your nephews. This is according to \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics Committee--and I think we have a \nchart on that:\n\n       Anticipated direct health consequences of climate change \n     include injury and death from extreme weather events and \n     natural disasters, increases in climate-sensitive infectious \n     diseases, increases in air pollution-related illness, and \n     more heat-related, potentially fatal illness. Within all of \n     these categories, children have increased vulnerability \n     compared with other groups.\n\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, if we were sent here to do anything, \nit is to protect the health and safety of our children, for goodness' \nsakes, and they are one of the most vulnerable groups if we don't act \non climate change. And if that doesn't move you, I say to my friends, \nwhat about the elderly? They are particularly vulnerable. This is from \nthe Draft National Climate Assessment.\n\n       Older people are at much higher risk of dying during \n     extreme heat events. Preexisting health conditions also make \n     the elderly susceptible to cardiac and respiratory impacts of \n     air pollution and to more severe consequences from infectious \n     diseases.\n\n  So if I didn't touch your heart with your kids and grandkids, how \nabout your grandmas, your grandpas, your great-grandmas, and your \ngreat-grandpas. They also are terribly vulnerable to the impacts of \nclimate change.\n  Laurence Kalkstein, a University of Miami professor, who studies the \neffects of heat on health, said:\n\n       Climate change is a silent killer. Heat can cause \n     fatalities among even the fittest.\n\n  It is a silent killer. And he knows because he studies the impact of \nheat on our health.\n  So let's not be silent. Maybe climate change is a silent killer, but \nwe can't be silent in the face of the information we have. Continuing \nto quote Laurence Kalkstein:\n\n       The warming planet can cause many other serious health \n     problems that are harmful to our families. Scientists predict \n     they will get worse.\n\n  Scientists believe it will only get worse. Listen to what they say:\n\n       Heatwaves are also associated with increased hospital \n     admissions for cardiovascular, kidney and respiratory \n     disorders. Extreme summer heat is increasing in the U.S., and \n     climate projections indicate that extreme heat events will be \n     much more frequent and intense in coming decades.\n\n  Is this the future we want for our people, increased hospital \nadmissions for cardiovascular, kidney, and respiratory disorders? I \nthink not. But, boy, part of me thinks so. I can't seem to get anybody \nexcited about this in the Senate.\n  You might ask me why that is? I have my theories. There is a lot of \npower on the other side. There is a lot of power on the other side--\npeople who don't want to move off coal, people who don't want to move \noff oil. There is a lot of power on the other side.\n  The increase in temperatures can lead to respiratory illnesses \nassociated with air pollution, such as asthma. Have you ever seen a \nchild with asthma gasping for breath? I say to my colleagues, asthma is \na leading cause of hospital admissions for kids at school. I go around \nand visit the schools, and I ask a simple question: How many of you \nkids have asthma or know someone with asthma? Almost 50 percent of the \nroom has hands up.\n  If you saw a child gasping for air on the street, you would hold them \nclose, you would calm them down, you would get them oxygen, you would \ndo everything in your power. You would call 9-1-1, you would take them \nto the hospital, you would sit by their side, you would hold their \nhand, you would nurse them back to health.\n  We have a situation, folks, where climate disruption is going to \nbring us more cases of asthma. Let's not stand with the giant \npolluters. Let's move to clean energy. Let's clean up our act and save \nour children, save our grandparents.\n  We are not talking about a remote possibility sometime in the near \nfuture. Climate disruption is here. It is happening before our eyes. \nMore American children are getting asthma and allergies, more seniors \nare suffering from heat strokes. And let me tell you about what is \nhappening in New York right now. They are seeing indications that \nextreme weather events such as Superstorm Sandy are linked to health \nproblems.\n  They have already given a name to a cough that has developed in that \npart of the country known locally as the\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\nRockaway cough because it is in Rockaway. The Rockaway Peninsula on \nLong Island, NY, was devastated by Sandy. Lives were lost, homes and \nbusinesses were destroyed, and now local residents are experiencing \nhealth problems from the flooding--coughing, which is a common symptom, \nhealth officials said, that could come from mold or the haze of dust \nand sand kicked up by the storm and demolitions. Governor Cuomo said \nthey are seeing these so-called 100-year storms--supposed to come once \nin 100 years--all the time.\n\n  I say to my colleagues: Wake up to the truth. Look out the window. \nFigure it out.\n  Look at this. Is this what we want to see in our country?\n  I was speaking to Senator Warren about what happened recently, and I \nwas shocked to see houses in Massachusetts on the beach, beautiful \nhomes, being totally razed and taken away because the ocean is moving \nso close they can't stay there. It is happening before our eyes. Right \nhere.\n  With the haze of dust and sand kicked up by the storm and \ndemolitions, the air in the Rockaways is so full of particles the \ntraffic police wear masks, though many recovery workers do not, and \nthat worries people who recall the fallout of another disaster.\n  Another real threat we are seeing more and more in the West is \nwildfires. Wildfire smoke contains dangerous compounds. Why do we see \nthis? The droughts that are coming. Smoke exposure increases \nrespiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations, emergency department \nvisits for asthma, bronchitis, chest pain, chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease, respiratory infections, and medical visits for lung \nillnesses, and has been associated with hundreds of thousands of global \ndeaths annually.\n  That is the bad news. Now, if I stopped here, I wouldn't sleep very \nwell tonight, having gone through all this. But there is good news. We \ncan take steps now to address climate change, and those steps will \nbenefit public health. We have an opportunity to turn this crisis into \na win-win situation. When we reduce carbon pollution from powerplants \nto address climate disruption, we reduce dangerous air pollutants, such \nas soot and toxic metals that are harmful to our health.\n  Here is a chart: Policies and other strategies intended to reduce \ncarbon pollution and mitigate climate change can often have independent \ninfluences on human health. For example, when you reduce carbon \nemissions, you reduce air pollutants, such as particles and sulfur \ndioxides.\n  We call that cobenefits, Mr. President. When you go after one kind of \npollution--carbon pollution--you get the cobenefits of going after the \nsoot, the small particles that lodge in our lungs. So we know when we \nreduce carbon emissions, we reduce those small particles and sulfur \ndioxide.\n  Here is the other good news. As we move away from the very dirty \npower sources of, what I hope will be, the past, and we move toward \nclean energy, we help our families' budgets because we move away from \npolluting automobiles. I drive a hybrid, a plug-in hybrid car. I have \nto tell you, it is pretty amazing. I get the first 12 miles on \nelectricity, and if I do a few chores and come home and plug the car in \nagain, then when I go past the 12 miles, it goes to a hybrid, which is \npart gas, part electric. So overall I am getting about 150 miles to the \ngallon. You know what. That feels pretty good when you don't have to \nstop and fill up your car all the time and get the sweats because of \nwhat it costs to fill up that car.\n  President Obama and my colleague Senator Feinstein, and my former \ncolleague Senator Snowe, I have to compliment them because in a \nbipartisan way they moved us toward fuel efficiency. So we are moving \ntoward 50-miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency, and that will help us. But \nwe have to do more.\n  We have to do more because the health costs associated with climate \nchange are heartbreaking and expensive. Taking steps to reduce carbon \npollution will lower our doctors' bills when we don't have kids \nwheezing and gasping for air. The evidence is clear: Climate change is \na public health threat.\n  We have moved before when we have seen threats to public health. We \ndid it on cigarettes. I was here when the Congress voted to ban smoking \non airplanes. Let me tell you, that was a hard vote. We had all the \nmoney of the cigarette and tobacco companies against us. And I want to \ncompliment Senators Lautenberg and Durbin. Senator Durbin was in the \nHouse. This was a long time ago, but I can tell you what it was like \nbecause I do so much travel across the country.\n  Mr. President, I would get off the plane where there was smoking, and \nI would reek of smoke. You felt it all over, and you certainly were \nbreathing it in. It was unhealthy. Everyone said it would never happen; \nthat we would never, ever ban smoking on the airlines. But guess what. \nWe did the right thing.\n  Now some people say: Well, how do you know that human activity and \nthe kinds of power we are using, the dirty oil and so on, the coal, is \ncausing this? Let me tell you how I know. Because 98 percent of the \nscientists tell me so.\n  People say, what if they are wrong. Ninety-eight percent of the \nscientists agree that human activity is causing this climate \ndisruption. If you stand with the 2 percent, you are standing with the \n2 percent who said smoking never caused lung cancer. I would say, if we \nwent to the doctor and the doctor looked at us and said there is a 98-\npercent chance if you don't change your eating habits or your smoking \nhabits you are going to die an early death, you would say, 98 percent \nchance? OK, I will change my ways. Well, 98 percent of the scientists \nare telling us to change our ways when it comes to carbon pollution.\n  How do we do that in a way that is smart? We have several bills to \nput a price on carbon. We have the Sanders-Boxer bill. We have the \nWhitehouse bill. There will be other bills. Once we put a price on \ncarbon, it makes sense because we are factoring in the true cost of \ncarbon pollution, which I just explained is enormous in public health \nalone and economics related to superstorms and the rest.\n  So we need to put a price on carbon. What Bernie Sanders and I do is \nwe take the funds that come in from that and we give it right back to \nthe people and say: Here is a check, and now you can pay for your new \nclean energy. It is kind of capping the carbon and giving a dividend to \nthe people. With the rest of the money we lower the deficit, we invest \nin solar rooftops, and a little bit in solar transportation. It is the \nway to go.\n  Some say wait. We can't wait. We wasted 8 long years when George W. \nBush was President. Do you know why? He said carbon pollution wasn't \ncovered in the Clean Air Act. All one had to do was read the Clean Air \nAct. I am not an attorney, but it is right there. It says, in essence, \nhere are the following pollutants that are covered, and it listed \ngreenhouse gas emissions. But, oh, no. He took it all the way to the \nSupreme Court and wasted 8 long years while the problem got worse and \nworse.\n  So here is the deal. Here is a quote from Washington School of Public \nHealth, University of Washington, Dr. Howard Frumkin, who says:\n\n       In public health, when faced with threats to entire \n     populations, we act. For infectious diseases, we vaccinate.\n\n  If 98 percent of the doctors say vaccinate to prevent illness, there \nis always 2 percent who are going to say don't do it. But we go with 98 \npercent.\n\n       For lung cancer, we ban smoking.\n\n  We didn't stand with the doctors who were paid off by big tobacco. We \nstood with the doctors who had an independent judgment, and we banned \nsmoking on airplanes and in close quarters and in the Senate cloakroom \nand all the other places in government buildings.\n\n       For injuries, we install seat belts and air bags.\n\n  Another big battle. Remember that battle? The auto companies said: We \ndon't want to spend the money installing airbags or seatbelts. We said: \nYou have to do it. You know what. It is worth the cost, and so many \nlives are saved.\n\n       For obesity, we promote physical activity and healthier \n     eating.\n\n  The First Lady has taken this on as a cause and we are starting to \nsee a change. We have a long way to go. Why do that? Because we know \nthe connection between obesity and diabetes and heart disease and \nstroke. So even\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\nthough it is a difficult issue, we have tackled it.\n\n       For climate change, we need to act.\n\n  We surely do. I am talking to pretty much an empty Chamber, but I am \nglad the Presiding Officer is here, and I feel a few people are \nwatching. It is good. But there are a few of us who are determined to \nkeep on bringing the facts to the floor of the Senate. Everyone has the \nright to act or not act, but I believe we need to make the record now, \nbecause when my grandchildren grow up, I want them to look back and \nsay: Wow. That was great what grandma's generation did. They took care \nof this issue. I don't want them to look back and say: What were they \nthinking? What was wrong with them? Why didn't they act when they could \nhave made a difference?\n  So next week I will be back. I will be talking about national \nsecurity threats. This is one of the biggest national security threats \nwe face. That doesn't come from me. That comes from the Pentagon. It \ncomes from the CIA. It comes from the national security teams. So we \ncan just close our eyes to this and we can wish it goes away, but it is \nnot going away or we can ease the pain of climate disruption by moving \nto clean energy, energy efficiency, and we will face a win-win as we \neventually have better public health, save money, and save the planet.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I come to the floor today \nin strong opposition to Amendment No. 115, offered by the junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, to strike funding for the Department of \nDefense's, DoD, Advanced Drop-In Biofuel Production.\n  The intent of this amendment is to further limit the Department of \nDefense's ability to use alternative fuels to enhance our country's \nnational security. Under the authorities of the Defense Production Act, \nDPA, the Department of Defense has created the Advanced Drop-In \nBiofuels Production Project. This initiative is focused on creating a \npublic-private partnership that will provide incentives for private-\nsector investment in cost competitive, advanced biofuels production \ncapability. It also requires at least a one-to-one cost share with \nprivate stakeholders. During consideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act of 2013, the Senate demonstrated bipartisan support \nfor DoD's alternative energy initiatives. This amendment would prevent \nDoD from taking the necessary steps to diversify its energy supply.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the \nDPA, I believe it is misguided to limit the authority of the Defense \nDepartment to continue with this project. As one of the largest \nconsumers of oil in the world, the Department of Defense spent $17 \nbillion in fiscal year 2011 on petroleum-based fuels. When oil prices \nspike, this dependency forces the Department of Defense to reallocate \nfunding from other critical needs. Last year alone, spikes in oil \nprices required the Navy to pay an additional $500 million on higher \nfuel costs. Amendment No. 115 will further increase DoD's vulnerability \nto fluctuations in the price of oil.\n  This amendment should also be opposed because if it were adopted it \nwould not have the effect intended. Due to a technical drafting error \nthis amendment would not strip money from the account that funds \nbiofuel production, but rather other unrelated programs at the DoD. The \namendment still scores in outlays per the Congressional Budget Office \nand is subject to a budget point of order. This technical drafting \nerror is another reason for Members to oppose this amendment.\n  The renewable fuels industry has played an important role in \naddressing our energy needs. Unfortunately, this amendment would hinder \nour Nation's ability to promote renewable domestic energy sources. We \nshould allow the Defense Department to retain its authority to take \nsteps to diversify the energy sources available to our military. Our \nnational security relies on energy security, and this amendment would \nweaken both.\n  I urge all my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1887-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

They are in my \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1887-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1887-S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE IAWP AND DICK FREEMAN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nInternational Association of Workforce Professionals, IAWP, for a \ncentury of leadership in enhancing the professionalism and excellence \nof America's workforce systems. IAWP will have a special celebration of \nthis centennial milestone during its annual International Educational \nConference in Chicago from July 6 to 10. IAWP was founded in Chicago \nand also celebrated its 50th and 75th anniversaries in that great \nMidwestern city. The association will honor its founder, W.M. \nLeiserson, superintendent of Wisconsin Employment Offices. In 1913, he \nreached out to his counterparts in other States to organize a \nnationwide association of public employment offices. Since its \nfounding, IAWP has consistently worked to advance its founding \nprinciples: to provide members with education, leadership \nopportunities, information exchange, and recognition of excellence. In \nparticular I would also like to applaud one of my constituents, Dick \nFreeman, who is receiving a much deserved Lifetime Achievement Award \nfrom IAWP at its July conference.\n  Dick has been a member of the Iowa chapter of IAWP for 41 years, \nincluding serving as the Iowa legislative chair since 1985. He has \nreceived the Iowa I-Care Award numerous times during his tenure of more \nthan four decades with the association. This award is given for \nprofessionals who perform above and beyond normal leadership duties.\n  Dick played an important role in planning and hosting IAWP's 1990 \nInternational Educational Conference in Des Moines. He was the deputy \ndirector of the Iowa chapter when it chose to compete to host that \nyear's International Education Conference. Iowa won the bid thanks to \nDick's initiative and persistence. Approximately 1,200 IAWP members \nattended the 1990 conference in Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to recognize Dick Freeman for his \nmany decades of dedicated service to IAWP members in Iowa and all \nacross the Nation. Again, I congratulate the International Association \nof Workforce Professionals for 100 years of service to America's \nworkers.\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1888-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            UNREST IN TIBET\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about the \ncontinuing unrest in Tibet and the tragic trend of Tibetan self-\nimmolations. Since February 2009, more than 100 Tibetans have set \nthemselves on fire. Many of the self-immolators have called out for the \nreturn of the Dalai Lama to Tibet and for China to acknowledge the \nbasic human dignity of the Tibetan people.\n  Like so many others, I wish that Tibetans would not choose self-\nimmolations, a horrific act, as a method of protest. I hope Tibetans \nwill find other ways to express their grievances and despair and halt \nthese self-destructive acts. At the same time, we must understand that \nthese sorts of acts are indicative of the deep sense of frustration \nfelt by the Tibetan people. This is not a conspiracy of ``foreign \nforces'' but indicative of the deep sense of hopelessness of a people \ndenied their basic dignity.\n  Under the Chinese Constitution, ``All ethnic groups in the People's \nRepublic of China are equal. The state protects the lawful rights and \ninterests of the minority nationalities and upholds and develops the \nrelationship of equality, unity and mutual assistance among all of \nChina's nationalities. Discrimination against and oppression of any \nnationality are prohibited. . . .''\n  Yet Tibet today is one of the most repressed and closed societies in \nthe world, where merely talking on the phone can land you in jail. \nSupport for the Dalai Lama can be prosecuted as an offense against the \nState. Tibetans are treated as second class citizens; their travel \nwithin and outside of Tibetan areas is highly restricted. Foreign \ndiplomats and journalists are routinely denied access.\n  The American people and Congress have demonstrated an abiding \ninterest in the culture, religion, and people of Tibet, as well as a \ndeep respect for His Holiness the Dalai Lama. We see Tibet as an issue \nof fundamental justice and fairness, where the fundamental human rights \nof the Tibetan people, as embodied in the PRC's own constitution, are \nnot being respected; where their culture is being eroded; and where \ntheir land is being exploited.\n  So I believe that responsibility falls to us to help the Tibetan \npeople in their efforts to preserve their culture and identity and have \na say in their own affairs and to be able to exercise genuine autonomy \nwithin the PRC.\n  Let me offer some thoughts on how Congress can help.\n  First, we should continue to fund the important programs that help \nTibetan communities, both in exile and on the Tibetan plateau. While \nthese provide tangible humanitarian results, they also send a critical \nsignal to the aggrieved Tibetan population that the United States hears \ntheir plea.\n  One measure with which I am familiar is the Tibetan language \nbroadcasts of Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America. I cannot \noverstate the importance of these efforts to provide perhaps the only \nindependent source of news to Tibetans who struggle under the heavy \ncensorship regime.\n  Second, we should embrace the statement last fall by U.N. Human \nRights Commissioner Navi Pillay on Tibet. She stated that ``social \nstability in Tibet will never be achieved through heavy security \nmeasures and suppression of human rights.'' She called on Chinese \nauthorities to adopt the recommendations of various U.N. bodies and to \nallow access to Tibet by independent international observers and media \nmembers, noting 12 outstanding requests for official visits to China by \nU.N. Special Rapporteurs on various human rights issues.\n  Third, the State Department should continue to insist on access to \nTibet by its personnel. We need independent and credible reporting on \nthe true situation on the ground, and the Department should work with \nChina to take steps to see that the principle of reciprocity is \nrespected.\n  Fourth, I encourage the State Department and other government \nagencies to join in dialogue with China and with others in the region \nto address the deeper strategic aspects of the Tibet issue. Instability \nin Tibet is a factor in the broader question of social stability in the \nentire PRC. Peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue could go a long way \nin demonstrating to the world that China is indeed a responsible and \nconstructive member of the community of nations. In turn, Beijing's \ngrowing influence in the Himalayan belt, especially Nepal, should be \nassessed in a broader dialogue with other nations in the region.\n  Likewise, the United States should look for constructive ways to \nengage China on the issue of water security, given that Tibet's rivers \nprovide the livelihood for hundreds of millions of people downstream in \nSouth and Southeast Asia. Chinese diversion of these rivers through \nconstructing dams could become a source of conflict in the region.\n  Mr. President, I close by paraphrasing an oft-uttered phrase by the \nDalai Lama. He says that those who raise their voices of concern for \nTibet do so not because they are pro-Tibet or anti-Chinese. They do so \nbecause they are pro-justice. I second this remark and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate, and with China, to promote a \ndurable resolution to the Tibet problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1888-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1888-S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING MITCH SEAVEY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the winner of \nthe 41st Iditarod race. Mitch Seavey of Seward finished the 998-mile \ndog sled race in a time of 9 days, 7 hours, 39 minutes, and 56 seconds. \nThis is Mitch's second title and I am happy to congratulate him on this \nsignificant accomplishment.\n  Sixty-six teams left this year from Willow, heading out into the \ndark, cold, and exceptionally rugged terrain of Alaska. This race is \nnot for the weak. Temperatures can plummet, footing is not always \nsolid, and mushers have to deal with the isolation of the Alaskan \nwilderness, leading an equally brave and athletic team of canine \nathletes.\n  Iditarod mushers are not the only people to have witnessed the great \nability of sled dogs. American soldiers overseas are now benefiting \nfrom the training these canines endure. The U.S. Marine Corps recently \ndecided to study the training regimen of sled dogs that are able to \nconsistently run 1,000-mile races through hazardous conditions. What \nthey observed is what we in the Iditarod community have become \naccustomed to in sled dog racing--train to the level in which you need \nto perform. For Iditarod dogs this means training in weather conditions \nthey will encounter during an Alaskan winter and eating up to 12,000 \ncalories a day. Exercise and nutrition techniques were transferred from \nthe Iditarod trail across the world to the deserts of Afghanistan. \nBomb-sniffing dogs working in conditions just as extreme, sometimes in \nheat well in excess of 100 degrees, are now saving lives and limbs \nevery day thanks to the science and innovative techniques developed in \nour great race. A group of those canines, led by Tanner, a 6-year-old \nhusky, trained their way into peak physical condition and onto the \nwinning podium in Nome.\n  The Iditarod race exemplifies the greatest assets of my home State: \nvast nature and beauty, the greatest will and determination in the \ncountry, and most of all a sense of community. Those qualities are \nexemplified in this year's winner, Mitch Seavey.\n  This title makes Mitch the oldest Iditarod winner ever. It is only \nfitting that Mitch crossed the burled arch on Front Street in Nome a \nchampion, a year after his son Dallas claimed the title and became the \nyoungest winner in Iditarod history. Back-to-back Seavey family \nchampionships lead me to believe that there must be some \ncharacteristics of this family that give them an advantage in the \nworld's toughest race.\n  Mitch Seavey's inspiring run this year was a testament to his \nathleticism, tenacity, and character. Mitch recaptured his title in \ndramatic fashion. His lead coming out of White Mountain, starting a \nsprint to Nome, was only 13 minutes. He thought he could see the dim \nlight of his competitor's headlamp coming up behind his team and he \nreached another gear. Late Tuesday night Mitch crossed the finish line, \nclaiming his second title, the first since his 2004 championship run. \nThis was one of the closest Iditarod finishes ever. Mitch even joked \ncoming out of White Mountain that he was going to grab his sneakers for \nthe finish. In the heat of competition Mitch kept his sense of humor \nand\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nnow he has kept the Iditarod championship in the family for another \nyear.\n  Mitch Seavey may have claimed the Iditarod title in Nome, but getting \nto that point takes preparation and training that begins months if not \nyears in advance. I would like to congratulate Mitch for all of his \nhard work and for claiming his second Iditarod title.\n  I would also like to thank the Iditarod trail team, the many \nvolunteers who came from around the country, the veterinarians, the \nIditarod Air Force, and everyone else who has worked to ensure the \nsafety and maintenance of the Iditarod trail and the safety of the \ndedicated athletes and canines that welcome the challenge. Their \nefforts are often underrated, but their commitment is resolute. My \nprayers go out to the families of Carolyn and Rosemarie Sorvoja, and \npilot Ted Smith, who lost their lives in a tragic plane crash as they \nmade their way to the eighth check point of Takotna. They had traveled \nhundreds of miles from the Anchorage area, in hopes of volunteering on \nthe trail. Every volunteer knows the risks associated with their \nefforts to ensure the safety of others and the success of the Iditarod, \nbut I am surprised each year at how many line up to serve in the face \nof rugged and extreme Alaskan conditions. This is now a time to \nremember and honor their efforts, and congratulate Mitch Seavey.\n  I am proud to congratulate the Seavey team on this amazing \naccomplishment and historic milestone. I send my best wishes to Mitch \nand the whole Seavey family as they celebrate this well-deserved \nvictory in Alaska's great race.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1889-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      ASCENT OF DENALI CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \ncentennial anniversary of the first successful ascent of the south peak \nof Mount McKinley. In Alaska, the mountain is popularly known as \nDenali, which means the ``Great One'' in Dena'ina language. At 20,320 \nfeet, the south peak is the tallest of its two peaks, and makes Mount \nMcKinley North America's tallest mountain.\n  Although other climbers attempted the climb or claimed to have \nsummited McKinley before 1913, Walter Harper, Hudson Stuck, Robert \nTatum, and Harry Karstens were the first to complete their journey to \nthe top. Among the party, it was Harper, an Athabascan, who was the \nfirst to stand on the south summit after a month-long expedition that \nstarted with a mush from Fairbanks by a dog team.\n  The unsung hero of this accomplishment was another Alaska Native, 16-\nyear-old John Fredson, who travelled with the group and cared for the \nsled dogs at base camp while waiting for the climbing team to return. \nThis story of triumph and courage underscores the importance of Alaska \nNatives in the great age of American exploration.\n  To commemorate the centennial, the Denali 2013 Centennial Climb has \nbeen organized. The official party's ascent will commence June 7, 2013, \nand includes ancestors of the original team: Dana Wright of Fairbanks, \nthe great-grandnephew of Harper; Dan Hopkins, from Ottawa, Ontario, who \nis the great-great-nephew of Stuck; Ken Karstens, from Colorado; and \nRay Schuenemann, from Dallas, Texas, both of whom are great-grandsons \nof Karstens.\n  Stuck was a missionary for the Episcopal Church and Archdeacon of the \nYukon back in 1913. Stuck had hoped to celebrate communion atop the \npeak. As part of the recreation of the historic ascent, Mark Lattime, \nthe Episcopal Bishop of Alaska and Reverend at St. Matthew's Episcopal \nChurch in Fairbanks, will join the climbing party and celebrate \ncommunion at the peak.\n  The spirit of adventure is something that we embrace as Alaskans and \nAmericans. Let us take this moment to acknowledge this significant \nachievement of our predecessors and wish the 2013 party a safe and \nsuccessful climb.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1889-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO COLONEL MARK E. WEATHERINGTON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize and congratulate the service of Col. Mark E. Weatherington, \nwho will be ending his command at Ellsworth Air Force Base in early \nApril.\n  An Air Force Academy graduate, Colonel Weatherington has served in \nmany leadership and flying positions over his impressive 23-year \ncareer. He is a B-1 pilot with 2,400 flight hours. Among his many \nassignments, Colonel Weatherington has served as commander of the 28th \nBomb Wing at both Ellsworth AFB and Dyess AFB; served as chief of staff \nof the Air Force Fellow; was a National Defense Fellow with the \nBrookings Institution; and previously served at Ellsworth AFB as chief \nof weapons and tactics and then assistant operations officer of the \n77th Bomb Squadron and wing weapons officer of the 28th Operations \nSupport Squadron.\n  Colonel Weatherington has served as commander of the 28th Bomb Wing, \nEllsworth Air Force Base, the largest B-1 combat wing in the U.S. Air \nForce, since May 2011. He has distinguished himself during his 2-year \nstint at the South Dakota installation. He has provided expert guidance \nduring the process to bring the first MQ-9 Reaper squadron, the 432nd \nAttack Squadron, to Ellsworth Air Force Base, while maintaining the \ngreat legacy of the B-1 aircraft and the personnel of the 28th Bomb \nWing. Last year, Colonel Weatherington presided over Ellsworth Air \nForce Base's 70th Anniversary festivities.\n  Colonel Weatherington's current stint at Ellsworth Air Force Base has \nlasted just shy of 2 years, but he has provided a lasting impact, \noverseeing 4,300 military and civilian personnel in the day-to-day \noperations of the base, as well as the ongoing rotation of airmen to \noverseas action in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He has \nmaintained a strong relationship between the Base and Black Hills \ncommunities, namely Rapid City and Box Elder. For decades there has \nbeen a very warm and cordial relationship between Black Hills \nresidents, businesses, and charitable organizations and the personnel \nand leadership command of Ellsworth Air Force Base. Colonel \nWeatherington has been committed to maintaining this bond. The \nrelationship between the civilian and military communities remains very \nstrong, and this relationship continues to make the Black Hills a great \nretirement option for military retirees who once served at Ellsworth \nAir Force Base.\n  Colonel Weatherington will now move to the Pentagon where he will \nserve as Military Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Dr. \nAshton Carter. This role will bring new challenges and \nresponsibilities, but I know the leadership, professionalism, and \nstewardship Colonel Weatherington showed during his time at Ellsworth \nAir Force Base will serve him well at the Pentagon and throughout his \ncareer. I commend Colonel Weatherington for his service to Ellsworth \nAir Force Base and his continued service to the U.S. Air Force. I wish \nhim, Stephanie, and their family all the best in future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1889-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1889-S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WEST VIRGINIA HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 74\n\n Mr. MANCHIN.

He is the longest tenured \nmember of the National Democratic Club, and founder of both the 116 \nClub and the prestigious Georgetown Club.\n  According to his colleagues, Mr. Friedman is also a veteran who \nserved this country in the Korean War and lived in Africa for almost 15 \nyears. Mr. Friedman was present during a number of movements within the \nregion; including the civil war in Mozambique and the dismantling of \nSouth African apartheid.\n  I am informed that Mr. Friedman served his country abroad by \ninvesting millions in the country of Mozambique with hopes of spreading \nAmerican style capitalism and creating hundreds of jobs.\n  Further, I am told that Mr. Friedman was inspired by Mozambique \nPresident Joaquim Chissano, which led to his relocation to Mozambique. \nAt the time, Mozambique was in midst of a bloody civil war. Even so, \nMr. Friedman assisted the newly appointed Presi-\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\ndent to develop relationships with western nations.\n  Mr. Friedman has said that he invested millions of dollars to promote \nfree enterprise in Mozambique. Accordingly, I am told that Mr. Friedman \nestablished the first direct foreign investment with Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation insurance in the country of Mozambique.\n  Mr. Friedman continued investing in the country until Mozambique held \nits first multi-party elections and, as a result, Joaquim Chissano was \nelected President of the Republic of Mozambique.\n  As a U.S. Senator, it is such an honor to serve the great people of \nWest Virginia and to bring attention to their special efforts. I always \nsay that the people of West Virginia are some of the most patriotic in \nthe country.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n             State of West Virginia, Legislative Resolution\n\n\n                   HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 74\n\n       [By Delegates Canterbury, Armstead, T.

JULIAN DAVIDSON\n\n As a huge crowd gathered on February 4, 2013, at the memorial \nservice for my good friend, Dr. Julian Davidson of Huntsville, AL, in \nthe magnificent Davidson Center for Space Exploration that bears his \nname, beside the Saturn V rocket, I had to take a moment to consider \nits power and the impact its development made on the world. Our space \nprogram is the world's greatest technological achievement.\n  Less appreciated is the monumental technological achievement of our \nNation's National Missile Defense System along with all the other \nshorter range missile systems that now protect the Nation from attack \nand accidental launch. Sixteen years ago, campaigning, I would ask \npeople what we would do if a nuclear missile were launched at us. \nUsually, someone would say we would shoot it down. That is the correct \nanswer today, but not then. No such system had then been deployed but \npeople were working on it.\n  Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson wrote a book, Present at the \nCreation, about the creation of our long lasting foreign policy \nframework. My friend, Dr. Julian Davidson, was present and creating at \nthe creation of our colossal, highly technical and effective global \nmissile defense system. It is accurate to call him the ``father of \nmissile defense.'' And, like a good father, he nurtured the program to \nmaturity for 50 years. As an Army Civilian and as a business \nprofessional, he was a constant and leading force for this amazing \naccomplishment. Launch vehicles in Alaska and California, radar \ndetection systems worldwide, and incredibly complex computer systems \nallow this Nation to identify, track, and hit to kill a hostile or \naccidental missile aimed to damage our Nation.\n  People doubted it would work, mocked it as Star Wars, but the \npolitical center held and aided by the scientific and political skills \nof Julian and others the system is now in place. Trust me--it was a \nnear run thing. Since Ronald Reagan, it has remained a sore spot for \nVlademir Putin and a major strategic development.\n  This modest, unassuming, gentle but brilliant, strong and determined \nman carried the day. And, blessedly, he could take pride and \nsatisfaction in actually seeing it proven and deployed. This was a \ntruly historic achievement.\n  As a new Senator, elected in 1996, I was aware of Julian's importance \nto Huntsville and national defense. But as the years passed, I came to \nunderstand more about his remarkable career and why he was so loved and \nrespected. For me, and for so many, his importance transcends the \nleadership he has provided to science and technology, to our Nation's \nbeing dominant in the world in missile defense technology and systems, \nand to our national security--it is personal. He touched so many lives \nin positive and important ways. My respect for his knowledge, his \nunbiased, sound insight, just continued to grow. I was in awe of this \nsmall man who had done so much, knew so much, and who was so admired in \nthe Defense Department, the defense industry, and in Huntsville. I was \nhonored that he became a true friend and he gave me his time and \ninsight as he did for so many others.\n  Last year, I talked with Admiral Syring about his appointment to be \nthe new MDA Commander, the agency Julian first directed. When I met \nwith Admiral Syring, I asked that he do only one thing. I asked him to \nhave a good visit with Julian and promised him he would enjoy and \nbenefit from it. Admiral later said they had a wonderful afternoon.\n  Now, Julian did love politics and there was an unusual purity about \nhis politics. It was an extension of his love for America, I think. \nFirst and foremost, Julian was a patriot. He was passionately committed \nto classical American values.\n  Julian felt that his country had been good to him, that it was a \npositive force in the world, and that it required civic support and \ndirection. He was always there to give that support and direction.\n  Julian was proud of Davidson Technologies and the 200 engineers and \npeople who worked with him there. He made it a premier missile \ntechnology and systems engineering firm in a very short time. His main \ngoal was for the company to meet and exceed contract requirements, to \nbe successful, and, importantly, so his people could prosper and be \nfulfilled and do their work with integrity. He was very proud that he \nhad created a work environment second to none in Huntsville. The \ncompany was good to him and he was grateful.\n  Julian was exceedingly generous to Huntsville, the place he called \nhome. The Davidson Center for Space Exploration is a dramatic example \nof that generosity. He and Dorothy were also great friends of the \narts--making major gifts to the Davidson Center for the Arts, the \nHuntsville Symphony, the Child Advocacy Center and many other good \ncauses. Their long and true partnership was exceedingly important in \nbusiness and civic affairs. Extremely talented in her own right, \nDorothy loved and admired Julian as he did her. This bond was a key to \nhis success.\n  Dr. Deborah Barnhart, CEO of the Space and Rocket Center said, \n``Dorothy and Julian Davidson are renaissance people who care \npassionately about the advancement of technology, the arts, and the \nHuntsville community.'' Truly so.\n  So, the gentle, humble man from Oakman, Walker County, AL, son of a \nstore owner, went forth and accomplished great things. And he did it \nwithout bluster, without ego, and without selfishness. He did it with \nskill, hard work, good judgment, honest dealing and respect for his \nfellow man. He did it all with a full dose of that critical quality--\nintegrity. He believed in work. He was blessed to continue his \nproductive work until his last days.\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n  We live in a magnificent universe, ordered by providence--too \nwondrous to relate. To an unusual degree, Julian Davidson was given the \nability and will to develop complex systems that utilize the rules of \nthe natural world to make our lives better and to actually control the \nmissiles that protect us from attack, even a nuclear attack.\n  It is important for the Nation to celebrate Julian's marvelous life \nand accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1891-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT DATED MARCH 2013 WITH THE ANNUAL \n REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR 2013, RECEIVED DURING \n           ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON MARCH 15, 2013--PM 6\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport, which was referred to the Joint Economic Committee:\n\n     To the Congress of the United States:\n  This year's Economic Report of the President describes the progress \nwe have made recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great \nDepression. After years of grueling recession, our businesses have \ncreated over six million new jobs. As a nation, we now buy more \nAmerican cars than we have in 5 years, and less foreign oil than we \nhave in 20 years. Our housing market is healing, and consumers, \npatients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.\n  But there are still millions of Americans whose hard work and \ndedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is adding jobs, but \ntoo many of our fellow citizens still can't find full-time employment. \nCorporate profits have reached all-time highs, but for more than a \ndecade, wages and incomes for working Americans have barely budged.\n  Our top priority must be to do everything we can to grow our economy \nand create good, middle-class jobs. That has to be our North Star. That \nhas to drive every decision we make in Washington. Every day, we should \nask ourselves three questions: How do we attract more jobs to our \nshores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those \njobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?\n  We can begin by making America a magnet for new jobs and \nmanufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than a decade, our \nmanufacturers have added about half a million new jobs over the past 3 \nyears. We need to accelerate that trend, by launching more \nmanufacturing hubs that transform hard-hit regions of the country into \nglobal centers of high-tech jobs and manufacturing. We need to make our \ntax code more competitive, by ending tax breaks for companies that ship \njobs overseas, and rewarding companies that create jobs here at home. \nAnd we need to invest in the research and technology that will allow us \nto harness more of our own energy and put more people back to work \nrepairing our crumbling roads and bridges.\n  These steps will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand \nand create new jobs. But we also need to provide every American with \nthe skills and training they need to fill those jobs. We should start \nin the earliest years by offering high-quality preschool to every child \nin America, because we know kids in programs like these do better \nthroughout their academic lives. We should redesign America's high \nschools to better prepare our students with skills that employers are \nlooking for right now. And because taxpayers can't continue subsidizing \nthe soaring cost of higher education, we should take affordability and \nvalue into account when determining which colleges receive certain \ntypes of Federal aid.\n  We also need to reward hard work and declare that no one who works \nfull-time should have to live in poverty by raising the minimum wage so \nthat it's a wage you can live on. And it's time to harness the talents \nand ingenuity of hardworking immigrants by finally passing commonsense \nimmigration reform--continuing to strengthen border security, holding \nemployers accountable, establishing a responsible path to earned \ncitizenship, reuniting families, and attracting the highly-skilled \nentrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists that will help create jobs.\n  As we continue to grow our economy, we must also take further action \nto shrink our deficits. We don't have to choose between these two \nimportant priorities--we just have to make smart choices.\n  Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce \nthe deficit by more than $2.5 trillion, which puts us more than halfway \ntowards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists \nsay we need to stabilize our finances. Now we need to finish the job. \nBut we shouldn't do it by making harsh and arbitrary cuts that \njeopardize our military readiness, devastate priorities like education \nand energy, and cost jobs. That's not how you grow the economy. We \nshouldn't ask senior citizens and working families to pay down the rest \nof our deficit while the wealthiest are asked for nothing more. That \ndoesn't grow our middle class.\n  Most Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--understand \nthat we can't just cut our way to prosperity. That's why I have put \nforward a balanced approach to deficit reduction that makes responsible \nreforms to bring down the cost of health care for an aging generation--\nthe single biggest driver of our long-term debt--and saves hundreds of \nbillions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for \nthe well-off and well-connected. And we should finally pursue \nbipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and \nhelps bring down the deficit.\n  The American people don't expect their government to solve every \nproblem. They don't expect those of us in Washington to agree on every \nissue. But they do expect us to put the Nation's interests before party \ninterests. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we \ncan. Our work will not be easy. But America only moves forward when we \ndo so together--when we accept certain obligations to one another and \nto future generations. That's the American story. And that's how we \nwill write the next great chapter--together.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/18/senate-section/article/S1891-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:41 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 803.

A bill for the relief of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Olivia \nGonzalez Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, his wife, Oliva \nGonzalez Gonzalez, and their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez, Jr. The Rojas \nfamily, originally from Mexico, is living in the San Jose area of \nCalifornia.\n  The story of the Rojas family is compelling, and I believe they merit \nCongress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Jorge and his wife, Oliva, originally came to the United States in \n1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr. was just 2 years old. In 1995, \nthey left the country to attend a funeral, and then re-entered the \nUnited States on visitor's visas.\n  The family has since expanded to include two sons, Alexis Rojas, now \n20 years old, Matias, now 3 years old, a daughter Tania Rojas, now age \n18, and a granddaughter, Mina Rojas, who is 3 years old.\n  The Rojas family first attempted to legalize their status in the \nUnited States when an unscrupulous immigration consultant, who was not \nan attorney, advised them to apply for asylum. Unfortunately, without \nproper legal guidance, this family did not realize at the time that \nthey lacked a valid basis for asylum. The asylum claim was denied in \n2008, leaving the Rojas family with no further options to legalize \ntheir status.\n  Since their arrival in the United States more than 20 years ago, the \nRojas family has demonstrated a robust work ethic and a strong \ncommitment to their community in California. They have paid their taxes \nand worked hard to contribute to this country.\n  Jorge is a hard-working individual who has been employed by Valley \nCrest Landscape Maintenance in San Jose, California, for the past 16 \nyears. Currently, he works on commercial landscaping projects. Jorge is \nwell-respected by his supervisor and his peers.\n  In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time \nto provide modern green landscaping and building projects at his \nchildren's school in California. He is active in his neighborhood \nassociation, where he worked with his neighbors to open a library and \ncommunity center in their community.\n  Oliva, in addition to raising her three children, has also been very \nactive in the local community. She volunteers with the People Acting in \nCommunity Together, PACT, organization, where she works to prevent \ncrime, gangs and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and schools.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the Rojas \nfamily to remain in the United States is the impact that their \ndeportation would have on their four children. Three of the Rojas \nchildren, Alexis, Tanya, and Matias are American citizens. Jorge Rojas, \nJr. has lived in the United States since he was a toddler.\n  For Alexis, Tanya, Matias and Jorge Jr., this country is the only \ncountry they really know. Jorge Rojas, Jr., who entered the United \nStates as an infant with his parents, recently became a father. He is \nnow 24 years old and working at a job that allows him to support his \ndaughter, Mina. Jorge Jr. graduated from Del Mar High School in 2007.\n  Alexis, age 20, graduated from Del Mar High School and is now a \nstudent at West Valley College in Saratoga, California. He is \ninterested in studying linguistics. Tania, age 18, recently graduated \nfrom Del Mar High School and is in her first year at West Valley \nCollege. Their teachers describe them as ``fantastic, wonderful and \ngifted'' students.\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear.\n  When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters from \nthe community in Northern California in support of this family. \nEnactment of this private bill legislation will enable the Rojas family \nto continue to make significant contributions to their community as \nwell as the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JORGE ROJAS \n                   GUTIERREZ, OLIVA GONZALEZ GONZALEZ, AND JORGE \n                   ROJAS GONZALEZ.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez, and \n     Jorge Rojas Gonzalez shall each be eligible for the issuance \n     of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of \n     an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon \n     filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\n     204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of status \n     to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva \n     Gonzalez Gonzalez, or Jorge Rojas Gonzalez enters the United \n     States before the filing deadline specified in subsection \n     (c), Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez, or Jorge \n     Rojas Gonzalez, as appropriate, shall be considered to have \n     entered and remained lawfully in the United States and shall \n     be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for the issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees not later \n     than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an \n     immigrant visa or permanent residence to Jorge Rojas \n     Gutierrez, Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez, \n     the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by 3, during the current or subsequent fiscal year, \n     the total number of immigrant visas that are made available \n     to natives of the country of birth of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, \n     Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez under \n     section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva Gonzalez \n     Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez under section 202(e) of \n     such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 585. A bill for the relief of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \nMicaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private \nimmigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident \nstatus to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, and \ntheir daughter, Adilene Martinez. This family is originally from Mexico \nbut has been living in California for twenty years. I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for this extraordinary form of \nrelief.\n  When Jose came to the United States from Mexico, he began working as \na busboy in restaurants in San Francisco, California. In 1990, he \nstarted working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award-winning Italian \nrestaurant in San Francisco.\n  Jose worked his way through the ranks, eventually becoming Palio's \nsous chef. His colleagues describe him as a reliable and cool-headed \ncoworker, and as ``an exemplary employee'' who not only is ``good at \nhis job but is also a great boss to his subordinates.''\n  He and his wife, Micaela, call San Francisco home. Micaela works as a \nhousekeeper and a part-time cook at a restaurant in San Francisco. They \nhave three daughters, two of whom are United States citizens. Their \noldest child Adilene, age 24, is undocumented. Adilene graduated from \nthe Immaculate Conception Academy and attended San Francisco City \nCollege. She is now studying nursing at Los Medranos College.\n  The Martinez's second daughter, Jazmin, graduated from Leadership \nHigh School and is now studying at California State University, \nDominguez Hills. Jazmin is a United States citizen and has been \ndiagnosed with asthma. According to her doctor, if the family returns \nto Mexico, the high altitude and air pollution in Mexico City could be \nfatal to Jazmin.\n  The Martinez family attempted to legalize their status through \nseveral channels.\n  In 2001, Jose's sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Jose to \nget a green card. However, the current green card backlog for siblings \nfrom Mexico is long, and it will be many years before Jose will be \neligible to legalize his status though his sister.\n  In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their \napplication was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent \napplication for cancellation of removal because he could not find the \n``requisite hardship'' required for this form of immigration relief. \nIronically, the immigration judge who reviewed their case found that \nJose's culinary ability was a negative factor weighing against keeping \nthe family in the United States, finding that Jose's skills indicated \nthat he could find a job in Mexico.\n  Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio \nD'Asti, petitioned for legal status for Jose based upon Jose's unique \nskills as a chef. Jose's petition was approved by U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services; however, he cannot apply for permanent residency \nbecause of his immigration history.\n  Jose, Micaela, and their daughter, Adilene, have no other \nadministrative options to legalize their status. If they are deported, \nthey will face a several-year ban from returning to the United States. \nJose and Micaela will be separated from their American citizen-children \nand their community.\n  The Martinez family has become an integral part of their community in \nCalifornia. They are active in their faith community and their \nchildren's schools. They volunteer with community-based organizations \nand are, in turn, supported by their community. When I first introduced \nthis bill, I received dozens of letters of support from their fellow \nparishioners, teachers, and members of their community.\n  The Martinez family truly embraces the American dream. Jose worked \nhis way through the restaurant industry to become a chef and an \nindispensable employee at a renowned restaurant. Adilene worked hard in \nhigh school and is now attending college.\n  I believe the Martinez family's presence in the United States allows \nthem to continue making significant contributions to their community in \nCalifornia.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria \nDel Refugio Plascencia; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprovide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez \nand his wife, Maria del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican nationals who live \nin the San Bruno area of California.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their five children, all \nUnited States citizens, would face extreme hardship. Their children \nwould either face separation from their parents or be forced to leave \nthe only country\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\nthey know and give up on their education in the United States.\n  The Plascencias have been in the United States for over 20 years. \nThey worked for years to adjust their status through appropriate legal \nchannels, but poor legal representation ruined their opportunities. The \nPlascencia's lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise \ncommunicate with them in any way. He also failed to forward crucial \nimmigration documents, or even notify the Plascencias that he had them. \nBecause of the poor representation they received, Alfredo and Maria \nonly became aware that they had been ordered to leave the United States \nfifteen days prior to their scheduled deportation.\n  The Plascencias were shocked to learn of their attorney's \nmalfeasance, but they acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and to \nfile the appropriate paperwork to delay their deportation to determine \nif any other legal action could be taken.\n  Since arriving in the United States in 1988, Alfredo and Maria have \nproven themselves a civic-minded couple who share our American values \nof hard work, dedication to family, and devotion to community.\n  Maria has distinguished herself as a medical assistant at a Kaiser \nPermanente hospital in the Bay Area. Not satisfied with working as a \nmaid at a local hotel, she went to school, earned her high school \nequivalency degree, and improved her skills to become a medical \nassistant. She recently completed school to become a Licensed \nVocational Nurse, and is scheduled to take the Nursing Board \nExamination.\n  Several Californians who wrote to me in support of Maria describe her \nas ``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.'' Kaiser \nPermanente's Director of Internal Medicine wrote to say that Maria is \n``an asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we Americans \nextol: hardworking, devoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] \ninvolved in her community. She and her family are a solid example of \nthe type of immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.''\n  Together, Alfredo and Maria have used their professional successes to \nrealize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. They saved up \nand bought a home. They own a car. They have good health care benefits, \nand they each have begun saving for retirement. They are sending their \ndaughters, Christina and Erika, to college and plan to send the rest of \ntheir children to college as well.\n  Allowing the Plascencias to remain in the United States would \npreserve their achievements and ensure that they will be able to make \nsubstantive contributions to the community in the future.\n  In addition, this bill will have a positive impact on the couple's \nUnited States citizen children, who are dedicated to pursuing their \neducations and becoming productive members of their community.\n  Christina is the Plascencias' oldest child. She is 22 years old, \nworking and taking classes at Chabot College. She would like to be a \nparalegal. Erika, age 18, graduated from high school and is currently \ntaking classes at Skyline College. Erika's teachers praise her \nabilities and have referred to her as a ``bright spot'' in the \nclassroom.\n  Alfredo and Maria also have three young children: Alfredo, Jr., age \n16, Daisy, age 11, and Juan-Pablo, age 6.\n  Removing Alfredo and Maria from the United States would be tragic for \ntheir children. The Plascencia children were born in America and \nthrough no fault of their own have been thrust into a situation that \nhas the potential to dramatically alter their lives.\n  It would be especially tragic if Erika, Alfredo, and Daisy have to \nleave the United States. They are old enough to understand that they \nare leaving their schools, their teachers, their friends, and their \nhome. They would leave everything that is familiar to them.\n  The Plascencia family would then be in Mexico without a means for \nsupporting themselves and with no place to live. The children would \nhave to acclimate to a different culture, language, and way of life.\n  The only other option would be for Alfredo and Maria to leave their \nchildren here with relatives. This separation is a choice that no \nparents should have to make.\n  I am reintroducing this legislation because I believe that the \nPlascencias will continue to make positive contributions to their \ncommunity in California and this country. The Plascencia children \nshould be given the opportunity to realize their full potential in the \nUnited States, with their family intact.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ALFREDO PLASCENCIA \n                   LOPEZ AND MARIA DEL REFUGIO PLASCENCIA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio \n     Plascencia shall each be eligible for the issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Alfredo Plascencia Lopez or \n     Maria Del Refugio Plascencia enter the United States before \n     the filing deadline specified in subsection (c), Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez or Maria Del Refugio Plascencia, as \n     appropriate, shall be considered to have entered and remained \n     lawfully and shall be eligible for adjustment of status under \n     section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1255) as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of \n     immigrant visas or the application for adjustment of status \n     are filed with appropriate fees within 2 years after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia, the \n     Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent fiscal year, \n     the total number of immigrant visas that are made available \n     to natives of the country of birth of Alfredo Plascencia \n     Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia under section 203(a) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, \n     if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia under \n     section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 587. A bill for the relief of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and \nArthur Mkoyan; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce private relief \nlegislation on behalf of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and their son, \nArthur Mkoyan. The Mkoian family has been living in Fresno, California, \nfor over 15 years. I continue to believe this family deserves Congress' \nspecial consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a \nprivate bill.\n  The Mkoian family is originally from Armenia. They decided to leave \nArmenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several \nincidents in which the family experienced vandalism and threats to \ntheir well-being.\n  In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing. \nAt one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which \nhe refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later \nlearned that a co-worker had gone ahead and registered the vehicles at \nthe request of the chief.\n  Several disturbing incidents occurred after Ruben reported the bribe \nto illegally register vehicles. Ruben's store was vandalized; after he \nsaid he would call the police, he received threatening phone calls \ntelling him to keep quiet. At one point, the Mkoians suffered the loss \nof their home when a bottle of gasoline was thrown into their \nresidence, burning it to the ground. In April 1992, several men entered \nthe family store and assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.\n  Ruben, Asmik, and their 3-old son, Arthur, left Armenia soon \nthereafter\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\nand entered the United States on visitor visas. They applied for \npolitical asylum in 1992 on the grounds that they would be subject to \nphysical attacks if returned to Armenia. It took 16 years for their \ncase to be finalized, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied \ntheir asylum case in January 2008.\n  At this time, Ruben, Asmik, and Arthur have exhausted every option to \nremain legally in the United States.\n  The Mkoians have worked hard to build a place for their family in \nCalifornia. Ruben works as a manager at a car wash in Fresno. He \npreviously worked as a truck driver for a California trucking company \nthat described him as ``trustworthy,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and an asset \nto the company. Asmik has completed training at a local community \ncollege and is now a full-time medical assistant with Fresno Shields \nMedical Group.\n  The Mkoians attend St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church in Fresno. They \ndo charity work to send medical equipment to Armenia. Asmik also \nteaches Armenian School on Saturdays at the church.\n  I would particularly like to highlight the achievements of Ruben and \nAsmik's two children, Arthur and Arsen, who were raised in California \nand have been recognized publicly for their scholastic achievements.\n  I first introduced a private bill for this family on Arthur's high \nschool graduation day. Despite being undocumented, Arthur maintained a \n4.0 grade point average in high school and was a valedictorian for the \nclass of 2008. Arthur, now 22 years old, graduated from the University \nof California, Davis with a major in Chemistry. He maintained excellent \ngrades and was on the Dean's Merit List.\n  Arthur's brother, Arsen, is 16 years old and a United States citizen. \nHe currently attends Bullard High School in Fresno, where he does well \nin his classes, maintaining a 4.3 grade point average.\n  I believe Arthur and Arsen are two young individuals with great \npotential here in the United States. Like their parents, they have \ndemonstrated their commitment to working hard--and they are succeeding. \nThey clearly aspire to do great things here in the United States.\n  It has been more than 18 years since Ruben, Asmik, and Arthur left \nArmenia. This family has few family members and virtually no supporting \ncontacts in Armenia. They invested their time, resources, and effort in \norder to remain in the United States legally, to no avail. A private \nrelief bill is the only means to prevent them from being forced to \nreturn to a country that long ago became a closed chapter of their \npast.\n  When I first introduced a bill on behalf of the Mkoian family in \n2008, I received written endorsements from Representatives George \nRadanovich, R-CA, and Jim Costa, D-CA, in strong support of the family. \nI also received more than 200 letters of support and dozens of calls of \nsupport from friends and community members, attesting to the positive \nimpact that this family has had in Fresno, CA.\n  I believe that this case warrants our compassion and our \nextraordinary consideration. I respectfully ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private legislation on behalf of the Mkoian family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR RUBEN MKOIAN, ASMIK \n                   KARAPETIAN, AND ARTHUR MKOYAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan \n     shall each be eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa \n     or for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of status to lawful \n     permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Ruben Mkoian, Asmik \n     Karapetian, or Arthur Mkoyan enters the United States before \n     the filing deadline specified in subsection (c), Ruben \n     Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, or Arthur Mkoyan, as appropriate, \n     shall be considered to have entered and remained lawfully in \n     the United States and shall be eligible for adjustment of \n     status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for the issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status \n     is filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an \n     immigrant visa or permanent resident status to Ruben Mkoian, \n     Asmik Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan, the Secretary of State \n     shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by 3, during the \n     current or subsequent fiscal year, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and \n     Arthur Mkoyan under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of birth of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik \n     Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan under section 202(e) of such \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 588. A bill for the relief of Robert Liang and Alice Liang; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce private relief \nlegislation for Robert Kuan Liang and his wife, Chun-Mei, ``Alice'', \nHsu-Liang.\n  I first introduced a private bill for Robert and Alice in 2003. Since \nthen this family has only further demonstrated their hard work ethic \nand commitment to realizing the American dream. I continue to believe \nthat Robert and Alice merit Congress' special consideration and the \nextraordinary relief provided by private legislation.\n  Robert and Alice have been living in San Bruno, CA, for the last 27 \nyears. Robert is a national and refugee from Laos, and Alice is \noriginally from Taiwan. They have three children who are all United \nStates citizens. I am concerned that forcing Robert and Alice to return \nto their home countries would tear this family apart and cause immense \nand unwarranted hardship to them and their children.\n  Robert and Alice have called California their home since they first \nentered the United States in 1983. They came here legally on tourist \nvisas. They face deportation today because they remained in the United \nStates past the terms of their visas, and because their attorney failed \nto handle their immigration case on a timely basis before federal \nimmigration laws changed in 1996.\n  In many ways, the Liang family represents a uniquely American success \nstory. Robert was born in Laos, but fled the country as a teenager \nafter his mother was killed by Communists. He witnessed many traumatic \nexperiences in his youth, including the attack that killed his mother \nand frequent episodes of wartime violence. He routinely witnessed the \nbrutal persecution and deaths of others in his village in Laos. In \n1975, he was granted refugee status in Taiwan.\n  Robert and his wife risked everything to come to the United States. \nDespite the challenges of their past, they built a family in California \nand established a place for themselves in the local community. They are \nhomeowners. They own a successful business, Fong Yong Restaurant. They \nfile annual income taxes and are financially stable.\n  Robert and Alice support their three children, Wesley, Bruce, and \nEva, who are all American citizens. Wesley is now 21 years old and \nstudying at City College of San Francisco. The younger children, Bruce \nand Eva, attend schools in the San Bruno area and continue to do well \nin their classes.\n  There are many reasons to believe that deporting Robert and Alice \nwould have a harmful impact on the children, who have all of their ties \nto the United States. Deportation would either break this family apart \nor force them to relocate to a country entirely foreign to the one they \nknow to be home.\n  The Immigration Judge who presided over Robert and Alice's case in \n1997\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nalso concluded that Robert and Alice's deportation would adversely \nimpact the Liang children.\n  Moreover, Robert would face significant hurdles if deported, having \nfled Laos as a refugee more than 27 years ago. The emotional impact of \nthe wartime violence Robert experienced at a young age was traumatic \nand continues to strain him. He battles severe clinical depression here \nin the United States. Robert fears that if he is deported and moves to \nhis wife's home country, Taiwan, he will face discrimination on account \nof his nationality. Robert does not speak Taiwanese, and he worries \nabout how he would pursue mental health treatment in a foreign country.\n  Robert and Alice have worked since 1993 to resolve their immigration \nstatus. They filed for relief from deportation; however, it took nearly \nfive years for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, to act \non the case. By the time their case went through in 1997, the \nimmigration laws had changed and the Liangs were no longer eligible for \nrelief. I supported these changes, set forth in the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. But, I also believe \nthere may be situations worthy of special consideration.\n  Robert and Alice Liang represent one such example. They are long-term \nresidents of the United States. Their children are all U.S. citizens. \nThe Immigration Judge that presided over the appeal of this case \ndetermined that Robert and Alice would have qualified for relief from \ndeportation, in light of these positive factors, had the INS given \ntheir case timely consideration. Unfortunately, their immigration case \ntook nearly five years to move forward.\n  A private bill is the only way for both Robert and Alice to remain in \nthe United States together with their family.

A bill for the relief of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing private \nrelief legislation on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel, a couple \nliving with their family in Camarillo, CA.\n  Joseph and Sharon are nationals of Egypt who fled their home country \nover twelve years ago after being targeted for their religious \ninvolvement in the Christian Coptic Church in Egypt. They became \ninvolved with this church during the 1990s, Joseph as an accountant and \nproject coordinator helping to build community facilities and Sharon as \nthe church's training director in human resources.\n  Unfortunately, Joseph and Sharon were also subjected to threats and \nabuse. Joseph was jailed repeatedly because of his involvement with the \nchurch. Sharon's family members were violently targeted, including her \ncousin who was murdered and her brother whose business was firebombed. \nWhen Sharon became pregnant with her first child, she was threatened by \na member of a different religious organization against raising her \nchild in a non-Muslim faith.\n  Joseph and Sharon came to the United States legally seeking refuge in \nNovember 1998. They immediately notified authorities of their intent to \nseek protection in the United States, filing for political asylum in \nMay 1999.\n  However, Joseph, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty \ncommunicating why he was afraid to return to Egypt, and one year later \ntheir asylum application was denied because they could not adequately \nestablish that they were victims of persecution. Joseph and Sharon \npursued the appropriate means for appealing this decision, to no avail.\n  It should be noted that sometime later Sharon's brother applied for \nasylum in the United States. He, too, applied on the basis of \npersecution he and his family faced in Egypt, but his application was \napproved and he was granted this status in the United States.\n  There are no other avenues for Joseph and Sharon to pursue relief \nhere in the United States. If they are deported, they will be forced \nback to a country where they sincerely fear for their safety.\n  Since arriving in the United States more than twelve years ago, \nJoseph and Sharon have built a family here, including four children who \nare United States citizens: Jessica, age 14, Rebecca, age 13, Rafael, \nage 12, and Veronica, age 7. Jessica, Rebecca, and Rafael attend school \nin California and maintain good grades. Veronica is attending second \ngrade at Camarillo Heights Elementary School.\n  Joseph and Sharon worked hard to achieve financial security for their \nchildren, and they created a meaningful place for their family in \nCalifornia. Both earned college degrees in Egypt. Joseph, who has his \nCertified Public Accountant license, has opened his own accounting \nfirm.\n  Joseph and Sharon carry strong support from friends, members of their \nlocal church, and other Californians who attest to their good character \nand community contributions.\n  I am concerned that the entire family would face serious and \nunwarranted hardships if forced to relocate to Egypt. For Jessica, \nRebecca, Rafael, and Veronica, the only home they know is in the United \nStates. It is quite possible these four American children would face \ndiscrimination or worse in Egypt on account of their religion, as was \nthe experience of many of their family members.\n  Joseph and Sharon have made a compelling plea to remain in the United \nStates. These parents emphasize their commitment to supporting their \nchildren and making a healthy and productive place for them to grow up \nin California. I believe this family deserves that opportunity.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill \non behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Claudia Marquez Rico; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nreintroduce private relief legislation for Claudia Marquez Rico. I \nfirst introduced a private bill for Claudia back in 2006. This young \nwoman has lived in California for most of her life. She suffered \ntremendous hardship after the sudden death of her parents more than ten \nyears ago. I believe she deserves the special relief granted by a \nprivate bill.\n  Claudia was born in Jalisco, Mexico. She was only 6 years old when \nher parents brought her, and her two younger brothers, to the United \nStates.\n  Ten years ago, tragedy struck this family. Early in the morning on \nOctober 4, 2000, while driving to work, Claudia's parents were killed \nin a horrific car accident when their vehicle collided with a truck on \na rural road.\n  Suddenly orphaned, Claudia and her siblings were fortunate enough to \nhave a place to go. They were welcomed into the loving home of their \naunt, Hortencia, and uncle, Patricio, who are both United States \ncitizens. Hortencia and Patricio are active at Buen Pastor Catholic \nChurch. Patricio is a youth soccer coach. This couple raised the \nMarquez children as their own, counseling them through the loss of \ntheir parents and helping them with their school work. They became the \nlegal guardians of the Marquez children in 2001.\n  Claudia likely would have resolved her immigration status, were it \nnot for poor legal representation. The death of the Marquez parents \nmeant that Claudia and her siblings should have qualified for special \nimmigrant juvenile status. Congress created this special immigrant \nstatus to protect children under extraordinary circumstances and spare \nthem the hardship of deportation when a state court deems the children \nto be dependents as a result of abuse, abandonment, or neglect. In \nfact, Claudia's younger brother, Omar, was granted this special \nimmigrant juvenile status, providing him legal permanent residency.\n  However, the lawyer for the Marquez children failed to secure this \nrelief for Claudia. She has now reached the age of majority without \nhaving resolved her immigration status, making her ineligible for this \nspecial relief.\n  It is important to take note that the lawyer who handled this case \nwas faced with charges on numerous counts of professional incompetence \nand moral turpitude for mishandling immigration cases. The California \nState Bar accused him of a ``despicable and far-reaching pattern of \nmisconduct.'' As a result, the lawyer resigned from the Bar and is \ncurrently ineligible to practice law in California.\n  Claudia deserved a fair chance at resolving her immigration status, \nbut her attorney's egregious behavior stripped her of this opportunity.\n  Claudia, nonetheless, finished school despite these adverse \ncircumstances. She secured a job in Redwood City, California, and she \ncurrently lives with her younger sister, Maribel, in Menlo Park, where \nthey care for their grandfather. Claudia also provides financial \nsupport to her two brothers, Jose and Omar, whenever necessary. She is \nstill active in the local community, attending San Clemente Catholic \nChurch in Hayward.\n  It would be an injustice to add to the Marquez family's misfortune by \ntearing these siblings apart. Claudia and her siblings have come to \nrely on each other in the absence of their deceased parents, and \nClaudia is clearly a central support of this family. Moreover, Claudia \nhas never visited Mexico and has no close relatives in the country. She \nwas so young when her parents brought her to the United States that she \nhas no memories of Mexico.\n  I am reintroducing a private relief bill on Claudia's behalf because \nI believe her removal from the United States would go against our \nstandard of fairness and would only cause additional hardship on a \nfamily that already endured so much.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief \nlegislation on behalf of Claudia Marquez Rico.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 590\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR CLAUDIA MARQUEZ \n                   RICO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Claudia Marquez Rico shall be eligible for issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Claudia Marquez Rico enters \n     the United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered and \n     remained lawfully and, if otherwise eligible, shall be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Claudia \n     Marquez Rico, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by 1, during the current or \n     subsequent fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Claudia Marquez Rico under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of birth of Claudia Marquez Rico under \n     section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) Denial of Preferential Immigration Treatment for \n     Certain Relatives.--The natural parents, brothers, and \n     sisters of Claudia Marquez Rico shall not, by virtue of such \n     relationship, be accorded any right, privilege, or status \n     under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et \n     seq.).\n       (f) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 591. A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria \nElna Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I offer private immigration \nrelief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to \nEsidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola \nCarlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are Mexican nationals \nliving in the Fresno area of California.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Arreola have lived in the United States for over 20 \nyears. Two of their five children, Nayely, age 27, and Cindy, age 22, \nalso stand to benefit from this legislation.\n  The other three Arreola children, Robert, age 21, Daniel, age 17, and \nSaray, age 16, are United States citizens. Today, Esidronio and Maria \nElena and their two eldest children face deportation.\n  The story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nsuch an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.\n  The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous \nerrors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been \ndisbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it \ncompelled an immigration judge to write the Executive Office of \nImmigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in \nhis client's immigration cases.\n  Mr. Arreola came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural \nmigrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a \nmigrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent \nresidence through the Special Agricultural Workers or SAW program, had \nhe known about it.\n  Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became \npregnant with her daughter Cindy. She returned to Mexico to give birth \nbecause she wanted to avoid any problems with the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.\n  Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United \nStates, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of \ndeportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United \nStates legally. However, their poor legal representation foreclosed \nthis opportunity.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this \nprivate bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and \nMaria Elena would have on their children--three of whom are American \ncitizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since \nthey were toddlers. For these children, this country is the only \ncountry they really know.\n  Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high \nschool and the first to graduate college. She attended Fresno Pacific \nUniversity, a regionally ranked university, on a full tuition \nscholarship package and worked part-time in the admissions office. She \ngraduated from Fresno Pacific University with a degree in Business \nAdministration and is working on her graduate degree. Nayely recently \ngot married and now has a newborn son.\n  At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals \nof citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her \nfull potential both through her academic endeavors and community \nservice. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific \nUniversity states in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno \nPacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become \nexemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''\n  In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual \nDetermination, a college preparatory program in which students commit \nto determining their own futures through achieving a college degree. \nNayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service \norganization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to this family, if forced \nto return to Mexico, will be her lost opportunity to realize her dreams \nand further contribute to her community and to this country.\n  Nayely's sister, Cindy, also recently married and has a three-year-\nold daughter. Both Nayely and Cindy are barred from adjusting their \nstatus based on their marriages because they grew up in the United \nStates undocumented.\n  The Arreolas also have other family who are United States citizens or \nlawful permanent residents of this country. Mrs. Arreola has three \nbrothers who are American citizens, and Mr. Arreola has a sister who is \nan American citizen. They have no immediate family in Mexico.\n  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any \nproblems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their \ntaxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked \nhard to support themselves.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. Arreola was previously employed as a farm worker, \nbut now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His \nbusiness has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home \nfor his family. He and his wife are active in their church community \nand in their children's education.\n  It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream. \nEnactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the \nArreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their \ncommunity as well as the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     or any order, for the purposes of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Esidronio Arreola-\n     Saucedo, Maria Elna Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, \n     and Cindy Jael Arreola shall be deemed to have been lawfully \n     admitted to, and remained in, the United States, and shall be \n     eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment \n     of status under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255).\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the applications for issuance of immigrant \n     visas or the applications for adjustment of status are filed \n     with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas to Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elna \n     Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael \n     Arreola, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 4, during the current or subsequent \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Marina Elna Cobian Arreola, Nayely \n     Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 203(a) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, \n     if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elna Cobian Arreola, Nayely \n     Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 202(e) \n     of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(c)).\n       (d) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 592. A bill for the relief of Alicia Aranda De Buendia and Ana \nLaura Buendia Aranda; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am reintroducing a private relief \nbill on behalf of the Buendias, a family who has lived in the Fresno \narea of California for more than 20 years. The beneficiaries of this \nbill include Alicia Aranda de Buendia and her daughter, Ana Laura \nBuendia Aranda. I believe this family merits Congress' special \nconsideration.\n  Mrs. Buendia works season after season in California's labor-\nintensive agriculture industry. She currently works for a fruit packing \ncompany in Reedley, California. Mrs. Buendia and her husband have \nraised two outstanding children, Ana Laura, age 23, and Alex, age 21, \nwho have both always excelled in school.\n  Ana Laura earned a 4.0 GPA at Reedley High School, and was offered an \nacademic scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley. \nUnfortunately, she could not accept the scholarship because of her \nundocumented status.\n  Ana Laura nonetheless persisted. She enrolled at the University of \nCalifornia, Irvine and recently graduated with a major in Chicano \nStudies and Art.\n  Remarkably, the Buendias should have been able to correct their \nimmigration status years ago. In 1999, it appeared they had succeeded \nwhen an Immigration Judge granted the family cancellation of removal \nbased on the hardship their son, Alex, would face if deported to \nMexico. However, the decision was appealed and ultimately overturned. \nAt this point, the Buendias have exhausted their options to remain \ntogether as a family here in the United States.\n  In the more than 20 years of living in California, the Buendias have \nshown that they are committed to working to achieve the American dream. \nThey\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nhave a strong connection to their local community, as active members of \nthe Parent Teachers Association and their church. They pay their taxes \nevery year, paid off their mortgage, and remain free of debt. They have \nshown that they are responsible, maintaining health insurance, savings \naccounts, and retirement accounts.\n  Moreover, the Buendia children are excellent students pursuing higher \neducation here in the United States.

A bill for the relief of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie \nRaymonde Toto; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde Toto. \nMr. Tape and Ms. Toto are citizens of the Ivory Coast, but have been \nliving in the San Francisco area of California for approximately 19 \nyears.\n  The story of Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were subjected to numerous atrocities in the \nearly 1990s in the Ivory Coast. After participating in a demonstration \nagainst the ruling party, they were jailed and tortured by their own \ngovernment. Ms. Toto was brutally raped by her captors and several \nyears later learned that she had contracted HIV.\n  Despite the hardships that they suffered, Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were \nable to make a better life for themselves in the United States. Mr. \nTape arrived in the U.S. in 1993 on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa. Ms. \nToto entered without inspection in 1995 from Spain. Despite being \ndiagnosed with HIV, Ms. Toto gave birth to two healthy children, \nMelody, age 14, and Emmanuel, age 10.\n  Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated \nthemselves to community involvement and a strong work ethic. They are \nactive members of Easter Hill United Methodist Church.\n  Mr. Tape is employed as a security guard and unfortunately, in 2002, \nhe was diagnosed with prostate cancer. While his doctor states that the \ncancer is currently in remission, he will continue to require life-long \nsurveillance to monitor for recurrence of the disease.\n  In addition to raising her two children, Ms. Toto obtained a \ncertificate to be a nurse's aide and currently works as a Resident Care \nSpecialist at a nursing home in San Pablo, California. Ms. Toto \ncontinues to receive medical treatment for HIV. According to her \ndoctor, without access to adequate health care and laboratory \nmonitoring, she is at risk of developing life-threatening illnesses.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto applied for asylum when they arrived in the \nU.S., but after many years of litigation, the claim was ultimately \ndenied by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Although the regime which subjected Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto to \nimprisonment and torture is no longer in power, Mr. Tape has been \nafraid to return to the Ivory Coast due to his prior association with \nformer President Laurent Gbagbo. As a result, Mr. Tape strongly \nbelieves that his family will be targeted if they return to the Ivory \nCoast.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to \nremain in the United States is the impact their deportation would have \non their two U.S. citizen children. For Melody and Emmanuel, the United \nStates is the only country they have ever known. Mr. Tape believes that \nif the family returns to the Ivory Coast, these two young children will \nbe forced to enter the army.\n  This bill is the only hope for this family to remain in the United \nStates. To send them back to the Ivory Coast, where they may face \npersecution and inadequate medical treatment for their illnesses would \nbe devastating to the family. I have received approximately 30 letters \nfrom the church community in support of this family.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 593\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Javier Lopez-Urenda and Maria \nLeticia Arenas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Javier Lopez-Urenda and Maria Leticia Arenas. \nJavier and Leticia, originally from Mexico, are the parents of three \nU.S. citizen children, Bryan, age 19, Ashley, age 15, and Nancy, age 9. \nThis family lives in Fremont, California.\n  I first introduced a bill for Javier and Leticia in 2009, and I \ncontinue to believe they deserve Congress' special consideration for \nsuch an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill. Javier and \nLeticia are outstanding parents, volunteers, workers, and leaders in \ntheir community. Javier and Leticia came to the United States after \neach suffered the loss of a parent.\n  Leticia left Mexico at age 17 after her mother died from cancer. \nJavier came to the United States in 1990, at age 23, several years \nafter the murder of his father in Michoacan, Mexico.\n  Javier had been living and working in the United States for 23 years \nwhen I first learned about this case. He originally entered the country \nlooking for work to support his extended family. Today, Javier is a \nMaintenance Engineer at Full Bloom Baking Company in San Mateo, \nCalifornia, where he has been an employee for over 19 years. In fact, \nJavier was the second employee hired at Full Bloom when the company \nfirst began.\n  Javier's fellow co-workers at Full Bloom have written compelling \nletters to me about Javier's hard work ethic and valuable \ncontributions. The company owners assert that with his help, the \ncompany grew to be one of the largest commercial bakeries in the Bay \nArea, today employing approximately 385 people.\n  They write that Javier is a mentor to others and maintains a \n``tremendous amount of `institutional knowledge' that can never be \nreplaced.'' One of his co-workers wrote, ``Without Javier at the \nbakery, the lives of hundreds of people will change.''\n  Javier made attempts to legalize his status in the United States. At \none point, he received an approved labor certification. However, his \ncase could not be finalized due to poor timing and a lengthy \nimmigration process. It took three years, for example, for his labor \ncertification to be approved. By that time, Javier was already in \nremoval proceedings and his case is now closed.\n  During consideration of Javier's case, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals acknowledged the difficult situation Javier faces. The Court \nwrote, ``We are not unmindful of the unique and extremely sympathetic \ncircumstances of this case. By all accounts, Petitioner has been an \nexemplary father, employee, and member of his local community. If he \nwere to be deported, he would be separated from his wife, three U.S. \ncitizen children, and the life he has worked so hard to build over the \npast 17 years. In light of the unfortunate sequence of events leading \nup to this juncture and Petitioner's positive contributions to society, \nPetitioner may very well be deserving of prosecutorial grace.''\n  Unfortunately, the Court ultimately denied the case. Javier and his \nwife have no additional avenues for adjusting their status. A private \nbill is the only way for them to remain in the United States.\n  I believe it is important to consider the potentially harmful impact \non Javier and Maria Leticia's three U.S. citizen children, Bryan, \nAshley, and Nancy, should their parents be deported. Ashley, and Nancy \nare still in school in California, and Bryan is currently serving in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Javier owns their home in Fremont. He is the sole financial provider \nfor his wife and children, while also providing some financial support \nto extended family members in Mexico. Javier and Leticia are good \nparents and play active roles in their children's lives. The Principal \nof Patterson Elementary School described Javier and Leticia as ``two \nloving and supportive parents who are committed to their children's \nsuccess.''\n  All too often, deportation separates U.S. citizen children from their \nparents. In 2009, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity found that, in the last ten years, at least 108,434 immigrant \nparents of American citizen children were removed from this country. \nOther reports show that deporting a parent causes trauma and long-\nlasting harm to children.\n  Moreover, the deportation of Javier and Leticia would be a \nsignificant loss to the community. Leticia is currently volunteering \nand training for a job with Bay Area Women Against Rape in Oakland, \nwhich provides services to survivors of sexual assault. She also works \nas a certified health promoter at the Tiburcio Vazquez Health Center in \nFremont.\n  Javier's community involvement is just as impressive. He has \nvolunteered with the Women's Foundation of California, Lance \nArmstrong's Livestrong Foundation, the Saint Patrick Proto Cathedral \nParish, the American Red Cross, and the California AIDS Ride.\n  Patricia W. Chang, a long-time community leader in California and \ncurrent CEO of the Feed the Hunger Foundation, writes: ``Asking Mr. \nUrenda to leave the United States would deprive his children of their \nfather, an upstanding resident of the country. It would deprive the \ncommunity of an active participant, leader, and volunteer.''\n  Judy Patrick, President/CEO of the Women's Foundation of California, \nstates that Javier ``is a model participant in this society.''\n  Clearly, Javier and Leticia have earned the admiration of their \ncommunity here in the United States. They are the loving parents of \nthree American children. Javier is a valued employee at Full Bloom \nBaking Company. This family shows great potential, and I believe it is \nin our Nation's best interest to allow them to remain here with their \nchildren and to continue making significant contributions to California \nand the Nation as a whole.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 594\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Shirley Constantino Tan; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for \nthe private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina \nnational living in Pacifica, California. She is the proud mother of 16-\nyear-old U.S. citizen twin boys, Jashley and Joreine, and the spouse of \nJay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n  I believe Ms. Tan merits Congress' special consideration for this \nextraordinary form of relief because I believe her removal from the \nUnited States would cause undue hardship for her and her family. She \nfaces deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her from her \nfamily and jeopardize her safety.\n  Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she \nleft to come to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, her \ncousin murdered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the head. \nWhile the cousin who committed the murders was eventually prosecuted, \nhe received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled \nthe Philippines just before her cousin was due to be released from \njail. She entered the United States legally on a visitor's visa in \n1989.\n  Ms. Tan's current deportation order is the result of negligent \ncounsel. Shirley applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was \npending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her attorney failed to \nsubmit a brief to support her case. As a result, the case was \ndismissed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted Shirley \nvoluntary departure from the United States.\n  Shirley never received notice that the Board of Immigration Appeals \ngranted her voluntary departure. Shirley's attorney moved offices, did \nnot receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. \nAs a result, Shirley did not depart the United States and the grant of \nvoluntary departure automatically became a deportation order. She \nlearned about the deportation order for the first time on January 28, \n2009, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into \nimmigration custody.\n  Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Ms. Tan was denied the \nopportunity to present her case in U.S. immigration proceedings. \nShirley later filed a complaint with the State Bar of California \nagainst her former attorney. She is not the first person to file such a \ncomplaint against this attorney.\n  In addition to the hardship that would come to Ms. Tan if she is \ndeported, Shirley's deportation would be a serious hardship to her two \nUnited States citizen children, Jashley and Joreine, who are minors.\n  Jashley and Joreine are currently attending Terra Nova High School in \nPacifica, California, where they continue to be excellent students on \nthe honor roll. The children are involved in their school's music \nprogram, playing the clarinet and the flute. The children's teacher \nwrote a letter to me in which she described Shirley's involvement in \nJashley and Joreine's lives, referring to Shirley as a ``model'' parent \nand describing her active role in the school community. In addition to \ncaring for her two children, Shirley is the primary caregiver for her \nelderly mother-in-law.\n  If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the United States, her family has \nexpressed that they would go with Shirley to the Philippines or try to \nfind a third country where the entire family could relocate. This would \nmean that Jashley and Joreine would have to leave behind their \neducation and the only home they know in the United States.\n  While Shirley and Jay are legally married under California law at \nthis time, Shirley cannot legally adjust her immigration status through \nthe regular family-based immigration procedures.\n  I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this \nfamily, with two United States citizen children, to make the choice \nbetween being separated and relocating to a country where they may face \nsafety concerns or other serious hardships.\n  Ms. Tan and her family are involved in their community in Pacifica \nand own their own home. The family attends Good Shepherd Catholic \nChurch, volunteering at the church and the Mother Theresa of Calcutta's \nDaughters of Charity. Shirley has the support of dozens of members of \nher community who shared with me the family's spirit of commitment to \ntheir community.\n  Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan \ntoday will enable this entire family to continue their lives in \nCalifornia and make positive contributions to their community.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SHIRLEY CONSTANTINO \n                   TAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Shirley Constantino Tan shall be eligible for issuance \n     of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of \n     an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon \n     filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Shirley Constantino Tan \n     enters the United States before the filing deadline specified \n     in subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered \n     and remained lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Shirley \n     Constantino Tan, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by one, during the current or next \n     following fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of the \n     alien's birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of the alien's birth under section \n     202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 597. A bill to ensure the effective administration of criminal \njustice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 50 years ago today, the Supreme Court \nissued its landmark decision in Gideon v. Wainwright. That case \naffirmed a fundamental principle of our democratic society, that no \nperson, regardless of economic status, should face prosecution without \nthe assistance of a lawyer. It is worth pausing today to celebrate \nGideon and the extraordinary idea that in a free society the government \nwhich seeks to convict someone must also assume the cost of providing \nan effective defense.\n  In the last 50 years, we have come a long way in ensuring equal \njustice for all Americans and there is much about our criminal justice \nsystem in which to take pride. But we must also be honest and recognize \nthat in too many courtrooms it is better to be rich and guilty than \npoor and innocent. The rich will have competent counsel, but those who \nhave little often find their lives placed in the hands of underpaid \ncourt-appointed lawyers who are inexperienced, overworked, inept, \nuninterested, or worse.\n  The bottom line is that the promise made in Gideon remains \nunfulfilled. At\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\nthe core of this problem is the fact that too many States still lack \nadequate programs for providing effective representation. That failure \nresults in miscarriages of justice, including wrongful convictions, in \nviolation of our constitutional obligation to provide effective \nassistance of counsel. In his column yesterday in The New York Times, \nLincoln Caplan noted, ``by well-informed estimates, at least 80 percent \nof state criminal defendants cannot afford to pay for lawyers and have \nto depend on court-appointed counsel.'' A recent article on the front \npage of USA Today correctly calls the problem a ``national crisis,'' \nhighlighting one public defender's office in Pennsylvania that has four \ninvestigators to handle its 4,000 cases a year and where some lawyers \nhave no desk or phone. A similar AP article which ran in the Washington \nPost cites additional examples of this ongoing failure of our criminal \njustice system, including one public defender in Indianapolis who was \nasked to represent 300 clients at a time. I know what it takes to work \na case effectively from my time as a prosecutor, and no lawyer can \nprovide effective counsel to 300 defendants at once.\n  We can no longer ignore the disturbing examples discussed in these \narticles. We are on notice that a constitutional right is consistently \nbeing violated and, if we are to call ourselves a country of laws, it \nis our obligation as a nation, and particularly as the Congress, to \ntake action and make a change. That is why today, I am introducing the \nGideon's Promise Act of 2013. This legislation takes important new \nsteps to breathe life into Gideon and ensure the fairness of our \ncriminal justice system for all participants.\n  I first introduced this legislation last Congress, as part of the \nreauthorization of the Justice For All Act. That law, passed in 2004, \nwas an unprecedented bipartisan piece of criminal justice legislation. \nIt was the most significant step Congress had taken in many years to \nimprove the quality of justice in this country and to improve public \nconfidence in the integrity of the American justice system. I plan to \nreintroduce the reauthorization of the Justice for All Act, again, \nlater this spring and it will include this critical provision to ensure \nthat our criminal justice system operates effectively and consistent \nwith our constitutional obligations.\n  The Gideon's Promise Act takes several important new steps to improve \nthe quality of the criminal justice system. First, it seeks to \nencourage States to adopt a comprehensive approach in using the Federal \nfunds received through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \nGrant, JAG, Program. This will help to ensure that their criminal \njustice systems operate effectively as a whole and that all parts of \nthe system work together and receive the resources they need. \nSpecifically, the bill reinstates a previous requirement of the Byrne \nJAG Program that States develop, and update annually, a strategic plan \ndetailing how grants received under the program will be used to improve \nthe administration of the criminal justice system. The requirement was \nremoved from the Byrne JAG grant application several years ago, but \ngroups representing States and victims have requested that it be \nreinstated in order to improve the efficient and effective use of \ncriminal justice resources. The plan must be formulated in consultation \nwith local governments and all segments of the criminal justice system. \nThe Attorney General will also be required to provide technical \nassistance to help States formulate their strategic plans.\n  This legislation also takes important new steps to ensure that all \ncriminal defendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, \nreceive constitutionally adequate representation. It requires the \nDepartment of Justice to assist States that want help developing an \neffective and efficient system of indigent defense, and it establishes \na cause of action for the Federal Government to step in when States are \nsystematically failing to provide the representation called for in the \nConstitution.\n  This is a reasonable measure that gives the States assistance and \ntime needed to make necessary changes and seeks to provide an incentive \nfor States to do so. As a former prosecutor, I have great faith in the \nmen and women of law enforcement, and I know that the vast majority of \nthe time our criminal justice system does work fairly and effectively. \nI also know that the system only works as it should when each side is \nwell represented by competent and well-trained counsel. That \nrealization was reflected in the testimony of District Attorney \nPatricia Lykos of Houston that competent defense attorneys are critical \nto a prosecutor's job. Our system requires good lawyers on both sides. \nIncompetent counsel can result not only in needless and time-consuming \nappeals but, far more importantly, can lead to wrongful convictions and \noverall distrust in the criminal process.\n  In working on this legislation, I have also learned that the most \neffective systems of indigent defense are not always the most \nexpensive. In some cases, making the necessary changes may also save \nStates money.\n  I remain committed to ensuring that our criminal justice system \noperates as effectively and fairly as possible. Unfortunately, we are \nnot there yet. Too often the quality of justice a defendant receives in \nour system depends on how much he or she can pay for an attorney. The \nConstitution requires that we do better. Americans need and deserve a \ncriminal justice system that keeps us safe, ensures fairness and \naccuracy, and fulfills the promise of our Constitution for all people.\n  This bill will take important steps to bring us closer to that goal \nand I urge all Senators to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthree articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The holding in \n     Gideon v. Wainwright enlarged the Constitution's safeguards \n     of liberty and equality, finding the right to counsel \n     ``fundamental.'' The goal was ``fair trials before impartial \n     tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the \n     law.''\n        This principle has been expanded to cover other \n     circumstances as well: misdemeanor cases where the defendant \n     could be jailed, a defendant's first appeal from a conviction \n     and proceedings against a juvenile for delinquency.\n        While the constitutional commitment is generally met in \n     federal courts, it is a different story in state courts, \n     which handle about 95 percent of America's criminal cases. \n     This matters because, by well-informed estimates, at least 80 \n     percent of state criminal defendants cannot afford to pay for \n     lawyers and have to depend on court-appointed counsel.\n        Even the best-run state programs lack enough money to \n     provide competent lawyers for all indigent defendants who \n     need them. Florida set up public defender offices when Gideon \n     was decided, and the Miami office was a standout. But as \n     demand has outpaced financing, caseloads for Miami defenders \n     have grown to 500 felonies a year, though the American Bar \n     Association guidelines say caseloads should not exceed 150 \n     felonies.\n        Only 24 states have statewide public defender systems. \n     Others flout their constitutional obligations by pushing the \n     problem onto cash-strapped counties or local judicial \n     districts.\n        Lack of financing isn't the only problem, either. Contempt \n     for poor defendants is too often the norm. In Kentucky, 68 \n     percent of poor people accused of misdemeanors appear in \n     court hearings without lawyers. In 21 counties in Florida in \n     2010, 70 percent of misdemeanor defendants pleaded guilty or \n     no contest--at arraignments that averaged less than three \n     minutes.\n        The Supreme Court has said that poor people are entitled \n     to counsel ``within a reasonable time'' after a case is \n     initiated. But defendants, after their arrest, can spend \n     weeks or even months in jail without a lawyer's help. In a \n     Mississippi case, a woman charged with shoplifting sat in \n     jail for 11 months before a lawyer was appointed.\n        The powerlessness of poor defendants is becoming even more \n     evident under harsh sentencing schemes created in the past \n     few decades. They give prosecutors, who have huge discretion, \n     a strong threat to use, and have led to almost 94 percent of \n     all state criminal cases being settled in plea bargains--\n     often because of weak defense lawyers who fail to push back.\n        The competency of lawyers is, of course, most critical in \n     death penalty cases. In dozens of states, capital cases are \n     routinely handled by poorly paid, inexperienced lawyers. And \n     yet, only very rarely are inmates ever granted a new trial \n     because of incompetent counsel.\n        In a Georgia death penalty case last year, the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that even \n     though the main defense lawyer drank a quart of vodka each \n     night of the trial, there was no need for a retrial. The \n     lawyer was himself preparing to be criminally prosecuted for \n     stealing client funds, and presented very little evidence \n     about the defendant's intellectual disability. But the court \n     said the defendant had a fair trial because proof that he \n     killed a sheriff's deputy outweighed any weakness in his \n     legal representation.\n        In an infamous 1996 Texas death-penalty case, the Texas \n     Court of Criminal Appeals upheld a defendant's death sentence \n     even though his lead counsel slept during the trial.\n        The Supreme Court has made it possible for courts to \n     uphold such indefensible lawyering. In 1984, in Strickland v. \n     Washington, the court said that for a defendant to be \n     entitled to a new trial, he must show both that his lawyer's \n     advice was deficient and that the deficiency deprived him of \n     a fair trial--a very high hurdle. And the court's majority \n     defined competency as requiring only that the lawyer's \n     judgment be ``reasonable under prevailing professional \n     norms.''\n        Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing in dissent, said the \n     result of this empty standard ``is covertly to legitimate \n     convictions and sentences obtained on the basis of \n     incompetent conduct by defense counsel.'' That is exactly \n     what has happened in the past three decades. In fact, \n     incompetent counsel for poor defendants is so widespread that \n     under this standard the prevailing professional norm has been \n     reduced to mediocrity.\n        After 50 years, the promise of Gideon v. Wainwright is \n     mocked more often than fulfilled. In a forthcoming issue of \n     The Yale Law Journal, Stephen Bright, president of the \n     Southern Center for Human Rights in Georgia, and Sia Sanneh, \n     a lawyer with the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama, \n     recommend that all states have statewide public defender \n     systems that train and supervise their lawyers, limit their \n     workloads and have specialized teams in, for example, death-\n     penalty cases.\n        There is no shortage of lawyers to do this work. What \n     stands in the way is an undemocratic, deep-seated lack of \n     political will.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 2013]\n\n50 Years After Landmark Ruling, Lawyer's Help is Legal Fiction for Many \n                            Accused of Crime\n\n                         (By Associated Press)\n\n       Washington.--It is not the happiest of birthdays for the \n     landmark Supreme Court decision that, a half-century ago, \n     guaranteed a lawyer for criminal defendants who are too poor \n     to afford one.\n       A unanimous high court issued its decision in Gideon v. \n     Wainwright on March 18, 1963, declaring that states have an \n     obligation to provide defendants with ``the guiding hand of \n     counsel'' to ensure a fair trial for the accused.\n       But in many states today, taxpayer-funded public defenders \n     face crushing caseloads, the quality of legal representation \n     varies from county to county and people stand before judges \n     having seen a lawyer only briefly, if at all.\n       ``There is no denying that much, much needs to be done,'' \n     Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday at a Justice \n     Department event to commemorate the anniversary.\n       Clarence Earl Gideon had been in and out of jail in his \n     nearly 51 years when he was arrested on suspicion of stealing \n     wine and some money from vending machines at a Panama City, \n     Fla., pool hall in 1961. Gideon asked the judge for a lawyer \n     before his trial, but was turned down. At the time, Florida \n     only provided lawyers for indigent defendants in capital \n     cases.\n       A jury soon convicted Gideon and the state Supreme Court \n     upheld the verdict on appeal. Then, from his Florida prison \n     cell, Gideon scratched out his Supreme Court appeal in pencil \n     on prison stationery. It arrived at the court early in 1962, \n     when the justices were looking for a good case to take on the \n     issue of indigent defense. The court appointed Washington \n     lawyer Abe Fortas, a future justice, to represent him.\n       Just two months after hearing arguments, Justice Hugo Black \n     wrote for the court that ``in our adversary system of \n     criminal justice, any person hauled into court, who is too \n     poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless \n     counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an \n     obvious truth.''\n       Five months later, Gideon got a lawyer and a new trial, and \n     the attorney poked holes in the prosecution's case. A jury \n     quickly returned its verdict: not guilty.\n       So that was the promise of Gideon--that a competent lawyer \n     for the defense would stand on an equal footing with \n     prosecutors, and that justice would prevail, at least in \n     theory.\n       A half-century later, there are parts of the country where \n     ``it is better to be rich and guilty than poor and \n     innocent,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor. Leahy \n     said court-appointed lawyers often are underpaid and can be \n     ``inexperienced, inept, uninterested or worse.''\n       Regardless of guilt or innocence, few of those accused of \n     crimes are rich, while 80 percent say they are too poor to \n     afford a lawyer.\n       People who work in the criminal justice system have become \n     numb to the problems, creating a culture of low expectations, \n     said Jonathan Rapping, a veteran public defender who has \n     worked in Washington, D.C., Atlanta and New Orleans.\n       Rapping remembers walking into a courtroom in New Orleans \n     for the first time for a client's initial appearance before a \n     judge. Several defendants in jump suits were shackled \n     together in one part of the courtroom. The judge moved \n     briskly through charges against each of the men, with a \n     lawyer speaking up for each one.\n       Then he called a name and there was no lawyer present. The \n     defendant piped up. ``The guy said he hadn't seen a lawyer \n     since he was locked up 70 days ago. And no one in the \n     courtroom was shocked. No one was surprised,'' Rapping said.\n       Complaints about the quality of representation also are \n     difficult to sustain, under a high bar that the Supreme Court \n     set in a 1984 case. The relatively few cases in which a \n     lawyer's work is deemed so bad that it violates\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\n     his client's rights typically have an outlandish set of facts \n     that would be funny if the consequences weren't tragic. ``You \n     see too many instances of ineffective assistance of counsel, \n     too many instances where you think, `Was this lawyer crazy?' \n     '' Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan said at the Justice \n     Department event.\n       She recounted a case from last term in which a lawyer \n     advised his client to reject a plea deal with a seven-year \n     prison term and go to trial The lawyer said prosecutors could \n     not prove a charge of intent to murder because the victim had \n     been shot below the waist. 'The defendant was convicted and \n     sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n       Kagan was part of the 5-4 decision in the defendant's \n     favor.\n       In some places, lawyers are overwhelmed by their caseloads. \n     A public defender in Indianapolis lasted less than a year in \n     his job after being asked to represent more than 300 \n     defendants at a time, said Norman Lefstein, former dean of \n     the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.\n       ``A lawyer with an S on his chest for Superman couldn't \n     represent these people. He simply couldn't do it. There are \n     only so many hours in a day. But it's not just caseload. It's \n     the other support services that go along with it,'' including \n     investigators, said Lefstein, who has studied problems in \n     indigent defense for decades.\n       In Luzerne County, in northeastern Pennsylvania, the chief \n     public defender told the local court he would stop accepting \n     certain cases because his office had too many clients, too \n     few lawyers and not enough money. A judge's ruling in June \n     acknowledged the lack of money and manpower, but forbade the \n     defender's office to turn away cases. The judge's ruling was \n     encouraging, Leftein said, but on his last visit to Wilkes-\n     Bane in January he found ``the caseloads are worse than \n     ever.''\n       Eighteen states, including California, Illinois, New York \n     and Pennsylvania, leave the finding of indigent defense \n     entirely to their counties, said Rhoda Billings, a former \n     chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court who has \n     looked at the issue for the American Bar Association. Those \n     states ``have a significant disparity in the appointment of \n     counsel'' from one county to the next, Billings said.\n       Public defenders in those counties often report to elected \n     officials or their appointees, rather than independent boards \n     that are insulated from politics. But even programs run at \n     the statewide level are not free of political influence, \n     Billings said, citing the case of a New Mexico public \n     defender fired by the governor.\n       The lack of independence raises questions about whether \n     decisions are being made in the best interests of clients, \n     Rapping said.\n       The avalanche of cases and politics come together to \n     present a formidable obstacle to alleviating some of the \n     problems that afflict the system in some states. Politicians \n     do not like asking voters for money for indigent defense.\n       ``Arguing for more money to defend criminals is not the \n     easiest way to win a close election,'' said former Vice \n     President Walter Mondale. As Minnesota's attorney general in \n     the early 1960s, Mondale recruited 21 other states to join in \n     a brief urging the court to rule as it did and rejected a \n     plea from Florida to support limits on states' \n     responsibilities to poor defendants.\n       Heralded for its powerful statement about the right to a \n     lawyer, the Gideon decision also left states on their own to \n     pay for the provision of counsel, Lefstein said. ``It came as \n     an unfunded mandate to 50 state governments and that problem \n     endures,'' he said, noting that in England, Parliament \n     provides money to local governments to pay for legal \n     representation of the poor.\n       ``The federal government does next to nothing to support \n     indigent defense in the United States,'' Lefstein said.\n       Since becoming attorney general more than four years ago, \n     Holder has shown a commitment to the issue. He established an \n     ``Access to Justice'' program and made Harvard Law School \n     professor Laurence Tribe its initial director. The department \n     also has sent a few million dollars to defense programs \n     across the country. He announced nearly $2 million in new \n     grants on Friday.\n       The right announced by the Supreme Court 50 years ago only \n     covers criminal cases. It has never been extended to civil \n     matters, although as Mondale pointed out, they can lead to \n     people losing their homes, their families, being confined in \n     a mental institution or being thrown out of the country.\n       To people in those situations, he said, the distinction \n     between criminal and civil law ``doesn't make much of a \n     difference.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Mar. 12, 2013]\n\n               You Have the Right to Counsel. Or Do You?\n\n\n  50 years after the U.S. Supreme Court enshrined the constitutional \n right to a lawyer, budget realities are undermining justice in America\n\n                           (By Rick Hampson)\n\n       Wilkes-Barre, PA.--The first face visitors see when they \n     walk into the public defender's office here is a photo of \n     Clarence Gideon, the drifter, drinker, gambler and thief who \n     became a hero of American jurisprudence.\n       It was in his case, Gideon v. Wainwright, that the Supreme \n     Court ruled 50 years ago this month that everyone accused of \n     a serious crime has a constitutional right to a lawyer, \n     whether they can afford it or not.\n       When he was charged with breaking into a pool hall outside \n     Panama City, Fla., Gideon asked for a court-appointed lawyer. \n     After the judge said no, he represented himself, was found \n     guilty and sentenced to five years. From prison, he appealed \n     to the Supreme Court, which took his case and ordered a new \n     trial.\n       If he came back today, Clarence Gideon might rue the \n     quality of legal representation he'd receive. He might not \n     get any at all.\n       Such was the fate last year of some indigent criminal \n     defendants who walked in the public defender's door here and \n     past Gideon's gaze. They were told that, because of a \n     shortage of staff lawyers, the office was turning down all \n     but the most serious new cases. They were given a letter to \n     show the judge.\n       Al Flora, Luzerne County chief public defender, says that \n     ethically and legally he had no choice: His overburdened \n     lawyers couldn't take on new clients and do justice to those \n     they already had. He sued county officials--his bosses--to \n     let him hire more lawyers and to stop them from retaliating \n     against him.\n       The situation in Luzerne County reflects what experts say \n     is a national crisis in indigent legal defense that has \n     thwarted Gideon's promise of legal equality.\n       Many public defenders are overwhelmed by caseloads, and \n     financially pressed states and counties are levying fees and \n     applying means tests for granting counsel. ``We're not \n     calling the anniversary a celebration,'' says Edwin Burnette \n     of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association. ``There's \n     nothing to celebrate.''\n       Flora is not the only rebel. The Florida Supreme Court is \n     considering a similar attempt by the Miami-Dade County public \n     defender's office to limit its caseload. Last year, the \n     Missouri Supreme Court authorized public defenders with \n     unmanageable caseloads to decline new cases, and the American \n     Bar Association urged states and counties not to fire public \n     defenders who do.\n       The problem is money. An explosion in the number of \n     criminal cases has overwhelmed the indigent defense system, \n     which represents about 80% of all accused.\n       The right to counsel is stronger than ever; it was expanded \n     by the Supreme Court during its last term. Although few in \n     state and county government quarrel with the principle of \n     Gideon, few are eager to cover the ever-growing tab for its \n     realization.\n       That worries advocates on each side of Gideon, including \n     Bruce Jacob, the former Florida assistant attorney general \n     who argued the state's case before the Supreme Court, and \n     former vice president Walter Mondale, who as attorney general \n     of Minnesota in 1963 filed a brief supporting Gideon.\n       ``We're not close to fulfilling the promise of Gideon,'' \n     Jacob says. Although more defendants see a lawyer than 50 \n     years ago, he says, many advocates don't have time to give \n     clients ``effective representation.''\n       Any celebration of the anniversary should be ``subdued,'' \n     Mondale says, because ``we've missed the mark, and we may be \n     going backwards.''\n       Others, while conceding the problem, take a more positive \n     view. ``For the most part, public defenders and prosecutors \n     get it right,'' says Scott Burns, director of the National \n     District Attorneys Association. ``Gideon would celebrate this \n     anniversary.''\n\n\n                    `I AM ENTITLED . . . TO COUNSEL'\n\n       Clarence Gideon was jailed before he was old enough to \n     drive and behind bars for much of his young adulthood. By the \n     time he was 51, he'd been convicted of five felonies, \n     including thefts from a government armory and a country \n     store.\n       His biographer, Anthony Lewis, described him as a ``used-up \n     man'' who looked 15 years older than his age. In a letter, \n     Gideon admitted ``the utter folly and hopelessness'' of much \n     of his life.\n       On Aug. 4, 1961, facing trial on a charge that would send \n     him back to prison, Gideon told the judge, ``The United \n     States Supreme Court says I am entitled to be represented by \n     counsel.''\n       The only problem: It had not, and he was not.\n       Beginning with Betts v. Brady (1942), the court had refused \n     to declare a blanket constitutional right to counsel in non-\n     capital state felony trials unless defendants faced ``special \n     circumstances,'' such as youth, illiteracy or unusually \n     complex issues.\n       Undeterred, the imprisoned Gideon mailed the court a \n     petition for a new trial. Handwritten in pencil on lined \n     prison paper, it began with anachronistic legalese: ``Comes \n     now the petitioner . . .''\n       The court received many petitions like it every week from \n     prisons around the country, but Gideon had two things in his \n     favor.\n       First, he had raised the constitutional issue at trial, \n     which meant he could use it to appeal.\n       Second, he didn't claim special circumstances, and--whether \n     Gideon knew it or not--a majority of the justices already \n     were inclined to jettison Betts v. Brady in favor of a flat \n     constitutional right to counsel.\n       All the court needed was a case on which to rule. And here \n     came Gideon.\n       On March 18, 1963, the court ruled unanimously that \n     Gideon's conviction was unconstitutional because he'd been \n     denied his request for counsel.\n       Justice Hugo Black wrote that in our adversarial justice \n     system, the ``noble idea (that) every defendant stands equal \n     before the law . . . cannot be realized if the poor man \n     charged with a crime has to face his accusers without a \n     lawyer.''\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\n       The case was sent back to Florida, which had quickly \n     established a network of public defenders. But Gideon \n     insisted on a private practitioner, Fred Turner. It was a \n     shrewd choice.\n       Turner interviewed Gideon in jail and spent several days \n     investigating. He checked out the pool hall. He drove to the \n     town where the prosecution witness had been earlier on the \n     night of the crime. He picked pears with the witness's mother \n     in her yard. He became convinced the witness was the \n     perpetrator.\n       The jury took just over an hour: Not guilty. Gideon went \n     out and got a hamburger.\n       The jailbird's name became synonymous with freedom. In \n     Florida alone, 976 prisoners were released because of Gideon; \n     an additional 500 got a new trial.\n       After his release, Gideon stayed out of trouble. He died of \n     cancer in 1972 at 61, too soon to see himself played by Henry \n     Fonda in the 1980 TV movie Gideon's Trumpet.\n       His gravestone in Hannibal, Mo., bears a message drawn from \n     a letter he wrote in prison. It reflects his belief that he \n     was part of something bigger than himself: ``I believe each \n     era finds an improvement in law,'' Gideon wrote. ``Each year \n     brings out something new for the benefit of mankind.''\n\n\n                        ALL WE CAN DO IS TRIAGE\n\n       After the inspirational Gideon v. Wainwright poster in the \n     reception area, it's all downhill in the Luzerne public \n     defender's office.\n       The walls are scuffed, the carpets stained. File folders \n     are stacked on the floor. ``It's a mess,'' admits Al Flora, \n     leading a tour. ``Half the time the secretaries can't find \n     the right file.'' As a result, clients sometimes aren't \n     notified of their court dates.\n       Some of the office's 21 lawyers have no desk or personal \n     phone. The top of a file cabinet serves as a desk for one \n     lawyer. A nightstand in a corner accommodates another.\n       The office, which handles about 4,000 cases a year in this \n     northeastern Pennsylvania county of 320,000, has only four \n     investigators and four secretaries. Lawyers often have to \n     type their own briefs. They have little time to take \n     depositions or seek discovery of prosecution evidence.\n       A third of Flora's lawyers have never tried a case. They're \n     smart and energetic, he says, but so inexperienced that if \n     given a full caseload, ``they'd crack. . . . All we can do is \n     triage cases.''\n       He says some public defenders ``don't want to talk about \n     the problem. I decided to go the other way. This has to \n     stop.''\n       Traditionally, Southern states have had the worst record of \n     giving poor defendants counsel. But Jonathan Rapping, founder \n     of the Southern Public Defender Training Center, says the \n     problem now is more acute in Northeastern jurisdictions with \n     shrunken industrial bases and chronic fiscal woes.\n       That describes Luzerne County, which gets no state funds \n     for public defenders. Last year, Flora's $2.7 million budget \n     was cut 7%, and later--until a judge intervened--a hiring \n     freeze blocked him from filling five lawyers' slots that were \n     budgeted.\n       In six months, he turned away more than 500 applicants for \n     legal counsel, an approach that antagonized county officials. \n     John Dean, a county attorney, has accused Flora of regarding \n     the county as ``nothing more than a checkbook'' and suggested \n     he handle more cases himself.\n       In June, a judge told Flora to resume taking all comers and \n     told the county to let Flora hire more lawyers. Since then, \n     the county has paid for a computerized case management system \n     and promised to find more office space.\n\n\n                         AN EROSION OF JUSTICE\n\n       In the past 18 months, a third of the office's lawyers have \n     left. One was Ed Olexa, 38. He'd read Gideon in law school \n     but didn't bargain for what he found when he became a public \n     defender four years ago.\n       Although he was a $34,000-a-year part-timer--19 hours a \n     week--he usually had 150 to 170 cases, far in excess of the \n     maximum recommended by the American Bar Association for full-\n     time defenders. The cases took up 40 to 50 hours a week. \n     Along with his private cases, he worked up to 70 hours a \n     week.\n       He often was scheduled to appear before two or three \n     different judges at the same time in different places around \n     the county. He'd meet clients for the first time in the \n     courtroom--some straight from jail, still in handcuffs--and \n     go before the judge with only the complaint and a hurried \n     conversation with his client as background.\n       That, he says, was the worst: No time to establish rapport \n     with clients or get the details that can win an acquittal. No \n     time to do what Turner did for Gideon. Instead, he spent his \n     time asking judges for more time. ``It offended my sense of \n     justice,'' he says.\n       And his clients'. He won't discuss their specific \n     complaints but says, ``The best attorney in the world would \n     be incompetent under those circumstances.''\n       Over time, most experts say, the costs are clear. Poor \n     people arrested for misdemeanors plead guilty and go free \n     rather than wait to see a public defender, even though a \n     conviction on their record might hurt their chances for \n     employment, loans or housing. At worst, the innocent go to \n     jail, and the guilty go free.\n       The Luzerne chief public defender is a part-time post; the \n     county plans to make it full time. Flora has applied.\n       ``I want to see it done right,'' he says. ``I believe \n     people who are impoverished and can't afford a lawyer deserve \n     one. If we can't provide that, then what kind of society do \n     we really have?''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Nelson):\n  S. 598. A bill to prohibit royalty incentives for deepwater drilling, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Bill Nelson, the Deepwater Drilling \nRoyalty Relief Prohibition Act.\n  Specifically, the bill prohibits the Interior Department from waiving \nroyalty payments due to American taxpayers as compensation for the oil \nindustry's exploitation of Federal oil and gas resources in waters \nexceeding 400 meters of depth.\n  It is necessary because Congress has established a number of royalty-\nrelief programs for oil and gas production in our deepest Federal \nwaters.\n  However, as the BP Deep water Horizon catastrophe showed, encouraging \nthis most dangerous and often dirty form of oil drilling is not in the \npublic interest.\n  The disastrous impacts of the Deepwater Horizon explosion illustrate \nthe enormous environmental and safety risks of offshore drilling--\nparticularly in deep waters. 11 people died and 17 others were injured \nwhen the Deepwater Horizon caught fire. 5 million barrels of oil gushed \ninto the Gulf of Mexico.\n  It took 9,700 vessels, 127 aircraft, 47,829 people, nearly 2 million \ngallons of toxic dispersants, and 89 days to plug the well and stop the \nflow of oil. And the scope of the disaster was tremendous. Oil slicks \nspread across the Gulf of Mexico, forcing the closing of 40 percent of \nGulf waters to all commercial and recreational fishing. Pelicans and \nother wildlife struggled to free themselves from crude oil. Wildlife \nresponders collected 8,183 birds, 1,144 sea turtles, and 109 marine \nmammals killed or negatively affected by the spill. Many more perished \nand sank to the ocean depths without detection.\n  More than 650 miles of Gulf coastal habitats--including salt marshes, \nmudflats, mangroves, and sand beaches--were oiled. Tar balls spoiled \nthe pristine white sand beaches of Florida, while wetlands were coated \nwith toxic sludge. Oyster beds could take years to recover.\n  The plumes of underwater oil created zones of toxicity for aquatic \nlife. Recent studies have determined the BP spill was ``definitely \nlinked'' to ``widespread signs of distress'' and the slow death of \ndeepwater coral within seven miles of the blowout site.\n  The response techniques, such as the use of dispersants, may have \ntheir own toxic consequences to both wildlife and the spill response \nworkers. A recent report asserts that the mixture of toxic dispersants \nand crude oil has now weathered into tar product, and that the ``unholy \nmix'' is allowing potentially carcinogenic concentrations of organic \npollutants to remain in the environment.\n  The impacts of an oil spill are so dramatic and devastating, it seems \nclear to me that this is not an area in which we should be subsidizing \ndevelopment.\n  In 1969, off Santa Barbara, California, a natural gas blowout caused \nan unprecedented oil spill.\n  The drilling technology 40 years ago was not able to prevent a \ndisaster, nor could it stop the flow of oil, which went on for more \nthan 11 days. Unfortunately, today's technology also cannot prevent \nwell-head blowouts or quickly stop the flow of oil.\n  The Deepwater Horizon drill rig was less than 10 years old when it \ncaused a devastating blow out. A similar rig that caused the 2009 spill \nin the Montara oil and gas field in the Timor Sea--one of the worst in \nAustralia's history--was even newer, designed and built in 2007. That \nspill continued unchecked for 74 days.\n  The failures that led to these catastrophes were human and \ntechnological. But they demonstrate that we are a long way from spill-\nfree offshore oil and gas production technology.\n  In deep waters, the risks are higher and the scope of the damage even \ngreater, because drilling in deep water presents even more challenges \nthan drilling in shallow water or on shore. This was demonstrated \nduring the Deepwater Horizon disaster.\n  Methane hydrate crystals form when methane gas mixes with pressurized \ncold ocean waters--and the likelihood\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nof these crystals forming increases dramatically at a depth of about \n400 meters. These crystals interfere with response and containment \ntechnologies. They formed in the cofferdam dome that was lowered onto \nthe gushing oil in the Gulf, which failed to stop the oil in the early \ndays of the spill.\n  When a remotely operated underwater vehicle bumped the valves in the \n``top hat'' device, the containment cap had to be removed and slowly \nreplaced to prevent formation of these crystals again.\n  In order to drill at deeper depths, many technical difficulties must \nbe overcome. The ocean currents on the surface and in the water column \nexert torque pressure on the pipes and cables, which are longer and \nheavier.\n  The water temperature decreases closer to the sea floor, but the \ntemperature of the ground under the ocean increases the deeper the \nwell--sometimes reaching temperatures in excess of 350 degrees \nFahrenheit.\n  The ocean pressure increases dramatically at depth, but the pressure \nin a well can exceed 10,000 pounds per square inch.\n  Drills must be able to pass through tar and salts, and the well bores \nmust remain intact.\n  The volume of drilling mud and fluids is greater, the weight of the \ncables heavier, and many technical procedures can only be accomplished \nwith the use of remotely operated vehicles thousands of feet below the \nsurface.\n  American taxpayers should not forego revenue in order to incentivize \noffshore drilling at these dangerous depths. It is not good \nenvironmental policy, and it's not good energy policy either. We need \nto move to cleaner renewable fuels.\n  I believe that global warming presents a serious environmental and \neconomic threat--and scientists agree that the biggest culprit of \nglobal warming is manmade emissions produced by the combustion of \nfossil fuels like oil and coal.\n  Taxpayer-funded incentives should be utilized to develop and deploy \nclean energy technologies that address this crisis, instead of \nencouraging the fossil fuels at the root of the problem through oil and \ngas royalty relief.\n  Congress has worked to move in this direction. In 2007, we passed the \nTen in Ten Fuel Economy Act which will raise fuel economy standards for \npassenger vehicles to 54 miles per gallon by 2025.\n  Over the past four years, renewable energy generation in the United \nStates has more than doubled--due in large part to Federal tax \nincentives, financing mechanisms, and a vastly improved permitting \nprocess. In 2012, a whopping 44 percent of new electric generating \ncapacity added to the grid was wind power.\n  The Federal government is helping the United States adopt a cleaner \nenergy future.\n  Royalty relief for dangerous oil and gas development, however, is not \nadvancing this goal.\n  Let me make one final point: oil companies--the primary recipients of \nroyalty relief--do not need taxpayer help. They are already reaping \nrecord profits.\n  Higher gasoline prices are causing families pain at the pump, but \nthey are a boon to the world's five largest oil companies. BP, Chevron, \nConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Shell made a combined $118 billion in \nprofits in 2012, or an average of almost $500 for each car in America.\n  Moreover, the big three publicly owned U.S. oil companies--\nExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips paid effective federal tax \nrates in 2011 of 13 percent; 19 percent; and 18 percent respectively. \nYet we continue to use taxpayer dollars to add to their bottom line. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  Oil reserves under Federal waters are a public resource. When a \nprivate company profits from those public resources, American taxpayers \nshould also benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ensure that \nroyalties owed to the taxpayers are not waived to incentivize risky \noff-shore drilling. In these critical economic times, every cent of the \npeople's money should be spent wisely.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
