Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nthis legislation at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote to end debate \non the farm bill conference report. I expect the Senate to conclude \nwork on this measure, which will reduce the deficit and protect hungry \nfamilies. This will happen, as I indicated, tomorrow afternoon.\n  Passing this legislation will support our Nation's farmers and \nranchers and more than 16 million jobs in the farm industry. Ensuring \nthat our farms remain the most productive in the world and protecting \nAmerican agricultural jobs is vital for our economic recovery. I have \nbeen in the Senate and the House for a while, as has the chairman of \nthe agriculture committee, the junior Senator from Michigan, so I have \nseen people handle legislation. The work done by Senator Stabenow has \nbeen remarkably good. It is exemplary for her to work to the point \nwhere we are now going to pass this important legislation. I look \nforward, as she does, to a strong bipartisan vote on cloture tonight \nand on the passage of the bill tomorrow.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  As we continue to work toward final passage of the farm bill, a \nbipartisan group of Senators has been working behind the scenes to \nreach an agreement to restore emergency unemployment benefits to 1.6 \nmillion people. In the 3 weeks since the Republicans filibustered a \nbill to extend this important program, 220,000 more Americans lost \ntheir benefits. State economies across the country have suffered as \nunemployed people, who are already getting by on so little, had to find \nways to survive on even less.\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\n  When unemployment benefits dry up, customers disappear from local \nstores and businesses suffer. More than $2.2 billion has been drained \nfrom State economies since the emergency unemployment insurance \nexpired.\n  Nevada alone lost $29 million in economic activity just last month, \nand $28 million has drained from the economy in the Republican leader's \nhome State of Kentucky since the emergency benefits expired on December \n31. It is no wonder two-thirds of Americans--including 65 percent of \nIndependents--believe we should extend unemployment assistance. Helping \nneighbors who have been hit hard is not only the compassionate thing to \ndo, it is also the smart thing to do for our economy.\n  Economists say there is no way to stimulate the economy more than to \ngive these people who don't have jobs some money because they are going \nto spend it.\n  Since Republicans filibustered a bill to restore benefits without \nadding a penny to the deficit--that legislation would not have added a \npenny to the deficit--the toll on local and national economies has been \ndevastating, but the toll on unemployed Americans has been \nimmeasurable.\n  For people who worked all of their lives and lost their job through \nno fault of their own, being unemployed is difficult enough, but \nworrying about how to pay the rent, put gas in the car, and buy \ngroceries while they look for a new job can be demoralizing. For the \nlong-term unemployed, some of those who have been struggling to find \nwork for more than a year, $300 a week in unemployment benefits can be \nthe difference between keeping a roof over their heads or becoming \nhomeless, and this is no hyperbole.\n  A 57-year-old Nevada woman wrote to me last week to say that the loss \nof her unemployment check was the last straw. Now she is homeless and \ncouch surfing. She is sleeping on the couches of friends kind enough to \ntake her in.\n  This is what she wrote:\n\n       Can you imagine sleeping on friends' couches at my age? Can \n     you imagine having to sell everything you worked hard for \n     just to keep gas in the car in the event someone calls for an \n     interview?\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       I have worked my whole life, since I was 16 years old, and \n     contributed to a system that is now failing me on a major \n     scale.\n\n  Millions of people--such as this unfortunate Nevada woman--who have \nworked hard all of their lives and contributed to their communities and \nplayed by the rules are on the verge of losing everything, just like \nher. It doesn't have to be this way.\n  I remain cautiously optimistic that Republicans will heed their \nconstituents back home and help Democrats restore emergency benefits to \nAmericans in need.\n  Congress can't solve every problem, but we can solve this problem. \nAll we have to do is work together--Democrats and Republicans--to do \nwhat is right for our constituents, our country, and our economy.\n  I urge Republicans to join us to restore these crucial benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/03/senate-section/article/S666-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Will the chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, as we begin the final debate and \nvote on the farm bill conference report, I thank our majority leader \nfor supporting this effort every step of the way. Every time I have \ngone to him and said, Mr. Leader, we need to have time for some \nparticular procedural vote or to move it along, he has been there. So I \nthank him very much for moving this conference report so quickly.\n  I also thank Senator Cochran and our entire committee. When Senator \nCochran is here later today, I will speak more about the wonderful \npartnership we have had. The senior Senator from North Dakota will be \nspeaking after me. I thank, Senator Hoeven for being an invaluable \npartner through this entire process. It has been a tremendous pleasure \nworking with the senior Senator, and he has made a real impact. I am \nvery appreciative.\n  As my colleagues know, the last farm bill expired 490 days ago. It is \ntime to get it done. It is time to pass this tomorrow and to give it to \nthe President for his signature.\n  This is not your father's farm bill. This farm bill is focused on the \nfuture, not the past. We worked long and hard to make sure that \npolicies worked for every region of the country, for all of the \ndifferent kinds of agricultural production we do in our country--from \ntraditional row crops, to specialty crops like fruits and vegetables, \nto livestock, to organics, to local food systems.\n  For the past 2\\1/2\\ years, we have been working in a bipartisan way \nwith colleagues in the Senate and in the House, and I appreciate our \npartnership with the chairman and ranking member in the House to craft \na farm bill that reflects the future in American agriculture and the \nhealthy food choices that consumers are asking for in the marketplace.\n  As we begin this final debate, I want to focus for a few minutes on \nsome of what people might not be focused on in this bill. Later today I \nam going to speak about the bill and each of its parts.\n  There are just five things I wanted to highlight as we begin this \ndebate.\n  First, conservation. The farm bill is actually our country's largest \ninvestment in land and water conservation on private lands, which are \nthe majority of our American lands. That means we are restoring and \npreserving wildlife habitat and open spaces. We help farmers reduce \nrunoff to help keep rivers and streams clean and teeming with fish. \nThis bill includes a historic new agreement that ties conservation \ncompliance to crop insurance.\n  This bill helps prevent plowing of native grasses through a provision \ncalled Sod Saver that will save taxpayers money and preserve sensitive \nhabitat for years to come.\n  Second, energy jobs. This farm bill has major investments in American \nenergy independence. I am very proud to say this conference report \ncontains the full $880 million investment we passed in the Senate for \nrenewable and clean energy. It includes my Grow it Here, Make it Here \ninitiative to support innovative biobase manufacturing that takes crops \ngrown on our farms, uses it to replace petroleum and other chemicals, \nand transforms them into consumer products.\n  It contains the Rural Energy for America Program, known as REAP, to \nhelp farmers install on-farm renewable energy and energy efficiency \nsystems to lower their energy usage. This bill supports the development \nof the next generation of biofuels, including new technologies using \nfood and agricultural waste.\n  Third, healthy foods. One of the incentivized programs in this bill, \namong others, is a successful program in Michigan called Double Up Food \nBucks, which essentially doubles food assistance when a family is \nshopping for produce at a farmers' market. Speaking of which, we have \nquadrupled support for farmers' markets--four times more help than the \nprevious farm bill. That means farmers have more choices to find fresh, \nlocally grown foods, and it means farmers have more opportunities to \nsell those products and grow our rural economies.\n\n  Fourth, research. Crops and livestock are affected by pests and \ndiseases, and\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\nif we are going to continue to be the world's leader in food \nproduction, we need to invest in order to fight back.\n  Unfortunately, for years we have had to cut funding for critical \nresearch, and that has been a great concern of mine and of all of our \ncommittee. This farm bill includes an innovative solution to that \nproblem. It creates a new agricultural research foundation modeled \nafter health research foundations to bring private and public dollars \ntogether to support our scientists all across the country who are \nworking to fight pests, find cures for crop diseases, and focus on food \nsafety and innovation.\n  Finally, reform. This farm bill contains the greatest reforms to \nagricultural programs in decades. We have finally ended direct payment \nsubsidies, which are given to farmers in good times and bad. Instead, \nwe shift to a responsible, risk management approach that only gives \nfarmers assistance when they experience a loss.\n  The bill also ends farm payments to millionaires, addresses a \nloophole that allows people who aren't farming to get payments, and \ntightens payment limits with a cap on payments that, for the first \ntime, includes all commodity title programs, including limits on \nmarketing loans. We looked at every part of the farm bill for reform \nand savings. It is safe to say we are the only area of the Federal \nGovernment that has voluntarily cut spending in our own area of \njurisdiction. Counting sequestration cuts, we made a commitment to \nachieve $23 billion in deficit reduction, and we have.\n  I have spoken about five reasons to support the farm bill. There are \nmany more. This farm bill reflects a major step forward in creating a \nnew paradigm for the future and a real victory for farmers, families, \nand all Americans who care about protecting our soil and water \nresources, increasing American energy independence, and the quality of \nlife of rural communities across our country.\n  With that, at this time, so that other colleagues may speak, I yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering the \nconference report to H.R. 2642.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent to proceed on my leader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Presidential Action\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in his State of the Union speech last \nweek, President Obama promised America a year of action. He said he \nwants to use his pen and his phone to make it happen. Here is what I \nsay: The President should use that pen and that phone of his today for \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline and the jobs that will be created almost \nimmediately.\n  Here is something both parties can agree on. I see my colleague from \nNorth Dakota here, and nobody has been more aggressively advocating the \nKeystone Pipeline than he has. This is an important shovel-ready \nproject for America. Here is the President's chance to work with \nRepublicans on a bipartisan plan to create thousands--literally \nthousands--of private sector jobs almost immediately. Here is his \nchance to show he is not captive to the ideological extremists on the \nleft. Here is his chance for action on a policy the American people \nactually want. Here is his chance.\n  On Friday, the State Department released yet another report \nconcluding what the President and everyone else already knew. The \nKeystone XL would meet the President's stated requirements on the \nenvironment, and there was basically no good reason not to build it.\n  So here is a project that essentially wouldn't cost the taxpayers a \ndime to build, that would have almost no net environmental effect, and \nthat would put thousands of Americans to work right away. It is an \ninitiative that is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans. \nIt is supported by unions, by businesses, by Republicans, by \nIndependents, and even by prominent Democrats--close to 20 right here \nin the Senate alone. Yet the President has delayed and delayed for more \nthan 5 years now, not because the project really needs to be studied \nfurther but because of pressure from the most doctrinaire fringe of the \ndoctrinaire left.\n  These are the kinds of folks who care a lot more about ideology than \nwhat makes sense for the middle class. Yet these are the same folks who \nhave a lot of influence in today's Democratic Party. Just look at the \nwar on coal--a war that is being waged with scant concern for the lives \nof people who live in States such as Kentucky where people are really \nhurting, and it doesn't seem to matter much to these folks.\n  So here is the thing. The President has run out of excuses on \nKeystone. It is way past time to make a decision. Let's be honest: This \ndecision shouldn't be a hard one at all because the science, the \neconomics, and common sense all basically point in one direction. As \nfar as I can tell, ideology is really the only thing that could lead to \na different decision.\n  So is President Obama on the side of the middle class or is he on the \nside of leftwing special interests? He needs to use that pen to show us \nwhere he stands, and he really ought to do it today.\n  While he is at it, he should pick up the phone too because in his \nState of the Union Address the President called on Congress to help \nbreak down trade barriers that stand in the way of more American jobs. \nHe called for legislation that would help prevent foreign countries \nfrom taking the trade jobs that should be going to America's middle \nclass.\n  ``China and Europe aren't standing on the sidelines,'' he said, and \n``neither should we,'' he said. Republicans applauded him for that. He \nis absolutely right. But now the President's own party is standing in \nthe way of getting anything done. So if there ever was a moment for the \nPresident to use his phone, this is it because trade should be a \nbipartisan issue. It sure used to be. Just ask President Clinton.\n  America's middle class is hurting. The very least Washington can do \nfor them is to approve job-creating initiatives such as Keystone and \nenhancing American exports. So we will see soon enough if the President \nmeant what he said about his pen and his phone--if his year of action \nwill really be just that instead of another tired slogan.\n  The answer is pretty simple. The President needs to step up and lead. \nMiddle class Americans have taken a back seat to the hard left \nextremists in this town for entirely too long. It is time for the \nPresident to stand up to these folks and to do the right thing. Pick up \nthat phone and that pen and get this done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, it is interesting that I follow our \nminority leader who spoke about the Keystone XL Pipeline issue, as well \nas the chairman of the agriculture committee in the Senate, the \nesteemed Senator from Michigan Ms. Stabenow, who has done such a \nmarvelous job of leading the farm bill.\n  The role of Congress is to govern. The people of this great country--\nmore than 300 million people, and the country that leads the world--\nsend us here to govern. To govern, we have to join together on a \nbipartisan basis to get something done. Solutions, by their nature--\nparticularly solutions to complex problems--are never perfect. There \nare no perfect solutions. But we are elected to join together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and solve problems; to put together \nsolutions, although not perfect, that will meet the challenges this \ngreat Nation faces.\n  Regarding energy, I echo the sentiments of the minority leader. I \nhave worked on the Keystone project for more than 5 years now, first as \na Governor and now as a Senator, and we have tremendous bipartisan \nsupport on that project and we need to move forward. The minority \nleader is right on point.\n  I come today to talk about what I believe we are on the cusp of \nmoving forward on, something we have worked on very hard, particularly \nthese last 2 years, and that is the farm bill. I wish to begin by \nthanking and commending the Senator from Michigan who is the chairman \nof the Senate agriculture committee, who has worked with unbelievable \ndedication and who has truly shown the spirit of bipartisanship I am \nspeaking about.\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\n  So I begin by thanking our chairman Senator Stabenow, who has worked \nwith Democrats and Republicans. She has continually reached across the \naisle not only to her ranking member, the good and senior Senator from \nMississippi Mr. Cochran, but also to our counterparts in the House, \nincluding Representative Frank Lucas, who is the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee in the House, and Representative Collin Peterson, \nwho is the minority member in the House. One is from Oklahoma and one \nis from Minnesota. So north and south, east and west, across this great \ncountry, Republicans, Democrats, Senators and House Members, and our \nchairman have worked to fashion a product that truly is a compromise \nbut which is a vital solution we need to put in place and we need to \nput it in place now for our farmers and ranchers.\n  I will begin with this chart, and I have to say it is the only one I \nbrought. It is the same chart I am going to end up with. I am going to \ntalk about the farm bill for a few minutes, but here is why a farm bill \nis so important. It is not just that it is so important to our farmers \nand ranchers; it is important to every single American and beyond, for \nthese simple reasons: The farmers and ranchers we have in this country \nproduce the highest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world--the \nhighest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world.\n  That is what we are talking about. When we talk about good farm \npolicy, we are talking about something that benefits every single \nAmerican every single day.\n  Somebody can say, Oh, well, gee, we don't need a farm bill. Don't \nworry about the farm bill; just let the farmers and ranchers do it the \nway they do and we will see what happens. Really? That is what we \nshould do? We should take a chance on not having the kind of sound farm \nprogram we have now, when we have the highest quality, lowest cost food \nsupply in the world, in the history of the world, that benefits every \nsingle American every single day? We should say, Oh, let's not worry \nabout that; let's just let it go and see what happens? I don't think \nthat is a very good argument.\n  So let's talk about this farm bill that is so important to every \nsingle American. Sixteen million jobs in this country, either directly \nor indirectly, rely on agriculture. We have a favorable balance of \ntrade in agriculture, and we have a net worth of farmers and ranchers \nacross this country who do an amazing job every single day.\n  I am going to start out by talking about the fact that we actually \nsaved money. We saved more than $23 billion. So think about it. Here is \na mandatory spending program where we strengthen the farm program, we \nimprove it, we make it more cost-effective, and we save $23 billion to \nreduce the deficit and the debt. How about we go through every other \nprogram in government and see how we make it better and reduce \nspending. Because when we do that, then we will have done what we are \ntalking about here with the farm bill. It seems like a good idea.\n  I see the good Senator from Montana on the floor and the Senator from \nSouth Dakota as well as the esteemed Senator from Michigan, and they \nwill tell us the same. Here we are reforming a mandatory spending \nprogram and we are reducing the cost while strengthening the program. \nIt seems like what we ought to be doing.\n  I know some folks will come here today and say, Gee, it could be \nbetter because of this or that, or we should have done this or that, \nand go right back into the same old gridlock and, I guess, argue for \nhaving yet another extension on a farm bill that expired over a year \nago and should have been done a long time ago. We provide a better \nprogram with savings of more than $23 billion to help reduce the \ndeficit and the debt.\n  What did we focus on in this bill to make it more cost-effective and \nto make it better? As our chairman on the agriculture committee said, \nwe eliminate direct payments. People want to talk about reforms. We \neliminate direct payments for the first time in a long time--more than \n$50 billion in direct payments--and we replace it with something that \nis much more cost-effective. We replace it with strengthened crop \ninsurance so that farmers and ranchers can insure like other small \nbusinesses across this country to manage risk, even though they operate \nin an environment where they certainly can't control the risks. When we \ntalk about weather, whenever we are putting in a crop and then waiting \nto see what the weather will be, that is a very difficult proposition. \nSo we worked with them on crop insurance so they can try to insure the \nsame way other types of businesses insure. That is much more cost-\neffective than the old direct payments. As our chairman said a minute \nago, those direct payments were going out good years and bad, whether \nfarmers and ranchers needed them or not. Now it is insurance, the way \nother businesses work.\n\n  We give them an option. We give them a countercyclical program called \nthe price loss coverage that works on a countercyclical basis. So if \ntimes are tough, if prices are low, if they need help, they get help. \nAnd if times are good and prices are high and they have a good crop, \nthey do not get help. That is cost effective.\n  We have tried to design it so we generate real savings--more than $23 \nbillion--but if it works as we hope, it will generate more savings so \nwe will continue to have the highest quality, lowest cost food supply \nin the world, continue to support a growing job base--16 million and \ngrowing--continue to help us in our balance of trade by creating a \nfavorable balance of trade for this country in agriculture, and we hope \nwith the reforms made we will continue to help reduce the deficit and \nthe debt.\n  We also provide strong support for livestock. I think perhaps the \nSenator from South Dakota will tell you about a terrible storm that \noccurred earlier this winter. This has been a tough winter across the \ncountry. But for livestock producers out in the Midwest--in South \nDakota, in my home State of North Dakota, and other areas--thousands \nand thousands of cattle were killed in an early blizzard. We provide \nhelp and support for those cattlemen.\n  We continue to provide other programs that will help them market not \nonly here in our country but overseas, to continue to build that \nfavorable balance of trade for our country.\n  In the dairy program--and it was very important to get agreement in \nthe House; this is yet another example of how the conferees had to work \nto strike the right balance between what everybody wanted, Republican \nand Democrat, to come up with a program we could get support on--there \nis no supply management in the dairy program. It helps our smaller \ndairy producers with an insurance type product, and the cost of the \npremium increases with higher levels of production by the dairy \nproducers. So it is designed the way that I think everybody should feel \nis a fair basis, where, again, when our smaller dairy producers need \nhelp, it is there, but it is cost effective and it is done without \nsupply management.\n  The conservation title--again, the Senator from Michigan talked about \nthe importance of conservation--is an example where we had \ndisagreement. Right. This goes to the heart of what is in this farm \nbill. Here is an example--as I have said, our chairman did a marvelous \njob on the ag committee, working with our ranking member and everyone \nelse--on conservation, I have to say, I had some different ideas than \nwhat is in the final compromise bill. I felt that crop insurance and \nconservation should have remained decoupled. But they are not. They are \ncoupled in the final product. But, to make things work, again we sought \nand found compromise. We made changes in the bill that truly make the \nconservation provisions much more farmer friendly.\n  What do I mean by that? I mean it is not retroactive. It is forward \nlooking. The conservation rules in the bill apply going forward. They \ndo not go back retroactively to the start of the last farm bill. That \nis very important. You cannot put people in a situation where they are \nbeing forced to go out and change their farm or ranch on a retroactive \nbasis. That is also very important.\n  Another provision we were able to include in the report language is \nmitigation. Farmers and ranchers do a tremendous job on conservation. I \nlove to hunt and I love to fish. My wife likes to fish even more. But \nwhen I am out there hunting, I see what is going on, I see who is \ntaking care of the land and making sure the water is there, the\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\ncover is there, the food is there for wildlife--deer, birds.\n  For any conservation program to be truly effective, you have to \nenlist the farmers' and ranchers' support so the conservation community \nand farmers and ranchers are working together in a way that works for \nthose individuals, those business people, those families, those farmers \nand ranchers who are out there making their living. Every day they are \nout there. They are not just out there once in a while. They are not \njust out there sometimes, as I am when I go out hunting. They are out \nthere all the time making it work. So these provisions have to work for \nthem.\n  That is why when we talk mitigation, the mitigation rules have to \nwork for the people who own the land--the farmers and ranchers. That is \nwhy we have worked to include language that makes sure USDA is focused \non an acre-for-acre approach, as long as there is reasonable and \ncommensurate value, and we set up a fund to help them do that.\n  I think we achieved a good result. All of the wildlife groups, the \nconservation groups, and the hunting groups are on board. They are \nendorsing this bill. Even the NRA is endorsing this bill. There is \nstrong support from conservation groups, from hunting groups, fishing \ngroups, wildlife groups.\n  But at the same time, I think we have provisions that truly make it \nfarmer friendly so that it works for our farmers and our ranchers. I \nknow that was something we had to work on very hard to get to but is \nvitally important.\n  The bill has a strong energy title. We included and, in fact, \nstrengthened the beginning farmer and the beginning rancher provisions.\n  I want to end on reform. Clearly, with our debt and deficit, it is \nvitally important we find ways to achieve savings. So as we go through \nall the discretionary spending programs--which is one-third of the \nFederal budget--we have to find savings. We are working to do that.\n  Since I have been here, we have reduced discretionary spending from \n$1.35 trillion to roughly $1 trillion. Since the beginning of 2011--\ndiscretionary spending at that time was $1.35 trillion--this year and \nnext year, it will be about $1 trillion. So you can see we have reduced \ndiscretionary spending about 35 percent--and over this 5-year stretch--\nand that is without counting inflation.\n  But two-thirds of the government is mandatory spending. Two-thirds is \nmandatory spending programs. So we have to find ways to make revisions \nso we protect and preserve the programs that are vital to us, such as \nMedicare and Social Security, but we also have to find ways to take \nthese mandatory programs and find savings and reforms as we do here in \nthis farm bill.\n  So when we talk about eliminating direct payments, when we talk about \npayment limitations that for the first time apply to everything, \nwhether you are getting the ARC program--the ag risk coverage--or the \nprice loss coverage program, as in your farming operation, whether it \nis the marketing loan program, your total payments cannot exceed \n$125,000.\n\n  That is the first time we have had a cap that applies to everything. \nRight. We have had caps before, but they did not apply to everything. \nThat is a real reform. You are going to hear others come down and say: \nWell, gee, it should have been better. It should have been like this. \nBut I am telling you, we have not had one that applied to everything \nbefore where you truly had a cap.\n  So when we talk about eliminating direct payments, when we talk about \na cap that applies to everything, that is a real reform. Furthermore, \nwe have an AGI limit--adjusted gross income limit--that also applies to \neverything for the first time, just like the payment limit. Right now, \nif you make $900,000 or more, you do not get any program assistance. \nBefore, again, it did not apply across the board. That is real reform.\n  I think in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--where we \nknew it would be tough to come up with a compromise--clearly, there \nwere differences of opinion on each side of the aisle and between the \nSenate and the House. Here again, I commend the leaders of our \nconference committee--Senator Stabenow, Senator Cochran, Representative \nLucas, and Representative Peterson--and the members of the conference \ncommittee. There was a lot of work to do in this conference committee.\n  To get an agreement on food stamps, on SNAP, supplemental nutrition \nassistance payments, was no small effort or accomplishment. Again, like \nall compromises, if you look at it, it really is fair to both sides. \nThe compromise itself--based on the reforms we made in LIHEAP and \ngetting the States to truly make sure we do not have waste, fraud, and \nabuse, but that people who need help get help--we have truly \nstrengthened those provisions. The scoring by CBO is about an $8 \nbillion reduction. But again, we get our economy going. These kinds of \nreforms will generate more savings while still ensuring people who need \nhelp get help.\n  If you look at that number, then it is very close to what the Senate \nsaid they had to have. So for those who are in that camp, they should \nfeel this is a bill they can support. That is a fair compromise. On the \nHouse side, where clearly there was a desire to have a significantly \nlarger number, if you look at this as a two-step process, where you \ntake the savings that come out of expiration of the stimulus program--\nwhere there was about $11 billion in savings--and combine it with the \nreforms we made here--the $11 billion and the $8 billion; $19 billion--\nthat was $20 billion. That was close to the House's original number.\n  Like all good compromises, it is fair and it does seek to get the \nkind of reforms that I think the American public wants to make sure \nthere is not waste, fraud, or abuse in the Food Stamp Program, but for \nthose who need help, they get that help.\n  Again, I commend not only the leadership in the ag committee but also \nthe leadership in the House and the Senate for recognizing that it is \ntime to put a solution in place for the American people. Again, no \nsolution is perfect. But we cannot continue to operate with an expired \npolicy that not only does not give our farmers and ranchers the \ncertainty they need to continue to produce the highest quality, lowest \ncost food supply, which benefits every single American, but where we do \nnot achieve the very savings and reforms that we have been sent here by \nthe American people to achieve.\n  So it is time to vote. We will vote on this farm bill. There was a \nvery strong vote in the House--250 to 160--a strong bipartisan support \non both sides of the aisle. The Senate needs to step up now and put \nthis solution in place for the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to support the farm bill conference report. It has taken a \nlong time to get to this point, with several unnecessary roadblocks \nalong the way, but we are finally near the finish line, and it is time \nwe conclude this process. I commend Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member \nCochran, Chairman Lucas, and Ranking Member Peterson for their \nleadership in developing this reasonable conference report.\n  The Agricultural Act of 2014 will reduce the deficit, restructure our \nag support programs, continue to feed the hungry, aid livestock \nproducers hit by the Atlas blizzard, and enable consumers to know from \nwhere their food comes.\n  This conference report certainly is not perfect. As with any \nlegislation that is this important and far-reaching, it is impossible \nto fully satisfy everybody. But this is a reasonable compromise.\n  Our ranchers will benefit significantly from this bill. Not only does \nthis compromise enable country-of-origin labeling to continue as well \nas maintain USDA's ability to ensure a fair and transparent \nmarketplace, but it also contains critical livestock disaster \nassistance programs to help ranchers in my State who are still \nrecovering from the 2012 drought and last year's terrible blizzard. My \nranchers lost tens of thousands of livestock, and they have been left \nhanging because of congressional inaction. With passage, they will \nfinally be able to get the aid they need.\n  Beyond the important assistance for livestock producers, this bill \nalso reforms our farm programs by eliminating direct payments and by \nstrengthening the crop insurance program. It also offers key support \nfor\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\nyoung and beginning farmers and ranchers, and it contains reasonable \nconservation compliance requirements for farm program and crop \ninsurance eligibility.\n  This legislation represents more than just assistance to our farmers \nand ranchers. It is also a jobs bill. It contains mandatory funding for \nseveral energy and rural development programs, and it will help USDA \ndeal with the huge backlog of pending rural water and wastewater \ninfrastructure applications.\n  Hundreds of rural communities across the country, including Aberdeen, \nWatertown, and Brookings in South Dakota will also continue to be \neligible for rural housing programs as a result of a provision I \nincluded in the Senate-passed farm bill that is maintained in this \nconference report.\n  I would also like to highlight the provisions to address some key \nforestry issues important to the fight against the pine beetle in the \nBlack Hills. This bill provides the Forest Service and private forest \nlandowners with critically needed tools and flexibility. This includes \npermanently authorizing stewardship contracting to combine timber \nharvests with needed conservation work, building on the Mountain Pine \nBeetle Response Project in the Black Hills by streamlining activities \nto combat insect and disease epidemics, and clarifying the forestry \nexemption to Clean Water Act permitting. These changes provide needed \ncertainty for both private and public forest managers.\n  While I am overall very pleased with this conference report, there \nare some disappointments. The senior Senator from Iowa and I have \nworked for years for meaningful payment limitations. In fact, we were \nable to include in the Senate bill a hard cap on payments as well as \nnew language to define farm program eligibility requirements. The House \nbill includes nearly identical language. However, this conference \nreport actually loosens payment caps and it punts the decision of \ndefining ``actually engaged'' to the Secretary of Agriculture. This is \nfrustrating. However, moving forward, I will urge USDA to follow the \nintent of the Senate and House bills with respect to farm program \neligibility when it undertakes rulemaking.\n  Even though I am not fully pleased with everything in this conference \nreport, I think it does represent a compromise. As such, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in passing the bill. If we do not, food prices \nwill rise, ranchers in my State will be forced out of business, and we \nwill not get the deficit reduction or reforms to our farm programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the importance of \npassing this farm bill that is in front of us, but I not only speak as \na Senator, I also speak as a farmer, someone who is involved in \nproduction agriculture. When I am not wearing a suit and casting votes \nor traveling around the State finding out what is on the minds of \nMontanans, I am farming. From planting to harvesting, to accessing \nseed, to hauling food to the market, I know firsthand the life in \nproduction agriculture.\n  I know that whether you are a farmer or rancher or forester, it can \nbe very tough because there is a lot of uncertainty--uncertainty I \nwitnessed firsthand last summer when I visited the fields of Montana's \nGallatin Valley, a valley that was devastated by a hailstorm literally \nhours before harvest was to begin, or the uncertainty caused by the \nblizzard that cost South Dakota thousands of cattle this last fall.\n  Farmers and ranchers understand and accept that uncertainty is a fact \nof life because we deal with weather; they know it is part of what \ncomes with being in production agriculture, but what they cannot accept \nand what they should not accept is a Federal Government that takes 6 \nyears in drafting a 5-year farm bill. We do not need that kind of \nuncertainty. That is why we need to pass the farm bill we have today.\n  When I talk to my fellow producers in Montana and around the country, \nthey tell me the lack of a long-term farm bill is preventing them from \nmaking critical business decisions. Without a long-term farm bill, \nfarmers do not know what crop insurance is going to look like. They do \nnot know what to expect from future farm loans. It is hard to plan \nahead or expand operations. You cannot even do the simple business \nplanning without that farm bill.\n  Many of us in the Senate got our start in business and know the \nimportance of a predictable business environment. Farming and \nagriculture is no different. You need certainty to grow and to prosper. \nThe fact is the lack of a long-term farm bill is hurting economies from \nMontana to Maine. Folks need and are demanding a responsible long-term \nfarm bill. I think it is time for the Senate to do the right thing; \nthat is, pass the 5-year farm bill.\n  But I am not encouraging folks to vote for this bill just for the \nsake of certainty. They should also vote for it because I think it \nstrengthens the hands of farmers, ranchers, American families who \ndepend on them. Livestock owners will see many benefits from this farm \nbill. This 5-year plan makes livestock disaster assistance programs \npermanent and retroactive, helping those South Dakota ranchers whom I \nspoke of a minute ago to recoup their October losses as well as Montana \nranchers who lost cattle to drought back in 2012.\n  All in all, livestock owners will be better able to manage risks, \nimprove production, and meet the new challenges because of this bill. \nWhen it comes to farmers, this bill removes the term limits on USDA-\nguaranteed farm loans so farmers can continue to access credit at banks \nin rural communities.\n  It also provides more support for farmers and ranchers just getting \ntheir start in agriculture. In rural America we need more young \nproducers willing to get up and work hard, keep small family farms and \nranches going. This bill is a positive step for beginning farmers and \nranchers.\n  Conserving land is another critical issue across this country, \nparticularly rural America. Farmers and ranchers are the true stewards \nof the land. This bill continues that proud American tradition. By \nimproving portions of the Conservation Reserve Program--or Sodbuster--\nthis farm bill supports our outdoor economy by working with farmers and \nranchers to preserve more native prairie for wildlife habitat.\n  That is good news for the hunters and anglers of this country. \nMontana is no exception. It is good news for folks who sell rifles and \nwaders and the guides who show our hunters and anglers where to fish \nand where to hunt. All in all, this great outdoor economy adds up to $6 \nbillion in the State of Montana alone.\n\n  This bill also includes an extension of PILT payments to rural \ncommunities that cannot generate enough revenue from lands that are \ncontrolled by the Federal Government. This is a big deal in rural \nAmerica. It continues strong country-of-origin labeling so consumers \nknow where their meat was born, raised, and processed, giving them the \noption to buy U.S.-made meat if they so choose.\n  The big multinational meat-packing firms may not like it, but for \nAmerican ranchers it is critically important, as it is for consumers. \nWhy? Because Americans know we produce the finest beef in the world. \nThis 5-year farm bill takes all of these positive steps while saving \ntaxpayers $23 billion by making tough choices in the nutrition \nassistance program and changing how we apply farm subsidies.\n  Chairman Stabenow and Ranking Member Cochran have written a \ncommonsense bill that is supported across our agricultural community. I \nwish to thank them for that. In an era when too many folks look for \nreasons to vote no instead of yes, it takes strong and determined \nleaders to bring a responsible, bipartisan bill such as this to the \nfloor. That is why--because I am in production agriculture especially--\nthe work that Chairman Stabenow and Ranking Member Cochran did for the \nAmerican farmers and ranchers needs to be commended.\n  That commitment is going to keep America's rural economy strong. The \nSenators from Michigan and Mississippi are the reason this bill is \nfinally at the finish line. Thanks to them, we are on the verge of \napproving a bipartisan bill that will strengthen production agriculture \nand support families, farmers, and ranchers across this country.\n  My wife and I took over our family's farm in north central Montana in \n1978.\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\nWe had land and we had a strong work ethic, but we had little else. So \nwith some hard work and a few good decisions and weather that \ncooperated, our farm is doing pretty well right now. Our story can be \nrepeated across rural America. But production agriculture will only be \nstrong if it has the certainty that comes with a commonsense, long-term \nfarm bill. That is what is in front of us, a bill that lets farmers and \nranchers know how to plan ahead, how to make their books balance, a \nbill that lets the distributors allocate resources and make sound \nbusiness decisions, and a bill that takes responsible steps to \nstrengthen programs that are working and ending others that are not.\n  Let's not leave farmers and ranchers and all Americans who depend on \nthem high and dry again. With strong support for production \nagriculture, with strong support for a nutrition program, and with a \nbill that saves taxpayers significant dollars, it is time to vote yes \nand send this farm bill to the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before the Senator from Montana leaves \nthe floor, I wish to thank him for his wise counsel throughout the \nprocess of writing the farm bill. It is nice to have a farmer in the \nSenate who can give practical ideas and reactions. This is somebody who \nhas been out there fighting for the farmer, small farmers, to be able \nto make sure they have the same shot to be successful as the big \nproducers.\n  I thank Senator Tester not only for his support, but he has a very \nkey voice in supporting farmers and ranchers across the country. I very \nmuch appreciate his counsel as we bring this effort to conclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time during quorum calls be equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The legislative clerk proceeded to \ncall the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Agricultural Act of 2014 is the \nculmination of a lot of hard work by our conferees, Representatives \nMike Rogers and Martha Roby from Alabama, as well as my colleagues in \nthe Senate, Senators Stabenow and Cochran and others.\n  This important legislation contains a number of commendable measures. \nDuring my time in the Senate, I have been a strong supporter of \nAlabama's farmers and believe this legislation does make a number of \npositive reforms over the long term that should help in the effort to \nreduce, not grow, the involvement of the Federal Government in \nagriculture.\n  For example, the legislation transitions farm subsidies from a system \nof direct payments to a more market-based crop insurance support \nprogram. Senator Lugar always favored that. I think many other people \nwho have thought about agriculture think that is the right path to go. \nI have supported that.\n  As a 5-year bill, this legislation should also give our farmers and \ntheir families some certainty that they need to make prudent planning \ndecisions and give them choices to select programs that best meet their \nneeds.\n  I believe our farmers can move forward and help our Nation remain a \nglobal leader in the production of food and fiber which is critical to \nour economic well-being and national security.\n  The final bill also contains many other essential provisions to \nreduce unnecessary regulations, such as the inclusion of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, forest roads fix, which I have \nstrongly supported. It is an excessive intervention into the forest \nindustry to have the EPA involved in the issues that they are talking \nabout, and I think we have clarified that so that won't be a problem.\n  It also contains provisions that are designed to help Alabama catfish \nproducers, peanut farmers, cotton farmers, and forest landowners who \ncompete in the global economy.\n  I am pleased the final bill contains my provision to help farmers in \nStates like Alabama that have not significantly used irrigation \npractices in the past. Under the current USDA policy, farmers have been \nexcluded from the Federal irrigation program if they don't have a \nhistory of irrigation, and that makes no sense where we are trying to \ninvolve more people to smartly use more irrigation. I thank the ranking \nmember and the chair of the committee for their work supporting us on \nthat. My provision will help ensure that more Alabama farmers are able \nto access these programs. It has been a priority of mine for some time, \nalthough it is a small part of the overall bill.\n  As a whole, the Congressional Budget Office claims that the farm bill \nwill reduce the deficit by $16.6 billion over 10 years. This is a step, \na small step, however, in the right direction. It means that if current \nlaw were extended without change, we would be spending $16.6 billion \nmore than if this bill were passed. So that is positive.\n  I wish we could do more, and we can do more. Unfortunately, we \nhaven't done more, but this is a positive step. It is fair to say that \nthe elimination of countercyclical and direct payments--almost \nentirely--is a historic occasion. Of course, Congress enacted Freedom \nto Farm in 1996, which was intended to slowly phase out these kinds of \nsubsidies. But when times became particularly difficult for our farmers \nin the years following the 1996 bill with low prices and drought, these \nprograms were, in essence, reinstituted by Congress. The retreat and \nthe movement away from Federal intervention was greatly eroded.\n  In my view--and that is all I have at bottom, is my view--Congress \nshould seek to steadily reduce the role of the Federal Government in \nfarming. But millions are dependent upon farming for their livelihoods, \nand a thoughtful, conservative approach to reducing Federal \nintervention would be to continue this reduction steadily over time. It \nsurely can't be done smartly all at once without some real dislocation \nin the agricultural marketplace--although I must say I think we could \nhave gone a good bit further this year.\n  But I remain concerned that the reforms to the SNAP program, the food \nstamp program, are much too modest. I hope our actions today help set \nthe table for continued and badly needed reforms that I and others have \noutlined during our debate on the farm bill in 2012, 2013, and this \nyear.\n  Yet it seems clear to me that the bill before us today regretfully \ndoes not go nearly as far as it could in addressing the abuses and the \nwastefulness that are contained in those programs.\n  For example, the bill spends $956 billion over 10 years. Nearly 80 \npercent of that is for the SNAP program, food support programs.\n  It is, in reality, as someone has said, a SNAP bill, a food stamp \nbill. Eighty percent of the money goes to that one problem. It asks our \nfarmers to contribute a disproportionate share to deficit reduction. \nThe bill cuts food stamps by only about $8 billion and it cuts the \nagricultural programs by about $8 billion. That sounds fair, balanced, \nas my colleagues like to use that word, ``balanced.'' But we are \ncutting $8 billion from the 20 percent of the program and the other $8 \nbillion from the other 80 percent of the program, and that is not \nbalanced.\n  I want to say to my colleagues that there is no intent or desire of \nany Member of this Senate to have people who are hungry remain hungry \nand people who are in need of food not to have food. What we are saying \nis there are a great number of abuses in the program that have clearly \nbeen identified and should be fixed and haven't been sufficiently \nfixed.\n  Although it repeals direct payments, the bill replaces those payments \nwith new programs that seek to help farmers in a more effective way and \nthat will cost at least $27 billion. So we reduce some programs and \nincrease others. I think most of that is in the agricultural insurance \npolicy, which is probably, in general, a better way to help our \nagricultural industry.\n  Congress needs to be careful about spending more money, and many \nSenators and independent analysts think\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\nthese new programs may cost even more than CBO is currently projecting. \nIt moves money from direct support to crop insurance, and I think that \ncould be good. We have studied the farm bill conference report and note \nthat the Congressional Budget Office has concluded it increases \nspending in 2014 by $2.1 billion above the spending limits Democrats \nand Republicans agreed to in December. It is more than what we agreed \nto in December--$2.1 billion over the limits we agreed to in a \nbipartisan way.\n  In the Senate this would normally subject the legislation before the \nSenate to two points of order, budget points of order, because it \nviolates the budgeted spending limits we just agreed to. Proponents of \nthe bill would then be required to either reduce the spending in the \nbill to the agreed-upon level or gather a supermajority of 60 votes to \nwaive the point of order and agree to violate the budget.\n  However, the Senate majority, our Democratic colleagues have deployed \na budget gimmick with Republican support that rendered these points of \norder--and consequently limit a minority's right to enforce the \nspending limits--ineffective. This is something I predicted 2 months \nago when the Ryan-Murray legislation passed. I said on December 18, as \nthat deal was being debated:\n\n       With 57 different reserve funds, the Murray-Ryan spending \n     bill that is before us now will allow Senator Reid and \n     Chairwoman Murray to bring to the floor a practically \n     unlimited number of big tax-and-spend bills. It will not be \n     subject to the 60-vote limit. Normally the minority party \n     would be able to raise a point of order under section 302(f) \n     of the Budget Act.\n\n  So the Budget Committee chairman has decided to make an adjustment to \nthe budget spending levels, and she can do so because of the Ryan-\nMurray spending agreement that passed the House, the Republican House, \nand the Senate. This will allow increased spending in the farm bill \nabove the amount we agreed to.\n\n  Though two points of order would lie against the bill, they are \nvoided in the Ryan-Murray legislation because of the powers granted to \nthe Budget Committee chairman in that legislation.\n  Let me explain this power that was granted, yet again. The Ryan-\nMurray agreement includes 57 deficit neutral reserve funds. \nOperationally, a reserve fund allows the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the allocations of budget authority and outlays to \na Senate committee or committees; aggregate levels of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues; and other appropriate levels prior to Senate \nconsideration. This allows the proposed legislation to avoid most \nspending and revenue-related budget points of order as long as the \nmeasure complies with both the subject matter and deficit neutrality \ninstructions in the reserve fund.\n  In the case of the farm bill, the Ryan-Murray budget numbers refers \nto the Senate-passed budget which garnered bipartisan opposition.\n  The Senate budget, S. Con. Res. 8, in section 313 gives the chairman \nof the Budget Committee the power to adjust the budget for any farm \nbill reauthorization: ``Provided that such legislation would not \nincrease the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal \nyears 2013 through 2018 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 \nthrough 2023.''\n  Those are complex words I just read. But in other words, the farm \nbill is now in a situation where it can increase spending in the first \nfiscal year and promise that it will recoup the money later on, which \nis exactly what this bill does, and the minority's rights are \ndiminished in its ability to stop it because of the Ryan-Murray budget \nagreement. That is what I warned about in December. Some said there \nwasn't anything to it. I warned that there was, and I think we are \nalready seeing that there is something to the complaints I made.\n  I said on the floor of the Senate that the ``power that Senators had \nto block tax-and-spend legislation that breaks spending limits has been \neroded significantly'' by Ryan-Murray.\n  The danger is that we will certainly have spending increases in the \nshort-term, but we have only promises of spending limitations in the \nfuture.\n  There is no point of order that lies against the bill because the \nRyan-Murray agreement passed by Congress, I acknowledge--I am not sure \nif Members of the House and Senate fully knew what was included in the \nRyan-Murray agreement after that secret meeting between the two budget \nleaders.\n  This legislation is far from perfect, and we will see how we proceed \nwith the agriculture bill. I appreciate those who have worked on it. We \nneed to do the right thing for agriculture. It is an important part of \nour Nation's economy and our national security. I have invested a lot \nof time and effort in it, as I know most of my colleagues have. I \nappreciate the work of those who have produced this legislation for us.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We all know the Senate and House agriculture leaders \nunveiled the long-awaited conference report last week for the 2014 farm \nbill. It has been a long trip getting this far. Every conference \ncommittee, of course, has some controversy, but the 2014 farm bill has \nhad more than its fair share of twists and turns--right down to the \nnegotiations on the dairy policy in the fleeting hours--before we, as \nconferees, signed this conference report. It sounds like the old days \nof The Perils of Pauline when we had the farm bill tied to the railroad \ntracks or about to head over the dairy cliff.\n  Fortunately, we had Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Cochran, and \ntheir superb staffs. I am also blessed with my own superb staff: \nAdrienne Wojciechowski, Kathryn Toomajian, Rebekah Weber, Kara Leene, \nand Tom Berry, all of whom spent hours away from their families while \nworking on this important bill. We ended with a bipartisan, bicameral \nfarm bill that addresses the needs of every region in the country. \nSenator Stabenow and I were on the phone or emailing about every hour \nof the day, night, and weekends from Michigan, Vermont, overseas, and \nfrom the Senate, but it worked. Everybody had a chance, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, to express their views. Now it is time to vote, pass \nthe bill, send it to the President, and give sorely needed certainty to \nour farmers, our families, and our rural communities.\n  After all, the 2014 farm bill saves taxpayers $23 billion. It \neliminates duplicative programs. It strengthens the toolbox for \nconserving our natural resources. It gives the farmers some much-\nneeded, long-overdue certainty as they make planting decisions. They \ndon't have the luxury that we seem to give ourselves to wait until the \nvery last second to vote on something. They have to plan months in \nadvance. It provides relief to struggling families, support for rural \ncommunities, and investments in a sustainable energy future. Is it a \nperfect bill? Of course not. No farm bill is. But while there are \nprovisions I would not have preferred, I do believe it has a lot of \nprovisions that will benefit Vermont and the Nation.\n\n  I wish the commonsense dairy policies that were passed twice by the \nfull Senate and supported by Republicans and Democrats, by the chair \nand by the ranking member, and also by the House Committee on \nAgriculture had not been ambushed at the last hour. As a result, we \ndon't have a market stabilization program--something that was proposed \nby dairy farmers themselves that would have protected taxpayers from \nthe exorbitant costs and would have insulated dairy farmers and \nconsumers from volatile rollercoastering milk prices.\n  Unfortunately, the Speaker of the House and some of the very \npowerful, huge industry figures from out West did not want it.\n  We do have, because of the constant work of everybody--and I again \nwould praise the chair of our own committee, Senator Stabenow--a \nsolution that while not perfect will help our small dairy farmers \nprotect themselves from poor economic conditions when milk prices \nplummet or when feed prices skyrocket or, as we have sometimes seen in \nthe worst scenario, when both happen at the same time. The final farm \nbill includes changes to lower the cost of the Dairy Producer Margin \nProtection Program for Vermont's small, family dairy farms. It will \nalso discourage large dairies from using this program to flood the \nmarkets through overproduction of milk, something that wipes out small \nfamily farms.\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\n  But the bill is not just about farmers; it is a food bill that \nsupports hungry children and struggling families and it has healthy \nfood initiatives. I am disappointed the final bill contains many cuts \nto the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but the conferees \nworked together and rejected the deepest cuts to the hunger safety net \nand the most harmful new conditions which were advocated by an extreme \nmajority in the House, both of which would have undermined the very \nreasonably offered food assistance. These provisions would have slashed \nnearly $40 billion from nutrition assistance programs, eliminating the \neligibility for millions of Americans, and making it harder for hungry \nchildren to receive free school meals.\n  Frankly, I am fed up with hearing Members, whether in the House or \nsometimes Members in this body, say: Oh, we can't afford to feed these \nhungry children when they go to school. These are the same Members who \nvoted for a blank check to go to an unnecessary war in Iraq, something \nthat has cost us $2 trillion, which they did on a credit card. We need \nto feed children in America so they might actually learn while they are \nat school, but some say: Oh, we can't afford that. Come on. Feeding \nthose hungry children is an investment in the future of this great \nNation.\n  Some of the demeaning and offensive provisions, such as allowing drug \ntesting of beneficiaries and unrealistic work requirements, were left \nout. You're telling me that we can have tax-paying, hard-working \ncitizens, who, when factories close, won't be able to feed themselves \nwith supplemental nutrition. We are going to demean them after what \nthey have done for the country? Of course not.\n  The legislation promotes food security in low-income communities and \nencourages healthy eating through increased access to fruits and \nvegetables. That is something we have done in Vermont for years and it \nis also one of the reasons--that and the fact we cover every child from \nbirth to 18 years old for health care--that Vermont is always listed as \neither No. 1 or No. 2 of the healthiest States in the Nation.\n  This legislation also--and again I wish to compliment the Chair on \nthis--continues to share the responsibility to conserve our working \nfarmlands and our natural resources. If we lose these natural \nresources, we can't make them again. We are not going to get them back. \nFederally supported crop insurance will ease farmers' exposure when \nnatural disasters strike. It will keep working lands in production. \nMeanwhile, enlisting farmers to continue the simple conservation \npractices they are already following will ensure the protection of our \nwetlands and our sensitive lands.\n  In a country as diverse as ours, it is no simple task to produce a \nfarm bill that addresses the needs of every region or every industry or \nevery priority. I am proud this is a bill that offers a targeted \napproach to tackling the needs of each State and agricultural sector, \nrather than doing it the easy way, which is a one-size-fits-all, which \nends up not fitting anybody.\n  The regional equity program guarantees that no State is left out from \nreceiving conservation resources under the farm bill. Not only Vermont \ncommunities but rural America everywhere will be strengthened by a \nbroadband development program, energy efficiency initiatives, and water \ntreatment and distribution loans. Vermont's very beautiful Northeast \nKingdom REAP Zone will continue to be a catalyst for growth and \nprogress to help build a resilient rural economy. Organic agriculture \nis supported through certification cost sharing, stronger enforcement, \ncrop insurance, and funding for organic research. We should promote \norganics because it is the fastest growing sector in agriculture.\n  I am also pleased that many of the harmful provisions from the House \nfarm bill were removed during the conference negotiations, including \ndangerous secrecy provisions and attacks on critical environmental \nregulations. One that was proposed by an extremely conservative \nRepublican would have actually threatened to limit States rights. What \nan amazing turn of events. We got rid of all of these.\n  Bottom line, the Senate and the House have produced a farm bill that \nat its core is about keeping America strong. Make no mistake, farming \nis part of our national security. Look at the number of nations in this \nworld that would give anything to be able to feed themselves and have \nfood left over to export. We are more secure as a nation because we can \ndo that.\n  This farm bill will boost the economy, will create jobs, will offer \nsupport for the hungry, conserve our national resources, improve our \nenergy security, and stand up for our country's families. I am proud to \nhave signed the conference report for another farm bill that will \nsupport Americans today and into America's future. I look forward to \none of my few duties I get to perform after this bill passes: I will \nsign the bill as President pro tempore after the Speaker signs it. And \nI know from what he has said to all of us, the President will then sign \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to address a small part of \nthis bill but a very important part of the bill, something I have been \nworking on through at least two farm bills. Since the chairwoman of the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is here, Senator \nStabenow, I thank her for defending my position up until the last day \nor two of the conference. She kept me informed fully about the \ndifficulty of the position that both Houses had taken getting that out \nof conference.\n  I come to the floor not to discuss just my issue but to use it as an \nexample that my colleagues may look forward to in the future; that is, \nthat just because something goes through the Senate, even without \ncontroversy--because as far as I know it wasn't discussed or there was \nno amendment offered to strike what I am talking about that came out of \ncommittee and it passed in the House of Representatives by a 230-to-194 \nvote in the same language--one would assume that something which was \nthe same in both Houses would not be changed by the conference. In \nfact, rule XXVIII of the Senate rules says this: ``Conferees shall not \ninsert in their report matter not committed to them by either House, \nnor shall they strike from the bill matter agreed to by both Houses.''\n  So if Members are interested in the Senate rules being followed by \nconference committees in the future, understand in this particular case \nthat was not followed. The provisions were not necessarily struck, but \nthey were changed in such a manner that the $387 million the \nCongressional Budget Office said would be saved if my provision stayed \nin, that amount of money will not be saved.\n  We are talking about a situation that we are trying to correct, going \nback at least to the 2008 farm bill and maybe previous to that, where \n10 percent of the biggest farmers get 70 percent of the benefits from \nthe farm program, so it is subsidizing farmers as opposed to helping \nmedium- and small-sized farmers get through conditions such as natural \ndisasters, politics, and other aspects beyond the control of farmers \nthat the safety net for farmers was intended to help.\n  So we could have saved $387 million, and the rules of Senate said \nthis should have been in the final package that came back to the \nSenate, but it is not here. It seems to me my colleagues ought to be \naware of that fact because they may be in a similar situation sometime \non some other conference committee report, and the question is: Are you \ngoing to let a small number of people--for most of this conference \nreport 4 people negotiating the difference between the House and the \nSenate--speak for the other 531 Members of the Congress? Are you going \nto let a majority of that group of people represent a minority of the \nSenate and a minority of the House? By this being taken out or this \nbeing changed in such a way so it has no value, that is exactly what \nhas happened.\n  Making sure we have limits on the amount of money a farmer can get \nand real numbers that work is not something new. President Bush vetoed \na farm bill in 2008 because he said it continues subsidies for the \nwealthy. In another part of his veto message he said the American \ntaxpayer should not be forced to subsidize that group of farmers who \nhave adjusted gross incomes up to $1.5 million as the rationale for \nvetoing that bill.\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n  So what we have is the moral authority of a majority of the Senate, a \nmoral authority of the House of Representatives, and their positions \ntaken on this language--language that limited a farmer to no more than \n$250,000 and defining a farmer as somebody who is actually engaged in \nthe business of farming so nonfarmers don't get help from the farm \nprogram--has been taken out, regardless of the moral authority that \nsaid it should be kept in the bill. In other words, conferees are \ntaking out something that represented a minority of the House of \nRepresentatives and a minority of the Senate.\n  We are here to vote on a farm bill--cloture today, final passage \ntomorrow. The farm bill is a very important safety net for producers. \nIt gives farmers a chance to survive in tough times. As a farmer, I \nunderstand the risk of farming. My payment limit reforms were adopted--\nand I can't say that too many times--in both bodies of Congress. It \nwould have saved $387 million.\n  People said, when we limited through my amendment that you could have \none nonfarming manager per farming operation, that was unreasonable.\n  There would have been a lot of money saved. But more importantly, as \nis the situation today and will probably be the situation in the \nfuture, nonfarmers are going to be able to get benefits from a farm \nprogram when they don't have legitimacy for it. This provision should \nnot have been touched, because it was the same in both Houses.\n  Unlimited subsidies, when 10 percent of the biggest farmers get 70 \npercent of the benefits from the farm program, actually put a new \ngeneration of young and beginning farmers at a severe disadvantage. \nThere is nothing wrong with farmers getting bigger. That is the \nAmerican dream, to use your potential to do the best for yourself. But \nwhen large farmers who shouldn't get subsidized get big payments from \nthe farm program, it is, in my estimation, wrong--particularly when it \ndrives up the price of land as it has in the recent 5 to 8 years; \ndrives up the price of cash rent as it has recently. It is very \ndifficult for people who are just trying to get into the business of \nfarming to start. So I think when nonfarmers can qualify for the farm \nprogram as managers when they might not even be making a phone call to \nthe operation and having limits that don't mean much--which is exactly \nwhat we are doing, subsidizing big farmers to get bigger--it puts young \nand beginning farmers at a severe disadvantage.\n  Changing my reforms behind closed doors is wrong. The House and \nSenate had spoken on the issue. With no debate in the Senate here, a \n230-194 vote in support of the Fortenberry amendment in the House of \nRepresentatives--something under the Senate rules that is the same in \nboth bodies should not be messed with by the conferees, but it was \nchanged dramatically.\n  Some are saying the effort the conferees took to give the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture authority to bring about some of these \nreforms on who is engaged in the business of farming will do the job. \nBut they have had that authority for a long time, and I see this as a \nWashington hat trick to say you have done something when you haven't \ndone anything.\n  I am not going to be able to vote for this bill because it would \nendorse what has happened. Egregious manipulation behind closed doors \nof something that is the same in both Houses should not be tolerated, \nand I hope my colleagues will take that into consideration so it \ndoesn't happen to them in the future. How we will fix other entitlement \nprograms if we can't cut subsidies to millionaire farmers who don't \neven farm makes it very difficult.\n  As I said, my friend from Michigan, Chairwoman Stabenow, has worked \nhard on this bill. I wanted to support this farm bill. I just can't get \nover what happened behind closed doors, once again, here in Washington. \nAnd as she has told me so many times, she has defended my position and \nI thank her for so doing.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, in spite of all the discussion about our \ngreat energy renaissance and ``all of the above,'' and new \nmanufacturing--and, yes, we are going to be a test site for the \nunmanned aircraft--in North Dakota we live and we breathe agriculture. \nIn summer, our plains are filled with beautiful sunflowers and canola \nfields and flax. It is the most amazing view, especially when the \ncanola is next to the flax.\n  Our ranchers take serious pride in their cattle herds that graze \naround much of our State. The wheat, grain, corn, and soybeans farmers \nprovide help to feed the world and have the best products produced in \nagriculture today.\n  Agriculture also supports 16 million jobs around the country, \nincluding thousands of manufacturing jobs in North Dakota. This is not \nsurprising, given that our State is one of the most productive farm \nStates in the country. Those jobs make it possible for our State to \ncontinue to harvest each year, supporting families across North Dakota \nbut also throughout the country.\n  I take great pride in the work our farmers and ranchers do. I know \nall North Dakotans do as well. For too long we weren't supporting them \nenough to enable them to do their job. In fact, we held farmers and \nranchers in limbo because they haven't been sure how to prepare for \nthis crop year since the Congress had not done its job and passed a \nfarm bill. Finally, that is about to change.\n  During my campaign I pledged to work tirelessly to get a long-term \nfarm bill passed. Now we are literally at the 1-yard line of finally \nreaching the goal of passing a 5-year bipartisan farm bill. I am \nincredibly proud of the work we have done and what we have almost \naccomplished. And I do have to give a shout-out to our tremendous \nchairwoman, Senator Debbie Stabenow, who, as Senator Hoeven put it, is \na tough negotiator--tough but fair, and absolutely remarkable, not only \nthis year but also in 2013 and 2012, and who never resists an \nopportunity to inform anyone who crosses her path about the importance \nto the economy of this country that a long-term farm bill positions us \nmuch better to be competitive in the world.\n  One subject we talk about a lot is the budget and about long-term \nsystemic reforms that can give us what in public policy we need to do, \nsuch as a safety net for farmers, but also reduce costs to taxpayers. \nThis farm bill saves 23 billion in Federal dollars, while still \nproviding one of the strongest safety nets for farmers and ranchers \never crafted in a long-term farm bill. It makes critical reforms to \ntarget resources where they are most needed while also giving farmers \nthe opportunity to thrive. This farm bill achieves that goal, and puts \nour agricultural system in a strong position to continue its role as a \nworld leader.\n  This is achieved through effective farm programs for growers; \nlivestock disaster coverage for ranchers and livestock producers; \nenhanced crop insurance offerings; expanded research, which is so \ncritical to so many of our new crops; increased export production for \nagricultural products; critical investments in biofuels and in energy; \nour renewal of the Sugar Program to prevent excess imports of unfairly \nsubsidized foreign sugar; and targeted conservation assistance to \ntackle the unique problems in this country, particularly in my State \nwith Devils Lake and the Red River Valley.\n  In North Dakota we grow more than 20 different crops each year, and \nwe lead the Nation in the production of 13 different commodities, \nincluding spring wheat, durum wheat, barley, edible beans, peas, \nlentils, canola, sunflowers, and flaxseed. So while we talk about this \nexpansion and explosion of both corn and soybeans, North Dakota is \nleading the way in diversification, which I think is the future for \nagriculture.\n  North Dakota is also a leading livestock State, with thousands of \ncow-calf operators raising livestock in the West, and a leading \nproducer of sugar beets from growers in the Red River Valley.\n  Approximately 25 percent of my State's economic base and employment \nis derived from work done on the farm. I talk about this quite a bit, \nbecause I think when we think about economics\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\nand what generates economic activity, at the very beginning, we have to \nhave new wealth creation, and in this country new wealth creation comes \nfrom what we extract from the earth, how we use our resources, and it \ncomes from exportation of our goods and services. That is new wealth, \nand farming is such a critical component. When we think about it, we \nrealize our farmers and ranchers help grow the economy and reduce our \nNation's trade deficit. North Dakota alone exported more than $4.1 \nbillion in commodities this year, contributing to farm cash receipts of \nover $7.6 billion.\n  But to simply put in a crop, an average grower in North Dakota spends \nupward to $1 million in import costs with the hope of earning a modest \nprofit, a modest return on that investment at the end of the year.\n  What is more, each year North Dakota faces challenges completely out \nof their control, such as floods, droughts, price collapse, and the \nintroduction of new pests and pathogens. Each year North Dakota growers \nface an incredible risk--within the last 2 years--the uncertainty of \nnot having a farm bill. They are able to take the risk because the rest \nof the country takes a little bit of risk with them for that food \nsecurity and national security that American agriculture provides.\n  For too long this body has debated farm and rural policies in place \nin our country without providing the needed certainty to America. \nSoon--in just a few hours--we will have the opportunity to prevail by \nputting rural America on a strong ground by passing a comprehensive \nlong-term farm bill that stands for our ranchers and our producers and \nstands for the people who consume agricultural products in this \ncountry.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on this bill. It is good for \nmy State, it is good for the country, and it is good for the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have 20 to 30 minutes. I would \nappreciate it if the Presiding Officer would notify me when I have \nconsumed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have been in the Congress for a lot of farm bills. I \nsaw ``Freedom to Farm.'' I saw the last farm bill, the one before that, \nand now I am looking at this one. It reminds me of the auto \ncommercial--something's up. Well, it sure is.\n  Only in Washington can we claim a bill saves $24 billion when it \nincreases the spending 43 percent over the next 10 years. How does that \nfit? Is that just the language of Washington? In fact, we are going to \nspend almost $1 trillion over the next 10 years on what should be \ncalled a food security bill rather than a farm bill because this is not \na farm bill. This is a food security bill.\n  The language we hear from our colleagues is totally parochial or \nproduct based. We hear all the claims that we are thinking about the \nbest interests of the Nation. What we are truly thinking about is the \nbest interests of the parochial values for our own States. That is how \nwe get this conflagration of people coming together to pass a bill \nthat, I admit, has some limited reforms in it.\n  I just heard the Senator from North Dakota talk about how we create \nwealth. I could not disagree more. We create wealth by making sure the \nrisk of capital investment is responsive to market forces. This farm \nbill is anything but that. There is no response to market forces \nbecause there is no place else in this country where someone can go \ninto a business or an enterprise and be guaranteed that their revenue \nis going to be secure. We even added a new supplemental low-cost Crop \nInsurance Program that all of us who are not farmers in America are \ngoing to pay the deductible on. Plus, we are going to subsidize 62 to \n63 percent of all the crop insurance in the country.\n  When we subsidize crop insurance, what we are doing is taking the \ncapital risk and modifying the risk; therefore, markets are not going \nto work.\n  We talk about sugar prices. Americans are losing candy manufacturers \nlike crazy. Why is that? Because Americans pay twice as much as the \nrest of the world for sugar because we are protecting cane sugar and \nbeet sugar farmers rather than letting market forces work.\n  I am very disturbed at the process of this bill as well. Senator \nDurbin and I tried to put some income limitations on the benefits to \nthe wealthiest in this country when it comes to crop insurance. It \npassed this Senate with 64 or 65 votes. It was in the bill when it left \nhere. The House passed the same thing by a voice vote and the conferees \ntook it out.\n  What is the farm bill about? It is about protecting the well-heeled \nand well-connected in the agricultural community.\n  I know a little bit about agriculture. My dad ran a ranch with 5,000 \nmother cows. I worked on it in the summer and after school. Back then--\nin the 1970s--there were no benefits for a cattle rancher. That has \ncome into the farm program since the 1970s. It guarantees them that now \nthey will make decisions that are against market forces but will farm \nthe government.\n  So I say again, only in Washington when we are going to spend $350 \nbillion more on a program over the next 10 years will somebody claim we \nare cutting spending $14 to $20 billion. Only in Washington will that \nhappen. It is unique Washington accounting.\n  We have heard all the proponents say what a great job they did. Let \nme talk a little bit about some of the details of this farm bill.\n  One of the things the President talked about--he just put Joe Biden \nin charge of the job training programs. He is supposed to look at all \nof them to see if they have metrics. The GAO has studied that. I have \nlooked at every job training program--State and Federal--in my State.\n  They have 10 job training pilot programs in this bill. We don't need \nany more job programs. What we need to do is make sure the ones we have \nwork and have metrics on them. We need to make sure that when we spend \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars that we are actually giving somebody a life \nskill rather than filling the coffers of the companies that contract to \ndo all the job training programs or allowing the small bureaucracies \nthat suck up the grants. Oklahoma's Federal programs are highly \nineffective--especially when we compare them to the State-run programs, \nwhich are highly effective.\n  So in this farm bill we are creating more job-training programs. It \nsounds good. It is a good sound bite on the floor, and it is a good \nsound bite in the press back home. But something is up, and what is up \nis we continue to make the same mistakes as a legislative body. That \nmistake is that we want to please constituents at home more than we \nwant to fix the real problems in front of this Nation.\n  Let me talk about SNAP for a minute. There is not anybody in this \ncountry I want to go hungry. When this country was first founded, we \nused some very good principles that the Senate and the House have \ntotally disregarded in terms of how to help people.\n  I reference the historical blueprint from a book written by a man by \nthe name of Marvin Olasky. The title of that book was called ``The \nTragedy of American Compassion.'' It talks about how we used to help \npeople versus how we are helping them now; how did we build up people \nas we helped them versus now; how are we tearing down people as we help \nthem. It talks about creating dependency versus creating \nresponsibility.\n\n  He outlines several factors this country has used in the past that we \nought to be reembracing. Let me list a couple of them. One is we should \ngive relief to people only after one-on-one personal investigation of \ntheir need. Let me say that again. We ought to know they need it. \nContrast where the money is coming from. The money is not coming from \ntoday's taxpayer when we are running a $640 billion deficit. The money \nis coming from our kids and our grandkids.\n  Do we not have an obligation to know that when we give somebody a \nSNAP card they truly need it versus the fact that the SNAP cards and \nPIN numbers get sold? The SNAP card is then used by somebody else. That \nis going on throughout this country. That is not to say that most of \nthe people who are getting this benefit don't need it. Because there is \nno personal investigation into it and there is no accountability on the \npart of the receiver or the giver, we are creating a situation in our \ncountry where we are undermining self-reliance.\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\n  The second point he made was to give necessary articles and only what \nis immediately necessary. That means you have to investigate it in \norder to give what is least susceptible to abuse; to give only in small \nquantities and in proportion to immediate needs and less than might be \nprocured by labor except in cases of sickness. That is a great \nprinciple. Let's help people, but let's help people help themselves. \nLet's don't create a situation of temptation to do the wrong thing; to \ngive assistance at the right moment, not prolong it beyond duration of \nthe necessity which calls for it. We don't do that at all in any of our \nprograms; to require each beneficiary absence from intoxicating liquors \nand drugs; to discontinue relieving all who manifest a purpose to \ndepend on alms rather than their own exertion for support. I don't have \none problem paying my taxes to make sure people don't go hungry and \nhave food on the table for their kids.\n  I just watched a documentary my daughter referred to me. I have to \nsay, as a physician, I understand the scientific tests and the great \nresearch that went into this. It is called ``Forks Over Knives.'' It \nmakes the case that most of our health care cost is based on our diet. \nIt is very accurate and well done--except we have no limitations.\n  Senator Harkin and I have tried for years to get limitations on how \nfood stamps and SNAP cards are used. We can't budge anybody to say we \nought to limit it to healthy foods, because for every $1 we spend on \nfood, we are creating $1 in health care costs down the road.\n  I recommend that my colleagues watch that study. It is unbelievable \nin terms of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. No medicine, \njust a change in diet, and all of a sudden those things go away. They \ngo away because we take Big Agribusiness's push to use what is \nprofitable out of the food chain and then start supplying foods that \nare actually good for us.\n  It seems to me Congress looks backward instead of forward when it \ncomes to the farm bill. One of the things we ought to do is look at the \nworld and what the population is. I also wish to say that some of the \nhardest working people in this country are the people who are in \nagriculture. I don't say these things to demean them, but markets do \nwork.\n  We hurt our farmers when we take them away from market forces because \nthat will cause them to make decisions that are false choices when it \ncomes to capital investment, and those are false choices for our \ncountry because that means capital is going into something that is \nsubsidized by the government rather than going into something that is \nnot subsidized that will create a greater good and more wealth for our \ncountry.\n  This bill does exactly that. You realize in this bill you are \nguaranteed 86 percent of your revenue. Let me think about that. Do you \nknow anywhere else where you can get your revenue on your crops \nguaranteed at 86 percent and the Federal taxpayer is paying most of the \ncost of the insurance for that?\n  Individuals in Oklahoma, Maine, and Virginia are paying higher tax \ndollars so we can create a system where we are investing in crops that \nare not necessarily good for us and causes us to pay a higher price for \na domestically produced crop versus world markets; whereas, we could \ndirect the same inputs into a product that is much better for us and we \nwould be much more competitive.\n  One of the points I wish to make is that in 2013, net farm income was \n$131 billion. That is 16.5 percent over what it was the year before, in \nan economy that is only growing less than 2 percent. Yet we are going \nto spend almost $100 billion a year in the future, of which only 18 \npercent of that will be for agricultural programs, outside of the Food \nStamp Program. We are going to spend $18 billion to misdirect capital \nin a way that, in the long run, we won't see that kind of growth.\n  I will finish with other commentary. It is necessary that we have a \nfarm program, but there is one little trick in this farm bill that \neverybody ought to be aware of. It is the pressure for the next farm \nbill that is put in this farm bill, and my colleagues know what it is. \nThey didn't eliminate any of the permanent law that is on the books; \nthey just let it stay there, and then we created the farm bill for 5 \nyears. What is the purpose of that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  The purpose is so that in 10 years, and in 5 years when we come to \nanother farm bill, the default position will fall back to 1940s-era \nagricultural law, which will create pressure to do a farm bill again. \nIf we do the same next time, it is going to cost $1.5 trillion over the \nfollowing 10 years.\n  My best friend is a feed corn, soybean, and wheat farmer. The farm is \nin excess of 2,000 acres in Oklahoma. On breaks, when they are \nharvesting, I go down there and drive a grain buggy. I have only bent \nthe auger on it once. I hear it from a farmer's perspective. Do my \ncolleagues know what he tells me? He tells me we don't need this \nanymore. We don't need it. We need decisions on capital investment to \nbe made on risks and markets. No one can tell me, when we have $131 \nbillion in net farm income this year, that we need to be subsidizing 86 \npercent of everybody's product, guaranteeing them, no matter what \nhappens in yield or price, they are going to get 86 percent.\n  The cost of this bill isn't just the $1 trillion we are talking \nabout; it is going to be much higher. We have had historically high \ncommodity prices. They have moderated somewhat, but if they go back \nanywhere close to historical prices, this bill is going to cost at \nleast another $100 billion, just in one program alone. CBO's assumption \nis that we are not going to do that. But most of the leading \nagricultural economists in this country think corn is going to be under \n$4, it is going to be $3.75, and wheat will decline and soybeans will \ndecline. So the score we have on this bill is nonsense because it \ndoesn't reflect the reality of what is happening out there.\n  I appreciate the hard work people did on the farm bill. I am highly \ncritical of adding new job programs. I think we have missed it \ncompletely. We don't even know what the real problem is in terms of job \ntraining in this program, and the 10 pilot programs aren't going to \nmake a difference anywhere. What we ought to have is real programs that \nare WTO-compliant, that reconnect capital investment with the real \nworld forces of market prices and markets.\n  We spend $200 million a year just on one program--assisting farmers \nselling their products overseas. Do we know what sells products \noverseas? Price, quality. But we have a little $200 million program \nthat everybody in organized agriculture gets to take advantage of. They \nget a couple of trips a year on the Federal taxpayer. It ought not be \nso. If we want to promote products, we ought to be out promoting them. \nWe shouldn't be promoting private brands with Federal Government money. \nWe ought to create the opportunity to promote it, but we shouldn't be \ndoing it.\n  Needless to say, I will not be voting for cloture. I will reemphasize \nthat Senator Durbin and I had a great amendment. Those who signed the \nconference report and took that out can't stand up and say anything \nabout anybody who is wealthy in this country or the tax rates or \nanything else, because they just gutted one of the things that would \nhave put back equality in terms of the farm program for the very \nwealthy in this country. We are continuing to pay hundreds of millions, \nif not billions, of dollars monthly to the most well-connected, well-\nfinanced, wealthiest people in this country because they are farming \nthe farm program. By taking that out, those who did lost all moral \nauthority to ever say anything again about income inequality in this \ncountry, because those who signed the conference report chose to take \nthat out.\n  We understand how politics works. I understand how politics works. \nBut credibility is important in our country and we are losing it. We \nare losing it here. Look at the polls. We have lost it in the Nation's \nCapital as far as the American people are concerned. We haven't just \nlost credibility; we are losing legitimacy, because we wink and nod to \ndo the parochial vote, even though in the best long-term interests of \nour country we are doing the wrong thing. But it sure sells well at \nhome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on two matters.\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\nThe first is the farm bill and the second is the U.S. attorney \nsituation in my State of Minnesota.\n  Being a Senator from a State that is a leader in agricultural \nproducts and now the sixth biggest State in terms of agricultural \nexports, I can tell my colleagues that the agricultural sector of this \ncountry is strong and it has, in fact, been a jewel in this economy \nwhen we look over the last few years and we look at the industries that \nwere hit so hard during the downturn. Our food supply remains strong. \nPart of why it remains strong is because we have believed in investing \nin agriculture and agricultural research and in the next wave of \nmachinery and all kinds of things, and it has helped our country, it \nhas been a positive for our country.\n  We have 80,000 farms in Minnesota. We are an exporting State, and it \nis one of the major reasons our unemployment rate is down to 4.6. \nBecause it is not just about the small farmers all over our State, it \nis also about the businesses and the employees, and it is also about \nthe fact that we are a country that makes its own food and is not \ndependent on foreign food the way we are dependent on foreign oil.\n  I fought hard to get on the agriculture committee when I came to the \nSenate. I was honored to serve on the farm bill conference committee \nunder Senator Stabenow's leadership. We worked together, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, on a bipartisan basis to put together a farm \nbill that strengthens the safety net for our Nation's family farms, \npreserves critical food and nutrition programs, and brings down the \ndeficit compared to the last farm bill to the tune of over $20 billion, \nwhich is one of the reasons we wanted to put this new farm bill in \nplace. The bulk of the savings comes from the transition from those \ndirect agricultural subsidies to a more risk-based management system of \ncrop insurance.\n  We also worked hard in the conservation area, which is very important \nin my State where hunting and fishing are a way of life. The \nconservation provisions are streamlined from 23 to 10 and we have the \nsupport of hundreds of environmental and conservation groups, including \nPheasants Forever, which is based in Minnesota, as well as Ducks, \nUnlimited.\n  We also worked hard in the energy area to finally fund that title, to \nacknowledge that we need many sources of energy in this country, \nincluding biofuels, wind, and solar. That is a big part of this bill as \nwell.\n  We kept the nutrition programs strong just by the fact that we were \nup against suggested cuts of $40 billion from the House of \nRepresentatives, and we found a way to make some changes that might not \nhave been our top priority, but they were ways we were able to move on \nthe farm bill and work with some of these States that were leveraging \ntheir heating assistance for food stamps. Most States were not \naffected. My State was not affected.\n  We also provided permanent disaster relief for our Nation's livestock \nproducers, something that is very important when we look at all the \ndead cows in South Dakota and everything that happened there.\n  I believe the strength of this bill is a testament to the work and \nleadership of Chairman Stabenow and her tireless efforts. I thank \nSenator Cochran as well as Chairman Lucas, and Ranking Member Peterson \nfrom my State, and then also Congressman Tim Walz who served on the \nconference committee as well.\n  This bill is important to the farmlands of our country, but it also \nis good for rural economies. I believe we do right by ourselves when we \ndo right by our rural communities.\n  I was listening to my colleague from Oklahoma, and I too have been on \ncombines with farmers. I will say I wasn't driving that combine, which \nwouldn't have been good for the farm or the neighboring farms. I was a \npassenger. I heard a different story from my farmers in terms of the \nconcern about bouncing from year to year and not knowing what the \npolicies are, and how good it has been to have a 5-year policy in place \nfor farm policy, how far we have come from those freedom-to-farm days \nwhen we were foreclosing on farms all over our State, and how we want \nto be able to continue to produce food in our State and to encourage \nyoung farmers and ranchers. That is why that amendment was part of my \nmajor focus, which was to give them some breaks on crop insurance and \ngrazing their cattle on CRP land.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n\n                      U.S. Attorney for Minnesota\n\n  Now I wish to turn to a very different topic, which is Minnesota's \nU.S. attorney. This is an appalling situation, as the Presiding Officer \nwill hear by the numbers. For 887 days, Minnesota has not had a full-\ntime, permanent U.S. attorney--887 days. During that time, from August \n2011 to August 2013, Todd Jones was responsible for doing two jobs. He \nwas responsible for being the U.S. attorney in Minnesota as well as \nbeing the Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, \nand Explosives. As my colleagues can imagine, with the mess after Fast \nand Furious, he had a lot of work to do at the ATF and that was his \nmajor focus. Meanwhile, we kept going with some fine prosecutors, but \nwe didn't have a full-time leader.\n  Over the summer, thanks to my colleague from the State of Arizona, \nSenator McCain, we were able to finally confirm Todd Jones to that job. \nThe ATF had been without a permanent director for 7 years. We got that \ndone. Of course, then it officially left the Minnesota U.S. attorney's \nposition open, even though it had already really been open for 2 years.\n\n  Even before that decision was made by the Senate to confirm Todd \nJones, Senator Franken and I had gathered together a bipartisan group, \nincluding the former U.S. attorney under President Bush, to advise us \non a replacement for Mr. Jones--even before the time we confirmed Mr. \nJones because of our concern over the problems in the office, many of \nwhich were on the front page of our newspaper. We were able to get a \nrecommendation from our committee for a replacement, Mr. Andy Luger. He \nis a respected litigator, a former assistant U.S. attorney.\n  It has now been 196 days since we made that recommendation to the \nPresident. It has been 187 days since Director Jones was confirmed with \nno full-time U.S. attorney again in the office. While the office has \ncontinued to provide the United States with the high-quality legal \nrepresentation it deserves, Minnesota needs a full-time U.S. attorney.\n  Mr. Luger sailed through the Judiciary Committee with no objections. \nHe has passed all the tests necessary, including the FBI test. He has \nthe support of law enforcement with whom I have spoken. He has the \nsupport of one of our Republican Congressmen in the area. I want to \nthank Senator Grassley, who also supports him and has raised issues \nwith the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office because of the fact that we \nhave not had a full-time attorney for 888 days, and he has been \nsupportive of our efforts to quickly move Mr. Luger's nomination, not \njust through the committee but to the floor.\n  Senator Grassley is in a similar situation because his U.S. attorney \nfor the Northern District of Iowa was nominated on the same day and is \nalso awaiting confirmation on the floor. Again, they have both come \nthrough the Judiciary Committee without any objection.\n  So why is this important? Well, I ran a prosecutor's office with \nabout 400 people for 8 years. We worked directly with the U.S. \nattorney's office. We were there during 9/11 when the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice in Minnesota was dealing with the Moussaoui case. As you \nremember, he was caught in Minnesota. They were dealing with terrorism \nissues. We worked hand in hand. We took a number of their white-collar \ncases.\n  I have been able to witness firsthand how day in and day out you need \na U.S. attorney to make very difficult decisions as to what cases to go \nforward on, and especially without a full-time U.S. attorney it is very \ndifficult to decide where to put limited resources in terms of \nstrategic decisions. We have not had that person in place for 888 days.\n  Protecting our Nation from terrorists is a top concern for all of us. \nWhen you hear of the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office, you might not \nthink: terrorism. But in fact, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota \nis renowned for its counterterrorism efforts and terrorism \nprosecutions, especially investigating the terrorist organization al-\nShabaab. For years, authorities have been on alert for al-Shabaab in \nMinnesota.\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\n  In Operation Rhino, the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted \nOmer Abdi Mohamed, who recruited young Somali Americans to fight for \nterrorists in Somalia. Mohamed was indicted in November 2009 in \nMinnesota and pled guilty in July 2011 to conspiracy to murder, kidnap, \nand maim abroad.\n  This operation is part of an ongoing terrorism investigation. As you \nknow, there have been suicide bombings in Somalia--sadly, recruiting \npeople out of our Somali community in Minnesota. We are proud of that \ncommunity. They are an incredible part of our State. But this did \nhappen. It has led to charges against 18 people for aiding al-Shabaab--\n8 of whom have been convicted, some receiving sentences of up to 20 \nyears in prison.\n  So I ask you, why would you pick an office like this not to have a \nleader for 888 days? But through a variety of circumstances--the fact \nthat the ATF job was held up in terms of an appointment, and then the \nfact that this is being held up right now--we still do not have a \nleader.\n  In addition to terrorism cases, the U.S. attorney's office is also \nresponsible for prosecuting major drug crimes. Recently, the office won \na major conviction and played a key role in shutting down a big \nsynthetic drugstore in Duluth. And 2 weeks ago, the Minneapolis Star \nTribune had a major news story about a growing and deadly heroin \nepidemic in Minnesota. As we have seen from the death this weekend of \nsomeone who was a celebrity, I think we all know there have also been \nheroin deaths all over this country, so Minnesota is not alone. But we \nare alone in that we have not had a chief leader in our U.S. attorney's \noffice to come up with a strategy to deal with this case for 888 days.\n  In the first half of 2013, 69 people died of opiate-related overdoses \nin Hennepin County, MN. That would be 69 people died. Some of these \ndeaths were young kids. This is a situation that demands attention \nimmediately, and Mr. Luger is eager to work with law enforcement on a \nstrategy.\n  Federal and State law enforcement also partnered to combat identity \ntheft and white-collar crime. Minnesota had the second biggest white-\ncollar conviction in terms of money--next to Madoff--in the country. \nYet this is an office that we have chosen not to put a leader in for \n888 days. The U.S. attorney's office won a conviction in a $3.65 \nbillion-dollar Ponzi scheme case--as I mentioned, the second biggest \nPonzi scheme in U.S. history.\n  Currently, Minnesota's U.S. Attorney's Office is headed by an acting \ndirector. But an acting director simply cannot provide the same kind of \nleadership as a full-time U.S. attorney.\n  I know that the local heads of the DEA, FBI, and other Federal and \nState law enforcement agencies are very anxious to get a U.S. attorney \nin full time.\n  I would also note that we also do not have an administrative officer \nbecause we are awaiting putting in a U.S. attorney so that Mr. Luger \ncan hire an administrative officer. This is not a small office. There \nare more than 100 people working there, including 54 lawyers. Again, \nthey are without a full-time boss and a leader. I think these hard-\nworking prosecutors and the people they work with deserve a leader in \nthe office.\n  When Minnesota was first made a State, President Zachary Taylor \nfilled the position of U.S. attorney in 2 days for our young new State. \nBack then, they deserved a U.S. attorney. If they could get it done in \n2 days, I think we should be able to get it done in 888 days.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his swift confirmation and give this \noffice and its hard-working prosecutors the full-time prosecutor they \ndeserve.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to make remarks about the \nfarm bill conference agreement that is before us.\n  Of course, across the Nation Americans are demanding that Washington \nrestore their faith in government. Last year we saw a Congress crippled \nby government shutdowns and debt-ceiling standoffs. We nearly failed to \npass a Defense authorization bill.\n  While many of my colleagues have high hopes this year for returning \nto the practice of moving legislation through the regular order and \nperhaps working under a more open amendment process, I am profoundly \ndisappointed that one of the first pieces of legislation we will send \nto the President this year is a $1.5 trillion farm bill. It is a mind-\nboggling sum of money that is spent on farm subsidies, duplicative \nnutrition and development assistance programs, and special-interest pet \nprojects.\n  Taxpayer groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste blasted \nthis farm bill as a ``Dung Deal.'' Last week, the Wall Street Journal \ncalled it ``A Bipartisan Taxpayer Raid,'' writing:\n\n       It's no accident that Congress dropped this porker under \n     the cover of the State of the Union hoopla. Handouts to \n     agribusiness and millionaires, continued trade protectionism \n     for the sugar industry--it's all still there.\n\n  How are we supposed to restore the confidence of the American people \nwith this monstrosity? A few weeks ago we crammed down their throats a \n$1.1 trillion Omnibus appropriations bill loaded with wasteful \nspending. Tomorrow we will wash the omnibus down with another trillion \ndollars. The only policy that gets bipartisan traction in Congress is \nWashington's desire to hand out taxpayer money like it is candy.\n  We have heard about some of the ``savings'' generated by this farm \nbill. It is true there are noteworthy cuts to several outdated \nDepression-era farm subsidies such as the Direct Payments Program and \nthe Countercyclical Program. We also close loopholes in our Food Stamp \nPrograms and conservation programs, which generated about $16 billion \nin savings, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and I applaud \nthe conferees for their efforts.\n  But, unfortunately, just about every subsidy eliminated under the \nfarm bill is simply reinvented into a new and many times more expensive \nprogram. For example, we have a new thing called Agriculture Risk \nCoverage Program, which locks in today's record-high crop prices and \nguarantees farmers up to an 86-percent return on their crop. Depending \non market conditions, ARC--agriculture risk coverage--could cost \ntaxpayers between $3 billion to $14 billion each year--far more \nexpensive than the $5 billion saved by the elimination of the Direct \nPayments Program. The bill also maintains the $95 billion federally \nbacked crop insurance program which subsidizes crop insurance premiums. \nWe then pile on a new $20 billion program called Supplemental Coverage \nOption that subsidizes crop insurance deductibles.\n  The bill also strips out an amendment offered by my colleagues \nSenator Durbin and Senator Coburn which would have prevented crop \ninsurance subsidies from going to individuals with a gross income \ngreater than $750,000 a year. That amendment was adopted by 59 votes in \nthe Senate's farm bill earlier last year. And guess what. Surprise. It \nis absent from the conference agreement. Millionaire farmers can \nrejoice that their crop insurance subsidies are safe. That is \nmillionaire farmers, farmers with a gross income greater than $750,000 \na year. So the next time I hear the managers of this bill talk about \nthe small farmer, I guess they are talking about millionaires as well.\n  But it is all part of farm bill politics. In order to pass a farm \nbill, Congress must find a way to appease every special interest of \nevery commodity association from asparagus farmers to wheat growers. If \nyou cut somebody's subsidy, you give them a grant. If you kill their \ngrant, then you subsidize their crop insurance. Let's look at several \nhandouts that special interests have reaped in this year's farm bill.\n  The bill provides $7 million in grants for the marketing of sheep. \nNow some who may be viewing this at home will maybe think I am making \nit up that we are spending $7 million of their tax dollars for the \nmarketing of sheep.\n  It also adds a thing called--and I am not sure I pronounce it right--\n``japonica rice.'' Japonica rice is a sushi ingredient grown primarily \nin California, and it is added to the list of products that can receive \nfarm subsidies.\n  The bill provides $100 million to promote the maple syrup industry. I \nrepeat: $100 million to promote the maple syrup industry. It says \nAmerican tax dollars will go to--and I quote from the bill--``promote \nresearch and education for maple syrup production . . . promoting \nsustainability in the maple\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\nsyrup industry . . . and market promotion for maple syrup.''\n  So, my fellow citizens, the next time you see an advertisement for \nmaple syrup, you may want to watch it because it is your tax dollars \nthat paid for it.\n  It places a 15-cent fee on harvesting Christmas trees. Not even \nChristmas is left out of this one--a 15-cent fee on harvesting \nChristmas trees. That money then is earmarked for promoting the orchard \nindustry.\n  There is $12 million for a ``wool research and promotion'' program. \nThere are a lot of needy areas of America today, but I had no idea that \nwool research and promotion was worthy of $12 million of our tax \ndollars.\n  I think this next one is probably my favorite--or unfavorite: $5 \nmillion for a study to--again, I am quoting from the bill--``evaluate \nthe impact of allowing schools to offer dried fruits and vegetables to \nchildren.''\n  I know that is a tough decision for schools to make, as to whether \nthey should offer dried fruits and vegetables to children. Do we need \n$5 million to help them evaluate that?\n  There is $25 million for a new grant program to ``teach children \nabout gardening, nutrition, cooking''--and get this--``and where food \ncomes from.'' I am sure all over America children are asking: Where \ndoes food come from? This may sound like a well-intentioned initiative, \nbut this grant program is a lot like 18 other food and nutrition \nprograms that the Government Accountability Office declared duplicative \nin a report issued 2 years ago.\n  The Federal Government's duplication of nutrition programs has cost \n$62.5 million annually in previous years. So here is a new grant \nprogram under the label of ``nutrition education.''\n  The energy title of this bill doles out about $881 million in energy \nprograms. Most Americans do not realize that the farm bill has become \nas much about energy subsidies as about farm subsidies. There is \nfunding for ethanol research, biorefinery installations, and a sugar-\nto-ethanol program where the Federal Government purchases surplus sugar \nand sells it at a loss to ethanol producers.\n  American taxpayers will spend $5 million on the Biodiesel Fuel \nEducation Program. Now, if there is anything that is needed in America, \nit is a good, vigorous biodiesel fuel education program. We are going \nto spend $5 million on it. It is to spread the gospel on the benefits \nof biodiesel. I have no objection to the use of biodiesel. In fact, I \nthink I prefer it much more as an alternative compared to corn ethanol. \nBut here we have $5 million to educate consumers on the benefits of \nbiodiesel.\n  Hidden in this bill is a tax on heating oil. Just yesterday, the \nWashington Times talked about the farm bill's National Oilheat Research \nAlliance Program in an article entitled ``Congress seeks to jack up \nfees on home heating oil in midst of frigid winter.'' The article \nreads:\n\n       Congress' mammoth farm bill restores the imposition of an \n     extra fee on home heating oil, hitting consumers in the cold-\n     weather states just as utility costs are spiking. The fee--\n     two-tenths of a cent on every gallon sold--was tacked onto \n     the end of the 959-page bill, which is winding its way \n     through Capitol Hill. The fee would last for nearly 20 years \n     and would siphon the money to develop equipment that is \n     cheaper, more efficient and safer, and to encourage consumers \n     to update their equipment. The heating oil fee was backed by \n     Northeast lawmakers who said it would fund important research \n     to benefit consumers.\n       The bill prohibits oil companies from passing the fees on \n     to consumers, but taxpayer advocates said that's a sham and \n     that the money has to come from consumers. To say they can't \n     pass on the cost, said Diane Katz, research fellow in \n     regulatory policy at the Heritage Foundation, ``It's kind of \n     silly because of course the costs are going to get passed on. \n     Money is fungible.''\n\n  So here we have a special oil tax on consumers where the revenue is \nearmarked back to the heating oil industry, about $15 million a year \naccording to the GAO. Why is the Federal Government in the business of \ncollecting funds for heating oil research on behalf of the heating oil \nindustry?\n  The bill reauthorizes USDA loan subsidies for peanut growers and \nallows them to use their peanuts as collateral. If a peanut grower \nforfeits on their USDA loan, the Federal Government takes ownership of \nthe peanuts and taxpayers bear the cost of storing the peanuts.\n  The infamous sugar program is housed in this farm bill. This is \nprobably the most ongoing scandal in the history of all of the farm \nbills and of all of the egregious aspects of it. Like the peanut \nprogram, USDA gives sugar growers, primarily in Florida, Louisiana, and \nMichigan, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans each year.\n  If a sugar grower misses their profit margins, they get to keep the \nloan and transfer their excess sugar to the Federal Government as \ncollateral. Over the past year, sugar subsidies and forfeitures have \ncost the taxpayers $258 million, while over 640,000 tons of sugar was \nhanded over to the USDA.\n  You know something. If you really look at it, there are a few \nfamilies that control the sugar industry in Florida. Those families, \nGod bless them, have given generous contributions to both Democratic \nand Republican parties. So the taxpayers have paid $258 million and \nover 640,000 tons of sugar was handed over to the USDA. Combined with \nimport tariffs and marketing controls, the USDA Sugar Program costs \nconsumers over $3 billion every year, one of the most obscene Federal \nfarm subsidies ever conceived. This farm bill, advertised as full of \nreforms, does nothing.\n  Another bizarre handout in this farm bill that I have been involved \nin now for many years is the creation of a catfish office. Again, I \nassure my colleagues, I am not making this up--a catfish office inside \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture at a cost of $15 million a year.\n  The USDA will hire inspectors to visually inspect catfish in seafood \nfacilities--only catfish and not shrimp, not a cod, not a tilapia, but \nonly a catfish. We are going to have a special office called--\nappropriately--the catfish office, to inspect visually catfish in \nseafood facilities--and only catfish.\n  Senator Shaheen and I and 11 other Senators have sponsored \nlegislation to kill this catfish program. I have been opposing it for \nyears. In 2012, our legislation was adopted in the Senate by voice \nvote. I assure the distinguished manager of the bill that is the last \ntime that on this issue I will accept a voice vote. The distinguished \nchairperson assured me that with a voice vote this amendment of ours \nwould remain in the legislation, and obviously that has not been the \ncase.\n  So next time the distinguished manager, if it ever comes up again, \nassures me that an amendment of mine will be adopted in the final \nlegislation, I will have to have better authentication than just taking \nher word.\n  Last year, the House Agriculture Committee passed a bipartisan \namendment to repeal it in the farm bill. Despite all this opposition, \nthe unpopular catfish office resiliently survived conference. We do not \nneed a new USDA catfish inspection program. The Food and Drug \nAdministration already tests catfish, along with all other seafood.\n  But certain farm bill conferees are insisting on creating a catfish \noffice because catfish farmers in Southern States do not want to \ncompete against foreign catfish importers, particularly those from \nVietnam. Its true purpose is trade protectionism at the taxpayer's \nexpense. Under this farm bill, there will be a virtual ban on catfish \nimports for several years while foreign inspectors switch from FDA's \ninspection procedures to USDA's catfish procedures.\n  The Government Accountability Office investigated the proposed \ncatfish office. In four different reports--four different reports--they \ncalled it ``duplicative'' and ``wasteful'' and warned that it fragments \nour food safety system by splitting FDA's ability to inspect seafood.\n  In fact, one GAO report was simply titled, ``Responsibility for \nInspecting Catfish Should Not Be Assigned to USDA.'' It called on \nCongress to eliminate the catfish office. Both the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture and the FDA have questioned the scientific value of the \nproposed catfish office. Several years ago, USDA studied the idea and \nconcluded that there is substantial uncertainty regarding the actual \neffectiveness of a USDA catfish inspection program. Even the \nPresident's budget proposed to zero it out.\n  American consumers should also be concerned about the trade \nimplications of this program. Some nations, including Vietnam, have \nthreatened WTO retaliation against American agricultural exports, like \nbeef and soybeans.\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\n  Trade experts warn that this catfish gimmick is the kind of \nprotectionism that harms our efforts to win concessions under trade \nagreement negotiations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which could \nreduce the tariffs on American products sold to Asian trading partners.\n  Again, Senator Shaheen and I tried to eliminate the catfish office in \nthe Senate's farm bill, but the managers blocked the vote on our \namendment. The House Agriculture Committee did the right thing and \npassed the farm bill amendment to eliminate it. Unfortunately, when \nthis bill went to conference, several Senate conferees blocked the vote \nin conference to repeal it--actually blocked a vote in conference and \nactually rewrote the law to increase it.\n  It seems that catfish is one bottom feeder with friends in high \nplaces. At the end of the day, this farm bill will be hailed by its \nsupporters as reform-minded. Let me assure the American public that \nthis is hardly reform. It was managed under a closed amendment process \nand will prove to be more wasteful and costly than any farm bill we \nhave ever seen.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \nbill. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Wall \nStreet Journal Editorial appropriately entitled, ``A Bipartisan \nTaxpayer Raid.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 28, 2014]\n\n                       A Bipartisan Taxpayer Raid\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       President Obama delivered his State of the Union address \n     Tuesday night to the usual bipartisan cheers for proposals \n     that don't have a chance of becoming law and that half the \n     Members despise. If you want to know what they were really \n     cheering about, take a gander at the gaudy spectacle of the \n     2014 farm bill, which gives bipartisanship a bad name.\n       Congressional negotiators on Monday unveiled this hulking \n     949-page special-interest bonanza, which will cost nearly $1 \n     trillion over 10 years--or more than President Obama's \n     stimulus. House Agriculture Chairman Frank Lucas, said to be \n     a Republican, and Senate counterpart Debbie Stabenow (D., \n     Mich.) are advertising the bill's token savings and reforms. \n     The real headline is how complete a victory this is for the \n     entitlement and farm-subsidy status quo.\n       Start with the fact that the subsidy programs are still \n     linked to food stamps. House conservatives last summer \n     revolted to force the chamber to separate the two, in an \n     attempt to end to the unholy alliance of urban Democrats and \n     rural Republicans that sustains the growth of both. The \n     conferees negotiated a remarriage.\n       Republicans also caved on a House provision to limit the \n     food-stamp reauthorization to three years, which would have \n     required a debate on a separate timetable from farm subsidies \n     in the future. The final bill reauthorizes everything for \n     five years, setting the stage for a logrolling repeat.\n       As for food stamps, the House bill had reduced future 10-\n     year spending by $39 billion--a mere 5%--in a program that \n     has doubled in cost since 2008 and is now about $80 billion a \n     year. The ``compromise'' settles for a cut of $8 billion over \n     10 years (1%), which is barely larger than Senate Democrats' \n     opening bid of $4 billion.\n       The elated conferees are bragging that they closed a food-\n     stamp ``loophole,'' but that's a rosy interpretation. ``Heat \n     and eat'' is a classic liberal spending tactic by which \n     states direct small home-heating assistance checks to \n     households solely to make those households eligible for food \n     stamps.\n       The reform requires that households receive all of $20 in \n     annual federal heating assistance (rather than today's $1) to \n     trigger benefits. They must be laughing at that one in the \n     grocery lobby. Meanwhile, Republicans abandoned reforms that \n     would have tightened the program, such as making food-stamp \n     eligibility contingent upon asset tests (as used to be the \n     case) or work requirements (as under welfare reform).\n       The farm crew is also boasting they eliminated the ``direct \n     payment'' program--handouts that go to growers whether they \n     produce a crop or not. Yet the $5 billion in savings is \n     rolled back into the government-subsidized (and uncapped) \n     crop-insurance program as well as a new ``shallow-loss'' \n     program that guarantees farmers' revenues and could balloon \n     to $14 billion a year.\n       Speaker John Boehner is getting credit for winning his \n     showdown with Collin Peterson over the Minnesota Democrat's \n     demand for a new Soviet-style program to manage U.S. milk \n     supply. The conferees stripped that stinker, but they salved \n     Mr. Peterson's feelings by fiddling with a separate insurance \n     program as an alternate means to give government control over \n     milk production.\n       Handouts to agribusiness and millionaires? Continued trade \n     protectionism for the sugar industry? It's all still there. \n     Heritage Foundation research fellow Daren Bakst notes that \n     the GOP even rolled over for President Obama's Christmas tree \n     tax, which demands a 15-cent assessment on every fresh-cut \n     Christmas tree, to fund an industry promotional program.\n       Republicans get credit for keeping the bill free of \n     earmarks, and for bucking Democratic demands that the bill's \n     savings go to more spending, rather than deficit reduction. \n     But with the Congressional Budget Office reporting on Tuesday \n     that the bill saves a pathetic $16.5 billion over 10 years \n     (rather than the $23 billion negotiators claimed), these are \n     linings without much silver.\n       The apparent GOP political calculation is that it needs an \n     election-year farm bill to solidify its rural-voter support \n     and to ward off President Obama's attacks that they are mean \n     to poor people. Talk about premature surrender. Unlike the \n     autumn government shutdown, the farm bill did give them real \n     political leverage. Democrats and Mr. Obama want food stamps \n     and a farm bill. Republicans could have held out at least for \n     some reform progress. The main achievement of this bill will \n     be to re-elect Mr. Peterson, the Democrat, and give more GOP \n     voters reason to wonder why they elected these guys.\n       Oh, and it's no accident that Congress dropped this porker \n     under the cover of State of the Union hoopla. GOP leaders are \n     eager to leave town for their annual retreat and to avoid a \n     conservative revolt. So they are planning a vote Wednesday \n     morning, fewer than 48 hours after it was unveiled.\n       So much for Mr. Boehner's promise to run a more transparent \n     Congress and allow 72 hours for Members to read what they are \n     voting on. The American people elected a GOP House not merely \n     to oppose the Obama agenda, but to stand for real reform. \n     They deserve a lot better than this.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the conference report for the 2014 farm \nbill represents a true compromise in the longstanding tradition of the \nAgriculture Committees. The proposal continues numerous reforms and \nprogressive policies that we created, expanded, or strengthened in \nprevious farm bills when I served as chairman of the Senate Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  This agreement is not perfect, and each side had to give. For \nexample, we were very far apart and had to negotiate on how we were \ngoing to support the food assistance programs we have. But, in this \nbill we have preserved SNAP and rejected the draconian House provisions \nthat would have meant the end of food assistance for nearly 4 million \npeople. I take solace in knowing that no one who needs this assistance \nwill be kicked off the program.\n  As a conferee and as a longtime supporter of SNAP, what we used to \ncall food stamps, I am proud of what we have done in this bill to \nimprove SNAP--the Nation's most effective nutrition program. It has \nbeen a crucial support to needy families around the country, \nparticularly during the recent economic downturn.\n  First, we took a number of steps to improve overall program \nadministration and program integrity. While SNAP is extremely efficient \nand effective with low rates of fraud, we can always strive to do \nbetter. This bill equips States and USDA with a number of new tools to \ncontinue their strong track record on program administration.\n  In this bill we have provided USDA with additional resources to \nimprove integrity. USDA has a strong and commendable commitment to \nrooting out fraud in the program. But the number of stores accepting \nSNAP has increased significantly, which means that USDA must continue \nto improve its efforts to monitor retailers. This bill provides USDA \nwith additional resources to boost its use of technology, for example, \nby taking advantage of innovations like data mining, which can show \npatterns of redemption among retailers and help pinpoint outlets that \nmay be abusing the program. We expect USDA to use data analysis and \nother smart tools to uphold the program's high compliance standards.\n  The bill also provides funding for pilot projects for State and \nFederal partners to address retailer fraud. States selected for the \npilot must demonstrate a commitment of resources to recipient \ntrafficking and they must prove that they have accurately determined \nfraud. The States that have successfully found and fought fraud should \nreceive priority in partnering with USDA on the retailer fraud pilot \nprojects. But success is not defined as a State that has used threats \nto persuade recipients to accept disqualification. Subsequent audits \nmust confirm that the State disqualified participants who truly were \nguilty of fraud and not confused about their rights or scared\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nabout the possibility of being prosecuted under criminal law, as it is \nunderstandable that some innocent people may be.\n  One of the thorny issues we wanted to tackle was the issue of how to \nhandle when clients request to have their EBT card replaced multiple \ntimes. The concern was that some households were repeatedly reporting \ntheir cards stolen or lost. USDA thought that some households \nrequesting that their cards be replaced 10 or more times per year were \nselling those cards. We wanted to empower the agency to address that \nissue. In the case when a household requests an excessive amount of \ncard replacements, the household must provide an explanation about why \nthey need another card. We know from experience that some households \nrequest multiple cards because they are confused about program rules. \nWe heard one report about an elderly woman who requested a card \nreplacement each month because she thought she was supposed to throw \naway the card after she used the benefits. By asking households to \nprovide an explanation, States will be able to accommodate individuals \nwho need more help to access their benefits. Of course, making a \nhousehold wait to receive a new card until it provides an explanation \nis a burden for the household. Increasingly, States aren't answering \ntheir phones in a timely way. So this requirement should not be imposed \non households unless we have a reason to believe there is a problem--\neither with their ability to use the card or with program integrity. We \nexpect that USDA will not impose this new requirement on households \nthat lose their cards a few times. We understood that they would set \nthe trigger for the explanation at least at 4 times a year.\n  It is also important that households be able to provide their \nexplanation through any number of options, such as over the phone to \ntheir EBT customer service center, via e-mail or mail. Most important, \nwe don't want SNAP agencies requiring households to provide their \nexplanation in person. That is too burdensome a requirement, \nparticularly when many offices may be far away from a given recipient \nand have long lines and delays to see someone. And, no matter what the \nreason a household provides, States cannot withhold their card or use \nwithholding the card as leverage to compel some other action. \nObviously, if the State believes the household has committed fraud or \ndoesn't believe their explanation, the State should investigate. If \nthey discover illegal activity, they can pursue a fraud violation \nthrough regular program rules. Those are steps that come after the \nState reissues the food card. I am particularly concerned about how \nthis provision is implemented with respect to vulnerable groups such as \nthe homeless, people with disabilities, or seniors. We don't want these \nindividuals or any struggling household to lose access to their food \nbenefits because their lives are chaotic and messy. We do not want \nvulnerable people to feel that their food benefits are conditioned upon \ngiving the right answer about why they lost their card. We cautioned \nUSDA to make sure that this provision was not used to delay benefits in \nany way. We can balance program integrity needs with compassion for our \nmost vulnerable citizens.\n  The farm bill also tightens SNAP eligibility in response to some rare \ncases.\n  One of the provisions that got a lot of attention was the provision \nthat reiterates that felons who have been convicted of certain crimes \nsuch as murder and who violate their parole or probation cannot be \neligible for SNAP. SNAP has long banned fleeing felons from the \nprogram. My good friend former Senator Lugar championed that rule. But \nMembers felt that it was important to reiterate this rule with respect \nto ex-offenders who served time for particularly heinous crimes. As has \nbeen the case for many years now, those who serve their sentence and \nare in compliance with the terms of their parole or probation and who \nare otherwise eligible for SNAP may apply for and receive assistance \nthrough the program. This provision does not change anything with \nrespect to program eligibility or program operations. States already \nhave the processes in place to implement this provision.\n  Second, over the last several years, there have been highly \npublicized instances where SNAP participants who won big at the lottery \ncontinued to receive SNAP. My understanding is that both of these \nwinners lived in Michigan. Of course, people who win millions of \ndollars from the Powerball do not need the help of SNAP, and for the \nmost part program rules would already exclude them. But we wanted to be \nsure that this type of thing never happens again. We included a \nprovision to prohibit households where someone won a substantial amount \nof money from a lottery or gambling from participating in SNAP. We are \nleaving it to USDA to define ``substantial''. Our expectation is that \nthey will not include nominal winnings that don't permanently change \nthe household's economic circumstances or their ability to purchase \nfood.\n  We also expect USDA to work with States to ensure that this provision \nis implemented behind the scenes without asking questions of clients. \nWhile we had two lottery winners, the nearly 47 million people who \nparticipate in this program are struggling. We don't want them to be \nasked if they had won the lottery when they are going through the \nprocess of applying for benefits. State lotteries and gaming \ncommissions must report winners that exceed the threshold to state SNAP \nagencies. That way, State agencies can remove individuals with \nsubstantial lottery or gambling income without requiring reports from \nevery participant or adding questions to current SNAP forms.\n  While I am focused on using back-end data matching to implement this \nprovision, I would like to discuss the bill's provisions that have to \ndo with what we call data matches. Data matching helps SNAP to preserve \nits record of strong program integrity and also cuts States' and \napplicants' paperwork requirements.\n  First, the bill makes it possible for SNAP to more easily exchange \ndata with other programs by adding Federal standards for such data \nsharing. This sensible provision means that our systems can ``talk'' \nwith each other across the various State and Federal programs. It is a \nwelcome and timely change. We expect the administration to protect \nindividuals' personal private information and prevent it from being \nmisused.\n  We also are requiring States to use HHS's National Directory of New \nHires when certifying a household for SNAP to help the State determine \neligibility and what level of benefits the household should receive. \nRight now States' use of the database is optional. We think the Federal \ndatabase could be helpful to States to find important information about \nthe employment of noncustodial parents who live or work in other \nStates.\n  Finally, the bill puts in statute the existing State practice of \nusing the Federal Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program, \nor SAVE, to verify immigration status. States can use this to \nefficiently determine eligibility without requiring a household to fill \nout unnecessary forms or find paperwork. This does not change anything \nwith respect to immigrant eligibility rules or households' \nresponsibilities. This requirement is another example of a behind-the-\nscenes administrative efficiency in the bill. The use of the Income \nEligibility Verification System, or IEVS, will remain optional, though. \nIt is sensible for the administration to set standards for how to \nverify immigration status through a national immigration data set. \nGiven low rates of error and fraud in SNAP, we did not want to dictate \nhow and when States use IEVS.\n  On the topic of data matches, I want to make clear that we want \nStates to use available data sources containing up-to-date, accurate \ninformation that helps determine SNAP eligibility and benefit levels as \nStates are making their decisions. Matches can help us to verify what \nclients tell us and reduce burdens on them. Matches can also identify \ninformation that clients failed to reveal. However, data matches are \nsometimes wrong and they can require a lot of staff work to correct, as \nwell as place undue burdens on clients. This bill should not be \ninterpreted to force States to seek or to use unhelpful data matches or \nwhere they determine the data match is not cost-effective. We expect \nthe Secretary will help States determine the best ways to use the data \nsources. It is not sensible to pay for matches for all individuals or \nto do the\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\nmatches every month or quarter, rather than as the State is making an \neligibility decision or if the State has uncertain information about a \nSNAP recipient. States need the flexibility to determine that an \nindividual living a 2-hour drive from the State border with a verified \nlong-term job in the community does not need to be checked in the new \nhire data base to determine if he is working out of State. We expect \nUSDA to work with HHS to find ways to hold the costs of the match to \nState agencies and the Federal Government in check, while maximizing \npayment accuracy. As always, States must ensure that SNAP applicants \nand recipients always have a chance to prove that data matches are \ninaccurate.\n  As useful as data matching can be, we need to remember to ensure some \nbalance on program integrity efforts. It is an inefficient use of \nresources to have eligibility workers looking for information about \nclients every minute of the day. Asking States to follow up on matches \nthat may not yield any changes in eligibility or benefit levels isn't a \ngood use of States' time and resources. In the last two farm bills, we \ntook steps to establish certification rules such that States would \ncarefully assess eligibility at certification and recertification. In \nthe interim, unless States had information to suggest that clients were \nincome ineligible or participating in two households, households were \nto continue to receive benefits without disruption or inquiries about \ntheir circumstances. Those changes worked. Overall program \nparticipation is up among eligible households, suggesting that we were \nright to make it easier for households to maintain benefits. States \nneed to focus on adjudicating eligibility at application and renewal. \nThis framework informed our approach to the use of datasets. We want \nStates to use third-party data to make eligibility renewals as \nefficient as possible. But, this information is not meant to be used in \nfruitless fishing expeditions to prove households ineligible or to find \ndata that requires needless back-and-forth between the client and the \nagency during their certification period.\n  I would like to turn now to talk about one of the more exciting \naspects of the nutrition title. The final bill includes several reforms \nof SNAP's employment and training program, including new investments in \nidentifying innovative job training opportunities for this population.\n  Most SNAP participants who can work, do work. As we know, however, \nmillions of Americans are out of work. So we want to find more ways to \nhelp those who are able to work but have been unable to secure a job. \nWe also want to find ways to build and grow the skills of workers so \nthat they may find better jobs with better pay.\n  SNAP work programs will receive better, and more, funding in this \nbill. It gives $200 million to pilot and evaluate new state employment \nand training programs. States can draw these pilots from SNAP E \ncomponents, but the programs can also include work supports, like child \ncare or transportation assistance, that those with low-paying jobs \noften cannot afford. We want to help States build pioneering volunteer \nprograms, which if focused on skills building or education programs, \nmight boost an individual's employability. It was imperative in this \neffort that States be creative and try different approaches to \naddressing the barriers that could be keeping individuals from working, \nsuch as stable housing or childcare.\n  We recognize that it is far better for the long term for people to \nsecure and keep unsubsidized jobs in the private sector. So we have \nallowed those types of arrangements to be considered part of the \npilots. But because States will have much less control over information \nabout what private employers are doing, we needed to include \nsignificant safeguards. We fully expect that these pilots will operate \nunder longstanding protections from the SNAP law and other laws against \nthe displacement of other workers, as well as workplace protection laws \nsuch as those for health and safety, wage and hour standards, family \nleave, workers' compensation, and the like.\n  The initial House proposal in this area was surprising in its \nharshness. The House essentially gave States incentives to throw off of \nSNAP people who could not find jobs. Furthermore, the proposal allowed \nStates to then spend on whatever they wanted the savings obtained from \nthrowing people out of the SNAP program. I thank the leadership of the \nconference committee, especially Chairwoman Stabenow, for holding firm \nto the principle in designing these work pilot projects that we should \nnot give States any new authority to take away people's SNAP benefits \nwhen they cannot find jobs. The rules under the pilot project for \nsanctioning people will be the same as under current law in terms of \nwhen sanctions can be applied and for how long.\n  When it comes to sanctioning individuals for refusing to cooperate in \nemployment and training programs, we already have in place protections \nto ensure that if there are good cause reasons for noncompliance that \nindividuals cannot be sanctioned. Similarly, for how these are extended \nto employment activities under the pilots, the agreement ensures that \nunless clear evidence shows that an individual wilfully refused to take \nactions that she or he could safely and properly take, participants in \nemployment activities in the work pilots may not be subject to \nsanctions. For instance, no sanction will apply if the employer gives \nthe individual fewer hours than expected or if the individual's mental \nor physical disability prevents the individual from succeeding at the \nwork or if childcare or transportation is not available at the time \nwhen he or she has been asked to work. Willful refusal to cooperate is \ndifferent from failing to perform adequately at work. Some low-skilled \nworkers will fall short at the workplace as a result of taking jobs \nthat may be at the outer limits of their ability. This is a difficult \ndetermination, and a State may have a hard time telling with a private \nsector employer whether an individual wilfully refused to comply or \nwhether the employer made demands that the employee could not, for \nwhatever reason, comply with. In such instances, it is inappropriate \nfor States to take away SNAP benefits.\n  In designing the pilots, we did not intend in any way to take away \nfrom States' existing authority to treat jobs that SNAP applicants and \nrecipients have found for themselves as allowable work activities and \nsupport such work with support services like childcare and \ntransportation.\n  Figuring out which services and activities work the best for \ndifferent types of people is a hard nut to crack in the job training \nworld, but it is one of the main goals of these pilots, and so we have \nrequired a careful evaluation. With the low-wage labor market the way \nit is and such a high percentage of SNAP recipients working already, we \nmust ask how we will know whether the State's program and services made \na difference. So we have required that only projects where the State \ncan guarantee they will participate fully in the evaluation should be \nincluded in the pilot. We especially want to know more about how States \ncan most effectively assess SNAP participants' needs early and match \nthose needs to the right education and training programs and other \nsupportive services that will positively affect that individual's job \nprospects.\n  Even though we have invested heavily in these handful of pilots, we \nalso want to learn more broadly what is working and not working so well \nacross the country in getting SNAP participants the skills and training \nthey need to get and keep a well-paying job. So under the bill States \nmust report more on the results of the services that they provide to \nSNAP participants. Using this information, USDA will work with the \nother experts in job training to improve assessment of whether SNAP \nemployment and training can attain more longlasting results and will \npush States to focus on proven activities. We will rely upon this \ninformation when we reauthorize the program five years from now. We \nunderstand that SNAP participants are often poorer and have lower \neducation and skills than people who participate in other job training \nprograms, and as such, we made clear we must have appropriate \nexpectations of these services' outcomes and take those differences \ninto account. In this slow-growing economy, everyone will not find work \nimmediately. Sometimes we have to invest now in building skills to see \na better outcome for people in the future, and when designing measures, \nwe expect USDA to take a long-term view.\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\nAs I mentioned above, upfront assessment is key, and so, while \nindividual assessments already are a requirement for SNAP work \nregistrants, we expect the USDA to have a focus on assessment as part \nof the state measures.\n  Now, let's turn to how this farm bill modernizes SNAP through a \nnumber of improvements for retailers.\n  The way we buy our food is evolving rapidly, and this bill helps SNAP \nremain in step. This bill gives the Secretary authority to test mobile \ntechnology use in SNAP, such as applications for smartphones that have \nbecome increasingly common and hold special promise to simplify SNAP \ntransactions at farmers markets and vegetable stands. But we don't want \nrecipients to see higher prices and we don't want program integrity to \nlapse as we seek additional ways to accept benefits. As a result, we \nstart in this bill with a pilot project to test the idea. We expect \nUSDA to pay special attention to testing fraud-prevention measures, so \nthat these new technologies do not open the program up to new schemes \nfor criminal activity. Some things will be tricky in a mobile \nenvironment. USDA currently relies on inspections of retailers' stores \nas a way of keeping out unscrupulous retailers, and so will need to \nfind ways to reliably distinguish between eligible and ineligible or \ndisqualified retailers in a comparable fashion as it implements this \nprovision.\n  Pilot projects testing purchasing food online with SNAP benefits also \nare allowed under the bill, reflecting a trend in the food industry \ntowards online transactions. The delivery of groceries could \npotentially help elderly or disabled recipients to access food more \neasily. Of course, we worked here too, to ensure that the same strong \nprogram integrity standards apply to this potential new way of \nredeeming benefits and we require, in the bill, that the agency stop \nthe expansion of online transactions if the Department determines the \nfraud risk is too great. We were clear that SNAP benefits cannot pay \nfor any delivery fees associated with online purchases, but we also \nexpect USDA to also set standards for the fees to ensure that they are \nnot so high that, on balance, this provision results in more hunger. \nAfter all, SNAP recipients rely on the program because they cannot \npurchase enough food--high fees would make hunger worse. USDA should \nensure that fees are capped at very low levels and are clear to the \nrecipients so that they are not surprised at the time the food is \ndelivered.\n  On the topic of modernizing SNAP benefits, I am troubled by the \nrecent reports of States seeking to include photo identification or \nfingerprinting as a way of supposedly ensuring program integrity. That \nis not a direction I think the program should go. One of the main \nadvantages of moving to SNAP benefit cards, away from the paper \ncoupons, was that the transaction looks the same and so there is less \nstigma. USDA should not approve State attempts to require photos on \nSNAP cards unless there is an airtight way of making sure every \nhousehold member can use the card, as well as any other person who is \nauthorized to shop for the SNAP recipient. There is no need for SNAP to \npursue such measures when other card issuers, like credit card \ncompanies, have not insisted on such measures to maintain security even \nthough those cards are issued to individuals.\n  One final point I want to make about EBT cards. Last fall, because of \na glitch with the computers at an EBT contractor, Iowa and about 15 \nother States had their EBT systems go out of commission for hours, \nwreaking havoc in grocery store aisles and leaving thousands without \nfood. In this bill we have taken another step to ``modernize'' by \nrestricting the ability of States to routinely issue manual vouchers, \nbut we have created an important exception for disasters or system \noutages. We expect USDA to create a simple, fast way for States to \ndeclare that they need to invoke this back-up plan.\n  In addition to these changes for how retailers take SNAP benefits, \nthe bill also raises the bar for retailers in an effort to increase the \navailability of healthy foods. Stores that want to participate in SNAP \nhave an obligation to participate as full partners in making healthy \nfood available to low-income Americans.\n  Some retailers have sought to spread SNAP issuances out over longer \nperiods during the month for the purposes of evening out their \nbusiness. This is allowed now through staggered issuance, and some \nlanguage in the statement of the bill managers encourages USDA to allow \nbenefits to be staggered throughout the month.\n  I am sympathetic to the need for retailers to not have spikes and \ntroughs in their business, but I am deeply concerned about a practice \nin some States I have heard of where, as part of a State's staggered \nissuance plan, households may receive no benefits for as long as 10 \ndays during a month. Apparently this is in the ``transition'' to \nstaggering benefits, but this kind of hardship in the name of smoothing \nretailers business is very troubling. SNAP benefits already are low and \nrun out for many households before the end of the month. To add on \nanother 10 days before the household receives the next month's benefits \ncould be a devastating hardship and means more children, senior \ncitizens, and people with disabilities going to bed hungry or facing \nheart-wrenching decisions.\n  The SNAP law regarding staggered issuance actually does provide a \nrequirement to protect households from stretches without food during \nthe transition. We revisited this provision in the last farm bill and \nagain reaffirmed that households may not experience a cut as a result \nof staggering benefits over the month. Nonetheless, I understand that \nthe Department has not fully enforced this rule. One solution would be \nfor the Department to allow States to protect households during the \ntransition with a one-time increase in the month prior to cover the \ntransition period.\n  In this debate over the last several years I heard repeated concerns, \nparticularly from some House Members, that SNAP was somehow out there \nrecruiting people who don't need food assistance to sign up. This is a \nridiculous claim. Quite the opposite is true. Some people need help \nlearning about the program, and there are many groups around the \ncountry who are working day in and day out to ensure that people who \nneed some assistance have the information they need to sign up, have \nmisperceptions cleared up, and can get some help navigating what is a \nvery complicated and burdensome process.\n  At the insistence of the House, we included some narrow provisions to \nprevent some perceived, uncommon abuses. We ended the USDA's \ncollaboration with the Mexican consulate and we prohibit groups who \nhelp sign up eligible households from being paid on a ``bounty'' basis \nfor each successful application, a practice I don't believe occurs very \noften, if at all.\n\n  But we have been assured that we have done nothing in this bill to \nundermine the great work that goes on around the country by dedicated \nindividuals and community groups to help educate and assist our low-\nincome neighbors. We still hear that the main reasons eligible \nhouseholds don't sign up are that they are not aware of the program, \nthey don't understand how it works, or they don't understand the \nprogram rules and can't get through the process. In this bill, we have \ndone nothing to change the education and application assistance \nactivities that states and community groups can engage in. We have long \nprohibited ``recruitment,'' which is trying to talk someone into \napplying if that person has made an educated choice to not apply. In \nthis bill we codify that definition. But we fully expect that it will \ncontinue to be allowable for USDA, States, and other partners to share \ninformation about the program, the advantages of participation, how the \nrules work, and to assist people in applying for benefits. Such \nactivities may change someone's mind about applying, but it is \nacceptable to change your mind because you learned new, accurate \ninformation or because you understand what you have to do to apply. \nThat is not persuasion, but rather, is education, and is still \ncompletely appropriate under this bill.\n  So to be clear, we have severed the relationship with the Mexican \nGovernment related to SNAP. And while it is inappropriate for anybody \nto receive their pay as a ``bounty'' per application, it is fine to be \ntracking how many people a group assists in applying and the outcome of \nthe application process. That is just a common, responsible\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\npractice for assessing whether the group successfully is achieving its \ngoals. Section 16(a) already prohibits tying anyone's pay to the number \nof people disqualified from SNAP and we have extended that principle to \napplication assistance.\n  I do want to address the one significant cut in SNAP benefits that \nthe nutrition title includes. I am disappointed that as a result of \nthis bill 850,000 very low-income households are going to lose food \nassistance. There are certainly many ways we could have reinvested \nthese funds into SNAP to improve the program and reduce hardship, but I \nhave to agree with my colleagues that the practice of issuing a \nhousehold just $1 in energy assistance so that they can deduct more \nincome than we had intended goes too far and it is sensible to address \nthis issue.\n  In this bill we have limited this practice. It is a painful loss for \nfamilies who benefit from this policy, but the change repairs the \nunintended oversight. What happens is that States can give SNAP \nhouseholds without heating or cooling expenses a token LIHEAP payment \nof $1 or less, which enables them to qualify for a utility deduction \nand in turn increases their SNAP benefits.\n  But we do not want this provision to affect any households in the \nStates that have not engaged in this practice or to cut benefits for \nhouseholds that do pay for utility expenses in the States that engaged \nin the practice. I know LIHEAP is a critical program in helping low-\nincome families meet their energy needs, especially in cold weather \nplaces and in winters like the one we're having this year. When the \nState has already determined that a household needs help paying for \nutilities, it is wholly appropriate for SNAP to piggy-back on that \ninformation. We expect the Secretary to work with States to ensure that \nwhere a legitimate LIHEAP payment is made--that is, when LIHEAP has \ndetermined the household pays heating or cooling costs that such \ninformation still can be used to authorize a utility allowance in SNAP \nand that nothing should change in how the State makes this \ndetermination. All we wanted to do was shut down the inappropriate \npractice of very small LIHEAP payments to households without utility \nexpenses from triggering a full SUA.\n  In addition, we also expect USDA and States will work to ensure that \nhouseholds that do not receive LIHEAP but that do incur utility \nexpenses will continue to be able to receive the appropriate allowance. \nMany households do pay separately for utilities and need the SUA to \nreceive adequate benefits. In cases where the cost of gas for heating \nis included in rent but the household pays for air conditioning or \nwhere the landlord has a surcharge to rent for utilities, the tenant \nshould be able to claim the higher standard utility allowance.\n  We understand and regret that some of the effective dates in this \nlegislation will result in considerable time pressure for the \nDepartment and States as a result of the slow process by which the \nfinal bill came together. We hope they make their best effort to meet \nthese deadlines. But agencies should not establish any claims against \nhouseholds for benefits that would have been proper under prior rules \nbecause new rules have not yet been implemented. None of this is the \nfault of any household, and they should not have to experience the \nhardship of recoupment or tax intercept because the policymaking \nprocess moved slowly.\n  Several other provisions in the bill's nutrition title deserve a \nmention.\n  In Puerto Rico the Nutrition Assistance Program block grant plays a \nunique role in the safety net because the island does not receive \nsignificant funds from other programs that are available in States, \nsuch as TANF and SSI. Despite this, Puerto Rico remains shortchanged on \nnutrition assistance too--if NAP operated as SNAP does in the States, \nparticipation would be 15 percent higher and the program would cost \nmore than 22 percent more in Federal dollars. Because of these \ninequities, Puerto Rico can currently issue 25 percent of its SNAP \nbenefits to households as cash, rather than in a form that can only be \nspent on food. As a result, some of the benefits likely are spent on \nother essential household items. Although I have no objections to \ncurrent law, responding as it does to the unique circumstances of \nPuerto Rico, on the Agriculture Committee we have been under pressure \nto end this cash allotment. However, I fear that such a change could be \nvery problematic for some participants who really need access to \ncertain nonfood items and lack any other means of obtaining them. This \nbill requires a study on how eliminating the cash portion of the \nnutrition grant would affect Puerto Ricans. Assuming the study shows \nthat it's feasible to make such a change, the cash allotment will be \ngradually phased out. But we wanted to be sure to protect poor Puerto \nRicans, and so under the bill, if the Secretary determines that \neliminating the cash portion would cause hardship, he or she can exempt \ncategories of participants. The exemption could apply to the entire NAP \ncaseload if the study shows that changing the policy would \nsignificantly and adversely affect all participants.\n  The bill also requires USDA to test changes to food assistance in the \nCommonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. USDA will explore whether \nCNMI's food aid can be configured more like the national SNAP structure \nand then a pilot is authorized subsequently to test this new approach. \nWe understand that many of SNAP's administrative requirements may not \nbe appropriate for CNMI, so we don't expect an identical program, just \none that moves in that direction. If the Secretary finds that it is not \nfeasible to run such a pilot, the funds available in this bill can be \nused for any of the things that the existing CNMI block grant currently \nallows for.\n  The bill also provides for a pilot program to test the provision of \ncanned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and \nVegetable Program. The program, as the name suggests, currently allows \nfor only fresh fruits and vegetables. The pilot in the conference \nreport was included at the suggestion of some in Congress who believe \nthat providing other forms of fruits and vegetables will be beneficial \nfor the health of children.\n  I myself am skeptical of the need to make changes to current law with \nrespect to the program. As we know from a recent, rigorous evaluation \nof the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, the program is currently \neffectively improving child health and increasing consumption of fruits \nand vegetables. In addition, the program is extremely popular with both \nchildren and with schools, with far more schools desiring to be \nincluded in the program than are able to do so because of limited \nfunding. This doesn't sound to me like a program that is not working.\n  But the pilot program will settle the question of the health impact \nof canned, frozen, and dried fruits and vegetables, allowing us to know \nfrom a sound scientific study whether allowing canned, frozen, and \ndried fruits increases consumption at a level consistent with a fresh-\nonly program. Luckily, we have a sound benchmark for purposes of \ncomparison that can be found in the evaluation of the fresh-only \nprogram. And it will be interesting to learn whether other forms of \nfruits and vegetables improve kids diets in the same way the current \nprogram does. In carrying out this pilot, we expect USDA to put \ntogether the soundest methodology possible so that we can compare the \nperformance of the fresh-only program with one that also provides \ncanned, dried, or frozen fruits and vegetables.\n  In addition, the bill makes a couple of changes to the Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children \nprogram, known as WIC.\n  WIC provides healthy foods, nutrition education, and health care \nreferrals to nearly 9 million pregnant and postpartem women, infants, \nand very young children, and has a strong track record of improving \nbirth outcomes as well as the diets and health of participants. One \nreason that WIC has been so effective is that the foods the program \nprovides were selected through a rigorous, science-based process to \nfill gaps in the diets of the low-income women and very young children \nwho participate. There have been many efforts over the years to get \nCongress to intervene in the specific foods offered by WIC, the most \nrecent of which has been an attempt to require WIC to offer white \npotatoes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's decision to exclude\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\nwhite potatoes was based on the recommendation of the Institute of \nMedicine, which found that Americans already consume plenty of white \npotatoes and providing them through WIC would crowd out purchases of \nother vegetables, like leafy greens, that are truly lacking in \nparticipants' diets. The absence of such a requirement in this \nlegislation reflects a firm commitment by Congress to protecting the \nintegrity of the WIC Program by keeping the process of selecting which \nfood to offer science-based.\n  Another one of WIC's hallmarks is that it is very cost-efficient. \nEach year Federal WIC spending is reduced by $1.5 billion to $2 billion \nas a result of a competitive bidding process for infant formula, which \nresults in sole-source contracts between State WIC programs and infant \nformula manufacturers. In light of the tremendous savings associated \nwith these sole-source contracts and the valuable health improvements \nthat WIC participation brings, Congress has remained strongly committed \nto WIC's competitive bidding process for infant formula. This \nlegislation calls upon USDA to study the implications of sole-source \ncontracting across all nutrition programs, as well as upon retailers \nand consumers, including the important role that sole-source contracts \nplay in WIC. Our consideration of the WIC Program when it is next \nreauthorized will benefit from a comprehensive assessment of the \nimplications of WIC's infant formula bidding process for participants, \nretails, and other consumers, as well the implications for federal \ncost-containment efforts and the ability of the WIC program to serve \nall eligible applicants.\n  As I said at the start, this agreement is not perfect. Each side had \nto give a little, but I am proud that we have rejected provisions that \nwould have kicked worthy SNAP recipients off the program and this \nproposal is a sound, balanced, bipartisan bill. It contains significant \nreforms, and extends and funds progressive elements that I was proud to \ninclude in previous farm bills. Coming to agreement wasn't easy, but \nthis farm bill takes an important step forward in dealing with the \nNation's most important food and agricultural issues. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first of all, I thank our majority \nleader again, as I did earlier today, for his help in bringing this \nconference report to the Senate as quickly as possible and for his \nwillingness every step of the way to work with us. I thank my partner \nin the Senate, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, for his wonderful \nleadership.\n  At this point in time I will turn to him and allow him to make his \nstatement before proceeding with mine. I want to say to Senator Cochran \nand to all of those in Mississippi who are lucky to have him as their \nSenator fighting for them what a pleasure it has been to partner with \nhim and his really excellent staff, and to have the opportunity to come \nhere today with a strong bipartisan product that represents the \nagricultural and food interests of all parts of our country.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am honored to be invited by the \ndistinguished chairman to proceed in describing our work product, the \nfarm bill conference report. It has been a true pleasure working with \nher and the members of her staff, it seems like over a long period of \ntime with her coming to my State of Mississippi and traveling to other \nregions of the country to get a first-hand impression and a lot of \nknowledge about the challenges being faced by the agricultural sector \nin our country. She has brought to this effort a lot of enthusiasm and \ncommonsense intelligence and pure old hard work. Also, there are the \npersonal courtesies that abound to all of us who serve on the \nagriculture committee in the Senate, during hearings preparing for the \nmark-up of an agriculture bill and during conference with our \ncolleagues in the House to produce a conference report.\n  I am pleased that this conference report represents a 5-year farm \nbill. It is very important to production agriculture and to all \nAmericans, as a matter of fact. The leadership that we have had from \nother Senators on the committee is reflected here too. We have had an \nactive committee participating in hearings as well as our mark-up \nsessions. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Stabenow and with \nall of our fellow colleagues on the committee.\n  We are recommending reforms in this legislation that are designed to \nassure producers that we understand the value of a safety net that will \nsupport them when they are struck by disasters or other things that are \nout of their control. Marketing disasters are just as severe as \nweather-related disasters. The risk management policies in the bill \nrecognize the regional differences in priorities of agricultural \nproduction throughout the country. The commodity and crop insurance \ntitles of the conference report reflect how Congress can work \neffectively to support American agriculture and at the same time be \nresponsible to taxpayers.\n  The conference agreement consolidates and improves programs to \nencourage farmers and ranchers to use healthy land and forest \nmanagement practices to conserve land, water, and wildlife resources. \nPrograms such as the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program, which will \nbecome a part of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the \nWetlands Reserve Program, are very important elements of a new emphasis \non conservation.\n  We also achieve savings that are significant from reforms in the \nnutrition title of the program. The expected costs of nutrition \nprograms are reduced by $8 billion. The conference report includes \nprograms to combat waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I am particularly proud of our work to address the needs of our \nNation's food banks because whether it is in Jackson, MS, or in \nIndianapolis, IN, many people turn to these facilities when other \noptions are not available.\n  Other titles of this legislation, such as the research title, have \nproven that keeping the United States' lead in agricultural research is \nessential to our maintaining an edge in global competition. Our land-\ngrant universities, such as Mississippi State University and Alcorn \nState University in my State, have seen their university-based research \ncommercialized to improve American agricultural production.\n  In addition to agricultural production reforms, this conference \nagreement contributes to the goal of deficit reduction. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the bill will save taxpayers \nnearly $17 billion. The farm bill baseline was trimmed by $6 billion \nfrom sequestration, resulting in an overall savings of $23 billion.\n  Failure to enact this farm bill would leave farmers and related \nbusinesses with uncertainties that have been hanging over the \nagricultural sector for the past 2 years. This bill achieves \nsignificant savings and addresses a variety of agriculture needs across \nthe country.\n  I urge the Senate to support passage of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Again, I wish to say what a pleasure it has been to \nwork with the distinguished Senator from Mississippi and also with the \nchairman in the House, Congressman Lucas, and the ranking member, \nCongressman Peterson.\n  This really has been an example of the House and the Senate working \nin a bipartisan way. We are about to take the final steps now in \npassing the 2014 farm bill. We have actually passed this twice in the \nSenate. Each time we have gotten large bipartisan majorities because of \nthe fact that we have worked together.\n  The final conference report that we have before us is one of which I \nbelieve we can all be proud. I hope my colleagues will support it and \nsend it to the President for his signature.\n  We all know this has been a long time in coming--in fact, frankly, \nway too long. Our farmers and ranchers have waited way too long.\n  This bill has seen a long and winding road, but in the process we \nhave worked together. We have not quit. We have worked across the \naisle. The final bill has the support of over 370 different groups, and \nthey represent those from all over the country and all over the \nideological spectrum. That is because we wrote this bill when we were \nworking hard to find common ground.\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nWe listened to each other, we respected each other, and we developed a \nbill that works for every kind of agricultural production in every \nregion of our country, for families, and for consumers across the \ncountry.\n  We have 16 million people who work in America because of \nagriculture--16 million people. Many of them work in Michigan. Many of \nthem work in Mississippi, California, New England, Virginia, North \nDakota, and in every other State in this great country. They grow \ndifferent crops in different climates, and they have different needs. \nThat certainly is one of the challenges, always, for a farm bill, \nparticularly when we are talking about a farm bill that reforms \nprograms. Those 16 million people were on our minds every single minute \nas we wrote this bill, and that is why we have such a strong coalition \nsupporting this farm bill.\n  This is a farm bill for the future with a whole new focus on \nresponsible risk management, healthy, locally-grown foods, strong \nconservation practices, clean energy, and research. In fact, it is a \nbit of a misnomer to call it a farm bill. It is 12 different bills, all \nof them impressive and worthy of colleagues' votes, and they all are \nput together in what we call the farm bill.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about these different pieces and all \nof the great policies that we have been working on for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  The first title, the commodity title, if we were going to split off \nthe commodity title of the farm bill and give it a name of its own, we \nwould probably call it the farm bill. That pretty well describes the \ncommodity title. Maybe that is why--even though the commodity title of \nthe farm bill is, in fact, smaller in terms of spending this year than \nit has been before--the farm bill has held onto its name all of these \nyears.\n  Once upon a time the commodity title was the be-all and end-all. The \nfirst farm bill was written during the Great Depression, when the \nentire agricultural system in the country broke down. Farmers left food \nto rot in the fields because crop prices were so low. It would bankrupt \nthem to spend the money to harvest and to ship their products to \nmarket.\n  At the same time, people were so desperate for food that some of the \nmost iconic images of the Great Depression are long, crowded bread \nlines that stretched for blocks and blocks. We have come a long way \nsince the Great Depression, and our agricultural farm policies are very \ndifferent than they once were. That is why this farm bill focuses on \nthe future of agriculture in this country. This is not your father's \nfarm bill.\n  In 1996 Congress passed a law called Freedom to Farm that eliminated \nthe last vestiges of those production controls. To give farmers time to \nget used to the new system, that bill created a system of direct \npayment subsidies, which were supposed to be temporary.\n  But it didn't quite work out that way. Those payments continued, farm \nbill after farm bill, even when it was quite clear they were no longer \ndefensible. The checks kept coming in good years and in bad. In some \ncases the checks went to people who weren't even farming.\n  In the budget climate of today, we just cannot afford those business-\nas-usual policies of the past. It was one of my top goals, as we wrote \nthis bill, to end direct payments once and for all, and that is exactly \nwhat we have done together in this farm bill.\n  We also went through this bill page-by-page and made major reforms. \nWe streamlined programs. We have cut red tape. We have eliminated \nwaste. The first thing in this bill, on page 1, line 1, is repealing \ndirect payments.\n  This is not your father's farm bill. This is a critical step in \nchanging the paradigm of agricultural policy. Instead of direct payment \nsubsidies, we are shifting the focus of the farm bill to responsible \nrisk management. Farming is a risky business. In fact, I can't think of \na more risky business than farming in this country. We saw this in \nSouth Dakota last fall when a freak blizzard wiped out tens of \nthousands of cattle and devastated ranchers. We saw this the year \nbefore when record-setting droughts wiped out crops across America's \nheartland. We saw it in Michigan where the combination of an early thaw \nand a late freeze almost destroyed our entire cherry crop and our apple \ncrop.\n  No other industry is as dependent on the whims of Mother Nature or on \nthe wild swings of the market as agriculture. That is why we have a \nfarm bill. We have a stake, and we should be proud we have the safest, \nmost affordable food supply in the world because we partner with \nfarmers. That is why risk management is our No. 1 goal in this bill.\n  In fact, it is what farmers have been asking for. They want the \nability and, more importantly, the responsibility of managing their own \nrisk. Of course, in a country as big and diverse as ours, the risks \nfaced by farmers in Michigan are very different from the risks faced by \nfarmers in Mississippi or Oklahoma or Minnesota. That is the key \nprinciple that guided us when we wrote the bill to make sure it worked \nfor all different kinds of crops throughout the country.\n  As farmers are managing their risk, we are giving them the choice to \nparticipate in an Agricultural Risk Coverage Program--that we are \ncalling ARC--which will help them cover losses they incur at the \nindividual farm level or county level or they can participate in a \nPrice Loss Coverage Program which will trigger if prices drop below a \nreference price.\n  Both of these programs will use historically-based acres decoupled \nfrom production to minimize any influence from the program on farmers' \ndecisions on what or where to plant. We don't want them planting to the \ngovernment program.\n  In addition, in order to qualify for either of these programs, \nfarmers must agree to comply with conservation and wetlands \nrequirements. They are so important.\n  We are reforming the system to stop subsidy payments to millionaires, \nand we have imposed a new, overall cap--a first-time overall cap--of \n$125,000, for the first time covering both crop support and marketing \nloans, all parts of the commodity title.\n  This is the overall commodity title cap passed by the Senate, even \nthough underneath the cap there were differences. We are requesting the \nUSDA to close what is called the management loophole by updating its \ndefinition of ``management'' and giving the Secretary, for the first \ntime, the authority to put limits on the numbers of managers on a farm \nthat can qualify for payments.\n  By ending direct payments once and for all--by asking farmers to take \nresponsibility for managing their own risk, and by partnering with them \nso that they can do it, and by capping farm payments and stopping \npayments to millionaires--we are putting in place the most significant \nreforms in agricultural policy in decades. This is a bill our \ncolleagues can be proud to vote for.\n  In hearing some of the opposition, people are debating the old farm \nbills and not understanding what we have done.\n  Every farmer we have talked to in writing this bill said that crop \ninsurance was their top priority. So we strengthened crop insurance and \ngave more crops access to this kind of insurance.\n  With this bill, we are taking significant steps to change the \nparadigm of farmer programs. With crop insurance, farmers don't get a \ncheck, they get a bill. They may pay tens of thousands of dollars in \npremiums and never get a check in a year because it is a good year and \nthere is no disaster, just like any other kind of insurance.\n  This bill also includes a very important permanent livestock disaster \nassistance program for ranchers who lose livestock due to severe \nweather, disease or other acts of nature. In the past, Congress had to \npass ad hoc disaster assistance for livestock producers, adding to the \ncost and the complexity of the program. These have been some very tough \nyears for ranchers. In fact, livestock herds are down to their lowest \nlevel since 1951--imagine that--because of what we have seen.\n  That is why this bill, for the first time, has a permanent, funding \nbaseline, and a system that will ensure our ranchers don't go bankrupt \nbecause of a freak blizzard in October or a scorching drought that \nwipes out a rancher's feed supply. This disaster assistance is applied \nretroactively to October 1, 2011, and makes the program permanent.\n  One of the worst agricultural disasters happened in 2009 to our \nAmerican dairy farmers. That is why we worked\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nvery hard in this bill to strengthen the dairy safety net by replacing \nthe existing dairy supports with two new programs. The dairy margin \ninsurance program, another insurance program, protects producer margins \nequal to the difference between the all-milk price and a national feed \ncost. We are taking special care to make sure that these insurance \npremiums are affordable for small and medium-sized dairy farms, making \nsure, especially, that we focus on any farm with fewer than 200 cows.\n  The Dairy Product Purchase Program, which is new and is a part of \nthis, gives the Department of Agriculture the flexibility to purchase \ndairy products, milk, and other products when margins fall below $4. \nThose dairy products will be donated for the first time to families in \nneed, through public and private organizations, including food banks, \nhomeless shelters, and soup kitchens. This was a hard-fought compromise \non dairy. I have to say my preference would have been what we passed \ntwice in the Senate as a strong dairy policy. But given the resistance \nof the Speaker and the leadership in the House and the need to be able \nto find something we could move forward on and pass that would work for \ndairy farmers, we worked very hard to find a way to move forward to get \nthe votes and support and make sure we were helping farm operations in \nevery region of the country. We know the pressures on the New England \narea farmers are very different from the pressures on our own producers \nin Michigan or in the Midwest or on the west coast, and we have worked \nhard to find something that works.\n\n  While title I of the farm bill reforms programs so farmers are taking \nresponsibility for their own risk, title II of the farm bill is about \nrisk management for the whole country. This is the conservation bill in \nthis farm bill. In all the discussions in the farm bill, it too often \ngets overlooked. In fact, it is our Nation's largest and most enduring \ninvestment in conservation on private lands, which are the majority of \nour lands in America.\n  This farm bill includes a historic agreement between supporters of \ntraditional commodities and environmental and conservation groups to \nlink conservation compliance to crop insurance--critically important as \nwe eliminate direct payments and ask farmers to manage their risk \nthrough crop insurance. We do not want to create unintended \nconsequences of risk for our lands and our water resources.\n  At the start of this farm bill process, commodity groups and \nconservation groups were on very different sides on this issue, but \nthey sat down together, they listened, and they found common ground. It \nturned out their differences weren't as great as they thought they \nwere. In fact, no one has a bigger stake in protecting our land and our \nwater than our farmers. With a little compromise and a lot of hard \nwork, which is the story of this entire bill, they brought us a plan \nthat conserves soil and water resources for generations to come and \nprotects the safety net for farmers to rely on.\n  This has been called the greatest advancement in conservation in \nthree decades. I wish to underscore for my colleagues that this is an \nimportant and historic agreement, and I thank everyone who has been \ninvolved in the hard work of putting it together.\n  We have also created a new sodsaver provision to prevent farmers from \nplowing up native prairie lands, saving money for taxpayers and saving \nabsolutely critical wildlife habitat. We need to manage land to prevent \nerosion. That is how we avoid having another dust bowl during droughts. \nIt is equally important to continue preserving wetlands that help \nprevent flooding and create important wildlife habitats for ducks and \nbirds and other waterfowl.\n  What else does the conservation title do? It directly preserves \nmillions of acres of wildlife habitat, which in turn has helped to \nrebuild populations of duck, quail, and pheasants, among others. That \nis why the bill has the strong support of the National Wildlife \nFederation, Ducks Unlimited, The Nature Conservancy, Quail Forever, \nPheasants Forever, the Audubon Society, World Food Program USA, and the \nWorld Wildlife Fund, which are only a handful of the more than 250 \nconservation groups that have endorsed this bill.\n  To strengthen conservation, we went through every program and focused \non making it more flexible, easier to use, and we were able to take 23 \ndifferent programs, cut it down to 13, and put it into 4 different \nareas with a lot of flexibility that also allowed us to save dollars in \nthis bill.\n  The first is working lands, giving farmers the tools they need to be \nthe best stewards of their natural resources. The centerpiece of this \nfunction is called EQIP--the Environmental Quality Incentives Program--\none of the most important conservation programs out there for farmers. \nEQIP gives technical and financial assistance to farmers, ranchers, and \nprivate forest owners to help them conserve soil and water.\n  Working lands conservation also includes the Conservation Stewardship \nProgram, which encourages higher levels of conservation and the \nadoption of new conservation technologies. We continued the \nconservation innovation grants and the Voluntary Public Access and \nHabitat Incentive Program, which allows landowners to get value-added \nbenefits from their land by opening them to hunting and fishing and \nbird watching. We made these programs even more flexible and added a \nfocus on wildlife habitat, making them easier for farmers to use.\n  The second area, the Conservation Reserve Program, recovers highly \nerodible land from production to benefit soil and water quality as well \nas wildlife habitat. Despite record droughts over the last few years--\ndroughts that in many ways were worse than during the Dust Bowl--the \nsoil stayed on the ground. We haven't had a Dust Bowl. The soil has \nstayed on the ground. CRP was a big part of that, protecting not only \nthe soil but air quality as well.\n  We also continued an important incentive program to help older \nfarmers transition their land to beginning farmers.\n  One of the parts of the conservation title that I am most proud of is \na new focus on regional partnerships. This will have a big impact on my \nown Great Lakes--that we in the Great Lakes area love so much--as well \nas the Chesapeake Bay and other critical areas where there are large-\nscale regional conservation challenges. We consolidated several \nprograms into one, which will offer competitive, merit-braced grants to \nregional partnerships made up of conservation groups, universities, \nfarmers, ranchers, and other private landowners to support improved \nsoil health, water quality and quantity and habitat for wildlife.\n  The final area includes conservation easements, which lets landowners \nvoluntarily enter into agreements to preserve wetlands and farmlands \nand protect them against development and sprawl. We consolidated and \nstreamlined existing easement programs to protect important land for \ngenerations to come.\n  The farm bill is also an export bill. In fact, agriculture is one of \nthe few areas where our Nation maintains a healthy trade surplus. That \nis why this farm bill continues efforts to expand opportunities for \nAmerican exports, including the Market Access Program, to promote U.S. \nagricultural products in overseas markets and develop programs to open \nnew markets for American agricultural products.\n  The farm bill is also a humanitarian bill that speaks to the best \nabout us and our American values. Around the world millions of people \nget their only meals as a result of the generosity of the American \npeople through the Food for Peace and the McGovern-Dole program.\n  I saw this last year firsthand in Haiti, where schools would open \nbags stamped with the American flag and provide a modest meal to \nstudents every day--very likely their only meal that day. I met one \nlittle boy who saved part of his lunch to take it home in his bag to \nhis parents so they could have something to eat that night.\n  In fact, in the life of this program, more than 3 billion--billion--\npeople in over 150 countries have gotten a meal thanks to the \ngenerosity of the American people and the American farmer.\n  The farm bill makes major reforms to our food aid program, speeding \nup emergency food aid response and giving flexibility to organizations \non the ground to supply local food to people in need. These reforms \nmean that because of this farm bill we will feed another 500,000 people \naround the world. That is\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\nwhy this bill has earned the endorsement of many humanitarian and \nreligious groups, including Feed the Children, the ONE Campaign, CARE \nUSA, Church World Service, Catholic Relief Services, Presbyterian \nChurch (U.S.A.), the United Methodist Church, and the American Jewish \nWorld Service, among many others.\n  Of course, we know hunger and poverty strike families all around the \nglobe, including right here at home. I believe in the richest country \nin the world it is a disgrace for any child to go to bed hungry at \nnight or go to school hungry in the morning. Crop insurance is disaster \nassistance for farmers who have been hit by a natural disaster. The \nnutrition title of the farm bill is disaster assistance for families \nwho have been hit by an economic disaster. Most families who need food \nassistance only need it for a few months, and the vast majority of \npeople receiving food help are children, the elderly, and the disabled, \nincluding our disabled veterans.\n  When the House of Representatives passed their nutrition bill, they \nincluded many provisions that would have seriously hurt Americans, such \nas many in Michigan who have paid taxes all their lives, lost their \njobs through no fault of their own, and are mortified they need help to \nput food on the table for their families while they are getting back on \ntheir feet. This conference report rejects every single one of those \nharmful provisions. Instead, this final conference report before us \nstrengthens the integrity and accountability of the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program--or SNAP--ensuring every dollar is spent \nresponsibly so those who need help can get it.\n  The bill stops lottery winners from being able to get SNAP benefits \nand stops the use of SNAP funds at liquor stores. It also includes an \nimportant provision that addresses what the Washington Post called ``a \nblack eye on the program.'' We have streamlined eligibility \nrequirements to cut down on wasteful duplication, but a number of \nStates discovered a way to use that streamlining to give some families \nadditional SNAP benefits by counting utility bills they do not have. By \nsending out as little as $1 in home heating assistance, States have \nbeen able to qualify families for a utility deduction, even if they do \nnot pay any utility bills.\n  I salute those who want to help people get additional funds. I would \nhave very much supported adding additional help in this bill, but this \ncannot be justified--what is being done here. We addressed this \nloophole and protected the entire program for 47 million people.\n  Here is what we have done and here is what it means to someone on \nSNAP. If you receive $20 or more a year in low-income heating \nassistance--if you receive $20 a year in low-income heating \nassistance--nothing changes for you. If you receive less than $20 a \nyear, you will need to go back to the old system of producing an actual \nutility bill in order to receive credit for a utility bill.\n  That is the sum total of where we have received and garnered the \nsavings in this bill as it relates to closing loopholes. This is about \nstrengthening the integrity of this program to ensure that food \nassistance is there for families who have fallen on hard times.\n  The farm bill also includes a number of pilot programs to help people \nfind work or receive job training so they do not need food assistance. \nThe Secretary of Agriculture can approve these pilots, which include \nfunding for child care and transportation to make sure individuals are \nable to succeed.\n  The bill increases funding for food banks, continues an important \neffort that provides supplemental food for seniors as well as the \nsenior farmers market program.\n  I am pleased this bill has the support of the AARP and others who \nunderstand the importance of senior nutrition.\n  The farm bill continues efforts to serve fresh fruit and vegetable \nsnacks in schools, and includes a new national pilot based on something \nwe do in Michigan called double Up Food Bucks. It essentially doubles \nthe SNAP benefits for families when they shop for fresh produce at \nfarmers markets.\n  I also wish to mention the healthy food financing initiative, which \naddresses the very serious problem of lack of access to grocery stores \nin low-income neighborhoods. There are many places in Michigan where \nthis is a very serious issue. This financing initiative will help \nfamilies put healthy food on the table while creating jobs in \nneighborhoods across the country.\n  It is also important to stress that the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects that this farm bill, in addition to addressing fraud and \nabuse, will spend $11.5 billion less on food assistance the right way--\nby the economy improving and people going back to work. So when we look \nat the fact that the numbers are going down, it is because of the \neconomy improving. Frankly, this is where we need to be focusing our \nefforts, on supporting businesses to create jobs, and part of the way \nto do that is by passing this jobs bill called the farm bill.\n  The farm bill is also a credit bill, increasing access to resources \nwhich help farmers, especially the beginning and veteran farmers, own \nand operate farms. This results in jobs. This title will make more \nqualified farmers, of all sizes, eligible for USDA farm loans and gives \nmore flexibility to the USDA so they can better reach new types of \nfarming, including local and regional producers.\n  With 16 million people working in agriculture across the country, the \nfarm bill is a jobs bill--and nowhere is that more evident than in \nAmerica's rural communities. The rural development title of the farm \nbill authorizes programs which are absolutely essential to small towns \nand rural communities and those who work in those communities.\n  We are continuing the important work of rural economic development \nand rural broadband. Just as rural electrification brought \nopportunities to families across the country in the last century, rural \nbroadband opens doors for increased commerce and interconnectedness for \nthe 21st century.\n  Ninety percent of community water systems serve 10,000 people or \nless. We provide mandatory funding to address the backlog of rural \nwater applications at USDA so rural communities have a safe supply of \ndrinking water.\n  For the first time we prioritize and reserve funding for rural \ndevelopment applications submitted by communities working together on \nlong-term, sustainable community and economic development plans because \nthese regional strategies will be more effective at the local level, \nand we want to provide as much flexibility as possible. The farm bill's \nrural development title is about entrepreneurship and the lasting \nstrength of small towns across America in which it invests.\n  As I mentioned earlier today, we are creating an innovative new \nFoundation for Food and Agricultural Research in this bill--modeled \nafter what we do with medical research--to tackle the difficult fight \nagainst pests and diseases, and it increases opportunities through \ninnovation to create jobs. For too many years, agricultural research \nhas suffered because of budget cuts over and over. This new research \nfoundation will bring together public and private funds to maintain a \nsteady stream of funding for this important research. We provide $200 \nmillion in seed money, and it can be matched by $200 million from the \nprivate sector in an ongoing commitment.\n  In addition to the new research foundation, we have a major new focus \non food and agricultural research throughout this bill. We have a major \nfocus on the specialty crops research initiative to find solutions to \npests and diseases that affect fruit and vegetable crops, and we have \nefforts in this title to support beginning farmers and ranchers as \nwell. We are also continuing successful research and extension efforts, \nincluding work done by our premier land grant universities--such as my \nalma mater, Michigan State University.\n  As to the forestry title, healthy forests mean clean air, fresh \nwater, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. Coupled with \nthe tools we have in the conservation title, the forestry title of the \nfarm bill helps foresters maintain the health of our private forest \nlands.\n  We are strengthening our efforts to fight invasive pests that have \ndestroyed many thousands of trees, particularly in the West. We worked \nhard to ensure that private landowners can continue to effectively \nmanage their operations.\n  As I mentioned earlier this afternoon, the farm bill is an energy \nbill. I\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nam extremely pleased that during negotiations with the House we kept \nthe full funding from the Senate's energy title.\n  Our rural communities have been at the forefront of the effort to \nachieve American energy independence. We are strengthening these \nefforts through the highly successful Rural Energy for America Program, \nwhich helps farmers and rural small business owners generate their own \npower or improve energy efficiency to lower their utility bills. \nThousands of farms across the country have lowered their input costs \nthanks to the REAP program.\n  We are continuing our commitment to the development of the next \ngeneration of advanced biofuels. Scientific advancements are allowing \nus to develop ethanol with food and agricultural waste products. With \nthis farm bill, we will see even more biorefineries come online, \nproducing homegrown fuels which bring competition and lower prices for \nconsumers at the pump.\n  This farm bill also supports our growing biobased economy with my new \ngrow it here, make it here initiative. Biobased products are \nmanufactured items made from all kinds of plant materials that replace \npetroleum and other chemicals. These products are everywhere, from the \ncups in the Senate cafeteria--which are made by a Michigan company, by \nthe way--to cleaning products, industrial lubricants, and even the foam \nin the seats of cars which, if it is a new American-made car, will be \nbased on soy oil foam rather than petroleum oil. Biobased manufacturing \ncreates jobs, strengthens our economy, and reduces our use of fossil \nfuels.\n\n  As I have said before, this is a farm bill focused on the future, and \nnowhere is that more evident than in the specialty crops title. This is \nessentially the produce aisle of the farm bill. Specialty crops include \nfruits, vegetables, nuts, and nursery crops. We are strengthening the \nSpecialty Crop Block Grant Program, expanding specialty crop research, \nexpanding crop insurance to include specialty crops, and continuing the \nhighly successful fresh fruits and vegetables SNAP program in our \nschools.\n  We don't want to just grow more fruits and vegetables, we need to be \nable to get them to consumers. That is why this farm bill more than \nquadruples support for farmers markets. We are also strengthening local \nfood hubs, which bring farmers together with local supermarkets, \nrestaurants, and schools to supply locally grown healthy foods.\n  The farm bill also recognizes an incredibly fast-growing segment of \nagriculture--organics. We continue our efforts to support farmers to \nget certified as organic, expand crop insurance options to organic \nfarmers, and provide funding for continued organic research.\n  This bill truly reflects the diversity of crops we grow in America, \nand nowhere is that more evident than in the specialty crops and \norganics title.\n  In every part of this farm bill we worked on streamlining and \nconsolidating programs. In fact, we ended over 100 different programs \nand authorizations in this process. I said to my staff at the very \nbeginning: Don't think about programs. Think about principles--what \nshould we be doing in agriculture and food policy, not what programs do \nwe want to protect. That is how we have moved forward throughout this \nentire process.\n  There is one thing we did add and I am very pleased with; that is, a \nnew veterans agriculture liaison at USDA to work with our men and women \nin uniform who are coming home and want to get involved in agriculture. \nWe know the majority of our men and women are coming home to small \ntowns, such as where I grew up in northern Michigan, and rural \ncommunities, and we want to support them so they can be successful if \nthey choose to go into agriculture.\n  This is a new kind of farm bill, designed to meet new challenges of a \nchanging world. We are also making major reforms, eliminating \nunnecessary, unjustified programs to cut government spending and to \nincrease the integrity of farm programs.\n  This farm bill reflects critical steps in changing the paradigm, \nwhere we are ending subsidies and giving farmers the tools they need to \nmanage their own risks. We support them, but in doing that, as we know, \nwhen we have insurance products--and that is what we are looking at \nthroughout this bill, whether it is a new insurance-type approach for \ncotton or dairy or for our traditional commodities. With any other kind \nof insurance, you pay the premium, pay the premium, and pay the premium \nbut don't get any help unless there is a loss, a disaster. This is a \nfundamental shift in this farm bill, helping our farmers to manage risk \nin a fiscally responsible way.\n  I think my distinguished ranking member would admit it was a lot of \nwork. After all of this work, to my knowledge, we offer the Senate the \nonly effort where a group of people within their jurisdiction of \nauthority have voluntarily cut spending to reduce the deficit. If we \ncouple the sequestration cuts of approximately $6 billion and the cuts \nin this bill to agriculture, we are coming to the Senate and offering a \nbill of reform, cutting programs, cutting duplication, cutting spending \nthat actually creates $23 billion in deficit reduction. I am proud of \nthat. This truly is not your father's farm bill.\n  We are about to vote to bring debate on this conference report to a \nclose. But before we do, I once again thank my ranking member, the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, who has been a friend and a partner \nthroughout this entire process. I have enjoyed very much having the \nopportunity to work with Senator Cochran and his very competent staff. \nI learned along the way that we have a great love of music in piano \nplaying and the blues--which sometimes we were singing during this \nprocess. But it has been my great honor to work with him and our House \ncolleagues as we have worked to bring this forward.\n  My ranking member had a different perspective than I had, and we have \nwritten this bill together. I have learned a lot about the perspective \nof Mississippi and the South, and I hope I have shared the perspective \nof Michigan and the North--and the East and the West--as we have \nlistened to our colleagues. I urge our colleagues to support this \nconference report.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2642, the \nFederal Agricultural Reform and Risk Management Act.\n          Harry Reid, Debbie Stabenow, Robert Menendez, Bill \n           Nelson, Tom Harkin, Tammy Baldwin, Jon Tester, Michael \n           F.

On this vote, the yeas are 72, the nays are \n22. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                    Extending Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, it is an honor to speak for my first time \nin the Senate. As I speak today on the urgent need to extend \nunemployment insurance, I feel a sense of profound gratitude that I \nfirst want to note. First, I feel this gratitude to the people of the \nState of New Jersey. It is remarkable, the privilege they have given me \nto walk into this hall, to stand right in the area where the great \nSenator Frank Lautenberg stood, to work here in this hall which is \nfilled with such history, to have the privilege of sitting there at the \ndesk where the Presiding Officer is sitting and touch things that seem \nlike they should belong in a museum, like a gavel from hundreds of \nyears ago, to walk in here and see over our heads words like \n``courage'' and ``wisdom'' and ``patriotism.'' Most importantly, it is \na privilege to walk here among my colleagues, all 99 of them, every \nsingle one senior to me in months and years served, in wisdom, and in \nexperience. It is my prayer, first and foremost, that I prove worthy of \nthis incredible honor.\n  With all of that said, I also realize that I joined this body at a \ntime when Congress is not really thought that well of by the American \npublic. In fact, this institution's approval ratings are at an all-time \nlow. I find that not surprising. Even when I was running for this \noffice, I encountered so much frustration. In the days before I came \ndown here, people who you would think would love Congress would look at \nme and say: Go down there and give them hell. I think that is because \nso many people in America understand what we have endured for the last \n6 years, which is the worst economy of my lifetime. While we are seeing \nsome progress in our national recovery, it has come slowly and \nunevenly. Many families are still hurting. Americans believe Congress \nis not doing all it can to address the urgent problems they face. They \nbelieve that we have, in some cases, made problems worse. Some people, \nI understand, have surrendered to cynicism about government, cynicism \nabout America's future, cynicism about the ability for people \nthemselves to shape their own lives and their destiny. But we cannot \nallow the pain of so many Americans to overshadow that long history we \nall share. There is a reason why American history does not look kindly \nupon cynics and naysayers, for even with all of its wrenching pain and \nsavage problems, our collective past offers a resounding testimony to \novercoming impossible challenges, to righting terrible wrongs and \nadvancing deeper and deeper meaning to those very American words \n``liberty and justice for all.''\n  That is what our Nation is, the oldest constitutional democracy, a \ncountry founded not so that its people get special treatment because of \ndivine rights of Kings and Queens but because everyone is valued. We \ndid not get there right away. Even in our founding documents, where \nNative Americans are referred to as savages, African American as \nfractions of human beings, and women not at all, we have made progress.\n  I know I am here in this Chamber because of what this Nation has done \nby coming together. Like all of my colleagues, all 99 of them, we are \nnot here because of some royal lineage or entitled ancestor. I \npersonally stand here like others because of the grit, work, sacrifice, \nand discipline of my ancestors but also because they had the blessing \nto labor in a Nation that for generation after generation advanced to \ngreater and greater inclusion, greater and greater opportunity, spread \namong more and more people.\n  Our Nation has an enduring belief that when we struggle together for \na common cause America is better and we are all better. It is the \nunderstanding that we are a Nation with a profound and sacred \nDeclaration of Independence. Also, our country has a historical chorus \nthat profoundly proclaimed a declaration of interdependence.\n  We began and have endured because our ancestors understood the common \ncause that is America. This cause was heralded by our greatest leaders \nin every single generation, the people whose words and speeches and \nexamples inspired me to be here today. George Washington, an original \nFounding Father, reminded us of this principle and American ideal in \nhis farewell address where he wrote:\n\n       The name American belongs to us. We have in common cause \n     fought and triumphed together. The independence and liberty \n     we possess are the work of joint counsel and joint effort, of \n     common dangers, common suffering and common successes.\n\n  So standing here I am grateful that I have never forgotten what my \nmom has told me time and time again: ``Boy, don't forget where you come \nfrom.'' Well, I know from whence I come. I now from whence all of my \ncolleagues come. I am proud that we, all 100 of us, descendents of \nslaves, of immigrants, labor factory workers, domestics, of farmers who \nthrough toil brought from the earth hope, of business people, who with \nimpossible mountains before them climbed high and commanded forth new \nopportunity--all of us, despite our political differences, share a \ncommon heritage, and we share a common desire to solve problems, to \naddress the challenges that plague this Nation, that hurt families, to \nserve our country so that we may give truth to the words like \n``courage'' and ``patriotism'' and ``wisdom,'' so that they never \nbecome simply empty words etched above our heads but they constantly \nfuel the passion and desire of our hearts.\n\n  That is why 3 months in, almost to the day, I am inspired by the work \nof this body. I have not surrendered to the cynicism about it. I am \ninspired by the remarkable people who sit around me right now. This is \na great institution. I now have an even more fervent, relentless belief \nthat together we can address our common cause and the common challenges \nafflicting our national strength.\n  Principal among these challenges facing the United States is the \npersistent economic hardship and insecurity facing too many Americans. \nOur economy, though improving, is nonetheless failing too many people. \nEconomic trends and challenges, not of any individual's making, and \nparticularly not of the making of those who felt the pain of this great \nrecession the most, are forcing too many families out of the middle \nclass and into poverty.\n  This is not a threat to just some. It is a threat to us all. A \nshrinking middle class and intractable poverty is a threat to America. \nIt is a challenge to the very idea of who we profess to be as a Nation; \nthat each generation should do better than the one before; that we are \na land of growing prosperity shared by a widening population; that the \nidea that anyone born in any station, through hard work, self \ndiscipline, and sacrifice can make it in America.\n  But over the last few decades this has become less and less the case. \nYou see, wages are stagnant and by some measures have declined for the \nmiddle class. Social mobility in America, almost embarrassingly, lags \nbehind many of our competitor nations. More and more families are \nbeginning to question that idea that in America every generation does \nbetter than the one before.\n  More and more people now are getting stuck and feeling stuck through\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\nno fault of their own in a dismal hope-subduing economic condition. I \nwatched, when I was Mayor of New Jersey's largest city, how company \nafter company shed workers during the recession, how retirement savings \ncollapsed, how the ratio of people looking for jobs to jobs available \njaggedly cut against the American worker, still standing now at roughly \n3 Americans looking for a job for every job that is available.\n  Amidst this jarring recession, other economic trends continue to \ndeepen our national economic wounds. Companies are now outsourcing jobs \nand investment. New technologies bring incredible societal benefit, but \nthey are also driving many jobs into obsolescence. The worker in \nAmerica is facing a weakening in negotiating position.\n  So as a new Senator, I am inspired by my colleagues, many of them, \nand especially their incredible staff, the unsung giants of our Federal \nGovernment who are working hard to meet the challenges. I profess that \nI hear from Members on both sides of the aisle a true understanding of \nour common cause and our collective responsibility here in the Senate.\n  Senator after Senator to whom I talked in my first 3 months is \ndriving an agenda that gives my very hope sustenance. I am proud to \nroll up my sleeves and work with them regardless of party. While we may \nhave differences in approach and disagreements on strategy, the common \ncall to improve our economy has Senators nobly pushing what I believe \nare critical important legislative measures, measures that range from \nefforts to address our national skills gap, to expand educational \nopportunities, to boost our manufacturing sector, to lift small \nbusinesses, to promote research, development and investment in \ninfrastructure, and efforts to stop the perverse incentive that drives \njobs and investment overseas, and so much more.\n  But these critical and worthy efforts may take months or longer to \nmove through Congress and even more time to have an effect to expand \nour economy at the necessary rate. Thus they do not relieve us from the \nurgency to do more right now to help those families caught amidst these \ntreacherous economic trends.\n  These are families who so desperately want to work, who spend their \ndays searching for jobs, sending out resume after resume after resume, \ngoing online and filling out application after application after \napplication. There are tens of thousands of New Jersey families who are \nvisiting food pantries for food or depleting their savings accounts or \nare cashing out their IRAs and who are racking up credit cards just to \npay for necessities, who are skipping prescriptions, who are missing \nrent payments, and who are falling behind on their mortgages, letting \ncar insurance lapse, having their utilities canceled, and having their \nchildren miss out--sitting out of field trips or afterschool activities \njust because their parents can't afford the costs.\n  This is why unemployment insurance is critical. It is America \nanswering the call to help people in a crisis not of their own making.\n  I am proud, God, I am so proud, that for the past 50 years America \nhas answered that call time and time again to help others in crisis. We \nare America. We have been America. This is our tradition. When times \nare tough, as the great New Jersey poet sings: ``We Take Care of Our \nOwn.'' In fact, we are a nation that takes care of its own and reaches \nbeyond. If there is a crisis, America is there. If there is a crisis, \nbe it a typhoon in the Philippines, an earthquake in Haiti, America \nresponds; be it an act of terror in New York or Washington, an oilspill \nin the gulf, flooding in Colorado or a hurricane barreling up the \nnortheastern coast, America responds.\n  Our tradition is clear. When the vicious vicissitudes of the market \ncreate economic crises for our people at levels as high as they are \nnow, America responds. Extending unemployment insurance has always been \nviewed in this light.\n  When Senator Robert Wagner rose in the Senate in the mid-1930s amidst \na depression that cast millions of families--my family--into economic \nperil, he called the Social Security Act and its unemployment provision \na compound in which blended elements of economic wisdom and social \njustice exist.\n  George Bush, who extended unemployment benefits five times, at a time \nwhen unemployment was lower than it is now, said in very plain English:\n\n       Americans rely on their unemployment benefits to pay for \n     the mortgage or rent, food and other critical bills. They \n     need our assistance in these difficult times, and we cannot \n     let them down.\n\n  Our inaction in the Senate in not renewing emergency unemployment \nbenefits at the end of December, with national unemployment as high as \nit is now, has let millions of Americans, adults and their children \ndown--down into an avoidable economic misery.\n  In New Jersey, I found it was particularly stinging to our residents, \neven confusing to them, that when times were not as bad as they are \nnow, we acted with bipartisan, no-strings-attached conviction for our \nfellow Americans. Not only did we act when the unemployment rate was \nlower than it is now, but we acted to extend unemployment insurance \ntime after time when long-term unemployment was about half of what it \nis today.\n  President after President, Congress after Congress responded--but not \nnow.\n  When times were better, we responded--but not now.\n  When fewer people were struggling, we responded--but not now.\n  When foreign competition was not as fierce, we responded--but not \nnow.\n  When banks were irresponsibly overleveraged and when insurance \ncompanies were dangerously undercapitalized, when rating agencies rated \ntrash as treasure and when mortgage companies used reprehensible \npractices that harmed family after family, all together threatening to \ncreate cataclysmic crisis, we responded--but not now.\n  For millions of Americans suffering in these horrible economic \nconditions not of their own making, who play by the rules, who are \nlooking for work, who are struggling, who are suffering, we have more \nthan 50 years of history of responding and extending unemployment \ninsurance--but not now.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment just to extend and single \nout my gratitude for the leadership of my colleague Jack Reed. For his \nefforts, he has been incredible in trying to extend these benefits. He, \nalong with other of my colleagues, refused to give up. He has worked \nquietly and relentlessly to find a bipartisan solution. He has offered \ncompromise, offered pay-fors, and has offered a way forward that would \nbring hope. But so far that solution has proved to be elusive.\n  If we are to honor our collective legacy and tradition, we cannot \nsurrender in this moment to the partisanship of today. So many people \nare depending on this body to come together and find a way not left or \nright but forward for America, because every week that we delay, 70,000 \nAmericans lose their benefits. For thousands, every week, that means \nlosing a house, an eviction from an apartment, and depletion of \nsavings. Because 40 percent of those who received benefits have \nchildren, it means depriving our children of things we would all \nconsider the basics. Nearly 3 weeks ago I stood with Senator Reed and \npledged to go back to New Jersey and return with stories of the people \nI met who needed our collective action and needed us to come together. \nTwelve events later, after stops all across New Jersey, my heart has \nbroken time and time again.\n  It is broken by the former A manager in River Edge, working every \nday to find a job and has burned through his entire life's savings; by \nthe Hunterdon woman whose home of decades has gone into foreclosure. \nShe is working every day to find a job but is in crisis; by the soon-\nto-be father in Paterson, working hard every day to find a job but is \nwracked with worry about providing for his new baby; by the father of \nfive in Bridgetowne who now struggles every day to find a job but also \nto afford life's basic necessities. He was talking to me about keeping \nthe heat on, about how they can keep gas in the car and food on the \ntable. He told me about the strain and the stress it is creating in his \noldest, a 10-year-old son.\n  These stories from cities to suburbs, from Barbara and Robert's \nkitchen table in Old Bridge, NJ, to the County Griddle Lounge in \nClinton, NJ, to the One Stop Center in Plainfield, NJ, were eerily \nsimilar and, most of all, they\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nwere all avoidable with action from Congress.\n  Eileen from Bernardsville told me she had been looking for work for 1 \nyear. Federal benefits allowed her to stay afloat and afford the things \nnecessary to find a job, money for gas, dry cleaning, a cell phone. \nEven in front of other job seekers, she couldn't disguise her anger and \ndisappointment with Washington. Her anger was about feeling that she \nand others were being ignored. She told me she felt ashamed of a \ncountry that would turn its back on its own people. She is mad about a \nCongress that she feels doesn't hear her, but she is mostly mad that \nanyone, especially a Member of Congress, would say she is lazy.\n  She is right to be mad, especially about the absurd notion that \nunemployment benefits provide a disincentive to work. That allegation \nfrankly burns me. It is something I have heard too often; that somehow \npeople are lazy or that unemployment insurance and payments, as meager \nas they are, provide a disincentive to work. This, to me, is \nintellectually dishonest and, according to most studies, factually not \ntrue.\n  This is one of those corrosive political strains that burns the \ncollective gut of our national truth, pitting, actually, American \nagainst American and violates that American wisdom--my mom always told \nme--that we should not look down on another person unless we are \nextending a hand of help. We are not calling them lazy.\n  When I was mayor of Newark, I saw my share of lines of good people \ndoing that well, offering a hand of help. These lines, I will tell you \nas mayor, motivated me even harder to double down because they were \nlines at soup kitchens where Americans were helping Americans. They \nwere lines at the one-stop job center where Americans were helping \nAmericans.\n  But the longest lines I saw as mayor were when we had successes, when \na new business, supermarket or company would come to town and say they \nwere hiring. The lines would go on for blocks or wrap around buildings \nwith people desperate to work, even for minimum-wage jobs.\n  I can vividly remember scenes just like that when Newark opened a \nHome Depot or then-Continental Airlines held a job fair. It was \nAmericans in line with pride in their hearts, resumes in their hands, \nand hunger to find a job, any job, to get to work.\n  I heard that the last 2 weeks all over my State from former managers \napplying for entry-level jobs to no avail and people with years of \nexperience so desperate they were applying for minimum-wage jobs with \nno success.\n  The people who really blew me away, who just set me aback because I \nhonestly should have expected it--but I didn't expect to hear it--were \npeople who told me in order to keep their pride and to keep their \nfeelings of self-worth, on top of all of their stress and strain of \nunemployment, they found ways to volunteer at their local libraries, at \ntheir schools, at their churches. These were folks such as Mary, whom I \nmet in Hunterdon County. Mary told me she was helping women look for \nwork as she herself was. She was helping them develop skills from her \nexperience while she was trying to find her own job.\n  This is the America I know. From our cities to our wealthier suburbs, \npeople want to work. They want to give back. They want to contribute. \nThey want to represent the truth of who we are as a country. Time and \ntime again I heard people say, ``We don't want unemployment insurance, \nwe want a job.''\n  Even folks who had jobs, though, told me of the pain of congressional \ninaction.\n  I stopped to meet with folks in Woodbury. I went to a restaurant, \nMarlene Mangia Bene--Senator Menendez can probably pronounce that \nbetter. I spoke with the owners: Christopher, Maria, Frank, and other \nbusiness leaders. The community of businesspeople told me how high the \nprevalence of unemployed people was and how many people were losing \ntheir benefits, and they came to the simple conclusion, as they watched \nhow it hurt businesses in that town--less money coming to people in \ntheir time of need, less money spent, and that meant less revenue for \nbusinesses, which meant that some businesses might not be able to hold \non to as many employees, and then those laid-off employees would then \nneed unemployment insurance and more social services.\n  The cycle feeds itself.\n  If we fail to extend unemployment benefits, economists say it is \ngoing to cost the country almost one-quarter of a million jobs this \nyear alone. This is another government self-inflicted wound we can \navoid. Reinstating benefits will save 19,000 jobs in New Jersey alone.\n  But it is bigger than that. Every single job is a family-added \ndistress. While all families are important, there are some who should \nweigh especially heavy on the conscience of our country.\n  Take New Jersey State Assemblyman Bob Andrzejzak, an Iraq war vet who \nlost his leg in service to our country. He pulled together a group of \nveterans, young and old, for me to talk with at a Rio Grande diner in \nMiddle Township in Cape May County.\n  I challenge any Member of Congress who hasn't done so already to sit \nwith veterans who are receiving unemployment benefits or who, because \nof our inaction, just lost them. It is not hard to find them.\n  Unfortunately, nearly 21,000 veterans lost their benefits earlier \nthan anticipated when we failed to extend benefits in December, and \nabout 3,000 or more will join them each month unless we right this \nwrong.\n  Listen to the testimony of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who \nhave come back into this economy after fighting on the frontlines, \nafter facing peril and danger most of us can't imagine, and then here \nin America they have to face the harsh realities of, despite their best \nefforts, being unemployed and even facing the potential horrors of \nhomelessness.\n\n  These men and women who fought for our country, who stood for our \nNation, are not lazy. There is no disincentive to work in these \nbenefits. These are people who signed up to go to war. The assemblyman \ntold me how hard it was for his friends and even him to find a job. He \ntold me what it does to their spirits and what it is like to give all \nfor your country and then have your country fail to do what it has \nconsistently done for others during times of crisis over the last 50 \nyears--to extend unemployment benefits.\n  This man, Bob Andrzejzak, is shorter than me but he stands taller \nthan I will ever stand--and on a prosthetic leg. He works a job as an \nassemblyman in New Jersey, with honor, battling to give more hope to \nhis constituents in counties with high unemployment, such as Cape May \nCounty, with an over 12-percent unemployment rate.\n  He has good days, he has bad days, fighting it out on the front lines \nof our economic struggle. This Iraq war veteran is still fighting to \nprotect his country, to advance it, and make real his country for the \nlives of thousands of people. His cause is our common cause. This \nburden should not be his to bear alone. We too, U.S. Senators, like \nhim, have jobs, elected by the people. We swore an oath to be there for \nour countrymen. We too pledged our sacred honor to serve America, to \nreturn to the words of General Washington. The name ``America'' belongs \nto all of us. We must be there for everyone, especially in this time of \ntrial.\n  It is my hope this body, in this generation of America, finds our \nmeasure of commonality and comes together to find a way so we can \nbetter tend to those in crisis, so that we too may add our humble \nmeasure to the greatness of that enduring American ideal.\n  Let us extend unemployment insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if I could praise my colleague for his \neloquence and for his passion and say how right he is. I thank my \ncolleague Senator Menendez for allowing me to speak, but I wanted to \ncommend Senator Booker for his brilliance and for his dedication.\n  I want to applaud the Senator for New Jersey for his maiden speech \nand for using this opportunity to focus on the urgent need to renew \nunemployment insurance for over 1.7 million Americans. The expiration \nhas drained an estimated $2.2 billion from State economies according to \nestimates based on data from the Department of Labor and the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\n  Our constituents, who lost their job through no fault of their own \nand are searching for work in this extremely challenging economy, are \nlooking to Congress to renew this commonsense and very modest support. \nThey've worked hard and are searching for work with just as much \nfervor. But on December 28 the rug was pulled out from under them \nbecause some of my colleagues on the other side had decided they would \nrather let emergency unemployment insurance expire. And yet we have \ntraditionally extended aid when the long-term unemployment rate remains \nas high as it still unfortunately is.\n  Democrats have been pushing to extend this vital lifeline since \nbefore its expiration. And on December 17, Senator Heller and I \nintroduced a bipartisan path forward--and I thank the Senator from New \nJersey for his support for that measure. This emergency extension for \nunemployment insurance for 3 months would give us more time to work on \na year-long extension and address the concerns raised by some of my \ncolleagues. This way folks in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Tennessee, and \nKentucky--jobseekers all over the Nation--would not lose unemployment \ninsurance as we work through these complex issues. Unfortunately, that \nimmediate aid was filibustered despite our efforts.\n  That did not deter us. We have kept on working through those issues \nraised by some of my Republican colleagues and we have addressed them. \nWe are now proposing a 3-month fully paid extension--which is way out \nof line with past extensions. Indeed, 17 of the 20 times that emergency \naid was extended no strings were attached.\n  President Reagan extended emergency aid three times and President \nGeorge W. Bush did it five times.\n  We are still working to secure enough votes to break a potential \nfilibuster. We are not there yet, but I remain hopeful. Yet the clock \nis ticking. I hope some of my Republican colleagues understand that \njobseekers deserve a solution now and not procedural delays or \nobstruction. So I look forward to continue working with Senator Booker \non doing everything we can to extend this vital aid to our constituents \nimmediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague from New \nJersey for an eloquent and soaring speech that speaks to the collective \naspirations we should have in this body on behalf of the collective \nNation we represent. I am not at all surprised at Senator Booker's \nability to relate to this body the lives of people from New Jersey and \nacross the country who depend upon us to respond to them in their times \nof need and to remind us of the greater nature of what we should stand \nfor as an institution and on behalf of this country. He did it with \nsuch aplomb and such passion and intensity, yet at the same time with \nsuch sincerity that I think it is an excellent beginning to what will \nbe a very long series of remarks in the Senate on critical issues that \nwill both inform us and at the same time remind us of the high calling \nfor which we are all brought to the Senate.\n  I want to take one moment to add to what Senator Booker said, \nspecifically on the topic he ultimately drove home, and that is this \nquestion of unemployment. I want to relate one story--I see the Senator \nfrom Utah is up, so I will relate only one story--but it speaks to the \nvery heart of what Senator Booker was conveying here.\n  I get thousands of letters from people who depend on their meager \nunemployment benefits to avert economic disaster while they desperately \nlook for work. As Senator Booker said, these people are not lazy; they \nare not looking for a handout. They just want a job, any job. I want to \ntalk about one constituent in particular--Noelle from Atlantic County, \nwho described herself as ``a middle-aged unemployed single mother \ntrying to raise two sons to be successful contributing members of our \nsociety.'' She relates what happened after her marriage ended:\n\n       I didn't shrug my shoulders and give up, even though the \n     ``system'' said I didn't qualify for assistance . . . I took \n     care of children in my home to pay the bills and avoid child \n     care costs. In 2000, when my children were school age, I \n     found a minimum wage seasonal job and worked hard to become a \n     permanent employee . . . I worked even harder to rise up in \n     the organization and become a respected manager. When that \n     company went bankrupt in 2009, I found another job within two \n     weeks taking a large pay cut and making far less than I would \n     have made on unemployment. I stayed with that company for 4 \n     years until I was laid off in July of 2013. Once again, I \n     didn't shrug my shoulders and give up. For the following 26 \n     weeks I sought employment. I have joined every employment \n     website I could find and I applied for any job remotely \n     within my limited job skills. Unfortunately, the responses I \n     have gotten have not been encouraging. Thirteen years of \n     retail experience, including nine years of management \n     experience, translates into few opportunities. No one will \n     consider me for any entry level positions based on my \n     previous experience.\n\n  She closes by saying:\n\n       No, I do not think unemployment should be a way of life. \n     No, I do not think you can be unemployed and disabled. No, I \n     do not think 3 million unemployed Americans are going to find \n     jobs in 26 weeks.\n\n  She is so right, and these are the type of Americans Senator Booker \nwas talking about, and this is why the Senate should act.\n  I don't believe that is too much to ask, and I am pleased Senator \nBooker has come to this floor to lend his voice to the debate and to \nstand for people such as her. Again, I congratulate my colleague from \nNew Jersey on an eloquent speech on such an important issue.\n  I am pleased that he chose to speak about unemployment insurance, an \nissue critical to so many families in New Jersey and across this Nation \nso they can make ends meet while they're looking for work.\n  Senator Booker has always been a voice for the voiceless, given hope \nto the vulnerable, and a helping hand to those who need it. It is why \nhe chose public service. It is who he is and what he has always stood \nfor.\n  He spoke eloquently and I commend him for his remarks. He rightfully \npointed out that the issue of unemployment insurance isn't just about \nthe poor. It is about all those people who need help while they \ncontinue to look for work.\n  We have seen the recession chip away at the middle class, pulling \nmore and more families to the edge.\n  In this job market, they need more time to find work, and extending \nunemployment benefits will give them that time. It will allow them to \nstep back from the edge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we are better than this. This farm bill is a \nmonument to every dysfunction Washington indulges in to defend our \npolicies and twist our economy to benefit itself at the expense of the \nAmerican people.\n  The top-line talking point among defenders of this bill is \n``compromise.'' The farm bill, we are told, may be imperfect, but it is \na compromise we can all live with. They said negotiators from both \nHouses and both political parties came together and hammered out a \ndeal. They said: This is just how you have to act to get things done in \nWashington.\n  There is, of course, some truth to this, but it is more of a half \ntruth. There absolutely is compromise in this thousand-page $1 trillion \nmess. But it is not a compromise between House Republicans and Senate \nDemocrats. No, it is collusion between both parties against the \nAmerican people. It benefits special interests at the expense of \nnational interest.\n  This bill does not demonstrate how to do things in Washington but \ninstead demonstrates how to do things for Washington. The final product \nbefore us is not just a legislative vehicle, it is a legislative \ngetaway car.\n  And what did they get away with? Well, the farm bill is really two \nbills--one that spends about $200 billion to subsidize the agricultural \nindustry and another that spends $750 billion on the public assistance \nprogram previously known as food stamps. The farm bill is, thus, a \nbeltway marriage of convenience between welfare and corporate welfare, \nensuring the passage of both while preventing reform in either. \nInstead, Congress broke out the neck bolts and sutures and put \nFrankenstein's monster back together.\n  This was the year the farm bill was supposed to be different. This \nwas supposed to be the year when we would finally split the bill into \nits logical component pieces and would subject them both to overdue \nscrutiny and reform.\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nThis was the year we might have strengthened the Food Stamp Program \nwith work and other requirements for able-bodied adults, to help \ntransition beneficiaries into full-time jobs. This was the year we \nmight have added an asset test, to make sure wealthy Americans with \nlarge personal bank accounts were no longer eligible for food stamps. \nBut those reforms aren't there. Those reforms aren't here--not in this \nbill.\n  Under this legislation, the Food Stamp Program is not really \nreformed, it is just expanded. Once again, the give and take of \ncompromise in Congress boils down to the American people give and \nWashington takes. Yet, if anything, the other side of this bill is even \nworse. Not only did the conference committee fail to reform programs \nsubsidizing agricultural businesses, the conference committee removed \nmany of the few improvements the House and Senate tried to include in \nthe first place.\n  For instance, the original Senate bill, for all its faults, included \na novel provision to limit farm subsidies to actual farms, actual \nfarmers. The Senate bill was also going to phase out crop insurance \nsubsidies for wealthy Americans with an annual income of more than \n$750,000; farmers who made three-quarters of a million dollars a year, \nafter all, should not need taxpayer assistance to keep their farms \nafloat.\n  The House bill included a transparency reform requiring Members of \nCongress to disclose any subsidies they personally receive under the \ncrop insurance programs. Yet all of the above reforms mysteriously \ndisappeared from the final legislation now before us.\n  It is not as though the farm bill was a paragon of accountability and \nfairness to begin with. Agricultural policy follows a troubling trend \nin Washington, using raw political power to twist public policy against \nthe American people to profit political and corporate insiders.\n  For instance, under this legislation, the Federal Government will \ncontinue to force taxpayers to subsidize sugar companies, both in the \nlaw and in the grocery store. The bill maintains the so-called ``dairy \ncliff,'' keeping dairy policy temporary. This will create an artificial \ncrisis the next time we take up the farm bill, which will once again \nundermine thoughtful debate and reform.\n  Perhaps of all the shiny ornaments hung on this special-interest \nChristmas tree, the shiniest may be the actual croniest handout to the \nChristmas tree industry itself. Under this farm bill, small independent \nChristmas tree farmers will now be required to pay a special tax to a \ngovernment-created organization controlled by larger corporate \nproducers, like some medieval tribute to feudal lords. These costs \nwill, of course, be passed on to working families. So every December, \nWashington will, in effect, rob the Cratchits to pay Mr. Scrooge and \nhis lobbyists in Washington.\n  Yet, even all this is squeaky-clean legislating compared to this farm \nbill's most offensive feature--its bullying, disenfranchising shakedown \nof the American West. Most Americans who live east of the Mississippi \nhave no idea that most of the land west of the great river is owned by \nthe Federal Government. I don't mean national parks, protected \nwilderness, national monuments, and the like. We have a lot of those \nand we love them. But that is a fraction of a fraction of the land I am \ntalking about. I am just talking about garden-variety land--the kind \nthat is privately owned in every neighborhood and community across the \ncountry. More than 50 percent of all of the land west of the \nMississippi River is controlled by a Federal bureaucracy and it cannot \nbe developed: no homes, no businesses, no communities or community \ncenters, no farms or farmers markets, no hospitals or colleges or \nschools, no Little League fields, no playgrounds, nothing.\n  In my own State, it is 63 percent of the land. In Daggett County, it \nis 81 percent. In Wayne County, it is 85 percent. In Garfield County, \nit is 90 percent. Ninety percent of the land in Garfield County isn't \ntheirs. In communities such as these, financing local government is a \nhuge challenge. There, as in the East, local government is funded \nprimarily by property taxes. But in counties and towns where the \nFederal Government owns 70, 80, or even 90 percent of the land, there \nsimply isn't enough private property to tax to fund basic local \nservices: another sheriff's deputy to police their streets, another \ntruck or ambulance to save their lives and protect their property from \nfires, another teacher to educate their children.\n  To compensate local governments for the tax revenue Washington \nunfairly denies them, Congress created--as only Congress could--the \nPILT program. PILT stands for Payment in Lieu of Taxes.\n  Under PILT, Congress sends a few cents on the dollar out West every \nyear to make up for lost property taxes. There is no guaranteed amount. \nWashington just sends what Washington feels like sending.\n  Local governments across the Western United States, and especially in \ncounties such as Garfield, Daggett, and Wayne County, UT, completely \ndepend on Congress making good on this promise. Given this situation, \nthere are three possible courses of congressional action:\n  First, Congress could do the right thing and transfer the land to the \nStates that want it.\n  Second, Congress could compromise and fully compensate western \ncommunities for the growth and opportunity current law denies them.\n  But in this bill it is neither. Congress instead chooses option \nthree: lording its power over western communities to extort political \nconcessions from them, like some two-bit protection racket. ``That's a \nnice fire department you got there,'' Congress effectively says to many \nwestern communities. ``Nice school your kids have. It would be a shame \nif anything should happen to it.''\n  These States and communities are looking for nothing more than \ncertainty and equality under the law. Yet Congress treats these not as \nrights to be protected but as vulnerabilities to be shamelessly \nexploited.\n  For weeks I have been on the phone with county commissioners who feel \nthey have no choice but to support a policy they know doesn't work. \nThis bill takes away their ability to plan and budget with certainty \nand forces them to come back to Congress, hat in hand, every year. \nCounty commissioners know this is no way to run a community.\n  I share their frustration, and I applaud their commitment to their \nneighbors and their communities. I am convinced that in the long run, \nthe best way to protect these communities is to find a real permanent \nsolution--one that gives them the certainty and the equality under the \nlaw they deserve.\n  My vote against the farm bill will be a vote to rescue Utahns from \nsecond-class citizenship and local communities in my State from \npermanent dependence on the whims of faraway politicians and \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC.\n  For all the talk we hear in this Chamber about inequality, we \nnonetheless seem oblivious to its causes. This bill--and thousands of \nother bills, laws, and regulations like it--are themselves the root \ncause of our shortage of opportunity in America today. The end result \nof this legislation will be to disenfranchise and extort the American \npeople to benefit special interests, to enrich the well-connected at \nthe expense of the disconnected.\n  The true cost of that transaction--just another forced deposit and \nwithdrawal from Washington's dysfunctional favored bank--is a lot more \nthan $956 billion. The true cost of this kind of unequal cronyist \npolicymaking is the trust of the American people in the legitimacy of \nour political institutions, in the fairness of our economy, and in the \ngood faith of their countrymen.\n  Our constitutional republic, our free enterprise economy, and our \nvoluntary civil society depend absolutely on the equality of all \nAmericans under the law, the equality of all citizen opportunity to \npursue happiness in their own communities, according to their own \nvalues, each on a level playing field with everyone else. This \nlegislation dangerously subverts that principle and mocks any patriot \nwho still holds it dear.\n  All Americans may be equal but--as George Orwell might put it if he \nwere here today--under the farm bill some Americans are simply more \nequal than others.\n  I will not be a part of it, and I encourage my colleagues to \nrecognize\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nthat there is another way, there is a better way, a new approach that \nremembers what--and whom--we are supposed to really stand for.\n  What we are supposed to stand for is deliberation--open debate and \ntransparent amendments on this floor, in this Chamber. These programs \nshould not be coupled to shield them from scrutiny and protect them \nfrom reform. If we need food stamps to fight poverty and farm subsidies \nto maintain our food supply, let those programs stand on their own \nmerits or not at all.\n  Furthermore, the land out West is not going anywhere. This should be \nan opportunity for us to bring our people together, not turn our \nregions against each other and turn the right to local government into \na dangerous political football.\n  It is time to have a serious debate about a permanent solution to \nfederally-owned lands which can improve economic opportunity and \nmobility while reducing the national debt and deficit. All the evidence \nin this farm bill to the contrary, I believe we are capable of finding \nsuch a solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Senator Booker for \nhis maiden speech. It is great to have him with us, and I thank Senator \nBooker also for calling upon the better angels in all of us to do what \nis right. Opportunity and fairness for all are not just empty words. \nThey are words to live by and words to live up to.\n  Today I rise to add my support for extending unemployment benefits to \nthose among us who need and deserve this lifeline.\n  In December over 2,000 Hawaii workers lost their unemployment \nbenefits. Since then about 250 more Hawaii workers are losing their \nbenefits every week.\n  In 2008 our country was plunged into the deepest economic crisis \nsince the Great Depression. Many lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own. Many are still unemployed. Since 2008 unemployment benefits \nhave kept over 11 million people out of poverty. Unemployed workers \nspend their benefits immediately on food and other necessities. \nUnemployment benefits go immediately into the local economy. Every \ndollar of spending on unemployment benefits generates almost $1.60 in \nlocal economic activity.\n  But this isn't just about numbers. For people struggling to find \nwork, emergency unemployment insurance is a vital safety net. It can \nmean the difference between being able to get back on your feet or \nfalling into poverty. These programs provide real hope and real \nopportunity for people. I know this because I have lived it.\n  My mother raised three children by herself as a single parent. Most \nof us have relied upon or know families who have used the earned \nunemployment assistance they paid for. When my mother lost her job \nthrough no fault of her own, her unemployment checks went for rent and \nputting food on the table for her three children while she searched for \nwork. So I know the anxiety when the family breadwinner loses her job, \nwhen every dime makes a difference.\n  Those who say people on unemployment are lazy or don't want to work \nare insulting and injuring millions of Americans, about whom nothing \ncould be further from the truth.\n  High unemployment particularly hurts women. Among female heads of \nhouseholds, the U.S. unemployment rate was 8.7 percent in December. \nThat is two points higher than the 6.7 percent unemployment rate for \nthe Nation as a whole. Neither one of these statistics takes into \naccount workers who have given up looking for work. We should support a \nshort-term extension of unemployment benefits while Congress works on a \nneeded longer-term bill.\n  Last Friday President Obama announced a new effort to support the \nlong-term unemployed. He gathered over 300 companies who have signed \nonto a set of best practices for recruiting and hiring unemployed--\nespecially those long-term unemployed--to prevent discrimination \nagainst these Americans.\n  The Federal Government will lead by example in a new Presidential \nmemorandum to improve its own recruiting and hiring of long-term \nunemployed people. Congress can do its part by updating and \nstrengthening job-training programs, such as through the Workforce \nInvestment Act which we will take up later this year. For right now, \nmillions of families are counting on us to extend a vital life line to \nthem. I urge my colleagues to support extending unemployment benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to discuss the \nAgricultural Act of 2014--the farm bill conference report.\n  This legislation has been delayed over 2\\1/2\\ years, weighing the \nentire time on the minds of farmers and ranchers all across the \ncountry.\n  Last Tuesday I came to the floor to explain why I was the only \nSenator on the farm bill conference not to sign the conference report \nand why I cannot in good conscience support this legislation. I am here \ntoday to go beyond my philosophical concerns with the direction of the \nlegislation, and I will instead focus on how the farm bill will \nnegatively impact agriculture in my home State of Kansas, as well as \nother States.\n  The farm bill is not a simple reauthorization or continuation of our \nNation's farm and food programs. We have already done that once with \nthe 1-year extension of the 2008 bill. Instead, the legislation before \nus should be a wholesale rewrite of the programs and policies at the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  When this bill is signed into law by the President and fully \nimplemented, our producers will have to make choices among new safety \nnet programs, new regulations, and new rules. Some of these choices \nwill happen only once and will be irrevocable. They cannot be changed \nfor the next 5 years. This is a 5-year bill. We owe it to these \nfarmers, ranchers, small business owners, as well as to the next \ngeneration of producers to get this legislation right. Unfortunately, I \nbelieve the Congress has missed the mark in that the conference report \ngoes backwards toward protectionist subsidy programs instead of forward \nwith innovative and responsible solutions.\n  I am not alone in that assessment. As reported by the Kansas City \nStar last Friday, January 31, all four Kansas House members voted \n``no'' on what is arguably the single most important piece of Federal \nlegislation in Kansas. Now, that should grab everybody in America's \nattention. The entire House delegation from the wheat State was united \nin opposing this version of the farm bill.\n  It is not that we do not appreciate agriculture or the producers and \ntheir families in our State. It is entirely the opposite. We care so \nmuch that after 3 years of work, we will not settle for supporting \nbackwards legislation just to get something done. I call it a look in \nthe rearview mirror.\n  I understand compromises were made. But I cannot support a bill which \nmarches backwards toward producers making bad decisions based off of \ngovernment subsidies, retaliation against our livestock producers, and, \nonce again, agriculture taking a disproportionate cut in spending \ncompared--yes--to Federal nutrition programs.\n  When Chairperson Stabenow and I started the process of rewriting the \nfarm bill, Kansas producers, regardless of what they planted, over and \nover again said their number one priority and concern was the \navailability of crop insurance which protects in case of disaster. They \nwere also fully aware that direct payments would no longer be available \nto them, and most were OK with that direction. Kansas producers did not \nask for a continuation of a target-priced subsidy program and they \ncertainly did not want Congress to raise the target prices of all \ncommodities.\n\n  Two years ago, in 2012, the Senate Agriculture Committee and the full \nSenate passed a farm bill that ended the countercyclical and commodity \nsubsidy programs. If signed into law, the 2012 Senate farm bill would \nhave taken the Federal Government and the Department of Agriculture out \nof the business of sending signals to producers, essentially telling \nthem what crops to plant. Unfortunately, that reform was never fully \nrealized.\n  We have something called the new Price Loss Coverage Program that is \ncontained in this conference report. It\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\nsets high fixed target prices and subsidies for all commodities and \nregions of the country.\n  Last week, after the final details of the bill were released, I \ntalked with a young producer near Dodge City, my hometown, who is a \nmember of my volunteer agriculture advisory council. I fondly refer to \nthem as my ``ag posse.''\n  With the current cash price for wheat at the Dodge City grain \nelevator around $6 and a target price guaranteed for wheat set at $5.50 \na bushel for the next 5 years, I asked this young, successful, and \ninformed producer: What are you going to plant? What he told me should \nnot surprise anyone in this body--or anyone. He said: Pat, I am going \nto plant wheat for the government subsidy.\n  His answer only reinforces one of my biggest concerns with this \nconference report. When the Federal Government guarantees producers a \nsubsidy triggered off a target price, reference price, a countercylical \nprice--whatever you want to call it--it always has and always will lead \nto planting and marketing distortions.\n  Today many producers have a college or advanced degree, often in \nbusiness. They are going to evaluate the programs at the Department of \nAgriculture and make decisions that benefit their business's bottom \nline.\n  Instead of planting grain sorghum or corn or soybeans, my friend in \nwestern Kansas already knows he is going to plant the crop he is \nguaranteed to receive the highest subsidy payment from the government, \nnot from the market. In this case, he plans to plant wheat at $5.50 per \nbushel over corn which has a target price of $3.70 a bushel.\n  I have yet to hear one explanation for why Congress is not only \nincluding target prices for corn, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, rice, \npeanuts, and barley but raising and fixing their prices regardless of \nmovements in the market.\n  Kansas is the breadbasket of the world. So you might think Kansas \nproducers planting more wheat would be a good thing; however, simple \neconomics and history demonstrate why this is such a dangerous road for \nthe Federal Government to take.\n  When all producers in Kansas and the rest of America have the same \nprice guarantees and signals to plant wheat--no matter where you are--\nand the majority makes the business decision to follow subsidy signals \ninstead of the market, over time there will undoubtedly be more \nproduction than global demand or otherwise.\n  We will have a surplus of wheat leading to lower wheat prices. That \ncould normally be corrected by market signals, but with the fixed \ntarget price, farmers will continue to plant wheat for the subsidy--\nthat subsidy guarantee--leading to further overproduction and even \nlower crop prices. We have been there before, and that is why we tried \nto reform the program several farm bills back.\n  This cycle of overproduction, low grain prices, and expensive support \npayments could eventually lead back to the days of mandatory quotas and \nacreage allotments--it has happened before--known as set-asides, paying \nfarmers not to grow anything. We don't need to go back to those days. \nOur producers in Kansas want none of that from their Federal \nGovernment.\n  Besides having high fixed target prices, the new Price Loss Coverage \nProgram sets the price guarantees so high that some are at or above the \nproducer's cost of production. This would mean the government is \nessentially subsidizing a producer so much that they are guaranteed to \nmake a profit if they have a normal or average year.\n  It gets worse. The early analysis I have seen shows that the target \nprices are high enough that rice, peanuts, and barley growers will \nreceive a subsidy payment at least 75 percent of any given year, likely \ntriggering a payment 4 out of the next 5 years.\n  Other commodities are not treated as favorably. Wheat prices are \nlikely to trigger a payment, on average, only 35 percent of the time \nand soybeans less than 15 percent.\n  What that tells me is that the new target price guarantees are set \nhigh enough for a few commodities to trigger subsidy payments with a \nhigh frequency.\n  Folks, this is no longer a risk-management tool or part of a \nresponsible safety net. Make no mistake, the Price Loss Coverage \nProgram is nothing more than a profit protection program from some of \nour commodity growers.\n  The lone commodity that has moved out of the price supports entirely \nwas forced to after learning the lesson the hard way.\n  In 2002, the World Trade Organization ruled against the United States \nfor cotton programs, including a decoupled target price subsidy. In a \nsettlement with Brazil, we have been paying their producers $147 \nmillion a year for damages. We are still paying them.\n  As much as I disagree with the backward direction of the commodity \ntitle, Kansas livestock producers may have more beef with this \nconference report. Kansas is in the heart of cattle country. After 3 \nyears of drought, livestock producers in my home State are waiting for \ndisaster assistance that has been unnecessarily delayed for over 3 \nyears.\n  Yet when taking the full conference report under consideration, both \nthe Kansas Livestock Association and the Kansas Pork Association \nstrongly oppose this bill. Why?\n  In a letter sent to me by Jeff Sternberger, president of the Kansas \nLivestock Association, he says:\n\n       We are deeply disappointed the report does not address our \n     two priority issues, mandatory country-of-origin labeling \n     (COOL) and the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards \n     Administration, GIPSA, rule on cattle marketing.\n\n  Mandatory country-of-origin labeling, or COOL, is a marketing \nprogram; however, our closest trading partners have found the practice \nanything but cool. Canada and Mexico are two of our biggest and \nhistorically strong markets for U.S. beef, pork, and chicken exports. \nIn 2012 alone, Canada imported over $1 billion worth of U.S. beef and \nMexico imported over $800 million.\n  If we do not come into compliance, as required by the World Trade \nOrganization, Canada and Mexico will retaliate against the United \nStates.\n  Without these markets, Kansas livestock producers will lose value on \ntheir products, negatively impacting one of the biggest drivers of our \nState's economy. Unfortunately, our efforts to fix COOL in the farm \nbill conference committee fell short--to the displeasure of our \nlivestock producers and trading partners.\n  The GIPSA rule on livestock marketing should have been addressed in \nthe final farm bill conference report as well. The House version of the \nfarm bill had strong provisions that would have let our livestock \nproducers make their own marketing decisions instead of GIPSA. Yet the \nprovisions were left entirely out of the conference report with no \nexplanation or transparency--behind closed doors.\n  Finally, I have to address a major inequality in the final conference \nreport; that is, nutrition spending. When the Congressional Budget \nOffice released their official estimate of the budgetary effects of \nthis agriculture act, I was more than disappointed.\n  According to their letter:\n\n       CBO estimates that direct spending stemming from the \n     programs authorized by the conference agreement would total \n     $956 billion over the 2014 to 2023 period, of which $756 \n     billion would be for nutrition programs.\n\n  That is almost $800 billion. By the way, that lower figure is a bet \non the economy improving and people getting off the SNAP program, which \nwould certainly be good but is not certain.\n  When you do the math, that means 79 percent--almost 80 percent--of \nthe total spending in the farm bill will go to nutrition programs, \nincluding SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n  The final compromise includes $8 billion in food stamp savings mainly \nfrom tightening the Low-Income Heating and Assistance Program, the \ninfamous LIHEAP loophole, and that is a good thing. States were gaming \nthe system. I am all for that, but that amounts to a 1-percent \nreduction to the nutrition spending out of a $750 billion program if \nyou believe the projections. I think it is probably more toward $800 \nbillion.\n  The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry recently \nreleased a statement with the headline ``Deficit Reduction: The 2014 \nFarm Bill,'' showcasing the savings in this legislation. The release \nhighlights the inequality between farm and food programs:\n\n       Farm subsidy programs were cut far more significantly than \n     any other area of the budget under the Agriculture \n     Committee's\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n     jurisdiction. By comparison, farm subsidy programs were cut \n     by 31 percent, while nutrition programs were reduced 1 \n     percent.\n\n  You heard that right. Farmers, ranchers, farm broadcasters listening \nin, you heard that right. The farm bill once again prioritizes spending \nfor food stamps over all other Department of Agriculture programs, \nincluding important conservation programs, research programs, and rural \ndevelopment programs.\n  I am fine with reducing farm subsidies such as the target price \nprogram, but we should have included additional reforms to the \nnutritional programs, which we tried to do--in several votes--in a \nreasonable and responsible manner. We were not touching anybody's \nbenefits; we were just looking at the eligibility requirements. But the \nconference principals decided on the final compromise--again behind \nclosed doors.\n  While we all want to provide much needed certainty to producers--\ngoodness knows it is been a long time since we had a farm bill in \nplace--the conference missed an opportunity for greater and necessary \nreforms to our Nation's farm programs, burdensome regulations on \nlivestock producers, and Federal nutrition programs.\n  After over 3 years of deliberation and disputes over the farm bill, \nour producers, consumers, taxpayers, and global trading partners expect \nand deserve more than what is found in this conference report.\n  As a conferee, I did not sign the conference report last week. That \ndidn't give me any pleasure. As a Kansan and a Senator from a large \nagriculture State, I am going to vote against this rearview mirror \nlegislation for all the reasons I have itemized.\n  Having said that, I do wish to take a moment to personally thank \nChairperson Stabenow and Chairman Lucas, over in the House, for their \nunwavering drive and perseverance to finalize a farm bill. It is one \nthing for me to stand and criticize it and find in my heart and my mind \nand on behalf of my Kansas producers to vote no because I think that is \nthe right vote, but I also know they have endeavored--Chairman Stabenow \nand Chairman Lucas--to at least get a bill. It is a tall task to get a \nmajority of the Members of Congress to understand that the farm bill is \nnot simply a bill that you pay off.\n  I can remember when I was chairman of the committee over in the House \nand I asked a colleague to help me on the farm bill. He said: Why don't \nyou just pay it? That indicated his broad knowledge of the farm bill at \nthat particular time.\n  The farm bill is not simply a bill you just pay off. It instead \nrepresents important legislation for both urban, rural States and \ndistricts and the stability of the world, if you will, knowing we have \nto feed 9 billion people in the next several decades. At last, the \nChairs have beaten all the odds and are on the verge of completing a \nvery complicated and time-consuming undertaking, to say the least.\n\n  I must also thank my colleagues and friends on the House and Senate \nagriculture committees for their knowledge, their expertise, and their \ndiverse perspectives on agriculture. It is going to be really hard to \nimagine that many of the faces in the Senate agriculture committee room \nwill not be there in person for the next farm bill 5 years down the \nroad--Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Saxby Chambliss, both of whom will be \nsorely missed as they have both led the committee in their respective \ncaucuses through previous farms bills. However, they will literally \n``watch over'' the committee for years to come, because their portraits \nare on the wall, hanging just above us. I think their eyes move when we \nconsider amendments.\n  Senator Max Baucus will continue his service to the country as the \nnext Ambassador to China, but we will miss his advice and counsel in \nthe committee.\n  Finally, it is hard to describe the void that will be created with \nthe departure of Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska. As the Secretary of \nthe Department of Agriculture, he has seen both sides of the farm bill, \nimplementing one and writing another. Even though Nebraska left the Big \n12 for the Big 10, this K-State fan can admit we will all miss having \nthis champion from the Cornhusker State around.\n  So although I will not vote for the farm bill conference report, I \npromise to all of Kansas agriculture that I fully appreciate the need \nfor a farm bill, especially one that has been delayed for years. But \nwhile we need a farm bill, we do not need this farm bill.\n  I truly respect the farmers and ranchers and everybody connected with \nagriculture for what they do as a profession for our economy and for \nglobal stability in a troubled and angry world. I just wish the rest of \nthis Senate would do the same thing. I will continue to work and to \nadvocate and to champion agriculture on their behalf every single day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I wish to commend the junior Senator from \nNew Jersey on his first speech on the Senate floor. He brings a strong \nvoice to the U.S. Senate. Today he raises that voice for our friends \nand neighbors who need it, and I am proud to stand alongside him.\n  Just 5 years ago middle-class families got hammered by the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression. These families didn't cause \nthe crisis. They worked hard and played by the rules. But they ended up \npaying the price for Wall Street's wild risk-taking and Washington's \nfailed oversight. People lost jobs, lost savings, lost homes. Far too \nmany of them are still struggling.\n  For these families every dollar counts. An extra couple of hundred \ndollars a week can keep food on the table or the heat on during cold \nwinter months. It can mean the difference between making the rent or \nmortgage payment or being out on the street.\n  That is what emergency unemployment insurance is for--to give folks \nthe little bit of help they need to keep their heads above water while \nthey search for a job. Unemployment insurance represents our commitment \nas a country that we will pitch in when our friends and neighbors have \nfallen on rough times, knowing they would do the same for us.\n  So far, Republicans seem determined to break that commitment. Because \nof Republican filibusters, 1.6 million Americans and counting have lost \naccess to unemployment insurance since the end of last year, including \nmore than 60,000 people in Massachusetts. Their obstruction means we \ncannot fulfill our commitment to the families who need it most.\n  My Republican colleagues should be looking for a way to say yes--yes \nto helping middle-class American families and their 2.3 million \nchildren who rely on unemployment insurance. But, once again, they just \nwant a way to say no.\n  Extending unemployment insurance should be a simple matter. It \nhappened five times during the Bush administration and not once--not \nonce--did Republicans demand that the costs be offset by cuts or \nrevenue increases elsewhere. But the Republicans have insisted on a \ndifferent standard this time, filibustering because the extension of \nbenefits wasn't offset. Democrats thought this was wrong, but we \ncompromised and we agreed to offset the cost. So did we have a deal? \nNo. The Republicans refused to take yes for an answer and filibustered \nagain.\n  Why would Republicans block the extension of unemployment benefits? \nSome seem to believe unemployment insurance is actually bad for \nstruggling families. One Republican Senator recently said emergency \nunemployment insurance does a ``disservice'' to people because it \ncauses them to ``become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our \neconomy.'' Last year's Republican Vice Presidential nominee, \nCongressman Ryan, said that Federal safety net programs such as \nunemployment insurance are like ``a hammock, which lulls able-bodied \npeople into lives of complacency and dependency.''\n  This is an insult to hard-working people across this country--people \nwho are doing their best and can't find a job.\n  This is an insult to people such as Terri, a 41-year-old resident of \nGardner, MA, who lost her job last year. Here is what she wrote to me \nafter Congress let the unemployment insurance program expire:\n\n       [M]y employer suddenly let me go and I found myself \n     unemployed for the first time since my very first part-time \n     job at 15. I have been diligently looking for work, applying \n     everywhere, but I haven't had any job offers . . .\n\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\n\n  She writes that unemployment insurance:\n\n       . . . is all we have. I'm already on the brink of losing my \n     home, we are struggling to hang on to what very little we \n     have. . . . I know I'm one of 1.3 million faces, but I'm a \n     face from near your home. I'm a face that never thought I'd \n     be in this situation. I'm a face that needs the help of my \n     government's services that I have paid into for many, many \n     years. I'm a face that has done everything I'm supposed to--\n     but I feel like I've fallen aside and no one sees me.\n       I'm not an abuser of the system. I'm someone who really \n     needs my government to be there for me now. Please see me.\n\n  Terri isn't looking for a life of complacency and dependency. And she \nis not the exception. A person can't get unemployment benefits unless \nthey prove they lost their job through no fault of their own, and they \nprove they are actively looking for work. Unemployment insurance is a \ncritical lifeline for people who are trying their hardest and need a \nlittle help--a recognition that Wall Street and Washington caused the \nfinancial crisis but Main Street is still paying the price.\n  And there is the rub. Republicans line up to protect billions in tax \nbreaks and subsidies for big corporations with armies of lobbyists, but \nthey can't find a way to help struggling families get back on their \nfeet.\n  People such as Terri are hurting. They worked hard their whole lives \nand paid into the system, and after the worst economic crisis in \ngenerations, they are searching for jobs and scrambling to stay in the \nmiddle class. They are not looking for a handout; they are looking for \na chance to rebuild their lives. They would be there for us; we should \nbe there for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am reminded even at this late hour, \nwhen most of the world has moved on to other pursuits, what a great \nprivilege it is to be with two magnificent voices and advocates for \nfairness and economic opportunity: Senator Warren of Massachusetts, and \nmy very good friend, Senator Booker of New Jersey, on his first \noccasion here on the floor. I feel very blessed and fortunate and \nprivileged to be here with them. I feel that way at any moment on this \nfloor in this body but particularly as we face this great challenge \nahead: how to preserve and enhance our middle class in America; how to \nmake sure America fulfills its great promise Senator Booker evoked so \neloquently, going back to the days of George Washington; and now, with \ngreat leaders facing many of the same kinds of basic questions about \nwhether we can provide that opportunity going forward, whether we are \nequal to the task in an increasingly complex society.\n  Just today, in the New York Times, there was a very profound and \ntelling story about markets losing middle-class consumers. Only the \nhigh-end and the low-end retailers are being able to find markets for \ntheir products because our middle class is dwindling, squeezed by the \nvise of an increasingly desperate situation. How desperate it is for \npeople who are depending now on unemployment insurance, as they see the \ndeadlines for them approaching and they know they will lose roofs over \ntheir heads, meals on their table, for families they are struggling to \nkeep together. As Senator Booker and Senator Warren said so well, the \nunfairness of the economic crisis caused by Wall Street and Washington \nbut visited upon Main Street America, middle-class America, mainstream \nAmerica, still struggling to recover.\n  We know the unemployment we face today is deeper and more intractable \nthan at any other time in our history. Long-term unemployment is larger \npercentagewise than it has been in previous recessions. That is a \ntragedy for those families but also for our economy, because those \nconsumers are lost to the retailers and to the mainstream small- and \nmiddle-sized businesses that depend on them to grow and hire more \npeople.\n  In Connecticut, as of last month, almost half of all of the \nindividuals who have suffered a job loss--43.6 percent--were unable to \nfind work for 6 months or more. That is more than 60,000 people. Those \nnumbers don't tell the stories. They are not the voices and faces I \nhave seen who are depending on a meager $300 a week and who have lost \neven that amount.\n  Rosa Dicker, who has a deep knowledge of health care reform from her \nprevious work, has received only three call-back interviews out of 500 \njobs she has sought, and her job search lasted almost a year. Michael \nKubica, who went back to get his MBA after years of experience in \ninsurance and publishing, and, again, has been repeatedly turned away \nfor employment. Alicia Nesbitt, proud to have been employed \ncontinuously from the age of 16--decades ago--recently found herself \napplying for food stamps. Then, of course, there is Katherine Hacket of \nMoodus, CT, who joined the President recently to speak out about the \nneed for extending these benefits. Katherine's family has sacrificed \ngreatly for this Nation, because she has not one but two children \nserving in our military. Yet, because of Congress's inaction, Katherine \nis struggling to pay for food and heating bills during her job search.\n  There are good guys out there helping people to find jobs. Capital \nWorkforce Partners has done tremendous work. I have met with them and \nother job creators, as well as job seekers around Connecticut, and \nsometimes those job searches actually succeed, because people are able \nto sustain their lives and continue to search for work.\n  Erin Londen, one of the constituents whom I met as I have gone around \nthe State, has found work after 10 months of unemployment. She writes:\n\n       I could not be happier! I just love my new job, it is \n     everything I was looking for.\n\n  She is not a person who wanted to be without work. She is not a \nperson who sought to be unemployed for 10 months. None of these \npeople--none of the people on long-term unemployment insurance--want to \nbe without work. She wrote to me:\n\n       It can take up to three months to get an interview. Then if \n     you have follow-up, it could be another month. So I do not \n     think it is reasonable to only offer six months of \n     unemployment benefits.\n\n  That pretty much says it.\n  I want to emphasize one aspect of this problem that I think is \nabsolutely unconscionable for this Nation to tolerate, and that is the \nhigh unemployment rate among our veterans.\n  This situation for post-9/11 veterans is beyond comprehension and \nbeyond accepting. The male post-9/11 veterans in particular face rates \nof 8.6 percent, almost 2 points above the national average. Many of \nthese veterans have been out of work for more than 6 months.\n  Long-term unemployment among our veterans is a scourge that this \nCongress has an obligation to address. Many of them left good-paying \njobs. They came back to a nation that said it was grateful, and now \nthey find no jobs and no unemployment insurance to keep a roof over \ntheir head and food on their table.\n  That is why I have introduced the VOW to Hire Heroes Act that would \nextend a key tax credit to incentivize companies to hire veterans. This \ncredit expired last year, but veteran unemployment remains a serious \nproblem, and I urge the Congress again to pass it. I have been joined \nby Senator Begich and Senator Udall of New Mexico in writing to the \nFinance Committee to urge it to approve this measure so we can bring it \nto the floor.\n  I want to thank AMVETS as well for its support on a measure that is, \nunfortunately, increasingly important; that is, to ban discrimination \nagainst veterans in both employment and housing. Believe it or not, \nthis phenomenon occurs. Most would find it incredible. Yet a measure is \nnecessary to ban discrimination against men and women who served in \nuniform, who served and sacrificed, who have given to this Nation.\n  Discrimination, unfortunately, is also a fact of life against the \nlong-term unemployed. I have proposed again and reintroduced the Fair \nEmployment Opportunity Act, which would prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of employment status.\n  Discrimination has been established by various studies--researchers \nat Northeastern University. Similar studies involving academics at \nYale, the University of Chicago, and the University of Toronto have \nfound that the long-term unemployed--the longer they have been \nunemployed--are much more likely to be victims of discrimination. I \nwant to thank seven cosponsors on this bill: Senators Markey, \nGillibrand, Sanders, Shaheen, Murphy, Menendez, and Brown. I urge other \ncolleagues to support it as well. f\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\n  Finally, I want to thank again Senator Booker. He honors not only his \nown long history of public service but also the memory of our late \ncolleague, our extraordinary and esteemed colleague, and my wonderful \nmentor and friend, Frank Lautenberg. He joins the ranks of others in \nthe Senate who are fighting for the needs of the economically \ndisadvantaged--people, as he said so eloquently, who play by the rules. \nThey believe in this country, its ideals, its goals, and they want to \nserve it and give back and contribute.\n  This Nation depends on a covenant. It is the covenant that each of \nour generations leaves the country better for the one that follows--not \nonly that the country is better for the next generation, but that each \nof our generations, on our watch, pledges to do better.\n  That is the reason we need to extend unemployment insurance. Without \nit, we will be a lesser nation, not just economically but in fairness \nand morality as well. I thank Senator Booker for reminding us of that \nfundamental fact about our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I would like to briefly say thank you to \nmy fellow Senators who took time to come and listen to my maiden speech \nbut especially those who also spoke on the issue as well. They spoke \nwith eloquence. They spoke poignantly about people in their State. And \nI pray they spoke persuasively.\n  I thank Senator Hirono, Senator Menendez, my senior Senator, \nespecially. I thank Senator Warren and Senator Blumenthal, who are \nstill here. I thank, also, Senator Jack Reed and Senate Majority Leader \nReid, as well, for their working on this issue.\n  I finally want to say that I have already gotten word from people who \nactually saw some of the speeches from myself and my colleagues that \neven the words alone made a difference to them. At least they felt \nsomeone heard them, is understanding what they are going through. But \nthat urgency persists, and my hope is that we, working together, can \nfind a way to extend these benefits.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/03/senate-section/article/S699-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. WARREN.

Mr. President, the coal under our Federal public lands is \na tremendously valuable asset that belongs to the American people. For \nnearly my entire career in Congress, I have been working to ensure that \nwe do not shortchange taxpayers by giving this asset away to the coal \ncompanies for bargain-basement prices. As we are facing Federal \ndeficits and budget cuts for programs that benefit hard-working, \nmiddle-class families, we need to ensure more than ever that we are not \ngiving a windfall to coal companies on the backs of taxpayers in \nMassachusetts and across the Nation by selling this public coal for \nless than it is worth.\n  In 1982, following coal lease sales by the Department of the Interior \non public lands in the Powder River Basin, PRB, in Wyoming and Montana, \nI asked the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to investigate \nwhether taxpayers had received a proper return in these lease sales. \nThe GAO found that this Federal coal was sold for pennies on the \ndollar. The GAO report concluded that the Interior Department had sold \nthis public coal in the Powder River Basin for $100 million less than \nit was worth. Following that revelation, there were a number of \nrecommendations made to reform the Federal coal leasing program and \nensure that taxpayers were protected. Unfortunately, I have concerns \nthat similar problems with the Federal coal program may persist today \nat the expense of taxpayers in Massachusetts and around the country.\n  This week, I am releasing a new public GAO report on the Federal coal \nleasing program. This is the first time in 20 years that the GAO has \nevaluated this program and it is well overdue.\n  The findings in the latest GAO report highlight the fact that there \nstill is a lack of competition for Federal coal leases. This dearth of \ncompetition amongst coal companies means that it is the Interior \nDepartment, and not the market, that is ensuring a fair price is set \nfor these valuable resources. To give you an idea of the magnitude of \nthis issue, for every cent per ton that coal companies decrease their \nbids for the largest coal leases, it could mean the loss of nearly $7 \nmillion for the American people. We have to act to correct the issues \nidentified in the report and make sure national resources are not being \ngiven away at below market prices.\n  The GAO has found that the Interior Department is not properly \nconsidering the potential of future exports of this coal from Federal \nleases. These coal leases are issued for 20 years and can be further \nextended. Coal exports for electricity generation in other countries \nhave doubled in just a few years. Companies want to sell U.S. coal \noverseas to China and European markets to increase their profits. If we \nare not properly valuing the possibility that coal exports to higher \npriced markets will continue to increase, we risk not only costing \ntaxpayers money but also exacerbating climate change by, in effect, \nsubsidizing coal companies to send more coal abroad to be burned in \ndirty power plants.\n  Moreover, the GAO has concluded in its public report that the \nInterior Department lacks transparency and is not providing sufficient \ninformation to the public on the Federal coal leasing program. I am \nextremely concerned that a lack of transparency and public information \nfor the American people and for the Congress is inhibiting proper \noversight of this important program to protect taxpayers.\n  When I was serving as ranking member of the House Natural Resources \nCommittee, I began an oversight inquiry into the Federal coal leasing \nprogram in July 2012. While the Department has provided me, and my \nstaff has reviewed, hundreds of pages of leasing documents, certain \ncritical information necessary to properly evaluate this program has \nbeen withheld. As a result, the Interior Department is not providing \ninformation on the Federal coal program to the Congress in a way that \nallows for proper oversight. While the intent of this restriction may \nbe to protect the integrity of future lease sales, the effect is to \nhamper congressional oversight.\n  As part of its investigation, the GAO released two reports to me, one \nthat is public and one that is not able to be made public. GAO kept one \nof these reports nonpublic because the Interior Department believes \nthat the proprietary information contained in the nonpublic report \ncould harm the integrity of future lease sales. I believe that \nincreased transparency with these coal lease sales would increase the \nintegrity of the process, not lessen it. It would be very helpful for \nthe American people to be able to review this information. But even if \nthat is not possible because of concerns about proprietary information, \nSenators should be able to review this information and debate it in \norder to ensure that taxpayers are protected. Unfortunately, we are not \nable to have that debate on the floor of the Senate for the American \npeople. That is wrong and very troubling.\n  It is concerning to me that an agency would seek to withhold this \nsort of information from Congress. Without this information, we cannot \nmake a legislative decision about whether the statutes governing coal \nleasing on Federal lands are working as intended and whether the \nDepartment is administering them properly.\n  Based on my staff's examination of the materials provided to me by \nthe Department and included in the nonpublic report issued to me by the \nGAO, it appears that the Interior Department may be consistently \nundervaluing Federal coal leases. The GAO report found that the \nInterior Department is using information that is outdated in valuing \ncoal leases. Based on\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nthe examination of the materials provided to me, I believe that this \nproblem may be even greater than stated in the GAO report. I am \nconcerned that the Department may be using extremely outdated \ninformation and boilerplate analysis that does not reflect current \nmarket conditions.\n  These are tremendously serious problems. Based on my staff's \nexamination of the materials, I believe that using appropriate market \ncalculations and assumptions in some recent coal lease sales could \npotentially have yielded $200 million more for the American people and \npossibly hundreds of millions of dollars more.\n  Therefore, I am transmitting two letters to the Interior Department, \none that I am able to release publicly and one that I cannot, which \nseek answers to how the Department will respond to the recommendations \nin the GAO report and other issues involved in Federal coal leasing. I \nbelieve that until the questions and issues that I have raised in my \nletters to the Department are properly addressed to guarantee \nsufficient taxpayer protections are in place, the Interior Department \nshould temporarily suspend further Federal coal leasing. I will also be \nintroducing legislation in the future to reform the Federal coal \nprogram to guarantee a fair return for the American people.\n  Congress needs to be able to conduct the necessary oversight to \nensure that the problems we have seen in the Federal coal program in \nthe past do not continue. Until that happens we cannot assure taxpayers \nin Massachusetts and every State that they are getting a fair return on \nthis public resource that they own. Until that happens, we lack the \nassurances that we are not subsidizing coal companies to increase \ncarbon pollution by sending our coal overseas. It is time for the \nCongress to be able to conduct the oversight of this program that is \nrequired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/03/senate-section/article/S700-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 5:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1901.
