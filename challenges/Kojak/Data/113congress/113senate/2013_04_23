Mr. President, following leader remarks the Senate will be \nin a period of morning business for 1 hour. The majority will control \nthe first half, the Republicans the final half. Following morning \nbusiness the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed \nto the Marketplace Fairness Act. From 12:30 today until 2:15 the Senate \nwill be in a recess to allow for our weekly caucus meetings.\n  Yesterday evening a number of Senators missed votes. We have talked \nabout this a number of times and become somewhat complacent. We have \nvotes for 15 minutes. We extend it for 5 minutes. We have extended that \ntime for a long period of time.\n  Because of procedural things around here in the Senate, I had to \nterminate that vote before 6 o'clock in an effort to save a full day of \nlegislative business. Obviously, there is 30 hours following that \ncloture vote--wasted time. I have talked about it before, but there was \nno reason whatsoever that we went into Wednesday rather than Tuesday. \nSo I do not apologize. Everyone here has to understand there are \ncertain things we have to do around here.\n  We have been somewhat lax in enforcing the length of votes. It is \nvery unfair to people who vote and have other things to do to wait for \nothers before the vote is terminated. I understand how important it is \nfor people to do their votes, but it is also important to get our \nbusiness done here. I repeat, had we not terminated that vote before 6 \no'clock, then it would have kicked us over until Wednesday before \ncloture could be filed on the bill. I do not know if I am going to file \ncloture on the bill today, but at least I have the opportunity to do \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2857-7", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2857-S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             REGULAR ORDER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my Republican colleagues often demand a \nreturn to regular order. We have heard speeches, and the House is also \ntalking about regular order. They have done this many different places \nbut especially where the budget process is concerned. They complained \nfor 2 years that we did not pass a budget, even though there was a law \nwe passed that gave us those budget numbers.\n  But they still came and talked about our needing to do a budget \nresolution. I repeat, we did not need a budget resolution because we \nhad enacted a budget with the force of law, a bill the President \nsigned. A resolution, the President does not have to sign that. This \nyear, I repeat, the Republicans again requested we take up a budget \nresolution.\n  Until 5 in the morning we took vote after vote on amendment after \namendment, more than 100 votes. In the end, we passed a budget \nresolution without a single Republican vote in the affirmative. After \ngiving the Republicans what they wanted or what they said they wanted, \nregular order, countless amendment votes, the passage of a budget \nresolution, a strange thing happened. House Republicans did a complete \n180. They flipped. They are no longer insisting on regular order, even \nthough they preached that for years. They do not want to go to \nconference and work things out. They did not even want to name \nconferees.\n  It seems House Republicans do not want to be seen discussing even the\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\npossibility of compromise with Democrats for fear there will be a tea \nparty revolt, but that is not a good reason to run away from budget \nnegotiations. In fact, it is ridiculous. So today I am going to ask \nunanimous consent to name conferees so we can have a budget conference \nto try to work things out.\n  I hope, even though I doubt, my Republican colleagues in the Senate \nwill not object for the sole purpose of giving cover to the House \nRepublican colleagues who are certainly directed and guided by the tea \nparty folks over there. If the Republicans are serious about reducing \nthe deficit, we need to get to work, get to work sooner rather than \nlater.\n  What is regular order? It means we do things the way they are \nsupposed to be done--by the book, so to speak. So I am going to ask \nthat consent soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2858-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEQUESTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Let's talk about sequestration just for a brief time. I \ntalked about it yesterday in the afternoon when the Senate convened. On \nSunday, the Federal Aviation Administration implemented sequester \nfurloughs. It will affect tens of thousands of employees. By Monday, \nyesterday, travelers were already experiencing delays at airports from \ncoast to coast.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, flights to New York airports \nwere delayed more than an hour already because of those furloughs. \nDelays are also reported in Los Angeles and even Baltimore. The FAA \nassured us things will get much worse before the end of the busy summer \ntravel season, as these arbitrary sequester cuts continue to affect \nairport staffing levels.\n  What this means is that every 2 weeks all FAA employees will have to \ntake a day off. At peak travel times, almost 7,000 flights will be \ndelayed every day, some of them by up to 3 hours. On the worst day we \nhad last year because of weather-related issues, less than 3,000 \nflights were delayed. Now, every day, more than twice that number will \nbe delayed.\n  These delays will be bad for business, they will be frustrating for \nfamilies, and they will be devastating for the economy. But flight \ndelays are not the only unintended consequence of these across-the-\nboard cuts. It is not just FAA employees. It will affect 750,000 jobs \nacross the country. It will shred the safety net that keeps millions of \nseniors, children, veterans, and needy families from falling through \nthe cracks.\n  It will gut investment in education, medical research that helps \nAmerica compete in the 21st century. More than 2,700 schools with large \nnumbers of disadvantaged children will see their Federal funding \nslashed. Seventy thousand little boys and girls will not be able to do \nthe Head Start programs. These cuts will put 10,000 classroom jobs at \nrisk. They will eliminate extra help at closing the achievement gap for \n1.2 million underprivileged students.\n  More than 7,200 teachers and classroom aids who work with children \nwith disabilities will lose their jobs because of the sequester. Some \n33,000 college students will lose their work study jobs. I was a \njanitor for part of the time I went to school. It helped me pay my \ntuition. Things have changed over the years, but these jobs are still \nimportant, very important. They call them work study jobs.\n  We are putting the dream of higher education further out of reach for \nour poorest students if we keep this sequestration going. Families and \nbusinesses in every State will feel the pain of the sequester whether \nthey fly or do not fly. But Congress could act now to reverse these \ncuts without adding a single dollar to the deficit. We can use the \nsavings from wrapping up military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to \navoid the full brunt of these arbitrary cuts.\n  Right now, there is about $650 billion in that fund. We could erase \nthe sequester for the rest of the year, which is a fraction of the \nsavings from winding down these two wars. Using those savings, Congress \ncould avert the most painful and senseless sequester cuts, cuts to the \nFAA and programs that get homeless veterans off the streets, fund \nresearch to cure lethal diseases, and provide meals to needy seniors.\n  I only hope public outcry over long delays at airports will serve as \na wake-up call to my Republican colleagues. We cannot put off action \nany longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2858-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader.\n  I feel the need to respond to the comments from the leader about the \nsequester that has gone into effect. I wish to be very clear. The \nflight delays that are occurring, the furloughs among air traffic \ncontrollers, and the shutting down of air traffic towers are entirely, \nutterly unnecessary. This is a willful choice being made by this \nadministration in order to inflict as disruptive a process as possible \non the American public and on our economy, all to further a political \nagenda. The political agenda is to attempt to convince the American \npeople there are no circumstances under which we can ever cut spending \nat all.\n  If you question why I say this is a willful decision on the part of \nthis administration, I would refer you to legislation Senator Inhofe \nand I offered prior to the beginning of the sequestration. This \nlegislation, as you may recall, would have granted to the \nadministration complete flexibility in how they achieved the savings of \nthe sequester.\n  What we hear from the administration, administration officials, and \nWhite House spokespeople is that this is terribly unfortunate, but they \nhave no choice and no alternative; the law requires that they make \nthese cuts. However, when Senator Inhofe and I introduced legislation \nto explicitly grant them all the flexibility they could ask for, \ncomplete flexibility to find the most wasteful, most redundant, most \nunnecessary programs, and to cut there instead of cutting essential \nservices, what did the administration say? They said: If you send us \nthe legislation, we will veto it. They put\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nout a Statement of Administration Policy insisting that this was a \nterrible idea, to give them the flexibility to avoid exactly what they \nare doing.\n  I don't know how one can come to any conclusion other than that this \nadministration wishes to impose this inconvenience, this disruption, \nand this cost on the American people and our economy. They have it \nwithin their ability to accept the device we were offering, which would \nhave allowed them to avoid this entirely.\n  I am extremely disappointed the administration would choose to \ninflict this kind of harm to our economy, this kind of inconvenience to \nour travelers, all for the purpose of furthering a political agenda. \nThis is no way to run this government.\n  What I would suggest we do is we revisit the legislation Senator \nInhofe and I offered which would have avoided all of this, allowed us \nto cut some of the waste, excess, duplication, and avoid all of this \ninconvenience. This is entirely unnecessary, and it is unacceptable.\n  One of the proper functions of any executive, including the President \nof the United States, is to look throughout the spending over which he \nor she has control to find the lowest priority, to find the least \nnecessary and least disruptive way to achieve the savings we need. We \nare running unacceptably large deficits. We have a huge debt that is \nalready costing this economy the kind of growth we ought to have.\n  The very modest savings of the sequester could be achieved in a way \nthat wouldn't be disruptive at all. The size of the Federal budget has \nmore than doubled in the last 12 years. To suggest that it is not \npossible to find 2.5 percent savings is simply ridiculous. It is not \ntrue.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's fix this. We know how to do it. We have \nthe tools available. Senator Inhofe and I offered. There are other \nways, and I would be open to any number of them. We need to achieve the \nsavings of the sequester, and we need to do it in a way that is not \ndisruptive and that can be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Las Vegas is the destination resort of the world. I may get \na little static from New York about that, but it is a place a lot of \npeople wish to visit. We understand the importance of doing something \nabout the lines at airports as the result of sequestration. But as I \nindicated in my remarks, I am also concerned about the little boys and \ngirls who are knocked off Head Start--70,000 of them. I am also \nconcerned about medical research. As I stated yesterday, Duke \nUniversity is laying off 50 people. Duke does some of the most \nimportant medical research there is, dealing with dread disease. I am \nconcerned about homeless veterans. The program will eliminate homeless \nveterans having a home. This is what sequestration does to them.\n  The reason sequester is taking effect is because Congress enacted it \ninto law the Budget Control Act of 2011. The vast majority of \nRepublicans voted for this. The Senate considered an alternative that \nwould have altered sequester, and it would have done it with a balanced \npackage. Republicans blocked it earlier this year.\n  We need to lessen the impact of sequestration. It is not as if we are \nblind to doing something about deficit reduction. We have already \nreduced the debt by about $2.6 trillion.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania has a reputation for being very concerned \nabout dealing with money, and I admire him for his tenaciousness in \nthat regard.\n  What I have suggested here certainly seems reasonable. For 5 months, \nwe do a timeout on the sequestration. During the 5 months, \nsequestration would be paid for with part of the $650 billion that was \nin a pot that is a result of the money building up due to reducing the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During these 5 months, let's find a \nbetter way to go forward with our efforts to reduce the debt. I think \nthis is reasonable, it would be fair, and it would give us time to do \nsomething.\n  Certainly with the debt ceiling coming up and other major issues we \nneed to deal with, I think we should lessen not only the impact of the \nproblems we have at airports around America, but also we should focus \non little boys and girls and elderly men and women who are losing Meals \nOn Wheels, their only hot meal of the day.\n  I think we should do that--look at this sequestration and take a \ntimeout.\n  I recognize my friend from North Dakota, who is going to give her \nmaiden speech. We are looking forward to hearing what she has to say.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2859-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2859-S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FACING CHALLENGES TOGETHER\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. First, I wish to thank all of my colleagues who came \nhere today to see me offer my first speech on the floor of the Senate. \nIt is a great group, a bipartisan group, and I believe our new class is \nexactly that--a group of great people who are very bipartisan and very \nwilling to work to solve America's problems. I am proud to be part of \nthis freshman class in the Senate.\n  People here all think they know each other, and this is absolutely \ntrue, but sometimes it is a good reminder to tell people about from \nwhere you come. I wish to spend a little time talking about my home \nState because I think it speaks a great deal about how I believe, how I \nvote, and who I am.\n  I grew up in a small town in North Dakota. Many may think that means \n90,000 people. No, it is 90 people. My family was one-tenth the \npopulation of that small town. When I was born, my mother had four \nkids, and the oldest was 2 and there were no twins. By the time my \nparents were done having children, there were seven children in 9 \nyears. My dad was a seasonal construction worker, and my mom was a \nschool cook and a janitor. Think about those occupations.\n  My mom never let anyone be bullied. The worst thing a person could \ndo, in my mother's eyes, was to pick on someone who couldn't defend \nthemselves. We knew that was what our role would be throughout our \nentire lives. This is a value my six siblings and I carry with us.\n  From my dad we learned about community and building community. My dad \nbuilt the smallest VFW chapter in the country. He returned from World \nWar II and knew they needed a place to gather, to provide support for \nveterans and for each other, and that needed to be in his community. He \nbuilt the ballpark, he built the fire hall, was chief of the volunteer \nfire department for years, head of the VFW, and was someone who \nbelieved in the community. He believed that when Mrs. Poster needed her \nsidewalk shoveled so she could go to church, it was our job. It wasn't \nsomeone else's job. We didn't look around to see who would come; we \npicked up the shovel and we went down there.\n  What do you learn from the place where you grew up? In Mantador, ND, \nas in communities all across this country, people gather at coffee \ntables usually at 7 o'clock, maybe 10:30 in the morning or maybe a \nlittle bit in the afternoon, and they talk about the problems of \nAmerica. They talk about the problems of their community. There are \nmany ideologies at that table--Democrats and Republicans; as we say in \nMantador, there are Lutherans and Catholics; there are Green Bay fans \nand Vikings fans, which may be the most divisive issue. They gather \ntogether and solve all the problems of America, if we would only listen \nhere in Washington, DC. More importantly, even though they have \nhorrible fights, they get together and solve problems in their \ncommunity. They figure out how to put up the Christmas lights on Main \nStreet. They figure out how to fix the roof on the church, how to pass \na school bond so they can expand classrooms.\n  All across America, people work together. That is the spirit, and \nthat is what I learned growing up in a small town in North Dakota--that \nwe can accomplish things if we keep our eyes on the goals, if we \nunderstand and appreciate that we all come from different places and \nneed to work together. Sometimes we are not going to agree, but we need \nto move forward. We need to work together to move this country forward.\n  I wish to take a moment, and hopefully I won't get too emotional, but \nI want to think about this. We live in a country, an amazing country \nwhere the daughter of a school cook and janitor and a seasonal \nconstruction worker can\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nstand on the floor of the Senate and address this body. It is an \namazing country, and we can never forget that value. But I never \nthought I would be here. What I mean by that is I never thought I would \ncome to the Senate. Do you know why? North Dakota had Senator Conrad \nand Senator Dorgan--two giants who came to this body, spoke their \nminds, and represented their State. I knew they would always represent \nme. Then something happened: They became tired, frustrated, and moved \non with their lives. They asked me to join this fight, the fight for \nNorth Dakota and the fight for our values. They asked me to step into \ntheir shoes. I am extraordinarily proud to be here, extraordinarily \nproud to represent agriculture.\n  What do I mean by that? We have frustration in farm country. There \nare 16 million jobs in agriculture. It is the bright spot on our \neconomy, and it is helping to reduce our trade deficit. It is \neverything in my State.\n  We have small farmers, small family farmers who must spend $1 million \nbefore they can even take a crop out of the ground. That is an average \nfarmer in my State. That is how much it costs to engage in farming. \nWhen we don't have a farm bill that provides certainty and security for \nthem, we not only hurt them and hurt American agriculture, we risk our \nsecure food supply. So I came here to speak for North Dakota farmers.\n  I came here to speak for an energy policy. This is an amazing place. \nYou hear everybody say we believe in ``all of the above.'' In North \nDakota, we do ``all of the above.'' We not only are rich in natural \ngas, oil, and coal, but we also have geothermal, ethanol, and biofuels. \nWe are one of the leading producers in the country of wind energy. We \nget it. But policies in this body and in this city that provide \ncertainty to our energy producers need to be established.\n  I am here to address the concerns we have. If we do not have policies \nthat address issues of redundancy and reliability in energy, we will \nfall further and further behind. And these are new technologies and \ngreat innovations that are coming down the pike. We need to address \nthose. We need to move forward.\n  I came here to speak about reasonable fiscal solutions. We heard a \ndebate--a good debate--about the effects of sequestration. We know we \nhave challenges. On both sides of the aisle, there is a sense of \npurpose to change the trajectory of this debt. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend. We have a national debt that is almost \nequal to our gross domestic product. We have interest payments that are \nthe third highest payment we make here at a time of record-low interest \nrates. This is unsustainable and it needs to be addressed, but it needs \nto be addressed responsibly.\n\n  Like many of you, I have my own personal passions. They involve \nsenior citizens--making sure we provide them with a secure future, but \nalso a secure future for future senior citizens. Veterans, I care \ndeeply about the condition of veterans benefits and what we are going \nto do to reward and truly thank the 1 percent in this country who step \nup to serve us. I have a great concern for people living in Indian \nCountry, what we are going to do to make sure they enjoy a future in \nour State. If we take every problem of America and multiply it times 3, \nthose are the problems in Indian Country that need to be addressed. I \ncare about Head Start. I believe a Head Start investment is a smart \ninvestment.\n  My colleagues might wonder, with all of these concerns and all of \nthese issues, why I am standing today to talk about marketplace \nfairness. Well, we are going to hear a lot about a case called Quill v. \nNorth Dakota. What my colleagues may not know is the whole caption of \nthat case is Quill v. North Dakota ex rel. MK Heidi Heitkamp.\n  Over 20 years ago, I heard the despair of Main Street businesses. I \nhad a woman come to me who ran a little wallpaper shop in her town. At \nthe time--and I don't know if it is true today--she had to buy these \nwallpaper books from the companies, so there was an investment in \npresenting this product. People would come to her, they would open the \nbook, and she would help them do a little interior design. She would \nwork through the fabrics and all of this, and then they walked out and \nshe never saw them again.\n  She knew and I knew what they did was go home, look in their \ncatalogues, take the lot number she had given them, and then order the \nwallpaper. Maybe--maybe--they ordered it more cheaply than just the \nsales tax, but she wanted to know from me, when I was tax commissioner, \nhow I could justify the 5 percent disadvantage she was having. She \nwanted to know what I could do to level the playing field so she at \nleast had a chance, she at least could compete.\n  Well, I listened. And it wasn't just that woman who ran the wallpaper \nbusiness, it was the furniture stores, and it was the Main Street \noffice supply stores. So we initiated a lawsuit called Quill.\n  For those who think this is going to unduly burden small business, I \nwant them to think about this: In my State we sued Quill because they \nwere the third highest retailer of office products in my State--the \nthird highest. It was pretty remarkable. Yet they were enjoying this \nadvantage of not having to collect sales tax. So we took the case to \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Some might say that didn't turn out very well for us. But let me cite \nsome basic information about the court case because at the time there \nwas a sense there was not due process jurisdiction if one didn't have \nphysical contacts in their State. A lot of us in this body are lawyers, \nand we know that long-arm statute had at the time moved on. The \nquestion was what in fact would be the contact, and could we, in tax \njurisdiction and in sales tax collection, get the court to agree that \ndue process was not disturbed by an extension of regulation and \nresponsibility to Internet sales and at that time catalogue sellers.\n  The court agreed with that piece, but when they were challenged with \nthe argument did North Dakota's imposition affect interstate commerce--\nand they heard a lot of arguments we will hear today about a lot of \njurisdictions, it is not very streamlined--they said: We aren't \ncomfortable. But you know where this belongs. It belongs where the \nConstitution puts this discussion. It belongs in the Senate. It belongs \nin the House of Representatives. It belongs to Congress because \nCongress has the obligation of regulating interstate commerce.\n  So here we are almost 20 years later--over 20 years later--since the \ncourt case was decided and still debating this issue. This issue has \ngrown tremendously because of the explosion of Internet sales. Remote \nsellers are getting bigger and our Main Street businesses continue to \nsuffer and continue to struggle.\n  We will hear a lot today about how this bill discriminates. We will \nhear a lot about how it is not fair. We will hear how it affects small \nbusiness. Every time we hear that argument, I want my colleagues, the \nMembers of this body, to think just for a moment that you are that one \nwoman with the wallpaper books or you are the small drugstore trying to \nsell candles to supplement the prescription drug business you have. You \nare that small business, and what you see is that you have the burden \nof collecting this sales tax and you are building your community. You \ntake out a little ad in your school newspaper to help that school \nnewspaper or an ad for the scoreboard down at the high school. When \nthey come around and ask for a little money for the fire hall, you chip \nin. So you are building the community, and you are there, and you are \nemploying people there and wondering why this government can authorize \nand approve discrimination against you, and why you have to fight so \nhard.\n  We will hear a lot today about small businesses that operate on the \nmargin; right? Retail has a small margin. Exactly. That is exactly the \npoint. That small margin is just as small for that Main Street \nbusiness, but they have a 5-percent disadvantage.\n  So today and tomorrow we will hear a lot about this bill. I know \nfeelings are running fairly high for people who oppose it. But when we \nhear discrimination and we hear it is not the role of this body to take \nthis on, understand this: It is exactly the role of this body. It is \nexactly the obligation we have--to level the playing field, to make \nthings fair, to respond to the needs of our community. And that is why \nwe are fighting so hard. That is why we are working so hard on this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\n  I think we are going to get it done, but let's just think for a \nmoment. We have taken a couple of votes. They have been pretty good, \nlopsided votes for us. If we fail in moving this bill after it has such \ntremendous support, how do we do the tough stuff? How do we do the \ndeficit reduction we need to do? How do we do the tough stuff that \ncomes here? Let's do this. Let's level the playing field. Let's make \nthis responsive to those Main Street businesses who every day struggle \nand are simply asking for justice. They are simply asking for equity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as a result of the administration's \npoor planning and, I would argue, political motives, thousands of \npeople were stuck on tarmacs over the last few days. The FAA's \nmismanagement of this issue is the source of bipartisan frustration. \nOur goal shouldn't be to score political points on the backs of weary \ntravelers, it should be to fix the problem.\n  Look, the Obama administration knew about the sequester for months--\nfor months. Yet it gave the traveling public and Congress only 3 days' \nnotice before implementing the furloughs now being blamed for these \ndelays. The FAA Administrator testified before the Commerce and \nAppropriations Committees last week but made no mention of the \nmagnitude and impact on delays of these furloughs that were just right \naround the corner.\n  It seems completely implausible to me he didn't know about them when \nhe was testifying last week. Was the administration hiding the ball \nfrom the traveling public? It seems like a fair question.\n  Frankly, this episode is a perfect illustration of why Republicans \nsought to give the administration even greater flexibility to ensure \nthey could prioritize essential services. One of the primary areas for \nwhich that flexibility was intended was air traffic control. The fact \nthe administration rejected it strongly suggests a political motive is \nat play.\n  I would also remind everyone this flexibility was rejected by nearly \nevery Democrat in the Senate, and the President threatened to veto \nlegislation that granted it, holding it hostage to tax hikes instead.\n  So here is what I would suggest at this point. We are where we are. \nThe Obama administration needs to direct the FAA to review their \ncurrent spending and use their existing flexibility to keep America \nmoving as smoothly as possible. Ensuring the safe, efficient movement \nof the traveling public is a much higher priority than the \nadministration's own travel, conferences, and consultants.\n  Not all government spending is created equally, and so this morning I \nam calling on the Obama administration and the FAA to be smarter and \nmore transparent about the sequester. That means prioritizing funding \nto ensure flights are not needlessly delayed or canceled.\n  If for some reason the President or the FAA do not believe they have \nthe flexibility to address this issue, they should ask Congress for the \nflexibility they need. Until then, however, they should use the \nflexibility we all know they do have to ease the burden on passengers.\n  But let's be clear: We wouldn't even be in this situation if the \nadministration hadn't rejected the flexibility we offered them months \nago or if they had done the planning they needed to do in the first \nplace. There is no good reason for these delays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2861-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this week, the Senate is debating a \nbill that would authorize States to require retailers to collect taxes \non remote sales. I recognize there are a range of views on this bill, \nand these views don't break along partisan lines nor do they follow, \nreally, along traditional ideological lines. Speaking for myself, \nhowever, I intend to oppose the bill, and here is why.\n  For me, the issue boils down to the fact the legislation we are \nconsidering would create an enormous compliance burden for a lot of \nsmall businesses out there, making them tax collectors for thousands of \nfar-away jurisdictions. Just as importantly, this legislation would \nincrease the tax burden on Kentuckians. As I have said before, I don't \nthink the people of Kentucky sent me here to help them pay higher \ntaxes.\n  Brick-and-mortar companies complain about the inequity that exists in \ncurrent law, where their customers have to pay taxes that online \nshoppers do not. Frankly, that is a legitimate concern; but by imposing \nthis new Internet tax, States would suddenly be empowered to force \nonline retailers to simultaneously comply with all the different tax \ncodes of all the States in which their customers reside. And that is no \nsmall feat.\n  From what I am told, there are nearly 10,000 State, local, and \nmunicipal tax codes nationwide. While complying with so many codes \nmight not be a big deal for large online retailers, it is actually a \nhuge burden for the little guys. So small business owners are worried, \nand justifiably so.\n  I know they are in Kentucky because so many keep writing to share \ntheir concerns with me. One small business owner lamented that ``small \nonline business owner[s] ha[d] been silenced and pushed to the side'' \nin this debate as larger companies ``[press] for the changes to take \neffect as quickly as possible. The simple matter of the fact is that \nany business with [fewer] than 100 employees would be completely \noverwhelmed by applying, keeping, updating, and reporting sales tax for \nevery state and tax zone in the United States.''\n  It is pretty hard to argue with that. Moreover, this is a bill that--\nonce again, as happens all too often in the Senate--hasn't been run \nthrough a committee, hasn't been properly vetted, and hasn't yet had \nthe kinks worked out of it.\n  It is not like there aren't other things that can be done to improve \ntax compliance for online shoppers--things that don't require us to \nturn private businesses into tax collectors for remote State \ngovernments. Most States impose a use tax, for instance, which requires \ntaxpayers to report how much they have purchased on the \nInternet. Individual States that are concerned about this issue could \nchoose to enforce their own existing use taxes rather than expect the \nFederal Government to impose sweeping legislation to empower States to \nreach across borders to collect taxes.\n\n  And let's not forget the fact that the Internet has been such an \nenormous source of innovation and convenience for our constituents, our \ncountry, and our economy--even in these tough economic times. But that \nis largely because the government has kept its nose out and allowed \ninnovation to flourish.\n  I won't be supporting this bill. If States decide they need this \nrevenue, they should keep in mind the tremendous burden they will be \nplacing on the little guys who do so much to drive this economy. In my \nview, the Federal Government should be looking for ways to help, not \nhurt, these folks. Let's be honest; the big guys can take care of \nthemselves. Let's not make it even harder for the smaller competitors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know Senator Barrasso is coming, but \nuntil he does, I wish to make a few comments about the Marketplace \nFairness Act, which is the legislation before us today, and especially, \nto begin with, Senator Heitkamp's address, the new Senator from North \nDakota.\n  It is rare that a new Senator has a chance to come to the Senate and \nin her first few months find us debating a bill she brought when she \nwas a State official in North Dakota 20 years ago. That shows why the \nSenate is a good place for people with a little bit of experience \nbecause she can bring to us exactly what we are talking about.\n  Her story about the small business people who are making a few \ndollars and have a very small margin for profit and then who are \ndiscriminated against by out-of-State sellers who don't have to collect \nthe tax that is already owed is a real story, and she made a remarkably \ngood address and I compliment her for that and welcome her to the \nSenate.\n  Sometimes we launch into these complicated debates without saying \nwhat we are talking about. Let me see if I can say in a few simple \nwords exactly what we are talking about here.\n  My wife gave me an ice cream freezer for my birthday last year. She \ngot it from Williams-Sonoma. It is not one of those freezers you have \nto crank, as I did when I was a kid, and when you eat the ice cream it \nmakes your head hurt because you would eat it too fast. This is a \nmodern ice cream freezer, and you mix the stuff up and put it in, and \nafter a while here comes the ice cream. But then I discovered that \nWilliams-Sonoma also sells a mix you can order and that makes it even \neasier. So I ordered the mix.\n  Williams-Sonoma has stores in Tennessee, but I ordered mine online. I \ndon't do this very much so I am not the best online purchaser who is \naround. But I looked up the catalog number, punched a few buttons on my \ncomputer, and I ordered my ice cream ingredients. It asked for my name, \naddress, and the information on my credit card. And with that \ninformation, two things happened: I ordered the ingredients and they \narrived within a few days. But Williams-Sonoma, through the Internet, \ndetermined from my ZIP Code what the sales tax is in Tennessee and in \nmy home county and will remit it electronically to the State of \nTennessee. That is what we are talking about.\n  If I go to the Williams-Sonoma store in Nashville and I buy the ice \ncream freezer or the ingredients, they add our 10-percent sales tax to \nit. If I order it online from Williams-Sonoma, they add the 10 percent, \ntoo, because I put my ZIP Code in. The way software is today, it is \nvery simple to find out what the tax is in any jurisdiction. It is as \neasy as finding out the weather. If I want to know the weather in \nMaryville, TN, I put weather 37205. That is my ZIP Code. I find out the \nweather. Williams-Sonoma can find out the tax I owe on the ice cream \ningredients that way.\n  So the Williams-Sonoma store in Nashville collects the tax, and they \nhave to do it by law. That is part of their business responsibility in \nthe State of Tennessee. The Williams-Sonoma store online collects the \ntax because they have stores in Tennessee. But lots of other out-of-\nState sellers do not collect the tax that is already owed. It is owed.\n  It is said there is a new tax here. I don't know where everybody got \nthat. They must not have read the bill carefully. The U.S. Congress \ncan't change the sales tax in Tennessee. We can't impose it, we can't \nlower it, we can't raise it. That is under the responsibility of the \nsovereign State of Tennessee.\n  This bill has nothing to do with the Federal Tax Code. Caterpillars \nhave as much to do with the Federal Tax Code as this bill does. So it \nhas nothing to do with taxes. This bill has to do with two words, and \ntwo words alone: States rights. Or you could substitute those two words \nwith Tenth Amendment.\n\n  Do we believe here in the Senate that the Governor of Tennessee or \nMassachusetts or Kentucky or Wyoming or anywhere else has to come here \nand play ``mother, may I'' to ask permission to decide what the State \ntax policy ought to be in Tennessee?\n  Tennessee imposes its own State sales tax. That is its decision. We \ndo not have a State income tax. That is Tennessee's decision. Some \nStates do. States have the right to be right; States have the right to \nbe wrong. That came with our constitutional framework. We ignore it all \nthe time.\n  A lot of Senators who fly to Washington somehow get the idea--if they \ncan get through the delay on the tarmac everybody else is experiencing \nright now--that this 1-hour flight makes them smarter because they flew \nup here. No, it doesn't make us smarter. In fact, we ought to leave to \nStates the responsibilities that States are supposed to have--whether \nit is in education or in health care or anything else, but certainly in \nmatters of State tax policy. We shouldn't be trying to tell Tennessee \nor Massachusetts or anybody else what their taxes ought to be.\n  What we are doing with this bill is we are doing what the Supreme \nCourt said we are the best persons to do. That is what Senator Heitkamp \nsaid a little while ago. We are the ones to write the rules to say: \nStates, of course, may decide whether they want to collect the State \nsales tax and use tax from all the people who owe it or some of the \npeople who owe it. That is what the issue is.\n  Let's say we pass the Marketplace Fairness Act. It says that \nTennessee can make its own decision about how it collects its sales tax \nand its use tax. Tennessee could decide it wants to discriminate \nagainst the Nashville Boot Company that sells boots out the front door, \ncollects the sales tax, and sends it to the State. Let's discriminate \nagainst the Nashville Boot Company and tell the out-of-State seller of \nboots, You don't have to do that. Or, the State may decide--as I am \nsure it will, because the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and the \nlegislators have told me they will. They may decide: We don't pick and \nchoose between winners and losers, we don't pick and choose between \ntaxpayers, we don't pick and choose between businesses. We want a level \nplaying field. So we are going to say to the out-of-State seller--\ncatalog, online, or whatever it is--welcome. You can sell in Tennessee \nif you play by the same rules that people who live in Tennessee do. \nThat is all you have to do.\n  So the States are going to require, as it does, the Nashville Boot \nCompany, the Williams-Sonoma store, the service station, the drugstore, \nto collect the sales tax and send it in to the States, and it is going \nto require the out-of-State seller to do the same thing. That is all we \nare talking about. If the out-of-State seller doesn't want to do it, it \ndoesn't have to. Nobody is requiring people to sell their stuff in \nTennessee. It is a free country. It is a big country.\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nIt is a big market. We produce 25 percent of all the money in the \nworld. If you don't like Tennessee's rules, as long as they fit the \nconstitutional framework of not imposing a burden on interstate \ncommerce, you don't have to sell in Tennessee. We hope you will. And if \nit is as easy for you to collect the tax as it is to find out the \nweather in your hometown, we don't know why you wouldn't.\n  We don't know why you would even expect that you would be treated \nbetter than somebody who lives in Tennessee and goes to work every day \nin Tennessee and pays taxes in Tennessee and collects taxes in \nTennessee. We will treat you just as well as we do the local folks, but \nwe are not going to treat you any better and put you at an advantage \nwith our hometown businesses. That is what this is about, and that is \nall it is about.\n  Let's make clear what this is not. It is not a tax. It is about taxes \nalready owed. It is not a Federal tax. It is State taxes already owed. \nSales taxes and use taxes, that is all we are talking about.\n  Are we telling any State they must do this or must do that? No. We \nare saying to States that we are simply affirming the spirit of the \nTenth Amendment, which says: You have the right to decide for yourself, \nMr. Governor, Ms. Legislator, what your State tax structure ought to \nbe. It is up to you. If you want to have just some people pay the sales \ntaxes and use taxes that are owed and other people to not pay them, \nthat is up to you too. That is your business. But this is a States \nrights Tenth Amendment decision that leaves to the States this ability.\n  I wanted to talk mostly about what we are talking about: We are \ntalking about what happens when you buy something online, from a \ncatalog, and the local store, and making sure that States are able, if \nthey wish, to treat all businesses in the same way. That is why so many \nconservative leaders, as they have understood this bill, have come to \nsupport it.\n  This is a rarity in the Senate. This is an 11-page bill. Some people \nsay it has been rushed. I wish to respectfully disagree with that. This \nlegislation was introduced beginning in 2001. It was introduced in \nalmost exactly the same form in 2011. It had a full hearing in the \nSenate Commerce Committee in 2011 in almost the same form of the 11-\npage bill that is before us today. Exactly this bill was filed on \nFebruary 14, 2013, so everyone has had plenty of time to read it since \nFebruary 14.\n  This is a bill that has been here for a long time, and the reason it \nis before us and hasn't come through the Finance Committee is because \nthe Finance Committee simply wouldn't hear it, act on it, and report \nit. We have a chance to amend it. The majority leader has said there \nwill be amendments. It is my hope that Senators will come to the floor \nwith their amendments as early as this afternoon. I hope Senators would \nwant to keep amendments aimed at the subject of the debate, the \nmarketplace fairness debate. There are many issues that have been \nraised. Let's bring them up, let's debate them, and let's vote on them. \nThat is what we do when we are acting properly in the Senate.\n\n  I mentioned some of the conservative leaders who have talked about \nthis issue. William F. Buckley, before he died, talked about the \nunfairness of treating instate sellers one way and out-of-State sellers \nanother way. Another leading advocate for the idea of marketplace \nfairness is Al Cardenas, who is chairman of the American Conservative \nUnion. He has written eloquently about it.\n  Former Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor Mitch Daniels, Governor \nMike Pence, the Congressman from Indiana--these are leading \nconservatives on the Republican side. They have all said if Congress \ndoes not act, it freezes into place a system that picks and chooses \namong winners and losers, that treats one taxpayer one way and one \nbusiness another way. That is not a good principle. That is not a good \nconservative principle at all. That is why so many of the Republican \nGovernors, the Republican leaders--Art Laffer, President Reagan's \nfavorite economist and distinguished writer, wrote in the Wall Street \nJournal last week that it would actually help economic growth if States \nwere permitted to collect taxes from all of the people who owe it \nrather than some of the people who owe it. Mr. Laffer said, and I am \nparaphrasing, that the best tax policy is one that, when there has to \nbe a tax, taxes the largest number of people at the lowest possible \nrate.\n  Governor Haslam of Tennessee, Governor Otter of Idaho, many of the \nGovernors have said if we have the opportunity to collect the taxes \nfrom everybody who already owes them, we have in mind a tax rate we \nwould like to lower. We would like to have a lower sales tax rate in \nTennessee. We don't like a 10-percent tax rate. One reason we have it \nis because some people do not pay it even though they owe it. The \nreason they do not pay it is because out-of-State sellers--catalog, \nonline--many of them do not collect it as others will do.\n  I think that is a summary of the legislation before us. It is about \nStates rights. It is an 11-page bill. It has been before the Senate for \nmonths. The idea has been before the Senate for years. It does not seek \nto tell any State to do anything.\n  New Hampshire does not have a sales tax. After this law is passed New \nHampshire citizens will not have to pay a sales tax. If a New Hampshire \ncompany or Michigan company sells in Tennessee they will have to do \nwhat Tennessee companies do, or anybody else who sells in Tennessee \nwill have to collect the tax and send it to the State government--or \nnot sell. But unlike 20 years ago, that is pretty easy today. As I have \nsaid, it is as easy as putting in a ZIP code and finding out the \nweather. One can compute the tax the same way I found out what my ice \ncream ingredients from Williams-Sonoma cost and what the tax was, and \nin the same way I paid that tax.\n  I look forward to the debate. I hope we can enact this bill. We have \nhad 2 good votes: one at 74 votes and one at 75 votes. A majority of \nDemocrats supported each vote. A majority of Republicans supported each \nvote. There is substantial support in the House of Representatives. \nThis is an important States rights piece of legislation. It is part of \nour job to simplify things and not to require States to play ``Mother \nmay I?'' with Congress about what their tax structure ought to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2863-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2863-S2864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FISHING BARRIERS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, seeing no other Senator here, I would \nlike to turn to another matter. In his biography of Thomas Jefferson, \nJon Meacham writes that Jefferson liked to fish. Jefferson ``had a \nfavorite spot,'' Meacham writes, ``below the old dam on the Rivanna \nRiver.'' Thomas Jefferson, if he were alive, would be pleased to know \nAmericans followed his example. Americans like to fish, and in \nTennessee we have nearly 900,000 Tennesseans who bought fishing \nlicenses last year, and they like to fish below the dams just like \nPresident Jefferson liked to do because they know that is where the \nfishing is sometimes the best.\n  That is why there is such an uproar in Tennessee and in Kentucky and \nfrom fishermen all over the country about the unreasonable obstinance \nof the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in seeking to put up physical \nbarriers to fishing below the 10 dams on the Cumberland River.\n  The Corps of Engineers is an honorable institution. The flooding \nseason is upon us, and we all remember the terrific job they did last \nyear and the year before when we had such serious floods along the \nMississippi. We are grateful to them for that. But for whatever reason, \nthe Corps of Engineers is rejecting every reasonable proposal from the \nStates of Tennessee and Kentucky to say let us work with you to ensure \nsafety below the dams on the Cumberland River in a way that continues \nto allow fishing when it is safe and that allows us to attract the jobs \ninto our area.\n  Senator Corker, Senator McConnell, Senator Paul, Congressman \nWhitfield, Congressman Cooper, Congresswoman Blackburn--we have all \nintroduced legislation we call the Freedom to Fish Act. I met with \nevery general and colonel I could find. I even talked to the Secretary \nof the Army and said: What in the world are you doing here? On these 10 \ndams ever since they have been built in the 1960s, people have been \nfishing there with their children and grandchildren. Some of the most \nardent fisherman are retired Army Corps of Engineers people.\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\n  They always come back and say: We have to ensure public safety. Of \ncourse they have to ensure public safety, but there are various ways to \ndo that. They do not have to put up physical barriers across the dam. \nSo they are on a path to take $2.6 million, during a time of sequester, \nthat is needed for other projects to build these monstrosities across \nthe river below these 10 dams.\n  Up to now it has been mostly those of us in Congress who registered \nthe complaints of the men and women who like to fish. I went to a rally \nat Old Hickory Lake about a month ago. There were a lot of people \nthere. They were not of any particular party, I would say. They were \ntea party, environmentalist, outdoors men and women, retired Corps of \nEngineers people, a lot of grandparents--people were mad because they \nfished there with their grandchildren and wanted to keep doing it. Then \nI went up to Kentucky to Lake Barkley a week ago with Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Paul, and Congressman Whitfield and found the same \nsort of thing there.\n\n  The argument is that it is unsafe. Of course it is unsafe when the \nwater is spilling through the dam. That is about 20 percent of the \ntime. The rest of the time it is safe. Restricting fishing below the \ndams 100 percent of the time when it is only dangerous 20 percent of \nthe time is like keeping the crossing gate down over the railroad track \n100 percent of the time. We could do that. I think we have nearly \n130,000 railroad crossings, but if we had a gate down on them all the \ntime we could never go anywhere. People expect drivers to have enough \nsense to stay off the track when the train is coming. The track is not \ndangerous when the train is not coming and the water is not dangerous \nfor fishing when it is not spilling through the dam.\n  One reason we are outdoorsmen in this country--and the great American \noutdoors is a part of the American character and our ethic--is we want \nto go outside and evaluate the risk. We want to be on our own. We want \nto be able to make decisions. We don't want a government that is so all \npowerful and all knowing that it makes it risk free when we go into the \ngreat American outdoors.\n  Now we have an additional voice that comes from the Democratic side \nof the aisle, and more important from the legal side. The Corps of \nEngineers, in talking with me, said: You know, we have legal liability. \nHere is an article that was in the Tennessean yesterday about the \ncomments of Jerry Martin, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of \nTennessee, who retired last week. He was appointed by President Obama \nas a leading Democrat in the area. This is the U.S. attorney position \nthat was first held by Andrew Jackson at one time. This is what the \narticle said:\n\n       Responding to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' proposal to \n     limit fishing on dams along the Cumberland River and its \n     tributaries in Kentucky, former U.S. Attorney Jerry Martin \n     said that the Corps' plan is not worth the effort.\n       Martin, who just weeks ago would have been responsible with \n     carrying out the Corps' wishes, said the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority's siren system, which goes off when water is \n     released from the dams, is enough to ensure public safety.\n       The Corps has proposed barriers along the river that would \n     limit fishing access, citing safety concerns. Detractors say \n     the move could cost millions of tourism dollars every year.\n\n  ``These waters belong to the citizens,'' Martin, who was appointed by \nPresident Barack Obama in 2010, said in a prepared statement. ``In \nlight of the tremendous protection from liability enjoyed by the Corps, \nI don't think it's reasonable for the Corps to ban everyone at all \ntimes from these public places.\n  I am concluding my remarks because I see the Senator from Wyoming has \narrived.\n  Let's stop and think about this a minute. The Corps of Engineers now \nalready has everybody in Tennessee of any political stripe saying: You \nare taking an unreasonable step. They have the wildlife agencies of \nTennessee and Kentucky saying: We would like to work with you to help \nyou do a better job of ensuring safety below the dams when the water is \nspilling through the dams, which is 20 percent of the time. We have the \nTennessee Valley Authority with dams on the Tennessee River, which \nmakes the Cumberland look like a stream, and the TVA allows fishing \nbelow the dams. It has sirens, it has signs, it has whistles. It \nassumes people are wise enough not to roll up just below the dam when \nthe water is spilling through it. Just like we assume we are wise \nenough, if we put on a siren and put on the red lights, not to sit on \nthe railroad tracks when a train is coming.\n  Now the former lawyer who would have been responsible for defending \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a liability case says:\n\n       These waters belong to the citizens. In light of the \n     tremendous protection from liability enjoyed by the Corps, I \n     do not believe it is reasonable for the Corps to ban everyone \n     at all times from these public places.\n\n  I call on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to recognize the voices of \nthe people of our country--all over the country--who fish below these \ndams and accept the offer of the two States, Kentucky and Tennessee, to \nwork with the corps to develop a reasonable attitude, a reasonable way \nof ensuring public safety for fishing below the dams. That is our \nopinion. We will pass a law to make it happen if we have to, but given \nthe statement, especially of the retired U.S. attorney, Jerry Martin, \nwho would have been the corps's lawyer in defending lawsuits about \nthis, the corps needs to change its mind, act reasonably, and spend \nthat $2.6 million on some more needed project.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2864-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2864-S2865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, recently the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Kathleen Sebelius, gave a speech in which she said she \ndidn't realize how complicated it would be to implement the President's \nhealth care law. She didn't attribute this to all of the flaws that all \nof us know are in the law. The only problems she could see were \nbecause, she said, of Republican opposition.\n  Here is how one newspaper, Investor's Business Daily, described it: \n``Blaming GOP for ObamaCare.''\n  The article goes through a list of problems with the law saying it is \nand it continues to be ``unpopular,'' ``expensive,'' ``ill-conceived'' \nand ``poorly written.''\n  Democrats in Congress and the administration do not seem to be \ninterested in admitting that there are flaws in their law. They are \nonly interested in trying to make sure someone else takes the blame for \ntheir huge mistake. The question is, Are Republicans opposed to this \nlaw? Of course we are because it is a terrible law. Democrats know how \nmuch of a mess this law is too. Some of them are even finally willing \nto admit it.\n  Last week the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on President \nObama's budget for the next fiscal year. Secretary Sebelius testified \nat that hearing. I wish to read from an article in The Hill newspaper \nabout what happened. The article is entitled: ``Baucus warns of `huge \ntrain wreck' in enacting ObamaCare provisions.'' A huge train wreck. \nThe article identifies Senator Baucus as ``a key architect of the \nPresident's health care law'' and quotes him telling Secretary \nSebelius: ``I just see a huge train wreck coming down.'' He added: \n``You and I have discussed this many times, and I don't see any results \nyet.''\n  It also quotes the Senator saying: ``Small businesses have no idea \nwhat to do, what to expect.''\n  I agree with Senator Baucus. Businesses do have no idea what to \nexpect, and this health care law is a train wreck.\n  So what does this mean in the real world? It is causing businesses to \navoid hiring or to cut back hours. There are new headlines on this \nevery day. Here is what one said last week: ``Nation's biggest movie \ntheater chain cuts workweek, blaming ObamaCare.''\n  Regal entertainment has more than 500 movie theaters in 38 different \nStates. Last month it began cutting shifts for employees to 30 hours a \nweek. That is the cutoff under the health care law where an employer \nhas to provide health insurance. The company sent out a memo to its \nemployees explaining why it had to cut shifts. It said:\n\n       To comply with the Affordable Care Act, Regal had to \n     increase our health care budget to cover those newly deemed \n     eligible based on the law's definition of a full time \n     employee.\n\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\n\n  One theater manager said they have had a wave of resignations from \nmanagers who have seen their hours cut by 25 percent.\n  He said:\n\n       In the last couple of weeks, managers have been quitting on \n     a daily basis from various locations to try and find full-\n     time work. Mandating businesses to offer health care under \n     threat of debilitating fines doesn't fix the problem, it \n     creates one.\n\n  We already had 22 million people in this country who either can't \nfind a job or can't find the full-time work they want. Now we have even \nmore hard-working Americans whose hours are being cut because of the \nunreasonable burdens of the President's health care law. That is what \nthis law does to jobs in America. That is what the coming health care \ntrain wreck looks like.\n  Here is another headline, this one from the New York Times over the \nweekend. It is on page 1. At the top of the page is the news about the \ncapture of the second bomber. At the bottom of page 1: ``Part-Time Work \nBecomes Full-Time Waits for Better Job.'' Part-time work is a full-time \nwait for a better job. The article talks about exactly this problem of \npeople who want full-time work but can only find part-time work.\n  The article specifically cites the health care law as a reason why so \nmany people are having trouble. It quotes one economist saying:\n\n       There is another reason to believe that part-time \n     employment will stay higher for longer, namely, the \n     incentives to employ part-time workers created by Obama's \n     health care reforms.\n\n  The article goes on to add: ``Confusion about the law and its \nrequirements abounds.''\n  That is the same point Senator Baucus made. Businesses don't know \nwhat to expect, people don't know what is going to happen and it is \nhurting families and it is holding down our economy. Again, that is \nwhat the health care train wreck looks like.\n  The train wreck also means the health care law is going to be very \nhard on family finances. It is going to increase how much people have \nto spend for insurance and care. A study by the Society of Actuaries \nsays costs for health claims will go up an average of 32 percent--a 32-\npercent average increase across the country. Those higher costs are \ngoing to be passed along to consumers. That means more money out of the \npockets of hard-working people, and that is going to be money they \ncan't afford to lose right now.\n  We got another sign of the coming health care train wreck when \nPresident Obama finally released his budget for the next fiscal year. \nOf course, it came in over 2 months late. That is later than any other \nPresident who was already in office at the beginning of the year.\n  Why did it take so long? President Obama certainly didn't use the \nextra time to come up with any sort of a plan to stabilize the Nation's \nfinances. Instead, he continues to add to the debt burden of America's \nchildren and makes it harder for Americans of all ages to achieve their \ndreams. Deficits continue far into the future. The President also \noffered no real entitlement reform and no plan to grow America's \nstagnant economy. President Obama is truly budgeting from behind.\n  What is interesting about his budget, though, is not just how late it \nis; it isn't just what that says about the lack of leadership from the \nWhite House. What is also very interesting is what this budget says \nabout the coming train wreck of the President's own health care law.\n  The train wreck is coming not just because the President's health \ncare law is unaffordable for families; it is also unaffordable for the \ntaxpayers of this country. The President's budget fails to slow down \nWashington spending, but it is also dishonest about how much of a \nbudget buster his health care law will be.\n  In fact, the administration has used a lot of smoke and mirrors to \ntry to hide the true costs of the health care law. Here is how the \nAssociated Press put it. They ran an article entitled ``Tracking \nObama's health law in budget isn't easy.'' The article points out that \nthe President's budget includes no chapter, no table, not even a \nmention of what all the health care spending adds up to.\n  This Associated Press article quotes Bill Hoagland, who is a senior \nvice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He says: ``I'm sure \nsomebody has a spreadsheet somewhere, but clearly they are not \npublishing it in this budget.''\n\n  The Obama administration knows that if they spelled out exactly how \nmuch this law is costing, the American people would be outraged.\n  So what do we know about the cost of the health care law? We know the \nPresident wants almost $975 billion for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services next year. It is a budget increase of over $100 billion \nsince just last year--an 11.5-percent increase. The health care law was \nsupposed to help slow down the growth in spending. Instead, it is using \ntaxpayer dollars to fuel the fire, and it is powering us toward the \ncoming train wreck faster than ever.\n  Part of the money would go to pay for 3,000 more Washington \nbureaucrats at Health and Human Services. That kind of increase in \nWashington spending is not something the American people need, and it \nis not anywhere close to what we as a nation can afford.\n  In another part of the budget, it says Washington needs $32 billion \nto pay for what the administration calls premium assistance credits. \nThose are the subsidies to help people pay for the new insurance they \nare going to have to get under the President's health care law. That is \ntaking $32 billion from taxpayers to help hide how unaffordable this \nhealth care law is for families. The President says that 10 years from \nnow this $32 billion will grow to $118 billion a year. That is a train \nwreck.\n  What else does the President want? He wants $772 million for \nadministrative costs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \nThat is going to pay for more than 4,600 bureaucrats.\n  When I talk to people about their health care concerns, nobody has \never told me--and I am a doctor; I have practiced for over two decades \nin Wyoming and I was home this weekend at a health care fair--nobody \nhas ever told me the problem is we don't have enough Washington \nbureaucrats. I have never heard that, not even once.\n  Still, that is exactly what we are going to get under the President's \nbudget and under this health care law: costs going up instead of down; \ndebt going up, not down; the Washington bureaucracy getting bigger and \nbigger. That is a train wreck.\n  The President's budget also asks for $440 million for the IRS to \nadminister the health care law. That is $440 million the IRS would not \nneed if Democrats had not forced this law on the American people. The \nInternal Revenue Service is going to need 1,954 more employees just to \nimplement the health care law, not more doctors, not more nurses--1,954 \nmore IRS employees. That is just the beginning of what the agency is \ngoing to be asking for in the next few years. We are going to see an \narmy of new IRS agents and auditors to investigate the health insurance \nchoices of Americans and their families.\n  The Obama administration isn't worried about all that power in the \nhands of those IRS agents. It is not worried about how unaffordable the \nhealth care law is for taxpayers. The only thing this administration \nseems to worry about is who is going to take the blame for the train \nwreck we all know is coming right around the corner.\n  The President's health care law is bad for our economy, it is bad for \nconsumers, it is bad for patients, and it is bad for the health care \nproviders of our Nation.\n  Now the President's budget makes clear his health care law is also \nvery bad for hard-working American taxpayers. The people wanted real \nhealth care reform, but Washington Democrats instead gave them a train \nwreck.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 743, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 41, \n     S. 743, a bill to restore States' sovereign rights to enforce \n     State and local sales and use tax laws, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to speak on this bill. It is called \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act. It will not do anything but damage to the \nmarketplace, in my opinion.\n  This bill will impose new burdens on our small businesses. Let me \nrepeat that. It will place new burdens on our small businesses. I have \nheard folks come to the floor and talk about how great this is going to \nbe for small businesses. This is going to be terrible for small \nbusinesses. Small businesses are going to have to bring on more people. \nThis is going to be more bureaucracy, with more accountants, more \nlawyers. This should be called the bill to employ more attorneys and \nmore CPAs.\n  The fact is, I do not think the attorneys want this kind of work, nor \ndo the CPAs want this kind of work, because what it will do is \nfundamentally alter the rights of States by allowing them to tax \nentities outside their borders.\n  Who is put at risk by this? Small businesses. If the small business \nscrews up, by the way, they are the ones who are held accountable. We \ntalk about this big old database out there that these folks are going \nto be able to dub into to determine what the sales tax is for a single \nentity of the 9,600 cities and States and municipalities that collect \nsales tax. If the business gets it wrong, they are the ones that have \nthe penalty. I am going to tell you that small businesses are not that \nprofitable to be able to go through this kind of an exercise.\n  In Montana we are in a little different situation. In Montana our \nbudget has a surplus because we have handled our money wisely. \nMontanans do not pay a sales tax, we do not have a sales tax, and the \npeople of the State of Montana have twice voted against having one. But \nour budget continues to operate with a surplus without that sales tax.\n  Now we are going to have other States balance their budgets on the \nbacks of Montana's hard-working small businesses. It is wrong and, \nquite frankly, it is insulting. In fact, Virginia--right close here--\nhas already counted these funds as part of their budgeting for a new \ntransportation plan.\n  I would say this is bad policy that I hope--I know what the cloture \nvote was yesterday--people take a look at because this is not the \ndirection this body should be going. At a bare minimum, we should send \nthis bill to committee and let the Finance Committee deal with it.\n  This has some real problems. It has real problems from an \nimplementation standpoint. If we go down this road, it is a very \nslippery slope; it is going to create more bureaucracy; it is going to \ncreate more burdens for small businesses, including new liabilities for \nincorrectly collecting this sales tax, as I talked about before.\n  There are 9,600--let me say it again--there are 9,600 cities, States, \nand municipalities that collect taxes--different taxes: higher taxes on \ncandy than in a different jurisdiction, sometimes no taxes on food. The \nlist goes on and on and on.\n  It also leaves questions unanswered about how this could impose new \ntaxes on financial transactions and 401(k) plans. It is bad policy.\n  What businesses will out-of-State tax collectors go after next? It is \nan aberration of States rights--rights which so many in this Chamber \nhave supported.\n  It is a situation where we are going down a road that, quite frankly, \nwe have not gone down before from a States rights standpoint. If we do \nthis, I think it opens a Pandora's box, so to speak, as to new rules, \nnew laws that potentially come down, using this as a basis for it.\n  As I said before, I empathize with the situation of States that have \nhad their budgets underwater. But they ought not be looking at other \nStates' small businesses--in our case Montana's small businesses--to \nget their budgets in balance.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. It would gut \nStates rights. It would impose new tax burdens on small businesses and \nmiddle-class Americans. Quite frankly, this is bad policy, and we \nshould not be passing bad policy around here.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation that \nis on the floor, the Marketplace Fairness Act. I rise as someone who \nhas spent 20 years in the technology business helping to fund and \ndevelop online businesses, understanding the importance they play to \nour economy, and applaud the enormous growth of Internet-based \nbusinesses.\n  But I also rise in support of this legislation, because in addition \nto being a technology investor, I also was a Governor and know the \nimportance that sales tax plays in funding so many critical State and \nlocal functions. Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, we \nhave an uneven playing field because local small businesses, oftentimes \nbricks and mortar, follow the law and collect sales taxes from \ncustomers who make purchases in their stores while, on the other hand, \nmany large online businesses that may be located or domiciled in some \nother State do not collect the same sales taxes. I think on this floor \nalready we have heard repeated stories of some online retailers that \neven encourage people to go to the brick-and-mortar store to look, go \nout and price a product and then go back and go online and purchase \nthat product. Not only does that discriminate against the brick-and-\nmortar store, but from a public policy standpoint, if these sales taxes \nare not collected, it creates an unlevel playing field between the \nonline vendor and the brick-and-mortar store.\n  This legislation will help level the playing field. It is about \nfairness. It is about having a level playing field for all types of \nretail outlets. Let me make clear, all it simply does is require every \nbusiness to collect and remit an already legal sales tax that has been \nput in place at a State or local level.\n  Because of this unequal playing field, because of current \ncircumstances, because there has been a failure amongst many of our \nonline vendors to collect these sales taxes, this creates a direct and \nimmediate impact on State and local governments. As a former Governor, \nI can tell you the inability of States and localities to gather \nuncollected revenues undermines dramatically their ability to invest in \nK-12 education, police and fire prevention, funding for roads and \nbridges, public safety, environmental causes. You name it, all the \nbasic core services that State and local governments perform, so many \nof them are directly funded in a major way by local or State sales \ntaxes.\n  I would also like to mention how important this bill is to the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. Most recently in the Commonwealth, Virginia's \nleadership, with a Republican Governor and a bipartisan legislature, \nfinally enacted legislation to make significant investments in our \noutdated and overstressed transportation network. Many of the folks \nwork on the Hill or those of my colleagues who happen to live in \nVirginia know that traffic in Northern Virginia is at an almost \ndebilitating point. We have finally in Virginia passed a funding source \nto try to address the transportation needs of Virginia.\n  Part of this solution, though, anticipates revenue from this \nlegislation. So if we are going to be able to solve the transportation \ncrisis that confronts not just Northern Virginia but all of Virginia, \nVirginia has to have the ability to collect all of its sale tax \nrevenue. This is a large amount. The current uncollected amount of \nsales tax revenue in Virginia is estimated to be $422 million over the \npast year.\n  That number is going to continue to increase as more and more vendors \ngo\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nonline. Nationally, the amount is a staggering $23 billion. Again, as I \nmentioned earlier, at a time when our States and municipalities are \nstruggling to maintain essential core services or government, I think \nit is irresponsible of us at the Congressional level to, in effect, \ninterfere or not allow these States and localities to collect sales \ntaxes that they have put in place, that are collected from vendors that \nare in their communities but not certain vendors who operate online.\n  I would like to take a moment also to address a couple of the \nconcerns I have heard from my community in Virginia. I say there are \nways to improve this bill. I am grateful the Northern Virginia \ntechnology community is generally supportive of this legislation. They \nhave raised some concerns, concerns I would like to address.\n  First, there is discussion about the small seller exemption. The \ncurrent legislation says that those small sellers online that have less \nthan $1 million in sales will be exempted from this regulation. It is \nimportant that a startup business gets going online, that we do not put \nundue bureaucratic and other restrictions in place. There have been \nsome suggestions that that $1 million small seller exemption is too \nsmall. I think perhaps looking at a slightly higher number may make \nsome sense.\n  But there have been some who suggested we would take this number all \nthe way up to $15 million. I have to tell you, I believe taking the \nsmall seller exemption up to $15 million per year in revenues would \ndramatically undermine this legislation and dramatically cut back the \n$422 million Virginia has left on the table and the $23 billion that is \nestimated to be left nationally.\n  So, yes, we can look at something a little larger than $1 million but \nto go up to $15 million would be much too high.\n  Second, I think there have been reasonable questions about how to \nmake sure, where we are going to create an audit trail, and where we \nare going to allow those vendors to remit back, not to the literally \nhundreds of jurisdictions that collect these kind of taxes but to be \nable to simply remit to a single point of contact.\n  I think the legislation moves forward in this direction. I again \nwould look at other opportunities. On the issues of remittance, the \nlegislation does put in place a requirement that every State would have \na single point of remittance, which I think strikes the right kind of \nbalance needed to not create an undue burden.\n  On the question of audits, I think there is more work that can be \ndone. I believe there is an analogy here to the telecommunications \nindustry I used to be part of. In the early days of the cell phone \nindustry, there were clearinghouses that were allowed to, in effect, be \nthe settlement agencies between a variety of competing cell phone \nsystems when we were charged roaming charges. I think we can look to \nsome examples in that industry and others to make sure that in a look-\nback basis, there is an ability to have a single point of audit so \nthose vendors, particularly small vendors, make sure they get a fair \nshake.\n\n  Finally, I think we need to make sure that, particularly for these \nsmaller vendors, we do all we can to make it easy for them to comply \nwith the law. I am pleased this legislation requires States to make \navailable, at no cost to retailers, common software that will basically \ncalculate the State and local sales tax requirements for any of these \nonline vendors, as well as kind of build in some of the administrative \nservices. I think this is an important step to make sure we continue to \nallow the entrepreneurial spirit to grow online as well as in the local \ncommunity.\n  Again, I think it is terribly important to remember that all we are \ndoing in this legislation is making sure there is a process in place to \ncollect sales taxes that are already due.\n  Two final comments before I yield the floor. During the course of \nthis debate, some opponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act have made \nstatements about what this bill might possibly do that I do not think \nare reflected in the legislation.\n  Among those claims, there is a claim that this bill is the first step \ntoward a State or local transaction tax on the purchase of stocks or \nderivative contracts. I have reviewed this legislation closely. There \nis nothing in this legislation that would make it be the first step on \na slippery slope toward a transaction tax. There is nothing in this \nbill that would prohibit that kind of tax. States already have that \nability. This legislation will do nothing to take a step toward that. \nSo I think that claim being made by some is not accurate and does not \nreflect the legislation.\n  Finally, this legislation comes about because at the beginning of the \ndevelopment of online sales, there was a belief, perhaps accurate at \nthat moment in time, that this growing industry of online retailers \nneeded an extra little benefit, an extra little head start, an ability \nto have this industry not be squashed at its outset. I think history \nhas shown, as we have seen the growth of retail sales online go up \ndramatically, faster than the growth of retail sales in bricks and \nmortar, that whatever needed boost the online industry might have \nneeded at some point, that they now have become an extraordinarily \nimportant and successful part of our economy.\n  I commend all those and many other companies I had the ability to \nhelp fund when I was in the private sector. I welcome their success. \nOnline businesses continue to be one of the areas for most \nentrepreneurial activity. I commend those efforts. But I do believe, in \n2013, we do not need to perpetuate what has become at this point an \nunlevel playing field.\n  I believe the Marketplace Fairness Act will correct that unfairness, \ncorrect this unlevel playing field. I was pleased to see the \noverwhelming bipartisan majority that voted to invoke cloture. I hope \nthis week we will be able to finish considering this bill, get it \npassed, and get it sent over to the House.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Boston Bombing\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of \nmisunderstanding about the position the Senator from South Carolina, I, \nand others have taken on the detention and interrogation of the suspect \nin the Boston bombing. None of us is saying the suspect should be \nindefinitely detained as an enemy combatant by the U.S. military or \ntried in a military tribunal. The suspect is a U.S. citizen and must be \ntreated accordingly, and he will be. What we are saying is that the \nimportance of treating the suspect in accordance with his rights as an \nAmerican citizen must be balanced with our government's top national \nsecurity priority, which is the lawful, effective, and humane \ninterrogation of this subject for the purposes of gathering \nintelligence.\n  The Boston attacks were clearly inspired by the violent ideology of \ntransnational Islamist terrorism. We need to learn everything we can \nabout what foreign terrorists or terrorist groups the suspect and his \nbrother may have associated with, whether they were part of additional \nplots to attack our Nation, and what other relevant information the \nsuspect may possess that could prevent future attacks against the \nUnited States or our interests.\n  We need to delve further into this whole issue of the education some \npeople who are motivated by these base ideologies obtain over the \nInternet and the effect it is having. We should at least know about \nthis.\n  Our civilian justice system offers a responsible option for striking \nthis balance with American citizens. It allows the Justice Department \nto delay reading a suspect his Miranda rights if doing so is in the \ninterest of ``public safety.'' The administration had rightly invoked \nthis public safety exception in the case of the Boston suspect, which \nprovided our national security professionals a discrete period of time \nto gather intelligence from the suspect without the presence of his \nlawyer.\n  However, soon after questioning him in this manner, the \nadministration recently reversed itself and read the suspect his \nMiranda rights. In doing so, the administration gave up a valuable \nopportunity to lawfully and thoroughly\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nquestion the suspect for purposes of gathering intelligence about \npotential future terrorist plots. Whether we will be able to acquire \nsuch information has now been left entirely at the discretion of the \nsuspect and his lawyer. Put simply, the suspect has been told he has \nthe right to remain silent. If he doesn't want to provide intelligence, \nhe doesn't need to.\n  Is this a responsible balance between a citizen's rights and our \nnational security? The suspect had only been responsive for a couple of \ndays before he was read his Miranda rights. Even then, he could not \ncommunicate verbally. Does anyone really believe our national security \nprofessionals were able to acquire all of the relevant intelligence \npossessed by a subject who couldn't speak in only 2 days? This is not a \nresponsible balance between civil liberties and national security.\n  From the very beginning of this debate, the Senator from South \nCarolina, the Senator from New Hampshire, I, and others have maintained \nthat the administration should reserve its right to hold the suspect as \nan enemy combatant for the purpose of gathering intelligence. This was \nnot the only option or even the ideal option. In light of the \nadministration's decision not to continue questioning the suspect under \nthe public safety exception, the only option we are left with is \nlawfully questioning the suspect as a potential enemy combatant.\n  The full extent of whether the suspect is linked to al-Qaida or its \nassociated forces remains unclear. The brother's trip to Russia \ncertainly should be the subject of an inquiry. Additional questioning \nis critical to making it clear.\n  Today there is ample evidence that would allow the administration to \nquestion the suspect for key intelligence. The consequence of not doing \nso is that our need to question the suspect for such intelligence is \nleft solely at his discretion and willingness to cooperate. This is not \na responsible approach to the national security of this country.\n  Again, this is not to say that we must hold the suspect indefinitely \nin military detention, nor that the suspect must be or should be tried \nin a military tribunal. In both cases, there is plenty of precedence \nfor holding a terrorism suspect as an enemy combatant for a limited \ntime before moving him into the criminal justice system for the purpose \nof standing trial in civil court. What is more, the Supreme Court has \nconsistently upheld the legality and constitutionality of this \napproach, as well as the ability to hold American citizens as enemy \ncombatants. Ultimately, the broader question is whether one views the \nUnited States as part of the battlefield in the global fight against \nterrorists. I know some don't. I, however, do not see how we can avoid \nthis fact. Those who seek to attack us certainly view the homeland as \npart of the battlefield--indeed, the central part.\n  Of course, there will always be and should be differences in how we \nhandle events in the United States and events overseas and differences \nin what rights are due to American citizens as opposed to foreign \ncitizens. Yet we cannot afford to build a wall between the fight \nagainst terrorists abroad and the fight against terrorists who are \ntrying to attack us here at home, including when American citizens are \ninvolved in this fight, as some clearly are, and will continue to be.\n  Just because some don't seem to want to grapple with the difficult, \nunprecedented legal issues this war presents does not mean they will \ncease to be real challenges. If we pretend the homeland, the United \nStates of America, is not part of this battle, I believe it will only \nbe a matter of time before we learn this lesson the hard way.\n  I say to many who are reporting on this issue, I hope it is clearly \nunderstood that we are not saying the suspect should be indefinitely \ndetained as an enemy combatant by the U.S. military or tried in a \nmilitary tribunal. The suspect is a U.S. citizen and must be treated \naccordingly, and he will be.\n  During the now-famous discussion of 13 hours on the floor of the \nSenate, there were certain comments made that I think are important to \nrecall.\n\n       The battlefield coming to America or acknowledging that is \n     an enormous mistake.\n\n  I am quoting from the debate that took place.\n\n       Alarm bells should go off when people tell you that the \n     battlefield's in America.\n       I'm here to argue that we can't let America be a \n     battlefield because we can't say that we're no longer going \n     to have due process, that we're no longer going to have trial \n     by jury, that we're no longer going to have presentment of \n     charges in grand juries. It is impossible in a battlefield.\n\n  This is another quote:\n\n       [W]hen people say, oh, the battlefield's come to America \n     and the battlefield's every--where the war is limitless in \n     time and scope, be worried, because your rights will not \n     exist if you call America a battlefield for all time.\n\n  The Chair understands as well as anyone that the people of Boston and \nthe people of Massachusetts, of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \nwould clearly take exception to a statement such as ``the battlefield \ncoming to America or acknowledging that is an enormous mistake.'' The \npeople of Boston are very well aware that the battle comes to the \nUnited States. There are many attempts for it to come to the United \nStates. Tragically, it came to the United States of America in a most \ntragic and terrible way.\n  We need to have a larger debate here about the location of the \nbattlefield. To somehow believe the ultimate target of these radical \nIslamic extremists and other extremist elements is not the United \nStates of America is a gross misreading of what this fight against \nterrorism is all about.\n  Quoting from a Wall Street Journal editorial, as I have done in the \npast:\n\n       The Boston bombing also ought to chasten libertarians who \n     keep insisting that the U.S. homeland is not part of the \n     terror battlefield.\n       ``It's different overseas than it will be here. It's \n     different in the battlefield than it will be here,'' [one \n     Member] told Fox News earlier this year. ``Which gets \n     precisely to the argument I have with some other Republicans \n     who say, well, `the battlefield is everywhere. There is no \n     limitation.' President Obama says this. Some members of my \n     party say the battle has no geographic limitations and the \n     laws of war apply. It's important to know that the law of war \n     that they're talking about means no due process.''\n       Boylston Street looked like a boulevard on Monday, and so \n     did Watertown on Thursday night. The artificial distinction \n     [arises from undue] focus on geography. The vital distinction \n     for public safety is between common criminals, who deserve \n     due process protections, and enemy combatants at war with the \n     U.S., wherever they are.\n       As for due process, the greatest danger to liberty would be \n     to allow more such attacks that would inspire an even greater \n     public backlash against Muslims or free speech or worse. The \n     anti-terror types on the left and GOP Senators who agree that \n     the U.S. isn't part of the battlefield are making the United \n     States more vulnerable.\n       Americans erupted in understandable relief and gratitude on \n     Friday with the rapid capture of the terrorist brothers. But \n     we shouldn't forget that their attack succeeded, with \n     horrific consequences for the dead, the wounded and their \n     loved ones. The main goal now is to prevent the next attack.\n\n  How do we prevent the next attack? We find out as much information as \npossible as to what motivated this attack.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South \nCarolina be included in the colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We wish to make sure our position is very clear. We are \nnot saying the subject should be indefinitely detained by the U.S. \nmilitary or tried in a military tribunal. The suspect is a U.S. citizen \nand must be treated accordingly, and he will be.\n  The tragic events we saw in Boston bring home again that this fight \nis far from over. I don't know if these young men were motivated by the \ninformation they received, whether it was overseas or whether it was \ndue to the Internet and various influences there. What we do know is \nthat while living in this country, they changed from apparently normal \nyoung people into terrorists who were willing to do anything to take \nthe lives of their fellow American citizens.\n  The battlefield is the United States of America. Anyone who doesn't \nbelieve this ignores the events from which we are recovering.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina, who has probably been \nmore widely quoted than I have, and request that he clear up this exact \nsituation we are calling for which, frankly, is being portrayed \ninaccurately in a great deal of the media.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Very simply put, I have two goals. I think Americans\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\nwant two things to happen in this case. They want the surviving suspect \nto be brought to justice. I am glad he survived, as hopefully we may \nlearn some information from him that will make us all safer in the \nfuture. I am pleased he survived so we may try him in a court of law, \nbefore a Federal court in Massachusetts, to hold him accountable for \nhis crimes. In the trial, he will be given a lawyer. He has the right \nto remain silent. He will be tried by a jury. He will be given all the \nrights associated with a Federal court trial. He is an American \ncitizen, and we have never suggested otherwise.\n  As one of the primary authors of the 2009 Military Commissions Act, I \nexpressly exempted American citizens from military commission trials. \nWhy? I wanted to reserve that system for foreign terrorists. It doesn't \nmean I don't believe there will be domestic terrorism. It doesn't mean \nI don't envision an American citizen helping the foreign enemy. I do. \nEvery war, unfortunately, we have been in during the history of our \ncountry, American citizens have joined forces and sided with the enemy. \nThis is not an unusual event. What would be unusual is to say one could \ndo so and not be treated under the law of war. We would be making \nhistory if we adopted that view.\n  Let me begin with a case in World War II. German saboteurs landed in \nLong Island. They had been planning for years an effort to come to our \ncountry. These were Germans who had lived in our country and went back \nto Germany and became Nazis. Because they spoke good English, they were \nrecruited by the German intelligence service to come back and plan \nmassive attacks on our homeland.\n  They had a cell here in America, some of whom were American citizens \nwho joined the plot. Thanks to the great FBI work of this time and day, \nas soon as they landed the plot was foiled and the American citizens \nwere captured. In 1944, 1945, and possibly as late as 1946, the \nAmerican citizens who aided the German saboteurs were held as enemy \ncombatants and tried in a military court. Three of them were hanged.\n  The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court said: \nWhen you join the forces of our enemy, you are committing an act of \nwar, not a common crime.\n  Tokyo Rose sided with the Japanese. She was tried and given a life \nsentence. Since 9/11, there have been three American citizens who have \nbeen involved with al-Qaida or the Taliban or affiliated groups. They \nhave been held as enemy combatants. They have gone to trial in civilian \ncourt and the courts have blessed the holding of American citizens as \nenemy combatants.\n  Rumsfeld v. Hamdi was an American citizen captured in Afghanistan \nheld under the law of war as an enemy combatant. He was eventually \ntried and the Court said, as in World War II, we can hold one of our \nown as an enemy combatant, recognizing the difference between a common \ncrime and the law of war.\n  Mr. Padilla was held 4 years by the Bush administration. His case \nwent up to the Fourth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit said: Yes, you can \nhold enemy combatants off the battlefield. That is the power the United \nStates possesses at a time of war.\n  When you are fighting a war, the goal is to win the war and to find \nout about what the enemy is up to. When you are fighting a crime, the \ngoal is to convict someone or have them found innocent. They are two \ndifferent systems.\n  This young man will be going to Federal Court and a jury will decide \nif he is guilty of his crimes. What we are asking of the administration \nis: How do you gather intelligence in that system? It is not meant to \ngather intelligence. We don't want to limit ourselves as a Nation to \nasking questions about future attacks in the criminal justice system \nbecause here is the way that works. If I am his lawyer, I am not going \nto let you ask him any question about anything until I get a benefit \nfor my client. So intelligence gathering now is controlled by the \nterror suspect and his lawyer. Is that smart? Now you are having to \nplea bargain to get intelligence.\n  What we are saying is, conduct the trial in civilian court--the only \nform available--but because there are international terrorist \nconnections here--clearly they killed people in Boston not because they \nwanted their property or they were mad with the Boston city government, \nthey killed--they slaughtered a young boy and his family and others \nbecause they have adopted a radical jihadist view of us as a Nation. \nThe older brother was quoted as saying we are infidels, we are a \ncolonial Christian power, we have corrupted Islam. They are trying to \nkill us and destroy our way of life because of what we believe.\n  The sooner we understand that, the better off we will be.\n  Here is my view about defending ourselves as a Nation. A criminal \ncourt is about due process and giving the accused a fair trial. \nMilitary intelligence gathering is about defending the Nation at war. \nThe question we all have to answer for ourselves is: Is America at war? \nThe answer, to me, is yes. We are at war with a radical ideology that \nhates everything we stand for.\n  Bin Laden is dead. We celebrate that. But al-Qaida is very much on \nthe march. As a matter of fact, radical Islam is regenerating, and the \nway they are coming after us is to find people in our own backyard and \nturn them against us.\n  How could we have missed this? How could the intelligence services in \nRussia tell the FBI: You need to watch this guy; we believe he is a \nradical Islamist coming to your country to hurt you? How could we miss \nhim going to Russia and coming back? How could we miss his YouTube \nvideos where he is ranting and raving against us and threatening to \ntake us down as a Nation?\n  These are questions to be asked and answered. And here is what we are \nsuggesting: The surviving suspect, due to the ties these two have to \nradical Islamic thought, and the ties to Chechnya, one of the most \nradical regions in the world, the President should declare \npreliminarily that the evidence suggests this man should be treated as \nan enemy combatant. We could hold him for a period of time, question \nhim without a lawyer, and none of the evidence could be used against \nhim in the criminal proceeding. That is the best way to gather \nintelligence. The best way to gather intelligence is to have a rapport \nwith him, take down the stories he is telling us and deconstruct them; \nspend time with him outside the criminal justice system.\n  We have gathered so much good intelligence from enemy combatants at \nGuantanamo Bay. You won't send him to Guantanamo Bay, but during the \nlast decade we have exploited intelligence from enemy combatants--\npeople who have joined the other side--and it has helped us figure out \nhow to defend ourselves and find bin Laden.\n  All we are saying is when it comes to defending against future \nattacks, we want to talk to him without a lawyer. That is all we are \nsaying. We want to talk to him without a lawyer so we can find out what \nhe may know about what we face in the future, and when it comes to \nprosecuting him, we won't use anything we found against him. A first-\nyear law student could convict him, but, my God, look what we are \nlosing as a Nation by using this model. Instead of taking time out to \ninterrogate him without the presence of counsel to learn about what did \nhappen, we are now stuck in a criminal justice system where we can't \nask him one question his lawyer won't allow.\n  I am not blaming the lawyer. My goodness, if I were his defense \nlawyer, no one would ask him one thing without my permission, and they \nwould have to give a lot to get an answer to anything. All I am \nsuggesting is we are at war, these two people fit the profile of folks \nwho are trying to kill us, they are tied to overseas organizations \npotentially, so why in the world can't our country have some time with \nthis person in the national security legal system to find out about \nwhat he knows and how they planned this attack, to make the rest of us \nsafer.\n  I believe in due process. And he, in that system, can go to a judge \nand say, I am not an enemy combatant, and the government would have to \nprove he is. So he has due process there. But here is what I believe \ndeeply, and then I will turn it over to Senator Ayotte of New \nHampshire. I believe the closer one gets to our homeland, the more \nrights we have as a people to defend ourselves. I don't want a police \nstate. I don't want to live in a country where\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\nwe can't express who we are and what we believe in and to argue and \nhave a different view of religion. But, by God, given the times in \nwhich we live, I don't want to become deaf and blind to the threats \nthat are real in our own backyard. I want a system that can find out \nabout guys like this before they kill us.\n  Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, if we don't gather good \nintelligence and we don't hit them before they hit us, there is more to \ncome.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire be included in the colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my colleague for a comment on the issue of whether \nthe United States of America is a battlefield. Does my colleague agree \nwith the quote, ``The battlefield coming to America or acknowledging \nthat is an enormous mistake''?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Not only do I agree, who picked the battlefield? I didn't \npick America to be the battlefield. I don't want to be at war with \nanybody. They chose the battlefield.\n  Where do you think they want to hit us most, I ask Senator McCain? If \nyou could get the top leadership and give them one shot at America \nanywhere, where would they take that shot? Would they hit us in France? \nThey would hit us here. Why? Because they want to destroy our way of \nlife. They are trying to come here to kill us. All I am suggesting is \nwe should be able to defend ourselves. And the closer they get to us, \nthe more rights to defend ourselves we should have.\n  Let me say I asked the Judge Advocates General of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, and Marine Corps: Is the authorization to use military force \nagainst al-Qaida, the Taliban, or affiliated groups limited to outside \nthe United States? They said: No, there is no geographic limitation. So \nif somebody hijacked a plane tomorrow trying to fly it into the \nCapitol, our military could shoot it down. We are not going to restrict \nourselves to the battlefield being everywhere else but in our own \nbackyard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, again, if there were information of an imminent \nattack, such as the aircraft that crashed in Pennsylvania that might \nhave been headed for the Capitol, we would take whatever measures \nnecessary to prevent it from happening. To somehow say we would not use \nevery capability in our arsenal to prevent that goes back again to this \nfundamental error, fundamental misconception about the nature of \nradical extremists where the battlefield clearly is the United States, \nand we should be most prepared.\n  And, by the way, if there is some good news that came out of Boston, \nit was that some of the measures that had been taken since 9/11 \ncontributed significantly to our ability to track down and eliminate \nthis threat far more rapidly than we would have prior to 9/11.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, if I may, hats off to the Boston, MA, police \nofficers, to the Presiding Officer's town. Our heart breaks for the \nvictims. Bostonians made us proud. They show us how to stay brave. The \nFBI and everybody did a great job, but how we missed this I still want \nto know.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire was the former attorney general of New \nHampshire. She knows the difference between fighting a war and fighting \na crime.\n  I have been a military lawyer, I have been a civilian lawyer, and I \nam all very much for the idea of due process being given to everyone \ncharged with a crime, including this man. He deserves to be presumed \ninnocent, to have a lawyer, and a jury to find him guilty or innocent. \nHe deserves all that because it makes us better and safer. But what we \nshould not give up as a Nation is the ability to find out about future \nattacks in a logical way. We are at war, and in the law of armed \nconflict, national security applies here, in my view, because of the \ntype of incident involved and the threats we face.\n  I wish to hear from Senator Ayotte, who has become one of the most \nknowledgeable people on the topic. She has tried people in New \nHampshire--death penalty cases--and if she doesn't mind, perhaps she \ncan share with us her view of where the battlefield is, what kind of \nlaws to apply to a situation such as this.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from South Carolina and very much \nthank my colleague from Arizona for, obviously, their leadership on \nthis issue.\n  I have great confidence in our criminal justice system, having both \ndefended and tried criminal cases in that system. The purpose of that \nsystem, of course, is to bring people to justice. There is no question \nin this case, in light of what Boston has gone through--and I know the \nChair knows all too well the crimes that were committed and the acts of \nterrorism committed--that we need to make sure the criminal justice \nsystem holds that individual, the terrorist who survived, accountable \nin the Federal criminal system.\n  I am confident, based not only on what we have seen with video \nevidence but the great work done by our law enforcement officials, both \nat the local level in Boston, along with the cooperation of our Federal \nagencies--they did phenomenal work--that evidence will be used against \nthis terrorist in the Federal court system and he will be found guilty. \nIn fact, with the overwhelming evidence, this is not a difficult case \nto prosecute, and we should hold him fully accountable.\n  But our criminal justice system, which I have great respect for, was \nnot set up to gather intelligence to protect our Nation. In fact, \nprotections such as the right against self-incrimination, when an \nindividual is given their Miranda rights, that is intended to tell \npeople they have the right to a lawyer, they have the right to remain \nsilent so they can't be coerced into confessing to something and then \nhaving that confession used to convict them later in a court of law, \nthat doctrine was not intended to stop this Nation from gathering \nintelligence, to make sure when we have a terrorist attack, such as \nwhat occurred in Boston, which was so horrific--and let me say my \nthoughts and prayers are with the victims of those terrorist attacks--\nwe cannot in the national security context hold that individual for a \nsufficient period while still being respectful of his constitutional \nright--which we can be--and gather intelligence.\n  If we cannot do that, what are we saying about our Nation? What are \nwe saying here? Let us go back to 9/11.\n  What if we had captured one of those individuals before the second \nplane hit the second tower or before the plane went down in \nPennsylvania. Are you telling me we couldn't hold them for a longer \nperiod of time?\n  Our law enforcement officers relied on what is called the public \nsafety exception to Miranda in this case with the Boston terrorist, but \nthat exception expired very quickly. It expired so quickly that \nyesterday, while our law enforcement spoke with him, by noon he was \nbeing advised by a Federal court judge he had the right to remain \nsilent. Is that enough time to find out whether he has any ties to any \nforeign terrorist organizations, given that his brother traveled to \nDagestan, with ties to Chechnya--with known ties in those areas of the \nworld to al-Qaida? Is that enough time to know whether somebody else or \nsome other organization was funding them or there are other attacks \nthat America can expect? Because that was a very brief period of time, \nand that is what we are talking about--respecting our values in the \ncriminal justice system but also protecting our Nation.\n  In this instance, this individual was very quickly advised that he \nhad the right to remain silent. When he came to consciousness, it was a \nmatter of hours that were given to gather all this information. Is that \nenough, given what happened in Boston, to make sure we know everything \nthis individual knows to protect this Nation from future attacks, if he \nhas ties to al-Qaida or some other foreign terrorist group? That is a \nvery limited time.\n  What we are saying is, yes, try him in Federal court, and he is \nentitled to due process in that system as well. But he should have been \nheld initially to make sure we have the maximum information in our \nnational security system to protect our Nation.\n  Is America the battlefield? We all remember too well 9/11. \nUnfortunately, the goal is to come to America, and we have to \nacknowledge we are at war with radical Islamic jihadists who are \nseeking to kill us--not for anything we\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\nhave done but for what we believe in and for what we stand.\n  I want to show an individual whose name is Anwar al-Awlaki. Anwar al-\nAwlaki was an American citizen, just like this individual who committed \nthe terrorist attack in Boston whom we are holding right now. This \nAmerican citizen became an influential leader in al-Qaida in the \nArabian Peninsula, advocated for violent Jihad against the United \nStates, used the Internet to recruit followers and inspire attacks, and \nwas linked to dozens of terrorist investigations in our country and \nwith our allies. He was in Yemen, and on September 30, 2011, our \nadministration took him out with a drone strike, and I applaud them for \nthat.\n  But if Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen under the constructs we are \nunder right now, came to the United States of America and was involved \nin an attack against our country--we can take him out with a drone \nstrike if he is in Yemen. But if he actually gets to the United States \nof America to carry out the attacks he wanted to as a terrorist and we \ncapture him here, we have to give him Miranda? No. We need to be able \nto hold individuals such as he, and anyone who is seeking to commit a \nterrorist attack against our country, in the national intelligence \ncontext, to find out what they know to make sure we can disrupt these \nterrorist networks around the world. That is what we are talking about, \nand we can do both within our values.\n  To those who have been writing inaccurate pieces about this, we \nunderstand that if someone is an American citizen, they cannot be tried \nin a military commission; they can only be tried in a Federal court. \nAnd we will do that here. If we had caught him, we would have tried him \ntoo. But before we do that, we had better know what he knows about the \nterrorist network to be able to know whom he is involved with and to \nprevent future attacks on this country because people like him--and \nunfortunately what we saw in Boston--do want to come here to attack us. \nWe have to be in a position to protect this country.\n  What concerns me most of all is the construct that this \nadministration has put together. Here we have a construct where even \nforeigners who are terrorists--not American citizens--are being brought \ninto our civilian system and are being advised of their Miranda rights \nwithout giving the maximum opportunity to gather intelligence.\n  This is a picture of Osama bin Laden's son-in-law sitting next to \nOsama bin Laden, Abu Ghaith, the day after our country was attacked on \nSeptember 11. Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Abu Ghaith, was captured \noverseas. He spent time in Iran. Instead of being brought to Guantanamo \nor held for a lengthy period to be interrogated, he was brought right \nto a Federal court in New York City to be tried there.\n  This is the construct this administration is using, where they are \nnot treating this like we are at war even with foreign terrorists. \nOsama bin Laden's son-in-law, not held as an enemy combatant, tried--\njust like this individual who was captured committing the terrorist \nattacks against us in Boston--in the Federal civilian court system.\n  We are at war, ladies and gentlemen, and we owe it to our Nation to \nprotect our country. The only way we can do that is when we capture \nindividuals who are foreigners who are members of al-Qaida or when we \ncapture individuals who are American citizens who commit terrorist \nattacks against this country--who may or may not have ties to foreign \norganizations--we had better find out. If they do, we need to \nunderstand what they know to protect our Nation and then hold them \naccountable, as we will in this case, and make sure they never see the \nlight of day. I hope in this case we seek the death penalty for what \nthat suspect in Boston did in terrorizing those who were there at the \nBoston Marathon on such a wonderful day.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We have an order for a recess at \nthis hour.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I would ask the Senator from New Hampshire, how do we get the death \npenalty when the only way we can get information out of the suspect is \nto go through his lawyer? If we can't have this national security \ninterrogation, where there is no lawyer, to get information to protect \nagainst a future attack that can't be used in a trial, don't you think \nthe lawyer is going to say: I am not going to have my client talk to \nyou unless you promise not to seek the death penalty?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say to the Senator from South Carolina, I don't \nknow how that isn't possible in this case. Any defense lawyer--as they \nshould--to defend their client, there is no way they will allow that \nindividual who committed the terrorist attack in Boston to speak to one \ninvestigator now, if we get additional information or we have followup \nquestions, without taking the death penalty off the table.\n  That is the defense lawyer's job. I respect them for that. But it \nputs our Nation in an awkward position to have to negotiate with a \ndefense lawyer when we have questions for someone who has committed a \nterrorist attack against our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2871-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, are we in regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are considering the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Marketplace \nFairness Act. I am pleased to join Senators Enzi and Durbin and many of \nmy colleagues in this bipartisan effort to pass this bill that will \nhelp small businesses in my State expand and create jobs by ending a \ntax loophole that benefits out-of-State remote sellers. I want to \nparticularly commend Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin for their long-\ntime leadership on this issue. They have been relentless in trying to \nfind an effective way to allow States to collect sales taxes on items \nthat are actually delivered into their States.\n  This is a huge issue in my State of Rhode Island where businesses are \nhaving a very difficult time competing against out-of-State retailers \nbecause of, frankly, the outdated rules that require shops on Main \nStreet to collect taxes while their out-of-State online competition \ndoes not. When you go to the stores in Rhode Island you'll see that \nthey are facing this with increasing frequency. And small business men \nand women are demanding help.\n  When Internet commerce was in its early stages, online companies were \nbasically exempted by what is now, by all accounts, an out-of-date \nSupreme Court decision, from collecting State and local sales taxes for \nsales in States where they do not have a physical presence--despite the \nfact that there was still an obligation to collect sales taxes on those \npurchases. That obligation was shifted to consumers, who are often \nunaware they have an obligation. This loophole puts Main Street \nbusinesses at a competitive disadvantage, hurts the ability of Rhode \nIsland to keep jobs in the State, and strains State budgets all across \nthe United States.\n  In order to address this inequity, the bill before us today would \ngive States the ability to enforce their own sales tax laws and, by so \ndoing, relieve consumers of the legal burden to report to State tax \ndepartments the sales taxes they owe on online purchases--since they \nwould be paying sales taxes as a matter of course at the time of \npurchase, just as they would in a regular store.\n  Essentially it levels the playing field. If you walk into a store in \nRhode Island and there is a sales tax charge, you would pay it. If you \nreceive an item you ordered off the Internet, you would pay a sales tax \nas part of the bundled price of the item. It is what people would \nexpect to do.\n  The legislation would also ensure that the rules for collecting sales \ntax from out-of-State retailers are clear and consistent. States can \nenter into\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\nan already established Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement which my \nState and 21 other States are party to, or States can adopt a set of \nalternative minimum simplification standards to make it easier for \nonline businesses to comply with their tax laws.\n  And this bill makes it easier for businesses--that choose to do \nbusiness in a State that requires remote sellers to collect sales \ntaxes--to comply with the law by providing software to help them \ncalculate the sales tax.\n  Furthermore, this bill exempts small businesses with less than $1 \nmillion in gross revenue from having to collect sales taxes on remote \nsales. Those truly small businesses would not be affected by the \nlegislation before us today.\n  This bill does not create new taxes or increase existing taxes. \nInstead, the bill will help States and cities collect billions in \nunpaid taxes already owed, reducing the need to raise new taxes on tax-\ncompliant businesses and citizens. Indeed, yesterday I was with my \nGovernor and he indicated that if we could pass this at the Federal \nlevel and allow the State of Rhode Island to collect approximately $70 \nmillion a year, he would secure a reduction in our sales taxes which \nwould benefit all the people and businesses in Rhode Island.\n  This is a proposal that I think is not only necessary, it is long \noverdue. In 2012, as I have indicated, Rhode Island estimated it lost \napproximately $70 million in uncollected revenue. The revenue was \nlegally owed but, because of this loophole, it went uncollected. This \nputs pressure on individuals and businesses that play by the rules. \nIndeed, if the Marketplace Fairness Act becomes law, Rhode Island has \nprovisions in State law--and the Governor reiterated that yesterday--\nthat would help lower the sales tax from 7 percent to 6.5 percent and \neliminate the recent extension of sales tax to clothing purchases over \n$250. This would have huge and immediate benefits to the people and \nbusinesses of Rhode Island.\n  The other thing it could do, frankly, is it would encourage local \nbusinesses to hire Rhode Islanders. We are facing a 9.1-percent \nunemployment rate. We have been slowly making progress in terms of \nputting people back to work--but there is much more to be done. This \nbill would help with that recovery because one of the barriers main \nstreet businesses face in hiring locally is the unfair competition from \nremote sellers that do not collect sales tax. This bill corrects that.\n  Now some online retailers who benefit from this unfair tax advantage \nunderstand the need to correct the loophole. That is why companies such \nas Amazon.com, with substantial remote sales, support this legislation. \nGovernors of every political stripe recognize the undue pressure this \ntax loophole puts on their budgets, businesses, and citizens, and that \nis why the National Governors Association supports this. Ultimately, \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act is about revitalizing our real economy by \nhelping Main Street businesses compete against remote sellers that \nbenefit from this tax loophole because these Main Street businesses \ncannot hire workers or expand if shoppers use their stores just to \nbrowse and then make their purchases online in order to avoid paying \nsales tax.\n  Yesterday I was with a group of business leaders in Rhode Island. \nAmong them were the Cardi brothers, Ron and Pete Cardi, who own a \nfamily furniture store. It has been in the family for generations. They \nare first-rate businessmen and first-rate community leaders. They tell \nme it is not uncommon for someone to come in the showroom, get help \nfrom one of their skilled sales personnel, order the furniture, have it \nshipped to their homes so they see it fits exactly right, then call up \nand have it returned to the store--and then a truck will show up a day \nor two later at the customer's house, from a remote seller with the \nsame item because the remote seller doesn't collect sales tax. We \ncannot have our retailers in States such as Rhode Island simply be \nshowrooms for remote sellers. That is one of the consequences of this \nloophole we have to correct. This bipartisan proposal is designed not \nonly to allow States to keep or retain the tax that is owed, but also, \nin the case of Rhode Island, to allow a tax reduction; and furthermore, \nto give local businesses more incentive to hire.\n  This is legislation that makes extraordinary sense in every \ndimension. I hope we can get through this debate this week and \nsuccessfully pass this legislation. We are all encouraged by the 75 \nvotes this proposal received when it was made as an amendment during \nthe budget debate and the 74 votes this bill received on the cloture \nmotion. I am hopeful it will continue to enjoy a similar level of \nsupport moving forward.\n  Once again, let me thank Senators Enzi and Durbin for their \nextraordinary leadership, which has helped forge this bipartisan and \nbicameral bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I join my colleague Senator Reed of \nRhode Island and I thank Senators Enzi and Durbin for their hard work \non S. 743.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the Marketplace Fairness Act. This \nlegislation will put businesses in Hawaii on an even playing field with \ntheir out-of-State competitors. It does this by giving the States--not \nthe Federal Government, the States--the authority to require out-of-\nState merchants to collect the same taxes local merchants have to \ncollect when they sell goods to customers in Hawaii. This is only fair.\n  I want to be clear about what this bill does and what it does not do \nbecause there is some confusion about what this bill does and doesn't \ndo. For example, this bill does not impose a new Federal sales tax. \nThis bill does not require the States to do anything. In fact, if this \nbill becomes law, nothing would change unless a State passes its own \nlegislation.\n  What this bill does do is to give States that choice. It lets each \nState choose whether to level the playing field for its local \nbusinesses. In addition, this legislation provides a framework that \nensures States can exercise this authority in a way that ensures \nfairness for businesses of all sizes.\n  For example, it requires any State that chooses to exercise this new \nauthority to streamline its sales and use taxes, and to provide free \nsoftware to calculate these taxes to out-of-State sellers. This does \nnot impose any kind of burden on these out-of-State sellers who are \nselling items to people in States such as Hawaii. This legislation \nprotects small online businesses by exempting any business with less \nthan $1 million of annual sales.\n  The growth of the Internet has been one of the most significant \ndrivers of innovation in our country's history. More and more Americans \nrely on the Internet to run their small businesses, access educational \nand health resources, keep in touch with loved ones, and for \nentertainment. Expanding fast, affordable, and secure Internet access \nis an essential building block for a strong 21st century economy.\n  However, we must be careful to ensure that while we are promoting the \neconomic potential of the Internet, we are also being fair to local \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs. These are the businesses that populate \nthe Main Streets of towns all across the country, across all the \nislands in the Hawaiian chain. These are hardware stores, clothing \nstores, gift shops, and many others--many of which are small \nbusinesses. These are businesses that create jobs, pay taxes, and \nprovide needed goods and services in our communities. In fact, in \nHawaii, retail businesses employ nearly 25 percent of the workforce, \nabout 128,000 people. In 2012, these businesses in Hawaii generated $30 \nbillion in sales as well as $1.2 billion in tax revenue. Many of these \nentrepreneurs do not want to just contribute economically, they want to \ncontribute and do contribute to the culture and character of their \ncommunities.\n  For example, my office received a call from the owner of Kona \nStories, a small bookstore in Kailua-Kona, HI. Kona Stories opened in \n2006 and sells over 10,000 titles of all kinds. But Kona Stories \ndoesn't just sell books, it hosts book clubs, supports local authors \nand artists, and it also helps promote other local businesses. The \nprograms and meetings Kona Stories hosts focus on promoting the local \nculture and character of the community. Small shops like these are \nplaces that can teach visitors about the unique characteristics of our \ncommunities. They also help bring local people closer together around \nshared experiences and values.\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\n  Unfortunately, these small businesses are the ones that are hurt most \nby the advantage online merchants currently have, because they do not \ncollect Hawaii sales and use taxes. This makes online products appear \ncheaper because their prices do not include State taxes, even though \nthese taxes are technically still owed. That is not real competition, \nit is an artificial discount that is unfair to local brick-and-mortar \nbusinesses and it puts businesses in Hawaii, such as Kona Stories, at a \ndisadvantage. As small businesses, they have a hard enough time \ncompeting with the online giants that can offer lower prices even if \nthey were collecting State taxes.\n  In addition to allowing States to level the playing field for their \nlocal businesses, this bill would also provide a boost for State and \nlocal government by letting them collect the taxes that are already \nowed. According to a 2012 Hawaii Tax Review Commission report, fixing \nthe situation and giving States such as Hawaii that option to enact \nnecessary legislation would mean nearly $160 million in additional \nrevenue for the State of Hawaii in 2013.\n  I want to be clear. That money does not come from new taxes. It comes \nfrom taxes that are already owed, that are not paid. That is money that \nshould be going to keep teachers in the classroom, firefighters and \ncops on the beat, and fixing our roads and bridges so we all benefit.\n  Overall, the Marketplace Fairness Act is a good bill whose time has \ncome. It balances the need to preserve a vibrant and innovative online \nmarketplace with a need to ensure fairness for local businesses. It \nalso ensures that everyone is meeting their responsibilities with \nregard to paying State and local taxes.\n\n  That is why this legislation has such a broad range of support from \nbusiness, government, labor organizations, big and small, from all \nacross the country. In fact, my home State of Hawaii has been working \nto try to address this issue on the State level for years. We need this \nFederal legislation. Passage of this bill will finally give Hawaii the \nability to address this disparity and put our businesses on an even \nplaying field. That will be especially important to the 2,000 local \nbusinesses that make up the retail merchants of Hawaii.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of Hawaii \nnational supporters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, \nthe material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n           Supporters of S. 743, the Marketplace Fairness Act\n\n       Retail Merchants of Hawaii, National Association of \n     Counties, National League of Cities, U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors, Government Finance Officers Association, National \n     Council of State Legislatures, Bipartisan Policy Center's \n     Governors Council, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, American Federation of \n     Teachers, National Education Association, American Federation \n     of Government Employees, International Association of Fire \n     Fighters, International Federation of Professional Technical \n     Engineers, International Union of Police Associations, \n     Service Employees International Union, UAW, American Apparel \n     & Footwear Association, Food Marketing Institute, Consumer \n     Electronics Association.\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, occasionally some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle will say President Obama is being poorly \ntreated on his nominations. That did not ring true to me because it \nseems to me that just the reverse was true. I have spent a good deal of \ntime in the last two Congresses to actually make it easier for \nPresidents--not just President Obama but any President--to have his or \nher nominations considered in a timely fashion.\n  There are about 1,000 nominations that a President makes in the whole \ngovernment that are subject to advice and consent. This is the \nconstitutional authority of the Senate. It was put there deliberately \nby the Founders to provide a check and balance. The Founders did not \nwant a king. They had been accustomed to tyranny and they wanted to \nthink of ways to avoid that. So they created a President, not a king. \nThey said the President shall, with these important nominations, send \nthem up to the Senate. The Senate has the right to advise and consent. \nMovies and books have been writing about this. It is well known. Some \nof the most celebrated debates we have had in the Senate have been \nabout Presidential nominations.\n  But for the most part, the Senate listens to the President's \nnominations, extends to him the courtesy that he was, after all, \nelected by the American people, that he has a right to staff his \ngovernment. He has the benefit of the doubt on his nominations for \njudges.\n  So I was surprised to keep hearing from some of my Democratic \nfriends. Every time we confirmed a judge, somebody would come on the \nfloor and say: The Republicans are holding up President Obama's \nnominations. I did not think that was true. So I asked my staff to work \nwith the Congressional Research Service. I come to the floor to include \nin the Record the facts which show it is not true.\n  Here is the bottom line. The Senate has confirmed President Obama's \nnominations for Cabinet more rapidly than it did those of President \nGeorge W. Bush or President Clinton; and has confirmed Obama's \nnominations to circuit courts--but not his district court nominations--\nmore rapidly than it did those of President George W. Bush.\n  In 2013, the Senate changed its rules to speed up consideration of \nthose district judge nominations. In the history of the Senate, of \ncourse this includes President Obama, no Cabinet member, unless we \ncount John Bolton's nomination by George W. Bush to be the U.N. \nAmbassador, and no district judge has ever been denied his or her seat \nbecause of a filibuster; that is, a failed cloture vote.\n  In the history of the Senate, only seven circuit judge nominees have \nbeen denied their seats by a filibuster, five of George W. Bush's \nnominees and two of President Obama's nominees. I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record this summary of President Obama's \nnominations, along with an article from the Washington Post that points \nout that President Obama's nominees have been confirmed more rapidly \nthan those of the last three Presidents in his first term.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     President Obama's Nominations\n\n\n                              BOTTOM LINE:\n\n       The Senate has confirmed President Obama's nominations for \n     cabinet and circuit court--but not his district court \n     nominations--more rapidly than it did those of President G.W. \n     Bush or President Clinton. In 2013 the Senate changed its \n     rules to speed up consideration of district judge \n     nominations.\n       In the history of the Senate, no cabinet member (unless you \n     count John Bolton) and no district judge has ever been denied \n     his/her seat because of a filibuster (failed cloture vote). \n     In the history of the Senate, only SEVEN circuit judge \n     nominees have been denied their seat by filibuster--FIVE G.W. \n     Bush nominees and TWO Obama nominees.\n\n\n            First-Term Circuit Court Judicial Confirmations:\n\n       Obama average time (240 days) is FASTER than G.W. Bush (277 \n     days) from nomination to confirmation.\n\n\n                  First-Term District Court Nominees:\n\n       Obama average time (221 days) is SLOWER than G.W. Bush (156 \n     days) from nomination to confirmation NOTE: January, 2013 \n     senate rules changes should speed this up.\n\n\n                   Second-Term Cabinet Confirmations:\n\n       Obama average time (46 days) is FASTER than G.W. Bush (55 \n     days) or Clinton (68 days) from announcement to confirmation \n     (see attached Washington Post article).\n\n\nSenate Filibusters that denied a cabinet nominee his/her seat due to a \n                          failed cloture vote:\n\n       NONE in the history of Senate (with only exception G.W. \n     Bush's nomination of John Bolton in 2005).\n\n\n Senate Filibusters that denied a district judge nominee his/her seat \n                    because of failed cloture vote:\n\n       NONE in the history of the Senate.\n\n\n  Senate Filibusters that denied a circuit judge nominee his/her seat \n                   because of a failed cloture vote:\n\n       SEVEN in the history of the Senate, including five under \n     G.W. Bush and two under Obama.\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\n       In 2011, Senate rules changes created ``innocent until \n     nominated'' working group to make it easier for presidential \n     nominees to be considered and eliminated 169 major and \n     approximately 3000 minor presidential nominations requiring \n     confirmation. And 273 Presidential nominations were placed in \n     an expedited process.\n       In 2013, the Senate has confirmed 10 Obama judicial \n     nominees (4 circuit, 6 district). President G.W. Bush by \n     comparison had 0 judges confirmed at this point in his \n     second-term.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 18, 2013]\n\n                    Senate Moving on Obama Nominees\n\n                             (By Al Kamen)\n\n       How slowly is President Obama's second-term Cabinet coming \n     together?\n       Well, there are two sides to the story.\n       One part of the equation is how fast Obama is putting up \n     nominees. And it seems he's been pretty sluggish on that \n     front. With the addition Monday of Thomas Perez for labor \n     secretary, he's announced eight nominees and still has four \n     more Cabinet or Cabinet-rank jobs to fill. By contrast, \n     George W. Bush had made 11 nominations by this time in his \n     second term--nine of which he made in the six weeks after \n     reelection. Bill Clinton had announced 12 nominees by the end \n     of the December after his reelection.\n       But in the second half of the Obama administration's \n     nomination picture--how quickly the Senate is approving those \n     nominees--things are moving apace.\n       Three of Obama's Cabinet nominees have been confirmed so \n     far: Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck \n     Hagel and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. For those folks, the \n     average number of days between the announcement by the White \n     House and confirmation is 45.6 days, which beats the averages \n     of the last three administrations that had second terms.\n       According to the Congressional Research Service, it took an \n     average of 54.6 days for Bush's second-term nominees; that \n     figure was 67.8 days for Clinton's picks and 56 days for \n     Ronald Reagan's.\n       Who says the Senate can't step lively these days?\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. To be more specific about these matters, let's take \ncircuit court judicial confirmations in President Obama's first term. \nAccording to our research, the average time for President Obama's \nnominees was 240 days. That is faster than President George W. Bush, \n277 days from nomination to confirmation. So circuit court judicial \nconfirmations which are usually the subject of great interest around \nhere, President Obama treated better than President George W. Bush, \nslightly better.\n  First-term district court nominees. The Obama average time, 221 days \nis slower than George W. Bush, 156 days from nomination to \nconfirmation. That is why in January of 2013 we changed the Senate \nrules to speed this up. Apparently, that is working. Last time I \nchecked, during this year, the beginning of President Obama's second \nterm, he has to date had 13 judges confirmed. President Bush, in this \nsame period of time in his second term, had one judge confirmed. \nSecond-term Cabinet confirmations. The average time of President \nObama's nominees is 46 days. That is faster than George W. Bush, 55 \ndays, and faster than Bill Clinton, 68 days from announcement to \nconfirmation.\n  I mentioned the Washington Post article which said--it was published \nMarch 18, 2013. It says:\n\n       He has announced eight nominees and still has four more \n     cabinet or cabinet-ranked jobs to fill. By contrast, George \n     W. Bush had made 11 nominations by this time in his second \n     term--nine of which he made in the six weeks after \n     reelection. Bill Clinton had announced 12 nominees by the end \n     of December after his reelection.\n\n  In other words, President Obama is a little slower in making his \nsecond-term nominations.\n\n       According to the Congressional Research Service,--\n\n  Says the Washington Post:\n\n     --it took an average of 54.6 days for Bush's second-term \n     nominees; that figure was 67.8 days for Clinton's picks and \n     56 days for Ronald Reagan's. So the Obama nominees were \n     moving more rapidly.\n\n  Senate filibusters that denied a Cabinet nominee his or her seat due \nto a failed cloture vote. It has never happened in Senate history so \nfar as we can find, with the exception of President George W. Bush's \nnomination of John Bolton.\n  There have been occasions when the minority says we are not ready to \ncut off debate yet. We have more information we want about a Cabinet \nmember. That happened with Secretary Hagel. Many of us made it clear to \nthe majority leader that his motion to cut off debate on Secretary \nHagel's nomination was premature because it had only been reported by \ncommittee for 2 days; we requested another 10 days to consider it, that \nwas until after the recess, and said that there would be an up-or-down \nvote.\n  But so far as we are able to tell, there has always been an up-or-\ndown vote on any President's nominee for the Cabinet, after that \nCabinet member has gotten to floor. Now it may be that in the past some \nCabinet nominees fell by the wayside in committee. I have repeated on \nthe floor my own experience in 1991, when President Bush nominated me \nto be Education Secretary and Senator Metzenbaum put a hold on my \nnomination that lasted a month, but I was eventually confirmed \nunanimously.\n  So there may have been secret holds in the past that slowed down \nnominations or even may have killed one. But so far as the \nCongressional Research Service has found, no Cabinet member by \nPresident Obama or any President has been denied his or her seat \nultimately by a failed cloture vote.\n  Same with district judges. No district judge in the history of the \nSenate has been denied his or her seat by a failed cloture vote. There \nmay have been a cloture vote on one or two occasions, but in the end, \nthat person was finally seated.\n  Then, as far as circuit judges, one of my great disappointments in \nthe Senate was when I arrived in 2003. The Democrats had cooked up a \nplan to filibuster President Bush's circuit court Federal nominees. So \nfar as I can tell, that had never been done before. There was always an \nup-or-down vote. Even in the case of Clarence Thomas, for example, a \ncontroversial nominee for the Supreme Court, I think the vote was 53 to \n47 or 52 to 48. There was no thought of killing Clarence Thomas's \nnomination by a cloture vote, by a 60-vote margin.\n  What happened was, without dwelling on it too much, Democrats decided \nthey did not like some of President Bush's nominees. It was not they \nwere not qualified. Michael Estrada was one, one of the most eminently \nqualified persons ever nominated. Bill Pryor was another one, from \nAlabama, former law clerk to Judge Wisdom for whom I used to clerk. \nPickering of Mississippi was another.\n  They were basically smeared is what happened. It was an outrageous \nthing. I remember I was waiting to make my maiden speech as a Senator \nin 2003 on another subject. I got so upset about this. The first time I \nspoke on the Senate floor was against that, against that practice of \ndenying a President an up-or-down vote on his circuit judge nominees.\n  If you do not like the person, vote against him or her but at least \nallow an up-or-down vote. That so enraged the other Republicans that \nthey wanted to change the rules of the Senate. They said: OK. We have \nthe majority. There are 55 of us. We will just change the rules. We \nwill confirm all of President Bush's judges with 51 votes. That is what \nthe Democrats have tried to do at the beginning of the last two \nCongresses: We have enough votes to do it. We will change the rules and \neverything will be 51.\n  Cooler heads prevailed. I made a couple speeches about it. Democrats \nand Republicans got together, one of these gangs that we have, maybe 14 \nMembers, they said: Look, except in extraordinary cases in the case of \ncircuit judges, there will always be an up-or-down vote on a \nPresident's nominee.\n  But a lot of the damage had been done. Five of President George W. \nBush's Federal circuit judge nominees were denied their seat because of \na filibuster. So as far as we can tell, with the research of the \nCongressional Research Service, that was the first time in the history \nof the Senate that it happened. As one might expect, now Republicans \nhave done the same thing, twice in the case of Ms. Halligan. If we \ncount her as twice, that is three. But we can count Miguel Estrada \nseveral times because he was filibustered a half dozen times.\n  The record is the Democrats have now blocked five of President Bush's \nRepublican nominees for circuit judge, and Republicans have blocked two \nof President Obama's nominees. I don't believe this is good for the \nSenate or for the country. It would be better if we had up-or-down \nvotes for Cabinet members and for Federal judges, both Cabinet and \ndistrict.\n  The body of the Senate has precedents. My own personal view is as far\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\nas district judges go I will always vote for an up-or-down vote. As far \nas circuit judges go, I will always do so except in an extraordinary \ncase. I have always thought a President ought to be able to have an up-\nor-down vote on a Cabinet member. Again, the Democrats, under President \nBush, decided once not to do this.\n  I believe it is important to bring this before the Senate. I would \nlike us not to go any further in the direction we have followed in the \nlast 20 years. I would like for us in the Senate to get back to where \nwe recognize elections have consequences. The President needs to staff \nhis government. Give the President the presumption of the doubt on \njudicial nominees. If we don't like the judge, vote no.\n  This means Republicans now need to swallow a little hard because \nthere is a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate. It will not \nalways be this way. We may have a Republican President and a Democratic \nSenate. Then the Democratic Senate could decide never to confirm a \nCabinet member or never to confirm a circuit judge. I think the \nAmerican people would be very upset with that. It is important to bring \nthis to the attention of the full Senate and place this in the record.\n  One other aspect which is important, we have had very good \nconversations at the beginning of the last two Congresses about the \nrules of the Senate. The rules of the Senate are not as exciting as a \ndebate about guns, immigration, or a debate about marketplace fairness, \nwhich is really the 10th Amendment we are having today. However, they \nare very fundamental to our country's structure.\n  The wisdom of our Founders was that they set up three competing, \nsound branches of government. All need to function well in order for us \nto have our liberty. This is why we have checks and balances. We want \nour liberty. We don't want a king, we don't want a runaway parliament, \nand we don't want a runaway court. We want checks and balances so we, \nas individuals, can retain our liberty.\n  I wish the Senate to function as it should and the advice and consent \nnomination to function as it should.\n  This is why as part of our rules change we took some steps to \nstreamline the advice and consent role of the Senate. We did this when \nit wasn't clear whether there would be a President Obama or a President \nRomney, which is one way we were able to do it with the Democratic \nSenate and a Republican House.\n  We took some important steps. For example, we reduced the number of \nPresidential nominees which require a full-blown Senate confirmation by \napproximately 170. We took approximately 200 of those nominees right to \nthe desk, and they were expedited. Unless an individual Senator says: I \nwish to have a full hearing on a member of the board for the Goldwater \nScholarship Fund--or something such as this, then it stays on the desk, \ngoes through the committee for vetting, and is moved to the calendar \nfor a vote. This has worked pretty well.\n  We did one other thing which was important and which, hopefully, the \nPresident and his administration are taking advantage of, we tried to \nwork on the innocent-until-nominated syndrome which has existed around \nhere for a long time.\n  Whenever someone is nominated for a Cabinet position, we need to go \nthrough such a process of vetting, public scrutiny, and general \nindignation, we wonder why anybody in his or her right mind would do \nit. Many people won't. This is why we call it innocent until nominated.\n  One reason for this is because of the multiplicity of forms a nominee \nsuch as the Secretary of Education needs to fill out. They might need \nto fill out one form about what their income was in 1977 and then \nanother form about what their income was in 1977 by a different \ndefinition. When they arrive at their hearing and someone has made a \nmistake, some Senator accuses the nominee of perjury because he was \nsworn in and said he was going to tell the truth. It was easy to make a \nmistake under those circumstances.\n  What we did was create a working group to review all the forms. They \nmade recommendations mainly to the executive branch about simplifying \nthem. The executive branch has worked with our Senate committees. They \nare doing this now.\n  As a result, if I am nominated for Secretary of Education, I might \nfill out a single form which might comprise the only form I would need \nto fill out for the executive branch. Any Senate committee could ask \nany question at once and add that to the form, but they might agree to \nstart with this form. It should make it simpler for the nominee, easier \nfor the Senators as we go through the confirmation process, and it \nmight be a way to help encourage talented men and women to enter public \nservice.\n  The President has said to several of us before that he recognizes \npart of the reason his nominations aren't moving as rapidly as he would \nwish is because of the vetting process, the process he and his \nadministration need to go through before they even send anybody over to \nthe Senate.\n  Much of the delay is in the time which comes before a nomination \nactually arrives in the Senate.\n  I hope this review will help to quiet down these--as Senator Grassley \nsaid--crocodile tears on the other side of the aisle. We don't think \nthey are deserved.\n  The President's nominees are moving more rapidly than the last three \nPresidents, and his circuit court nominees moved more rapidly than \nthose of George W. Bush. As we change the rules to speed up his \ndistrict court nominees--he is ahead 13 to 1 in terms of nominations in \nthe second term for judges. This is a pretty good record.\n  It is my desire the President will work with us to speed up the \nvetting process to develop an innocent-until-nominated effort, which is \nongoing to enable it to be an advantage not to just this President but \nfuture Presidents. Hopefully, we may give respect and due consideration \nto any nominee the President sends forward.\n  At the same time, the President will recognize we have an advice and \nconsent responsibility. It may take some time. We will ask questions \nand may not want to move to a final vote at the very moment the \nmajority leader may. This doesn't necessarily mean the nominee will be \ndenied his or her seat. As a matter of fact, as far as I can find in \nthe history of the Senate, it has not, with the exception of John \nBolton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for \ncoming to the floor. He has been here with some frequency together with \nthe Republican Senator from Wyoming to discuss the matter which is \npending before the Senate.\n  What is pending before the Senate is known as the Marketplace \nFairness Act. It is a measure which Senator Enzi of Wyoming has been \nworking on for 12 years and one on which I have worked with him for \nseveral years. It is an interesting issue because it is one where the \nSupreme Court challenged Congress 20 years ago. The States went to the \nSupreme Court and said: We want those who are not physically present in \nour State, but sell in our State, to collect sales tax. At that time \nthe Supreme Court in the Quill decision said no; this is up to \nCongress. Congress needs to take action.\n  Here we are 20 years later and the conversation has changed \ndramatically. What used to be sales by mail or catalog are now Internet \nsales, and they are growing in volume by the day. States are finding \nthemselves in a challenging situation.\n  States pass sales taxes. Senator Alexander was Governor of Tennessee. \nThe State decided on a State sales tax. They say to every business in \nthe State--as Senator Manchin understands because he was Governor of \nWest Virginia--every sale you make over the counter collects sales tax \nfor West Virginia, Tennessee, or in the State of Illinois. Those \nmerchants understand their legal responsibility, their civic \nresponsibility, and they collect the sales tax, remitting this amount \nback to the State.\n  The problem they now have discovered is what is known as showrooming. \nStore owners have described this as a situation where a customer shows \nup and requests to look at running shoes--this happens at Chris Koos \nrunning sports shop in Normal, IL. The customer will say: These look \ngood, but do you have them in a different color? Staff goes back and \ngets another box of shoes for the customer who tries them\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\non. Then they will say: This looks great but do you have a wider one? \nYes, that is perfect. That is the shoe I want. Let me write down the \ninformation about the shoe.\n  The customer will then turn around, go home, and order the shoe on \nthe Internet. The local merchant who did all of the work, who displayed \nthe merchandise, pays the rent, pays the taxes, receives nothing. The \nperson buys it over the Internet because many Internet retailers do not \ncollect sales tax.\n  In my State this might be 8, 9 or 10 percent difference. Chris, my \nfriend, the mayor of Normal, told me it is not unusual 2 weeks later \nfor them to come back in with the shoes purchased over the Internet and \nsay: These didn't turn out right. He reminds them they didn't buy the \nshoes in his store.\n  This is a story repeated over and over. The brick-and-mortar \nretailers, the shops on Main Street, and the malls feel they are at a \ngreat disadvantage. If their competition on the Internet is not \ncollecting sales tax and they are, it puts them at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  In all of the States with a sales tax, approximately 46 States, if I \nam not mistaken the purchaser over the Internet has a legal \nresponsibility to pay the sales tax. Most people don't know this. In my \nState of Illinois people are supposed to pay it when they file their \nState income tax. There is a line: How much do you owe for sales tax \nand use tax for remote purchases on Internet purchases?\n  Several months ago I was reminded by my bookkeeper this line was on \nthe form. I said I should take a quick look to see what I owe.\n  One in twenty people in Illinois fill out this line. We have about 95 \npercent of the taxpayers in my State who put zero. We know it is more \nthan 5 percent of the people living in Illinois who are purchasing over \nthe Internet. This tax is not paid.\n  What this bill says is we don't create any Federal tax; no, none at \nall. We don't create any new State or local tax, none at all. What we \ndo say is States can give the software to these Internet retailers to \ncollect the tax when people make the purchase.\n  I recently bought a book on amazon.com, put in my address, ZIP code, \nand they calculated instantly how much I owed in sales tax on that \npurchase. I paid it and the money was emitted to the Illinois \nDepartment of revenue. They are doing this even though there is no \nlegal obligation for them to do so. More and more companies such as \nLands End--I called them. They said: We collect sales tax.\n  More and more companies are doing so, but this would make it uniform. \nWe wrote this law understanding there are some small Internet retailers \nwho perhaps sell several hundred or several thousands of dollars' worth \nof goods in the course of a year. We exempt them. They don't have to \ncollect the sales tax if their revenues from the previous year are \nbelow $1 million. We exempt them. That is to put no hardship on the \nsmall retailers but to go after the 1 percent with sales in excess--\nrevenue in excess of $1 million. We go after them to make them pay what \nthey should.\n  This is what is pending before the Senate. It has been a long time \ncoming. We have been working with retailers across America to \naccomplish this. They have said this will give them a level playing \nfield when it comes to sales. The same sales tax is collected over the \ncounter which is collected over the Internet. This is the way it works \nand at no expense to the retailer.\n  The States need to provide the software for the collection. They are \nnot going to be held responsible if the State gives software which is \nimperfect. They can't be held responsible for it. If they use the \nsoftware given to them, they have met their legal obligation. This is \nwhat is before us.\n  We have had two votes now: one a symbolic vote on the budget and \nanother a procedural vote to move forward on this measure yesterday, \nwhich 74 Senators voted for, which is pretty substantial in a body of \n100 Senators. All but 5 of the Democratic Senators support it, and a \nsubstantial number, 24 or 25 Senators, from the Republican side support \nthis, more than half of their caucus.\n  We are on this measure now. I have said to my colleagues, and I \nbelieve Senator Alexander said to his Republican colleagues: If you \nhave an amendment which is relevant and material to this bill, bring it \nto the floor. Let's get into a debate. Let's talk about these \namendments. Let's vote on these amendments, and then let's move to \nfinal passage.\n  Those who will witness this will see a rare occurrence on the floor \nof the Senate--perhaps an actual debate and vote on an amendment. It \ndoesn't happen very often around here. So you may wish to stay tuned. I \nencourage all of my colleagues interested in this issue who believe \nthey would like to offer some form of an amendment to please bring it \nto the floor as soon as it is ready, which I hope will be today. This \nis our last week in session before we break for a week. We want to get \nthis bill done. We started early in the week--on Monday, yesterday--and \nwe want to get it done by Friday. If we have to stay over, we will stay \nover--Saturday, whatever it takes. We want to get this done before this \nbreak, and it now depends on my colleagues.\n\n  Those who are sitting on an idea, it is time to let it hatch. Bring \nit to the floor, and let's have a vote on it or let's talk about it. It \nmay be something we can accept. If it is, we will try. If it isn't, we \nwill bring it up for a vote and let the Senate decide. We want to act \nas a Senate because we have a good bipartisan measure, Senator Heitkamp \nof North Dakota and I, joining on the Democratic side along with quite \na few others, Senators Enzi and Alexander on the Republican side.\n  I urge my colleagues and staff who are following this debate, now is \nthe time. If you have an amendment, bring it to the floor today, right \nnow. We will be here to receive those amendments and to work on them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the principal leaders for this \nlegislation, Senators Durbin and Enzi, and I congratulate them for \ntheir leadership. What they have been able to do is to come up with a \nsimple, 11-page bill that has two words for a theme--States rights or \n10th Amendment. We have a majority of Senators on the Democratic side \nand a majority of Senators on the Republican side who have indicated \ntheir support for it. They voted twice in support of it.\n  I talked with Senators at the Republican luncheon today, and at least \none Member told me he had a couple of amendments, and I encouraged him \nto bring them on down because we want amendments. We want this to be \ndiscussed on the Senate floor. Senator Reid, the majority leader, has \nsaid there will be amendments. I have a fishing amendment I would like \nto get passed somewhere, but I will not offer it on this bill because I \nwant to offer amendments that are related to marketplace fairness. But \nthere are a number of ideas that are, and they ought to be discussed.\n  I wonder if, before I finish, I might ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois a question. Maybe I am just sensitive to this as a former \nGovernor, as I know the occupant of the Chair is as well, but I wonder \nif the Senator from Illinois finds it a little ironic there are some \npeople in Washington who say they do not trust the States to make \ndecisions about their own tax structure. I was Governor of a State that \nhas a triple-A bond rating, no State debt on roads, no income tax, is \none of the best run States, and when I was there had eight balanced \nbudgets. Unfortunately, during the 10 years I have been in the Senate, \nwe haven't had any of that. So I feel just the reverse.\n  In a constitutional framework that has a 10th Amendment that says \ndecisions are reserved to the sovereign State, it not only smacks of a \nlack of respect for our constitutional structure, but it makes no sense \nto me that Members of Congress would not trust the Governor of \nTennessee and the Legislature of Tennessee to make their own decisions.\n  We had a representative today at a meeting that all three of us \nattended who said that in Ohio, as I recall, the legislature and the \nGovernor have already decided that if we pass this law permitting Ohio \nto collect taxes from everybody who already owes them rather than just \nsome people, they will reduce their income tax rate.\n  So does the Senator find it ironic there would be people in \nWashington\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nwho don't trust the States to make decisions for themselves in a \nconstitutional system that was created by sovereign States?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for posing that \nquestion, and through the Chair I would say to him that I am in a tough \nposition here facing two former Governors--Governors of West Virginia \nand Tennessee--but I am sure they agree with what I am about to say.\n  In this circumstance, the decision was made by the State of \nTennessee--and West Virginia as well--as to what the sales tax would be \nby the people living in the State and making purchases in the State. We \ndon't change that at all. That is up to the States to decide.\n  As I mentioned, four States, maybe five States, when it comes to \nsales tax, have no sales tax. What we are putting in this bill will not \nchange that in any way. If you live in Oregon, you will pay no sales \ntax because of this bill for what is sold over the counter or over the \nInternet.\n  Our friends from Delaware are supporting this bill because they think \nbecause they are a no-sales-tax State surrounded by Pennsylvania and \nNew Jersey and Maryland, they are going to have an advantage. They \nbelieve people will cross the borders to buy in Delaware. So they have \ncalculated this actually helps them.\n  But we are respecting the decisions made by each State as to the \ntaxes that will be imposed. We are doing it on a fair and equalized \nbasis for those who have brick-and-mortar stores as well as those over \nthe Internet. And I would say that is consistent with the 10th \nAmendment and consistent with States rights in this area.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if I could, through the Chair, \npose another question to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I am not mistaken, there is a Federal moratorium on \nInternet taxes; that is, there is a Federal temporary ban on State \ntaxes on access to the Internet. Am I not correct that if the \nMarketplace Fairness Act passes, that ban will still be there? In other \nwords, today there is a Federal ban on Internet taxes, and after this \nlaw passes there will continue to be a ban on Internet taxes? And this \nis not about Internet taxes, it is about State sales and use taxes that \nare already owed but in some cases are not collected.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Responding to the Senator from Tennessee through the \nChair, he is right. And this has been controversial. I can remember \nthat in the last debate--and it was a few years ago--the argument being \nmade was that we should have free access to the Internet. I don't \nquarrel with that. The Internet has been a powerful force in our \neconomy. It is going to grow as a force in our economy, and I don't \nbelieve we should tax access to the Internet. There are also a myriad \nof bills related to services over the Internet and whether they should \nbe taxed. We do not get into that in any way whatsoever. What we are \ntalking about are taxable goods by State law subject to State sales \ntaxes as they currently exist. We don't change those taxes in any way.\n\n  A point that was raised in our press conference is an important one. \nSome States treat food differently, prescription drugs differently. The \nState has to basically tell the retail community what the State \nstandard is going to be for the categories of goods that are being \nsold. So we make it as easy as humanly possible for the Internet \nretailers, providing at the expense of the State the software they need \nto make this work.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator alluded to this in his \nremarks, and we both heard Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota. It is \npretty remarkable that a Senator, in her first 3 months, would find \nherself in the middle of a debate about a problem she created 20 years \nago in North Dakota. She brought this case that created this situation.\n  But let me ask the Senator from Illinois what he envisions will \nhappen if we do not act. If I am not mistaken, under the arrangements \nwe now have today, if a big Internet seller in Illinois--someone who \nsells more than $1 million a year--and as I understand it, 99 percent \nof Internet sellers are exempt from this, but let's say you are in that \n1 percent and you want to sell in Tennessee--your responsibility is to \nfile one return in Tennessee, and you are subject to one audit, period. \nAnd if you sell in another State, the same thing. So you might be \nsubject to filing one report and one audit in all the States, and many \nof the States are part of what is called a streamline structure where \nthey work together, so they audit together. And audits don't occur \nevery year.\n  But there are 9,600 taxing jurisdictions in the United States. So \nwhat we have done or propose to do is simplify this greatly so that if \nyou are an Internet seller, if you sell online or by catalog from \nIllinois to Tennessee, you have a very small number of reports you need \nto fill out, a very small number of audits to which you might be \nsubjected. And your liability is very limited for making a mistake \nbecause the State has to provide the software, and if the software \ndoesn't work, that is the State's fault and not yours.\n  But what would happen if we didn't act, I would ask the Senator from \nIllinois? What if we did not act to simplify this system, as the \nSupreme Court said 20 years ago is our responsibility?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Tennessee through the \nChair that there are two possibilities:\n  We continue under this current system, which works a disadvantage on \nthe Main Street stores and shopping malls and denies to those units of \ngovernment the revenue that would otherwise be coming from the sales \ntax. That would be one outcome.\n  The second outcome is--and Senator Heitkamp has mentioned it--this \ncase may return to the Supreme Court. If it returns to the Supreme \nCourt, it is quite possible it won't be written as mercifully as our \nversion. We have exempted--we have exempted Internet retail sellers \nwith revenues the previous year below $1 million. We have tried to lean \ntoward an accommodating approach. I don't know if the Supreme Court \nwould reach the same decision when it comes to sales tax liability. I \nbelieve it is better for us to accept their challenge, even 20 years \nlater, and get this done.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. In addition to that, let's say I am the Governor of \nTennessee and I look to the Senate and say: These guys can't get \nanything done. They have been debating this ever since Senator Enzi has \nbeen a Senator. They have been debating it for 14 years. They are never \ngoing to do anything.\n  So I just bring a lawsuit and I say: If you are going to sell in \nTennessee, you are welcome, but you are going to collect the tax. I \nmean, Tennessee businesses collect the tax and send it in. So if you \nwant to come in and sell to us, you do that too. We are going to treat \nyou exactly the same way.\n  Now, let's say the Congress hasn't acted. Then that seller in \nIllinois who wants to sell in Tennessee has not only the State taxing \njurisdiction to consider, he has 95 counties to consider, he has \nseveral dozen cities with local sales taxes to consider, and he has \n9,600 jurisdictions across the country to consider if we don't act.\n  So some of the opponents of this legislation who raise this 9,600 \njurisdictions--this is the solution to that problem. If you want to \nsell by catalog or online, this simplifies it for you, it reduces your \nliability, it reduces the number of forms, and it requires the States \nto provide the software that you would use, which many businesses are \nusing today and it works for them.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Illinois, don't you imagine if we \ndon't act, another consequence will be some Governor in some State will \ngo back to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court will say: Twenty \nyears have passed. We now have an Internet. There is no burden on \ninterstate commerce, so it is up to the States to decide what to do.\n  And then we would have a big free-for-all.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Responding to the Senator from Tennessee through the \nChair, I listened to the speeches of our critics, and they were \nswooning over the notion of being subjected to 9,600 taxing districts, \ntaxing entities. What the Senator from Tennessee has described is our \nanswer. This bill avoids that problem. This bill simplifies that \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\n  We are down to 46 States with the defined goods and the defined sales \ntax. That is more reasonable for the retailers than running the risk, \nas the Senator suggests, that this goes back to the Supreme Court, and \n20 years after the fact they say: It is wide open. If Congress is not \ngoing to act, the Internet retail community has now matured to a point \nwhere they should be able to collect sales tax in every taxing entity \nwhere a person resides.\n  I believe that is a much more complex and challenging situation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see Senator Enzi is here, and I \nappreciate his patience in allowing me to go ahead, but I know if I \nwere still the Governor of Tennessee--which I am not, and I won't be \nagain--and Congress did not act on this and I saw an opportunity--if I \nlooked across my State and I saw that our tax laws treated some \ntaxpayers one way and other taxpayers a different way and instate \nbusinesses one way and out-of-State businesses better, it wouldn't take \nme 20 minutes to call the attorney general over and say: Let's take \nthis case to court. Let's go back to court. If somebody is going to \nsell in Tennessee, they are going to collect the tax.\n  I believe I would have a reasonably good chance of winning. And I am \nconfident that, knowing a number of the Governors around this country, \nif we fail to act, I will bet one of them will be in court the next \nday.\n  I congratulate Senator Durbin and Senator Enzi for their persistence \nin creating what is an 11-page bill about two words--States rights--\nthat will--my prediction--allow many States to lower their tax rates \nwhen they collect taxes that are already owed but not paid and treat \nbusinesses the same way and taxpayers the same way.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, and the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, for this \ndiscussion they have had where I think they cleared up a lot of the \nconfusion there might be over the bill. They have presented excellent \nreasons why we need to get this bill done, and why we need to get it \ndone now--so we can continue to grow businesses in our States instead \nof growing businesses outside of our States.\n  There are a number of things people have mentioned. One of the big \nones I want to talk about is the small seller exemption. I know Senator \nWyden from Oregon has suggested a compromise for the whole bill which \nwas to create the nontax States to be a haven for all Internet sales, \nand that won't work. Our purpose is not to move all of the business \nonline out of our own States but to keep it there.\n  But there is a compromise in this bill. It is called the small seller \nexemption, and that is where people who are starting in business don't \nhave to collect the tax when they are out of State. With in-State \nsales, a lot of them will have retail sales in their State as well as \nhopefully some online sales. On what they sell in their bricks-and-\nmortar store, they collect sales tax from everybody who buys from them. \nThere is no exemption. But the compromise we made for the online sales \nwas until a retailer hits the $1 million mark in a year--and we would \nlove for them to hit the $1 million mark and have that kind of \nbusiness. But until they do, they are protected in that they don't have \nto collect the tax. We give them a break over the in-State retailers. \nOf course, the ones who are in State who are selling out of State have \nthat same online break. But that is why we have a small seller \nexemption, to continue to grow small businesses that are using the \nInternet. We want the Internet to grow and are not discriminating \nagainst the Internet. And as has been mentioned, there will be no tax \non the use of the Internet. That is not a part of this bill.\n  This is a tax on what people buy on the Internet, because States \nalready anticipate that the sales tax they have in place is going to be \npaid on every purchase. When that money comes back, part usually goes \nto the State, part goes to the county, part goes to the towns. That is \nto provide for their schools, fire protection, for all of the services \npeople who live in the communities are used to. I can tell you that in \nWyoming that makes up at least 30 percent of everybody's budget. I know \nin one town it is 70 percent of their budget.\n  So if you start eliminating the sales tax by getting products from \nout of State, you are wiping out services in the local communities. \nThose local communities are where the Main Street retailers, the \nshopping center retailers--the brick-and-mortar retailers--are the ones \npaying property tax. They are hiring local people, and they are also \nparticipating in the community in a number of ways. School yearbooks \nprobably wouldn't exist without the participation of the local \nmerchants.\n  We want to continue to encourage the local merchants, and so we came \nup with the small seller exemption of $1 million. You don't start \ncollecting the tax and you don't need to get the free software to be \nable to collect the tax until you hit the $1 million mark in a year, \nand then that would go into effect.\n  We looked into a number of different levels. Our older bill had \\1/2\\ \nmillion in the Senate bill and the House had $1 million in their bill. \nI said, Let's give a little more flexibility. Let's go with the $1 \nmillion. So that is how we wound up with $1 million.\n  I will comment more on this later, but I see my fellow Senator is \nhere who would probably like to make a comment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Enzi and \nSenator Alexander. I completely agree with their position.\n  I had a chance to talk about this issue when we were debating it on \nthe budget issue. The bill simply removes an impediment from the States \nbeing able to collect the sales taxes that are due. It responds to the \nQuill decision about requiring a physical presence in a State in order \nto require that State to collect the sales tax.\n  Senator Enzi points out there are no new taxes; that it is a matter \nof basic fairness. It really does help small businesses. The brick-and-\nmortar companies located in our neighborhoods, small shopowners who \nbuild a neighborhood and build a community, are the ones who are at \nrisk where they have to pay sales taxes and yet their competitors \ndon't.\n  I will give a short example with a story told to me about a retailer \nselling electronic goods. The consumer came into the shop, looked and \nfound the product she wanted, went on the Internet, found the product \nfor the same price on the Internet but didn't have to pay the sales \ntax, and literally bought it while the shopowner was watching--after \nthe shopowner had given that individual personal service. The shopowner \ndidn't lose the sale because of competitiveness but lost the sale \nbecause of tax avoidance. This bill would correct that.\n  This is $23 billion. This is a lot of money our States are not \ncollecting. These are taxes that are already imposed. In my own State \nof Maryland, it is somewhere between $150 million and $300 million of \ntaxes that could be used to reduce tax burdens to the taxpayers in my \nState.\n  It is a matter of basic fairness, something that needs to be done. As \nSenator Enzi pointed out, it will simplify the sales tax collections by \nusing the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, and we exempt small \nsellers of $1-million-or-below sales. So it is an issue that needs to \nbe passed, and I am pleased that we are finally getting around to \npassing it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I have never supported the sequestration. I always \nthought it was a big mistake. These are across-the-board, mindless cuts \nthat say every priority in government is identical to the other. That \nis not the case.\n  If you had a problem in your family budget and you had to reduce some \nspending and you had money put aside for your mortgage payment, your \nrent payment, or your family food budget, and maybe some money for a \nweekend\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\ntrip, you wouldn't identically cut every category. You may give up that \nweekend trip in order to be able to save the roof over your family or \nput food on the table. Sequestration says every priority in government \nis the same.\n  It is also not directed to where we need to go to reduce the deficit. \nOnce again, sequestration primarily applies to domestic discretionary \nspending. It provides a fourth round of cuts when we have already had \ncuts over the last 3 years. For the agencies that are affected, it is \nequivalent to about a 10-percent cut. You can't do that without \nseriously affecting the mission of the agencies, and that is wrong. \nThat is why I have said from the beginning, let's replace \nsequestration.\n  March 1 came; sequestration came; people woke up the next day and \nsaid, What is the big deal? Well, we are finding out what the big deal \nis all about. We just heard from the FAA, the air traffic controllers, \nthat because of sequestration they have very little option--85 percent \nof their operational budget is in personnel, and air traffic \ncontrollers are most of the personnel. Therefore, they have announced \nthey have to furlough 11 days during the remainder of this fiscal year. \nThat comes out to about one furlough day over each work period. It is \nas much as a 10-percent reduction in the workforce to man our towers to \nmake sure air traffic is managed safely. You can't do that with that \ntype of reduction, and we are now looking at whether there are going to \nbe significant delays of flights. Those types of cuts are ridiculous. \nWe know better than that. There is no question about it, these are the \ntypes of things that are going to hurt our economy if we can't have a \nreliable air traffic service.\n  I was talking to one of the nonprofits in Maryland that manages a \nHead Start Program, and they were telling me about what the fall \nenrollment is going to be. They have a waiting list of families who \nwant their children in Head Start and qualify for Head Start and aren't \ngoing to be able to get into a Head Start Program. Why? Because of \nsequestration. The waiting list will get longer. Children will be \ndenied the ability to go to Head Start Programs. Did we intend that? I \ndon't think so. I don't think our colleagues wanted to say we were \ngoing to balance our budgets on the backs of children being denied Head \nStart placement.\n  I was at the National Institutes of Health not too long ago. The \nresearch they do is so critically important to our country's future. It \nis not only the fact that they are discovering the answers to dread \ndiseases or ways in which we can keep people healthy. They are now \nworking on developing a universal flu vaccine against the influenza so \nyou don't have to get a vaccine every year. Think how many lives that \ncan save. It is also the basic research we need in order to create the \njobs in the bioscience areas and the tech areas. This is about creating \nmore jobs in our communities. Now they are going to have to give up \ngrants as a result of sequestration even though today they are only \napproving about one out of every seven worthwhile grant applications. \nWe certainly didn't intend that through sequestration.\n  I could talk about new transit starts. We have some very exciting \nprograms in Baltimore, Washington, and Maryland--a purple line to \nprovide transit between the Washington suburban counties and Maryland. \nWe have transit programs in Baltimore. We have the corridor cities \nalong the 270 corridor. We have southern Maryland that needs help. All \nthese programs need to compete for a limited amount of funds. Now, \nbecause of sequestration, there are going to be less funds available, \nmeaning we are going to have more traffic jams rather than less. Do we \nmean for that to happen?\n  I could go on and on. I could talk about the cuts to the Department \nof Defense and what they have to go through. These weren't cuts we \ninitiated, saying this program needs to be reduced. These aren't the \ntypes of deliberative actions a Congress would do. It is saying we are \ngoing to do a meat ax approach and tell the agency: You cut your \nprogram by this percentage amount. We advertised it a little over 5 \npercent, but in reality it is much higher than that because these cuts \nover a 7-month period reflect a year's reduction. So the cuts are even \nmore severe when used on an annual basis.\n  Our Federal workforce deserves more. These are people working hard \nproviding vital services in our country, whether it is protecting our \nborders or doing research or keeping our food supply safe or making \nsure our seniors get Social Security checks. The list goes on and on. \nIt is not fair to those who signed up to serve the public as Federal \nworkers, and it is certainly not fair to our economy. This is having a \nvery damaging impact on the economy of this country. We have already \nseen in the most recent job reports a slowdown of more than we \npredicted, and most economists say it is directly related to these \nacross-the-board sequestration cuts.\n  So what should we do? We are in session. It is time for us to act. We \nare in the fiscal budget year 2013. Yes, we passed a budget at the end \nof last year. I think it was on January 1 when it finally got around to \npassing. We passed it at the sequestration levels saying we hoped we \nwould figure out a budget plan to avoid the sequestration cuts in this \nyear. So let us consider a way to avoid these mindless across-the-board \ncuts, and substitute it for sensible reductions that we know will not \nhave the same type of unintended consequences on services that are \nvitally important to our economy and to the people of this country.\n  There are areas where we have savings. We know that. We have that in \nthe overseas contingency accounts under the Department of Defense. We \nknow we can find savings in tax expenditures. We spend $1.2 trillion a \nyear in tax expenditures. We know we can certainly find some savings on \ntax expenditures. I think we have to look at a broader level than just \nthese discretionary spending accounts that are particularly devastated \nby these sequestration cuts.\n  I urge this body to find a way we can replace sequestration for \nfiscal year 2013--this current fiscal year--by more responsible budget \nsavings, and then, working through our appropriations committees, \nworking through the Budget Committee and the other committees for \nfiscal year 2014, have time under a more normal legislative process to \nfigure out our spending priorities to go beyond the appropriate \ndollars--what we do on the Tax Code, what we do under mandatory \nspending. Let's bring up that game plan after the next fiscal year, \n2014, which begins October 1. But for the current situation, let's \nreplace sequestration with a more sensible way to get those savings, \nrather than causing harm--whether it is to those who depend upon air \ntraffic, those who depend upon a place in Head Start, those who rely \nupon the research done at NIH, or those who depend upon having adequate \nsupport within our military. All of the above are adversely affected by \nsequestration. It is time for us to take action, to do what we were \nsupposed to do: Make the tough decisions. Don't take the way out that \nevery program in government is of equal importance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor to oppose \nthe cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the so-called \nMarketplace Fairness Act. I, of course, would like to, I think \nproperly, name it the Internet Tax Collection Act because that is what \nit is. I strongly oppose this bill which has very serious flaws to it \nand very serious ramifications for not only businesses in my State, \nonline businesses where we have seen great growth, but also online \nbusinesses across this Nation.\n  I strongly disagree with the decision to fast-track this bill, to \nskip the regular markup process of the Finance Committee. Both the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and the ranking \nRepublican on the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, had opposed going \nto this bill without the committee doing its work.\n  Why? There are a number of concerns that have been raised about this \nbill by Members on both sides of the aisle. At a very minimum, we \nbelieve these concerns warrant a thorough vetting through the regular \norder. That is why I, along with Senators Wyden, Tester, Shaheen, \nRubio, Lee, and Cruz wrote a letter to the majority leader expressing \nthese concerns, asking again for regular order for this bill. But here \nwe are. Cloture was invoked and I suspect the\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\nsupporters of this bill certainly do not want to go through the markup \nprocess so here we are again without regular order.\n  This bill is wrong for a great area of growth for our country, which \nis online businesses. Small business owners get hit the worst under \nthis bill. Small business owners from my State of New Hampshire have \ntold me--and large businesses from my State of New Hampshire that do \nbusiness online have told me--this legislation would make it harder for \nthem to do business. During the recent Senate work period, I held two \nroundtable discussions in New Hampshire, one in Manchester and one in \nPortsmouth. It was a great opportunity to hear directly from those on \nthe ground what the implications of this bill will be to business \nowners in my State. I would like to share a sampling of the feedback \nfrom businesses in New Hampshire about this bill.\n  Russ Gaitskill, who is the president and CEO of Garnet Hill, in \nFranconia, NH: ``It's going to be a nightmare.''\n  He sent to my office an example of what he would have to do. \nUnderstand what this will make online businesses have to do in this \ncountry. They now become the tax collectors for other States, even \nthough they do not rely on the services in those States, they do not \nuse the roads in those States, they don't get to vote for the \nRepresentatives in those States. Taxation without representation, that \nis what this bill is about. They now have to collect for the rest of \nthe Nation's 9,600 tax jurisdictions of different not only State sales \ntaxes but local and county sales taxes.\n  I want to use one example of what this is like and what an \nadministrative nightmare this is for businesses. This is 1 page of a \n40-page sales tax manual that is an example of what any online business \nacross the Nation could have to face. In New Hampshire, if there is a \ncustomer from Illinois who chooses to buy from an online business in \nNew Hampshire--here we are. If the person lives in Grand Prairie, it is \na 6.5-percent rate. But if the person is from Colona or Collison, a \n6.5-percent rate or if you live in Dow, it is a 7-percent rate.\n  There are 9,600 different tax jurisdictions across this Nation and \nthe people pushing this bill, the proponents, say: Oh, no problem for \nthese businesses. Just use software. Every business has this software. \nIt is going to be easy as pie.\n  So when Dow changes their tax rate half a percent, the whole program \nchanges. Yes, that burden is put on the business. Talk about an \nadministrative nightmare. Do you know why. Because States are in a \nposition where they want to use that as a cash grab to make other \nStates and online businesses do their work of tax collecting for them \ninstead of them doing it themselves. I cannot believe my colleagues are \ngoing to go along with this and those who are pushing it.\n  I think it is especially odd there are Republicans who want to create \nthis kind of complicated tax mess. I hear from my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle all the time about how we are going to cut through \nregulations, we are going to make it easier for businesses. A lot of my \ncolleagues on the Republican end are pushing this notion that a \nbusiness--oh, just let them purchase some software and then let them \ntry to collect for almost 9,600 tax jurisdictions in the Nation. What \ncould possibly go wrong for an online business? Many of them, smaller \nbusinesses in this country, are trying to thrive, trying to grow \nthrough a difficult time in our country.\n  I also heard from E Laundry and Dry Cleaners, a small business \nfounded in 1921 in Manchester. About 70 percent of E's sales are now \nInternet based. The company's president said he would not have the \nresources to calculate, collect, and deliver sales taxes for thousands \nof jurisdictions across the country.\n  A bakery in my hometown of Nashua echoed that sentiment. Susan Lozier \nRoberts of Frederick's Pastries--and anybody who has been there, yum. I \ncan understand why people across the country would want to get some \nFrederick's pastries. Susan said it would create mass confusion, \nkeeping up with all the individual State tax codes.\n  I heard the same from one of the most prominent maple sugar producers \nin the State. In New Hampshire, we are a State that prides itself on \nits maple sugar products. Peter Thomson--his father was the late Gov. \nMel Thomson, a wonderful figure in the history of our State--said it \nwould be a burden we just couldn't afford.\n  Ken Smith, the owner of Maine-ly New Hampshire, said: I physically \ndon't have the manpower or the hours to be able to handle something \nlike this.\n  Jenn Coffey, another business owner, said: If I had to become a tax \ncollector on top of what I am already trying to do as a startup--we all \nknow how hard it is so start your own business, by the way--she said: I \nwould be out of business.\n  I also heard widespread concerns about the threat from faraway audits \nthat this legislation would bring. That is the poster board I had up \nthere, with all these tax rates. In every single one of those \njurisdictions, if we divide it by county or we divide it by State, when \na business in another State, in New Hampshire, for example--if they are \nselling to a customer in Illinois, they can then, if their computer \nprogram that everyone is saying is so easy doesn't calculate it right, \nthey can be hauled in for an audit in another State where they do not \nhave any physical presence. What do they do? They have to get a lawyer \nin another State. They have to deal in a court system in another State \nor with auditors with a department of revenue. Whom do they deal with? \nTalk about administrative nightmare, to be dragged into another State \nfor potential audits, to have to hire lawyers in other States--what an \nadministrative mess this bill will create.\n\n  It is truly shocking to think that people actually want to say this \nsomehow is going to level the playing field or make it more fair, when \nit puts this great burden on businesses.\n  Travis Adams, with whaddy.com, based in Nashua, said: One tax audit \nfrom another State or jurisdiction would completely crush us.\n  Ben Baker, an online retailer in Barrington, said: Small businesses \nlike mine just can't handle that kind of accounting burden. If I have \nto hire a bookkeeper or pay my current offsite accountants \nsignificantly more per month to track all this, you can bet my plans to \nexpand my business in the next 6 months are a lot less likely.\n  Paul Ford, an online dealer in Portsmouth, perhaps summed it best \nwhen he said: The last thing we need is legislation like this.\n  I would also like to mention a comment from Joel Maloy, a friend of \nmine, a great business owner in New Hampshire, president of Polaris \nDirect. He said: This is not about making Main Street more competitive. \nIt is about passing new taxes on to consumers. That is consistent with \nwhat other business owners have told me from across New Hampshire, and \nI have certainly also heard it from businesses across the Nation. They \nknow this is not about competitiveness. It is about helping States get \nmore money to spend on programs they cannot afford.\n  That is what the Wall Street Journal said this week. The paper called \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act an online revenue raid. They said this is \na bill--of course, do you know who is pushing this bill? Big business, \nbig retail business. Do you know what it does, according to the Wall \nStreet Journal--and I fully agree with them on this--``. . . big \nbusiness and big government are uniting to pursue their mutual interest \nin sticking it to the little guy.''\n  ``[B]ig business and big government are uniting to pursue their \nmutual interest in sticking it to the little guy.'' Haven't we had \nenough of that in our Nation? The paper concluded that ``the new \nrevenues will merely fund larger government.''\n  Some of my conservative colleagues have tried to justify their \nsupport for this big government bill on the notion that their States \nwill be able to reduce their income or sales tax. I think we all \nunderstand there is no requirement in this bill that States have to \nreduce some other tax burden if they collect taxes in this way. This is \njust about spending more money.\n  Let's talk about the Constitution. By imposing collection \nrequirements on businesses that have no physical presence outside their \nhome State, I also fear this is going to trample on existing State \nsovereignty. Under current Supreme Court precedent, in the absence of \nan actual sufficient nexus, a State cannot reach beyond its borders\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\nto compel out-of-State Internet vendors to collect taxes on a \nparticular transaction. That is the Quill decision.\n  By usurping and changing the standard, it would undermine an \nimportant limitation in the commerce clause, the nexus requirement. So \nnow your nexus with a State is a click; instead of a physical presence \nin a State. If an online business in New Hampshire has to collect and \nremit sales taxes for online customers from Massachusetts, what is to \nprevent Congress from later expanding the commerce clause even further \nto require New Hampshire brick-and-mortar businesses to collect the \nMassachusetts tax, because Massachusetts has already tried to do this \nto New Hampshire. In fact, when I was attorney general of the State, we \nbrought a case to the Massachusetts Supreme Court because there were \ncustomers from Massachusetts who came over to buy some tires in New \nHampshire and the Massachusetts DRA tried to get New Hampshire \nbusinesses to collect that tax.\n  That is exactly what we are doing with this bill. It actually places \nan unfair burden on online businesses versus brick-and-mortar \nbusinesses that are in that situation that now do not have to collect \nthat. But I worry that will be the next step for businesses in my State \nof New Hampshire and other States across this Nation that do not have a \nsales tax.\n  What about stores that sell through catalogs. Their customers are \nfrequently older and less likely to have transportation or be online. \nWill catalog vendors also have to collect and remit State sales taxes?\n  Finally, what about other unintended consequences on consumers, \nretirees, and investors? That is the type of information we would have \ntalked about in a committee hearing that we did not have on this bill \nbefore the Finance Committee. There was a hearing, but there was no \nmarkup. A markup is when we try to improve and deal with unintended \nconsequences to a bill.\n  Could this bill open the door to taxes on financial services or \ntransaction taxes? Some of the financial organizations have raised that \nissue. In my home State of New Hampshire, it is a matter of pride that \nwe do not have a sales tax, and this bill tramples on that choice for \nthe State of New Hampshire. That is because we know it gives our \nretailers, yes, an advantage in a competitive marketplace, but we also \nknow low taxes are the result of low spending. This legislation \nthreatens to trample on retailers in all States, forcing them to become \ntax collectors for other States--nearly 9,600 tax jurisdictions, as I \nhave mentioned.\n\n  I said it before, and I will say it again. This truly is taxation \nwithout representation because businesses in New Hampshire or online \nbusinesses in other States can now be subject to doing the business of \ngovernments in other States, of collecting their taxes, when they don't \nelect the representatives there, when they don't rely on the roads \nthere or the services there. Here we have it--the ultimate in taxation \nwithout representation. I say to my conservative colleagues, why would \nthey want to support such authority given by the Federal Government?\n  Supporters of this amendment argue that they have created an \nexemption for small businesses of $1 million for small sellers, but \nthis amount is not indexed to anything. What about the business that is \n$1 million and $1 in sales? Then they have to do it, and it is going to \ndiscourage businesses from growing.\n  Also, this limit is far lower than the SBA--the Small Business \nAdministration--actually defines a small business.\n  Even with this exemption, trust me, once this exemption is in place \nand the States don't get all the revenue they want, they will be back. \nThey will be back before this body to say: We didn't get enough money, \nso the Senate needs to authorize us further. Get rid of the exemption. \nWe have a right to collect from those businesses as well or have them \ncollect for us as well because that is what it is--requiring them to \ncollect for us.\n  A broad coalition of groups is opposed to this far-reaching \nlegislation. Let me talk about a few of them.\n  No. 1, Americans for Tax Reform. Americans for Tax Reform said:\n\n       This legislation grants states new tax collection authority \n     without removing equivalent taxing authority elsewhere. \n     Therefore, this legislation can only be viewed as a tax \n     increase.\n\n  The Financial Services Roundtable said:\n\n       This legislation has the potential for unintended \n     consequences. It's important for Congress to explore all \n     possible outcomes and costs of this proposal, especially the \n     impact on consumers.\n       A transaction tax on financial services products will hurt \n     retail investors, retired Americans, and small businesses, \n     effectively making it more expensive for them to invest and \n     plan for the long term. Without hearings, these implications \n     and others will not be properly addressed.\n\n  Again, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association has \nraised similar concerns, saying that this could lead to a financial \ntransaction tax which will hurt all of us.\n  TechNet opposes this, saying:\n\n       Imposing a new Internet sales tax regime is a tremendously \n     complex issue that should be addressed through regular order, \n     starting in the Senate Finance Committee, and done in a \n     thorough and deliberative manner.\n\n  That has not been done here.\n\n       We should not rush a proposal that is riddled with holes \n     and, most importantly, does not provide enough protections \n     for small businesses, the back bone of our economy.\n\n  Americans for Prosperity opposes this. Americans for Prosperity says:\n\n       This bill would not level the playing field; it would \n     burden online retailers in a way that brick-and-mortar stores \n     are not. Complying with the internet sales tax would be a \n     considerable administrative burden for companies, \n     particularly for small businesses.\n\n  Freedom Works opposes this as well. Heritage Action for America \nopposes this. The National Taxpayers Union opposes this. The \nCompetitive Enterprise Union opposes this. Competitive Enterprise \nInstitute opposes this, as well as the Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste. These are groups that are committed to low taxes, \nless government, and free enterprise so we can have a strong economy.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--\nespecially my colleagues on this side of the aisle--to listen to the \nred flags these groups and several of my other colleagues have raised.\n  I will conclude by once again restating the serious concerns I have \nabout this legislation. I have concerns about the impact on small \nbusiness owners in my State and in States across the Nation. I have \nconcerns about the impact on online businesses that have been such an \narea of growth for this country.\n  The concerns about the administrative application of this bill--I \nshowed my colleagues all the tax jurisdictions. To put that burden on \nbusinesses is absolutely wrong. It is wrong for creating jobs in this \ncountry, and it is absolutely wrong to put such an administrative \nburden on people who are working so hard in starting their businesses \nand thriving and making sure they grow.\n  I believe we are opening Pandora's box with this bill, and this \nshouldn't be done in the manner it has been--without regular order. We \nare talking about a massive reorganization on how sales taxes are \ncollected in this country. What will be next? What will the States ask \nus for the authority to tax next? That should be a very big question \nfor our colleagues.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to put the brakes on this bill and \nto think about the harm this legislation would do to small online \nretailers across America. When consumers and online retailers in the \nStates of my colleagues find out what is actually in this bill and they \ndon't understand why their Senators would support an online sales tax \nbill, I know they will raise many concerns to my colleagues when they \nhave the administrative burden and the nightmare of trying to collect \nfor 9,600 tax jurisdictions in this Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation that will level the playing field for brick-and-mortar \nretailers in Minnesota and across our Nation. I join my bipartisan \ngroup of friends, including Senators Durbin, Enzi, Heitkamp, and \nAlexander, in support of the legislation we are debating this week, the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. It will simply allow States to help their \nbrick-and-mortar retailers, including the mom-and-pop shops on Main \nStreet, stay competitive in a marketplace where online sales\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\nhave become a fact of life. This legislation is a commonsense measure \nthat brings our sales tax laws into the 21st century.\n  In Minnesota the retail industry includes nearly half a million \nworkers--about one in five jobs in our State--and those retailers need \nto compete on price and on service every single day. But the current \nsales tax system makes it impossible for them to compete on an even \nplaying field.\n  Take Michael Norby, who owns Norby's, a department store in downtown \nDetroit Lakes, MN, whom I met last August. His situation and what I \nhave learned from him explains a lot about why I support this bill. \nNorby's has been in his family since 1906. Mr. Norby wants to compete \nwith the big guys--with the Amazons and the Overstocks of the world. He \nsaid he can compete with anybody just as long as it is on a level \nplaying field. He said: Once you bring those guys onto the same playing \nfield as the rest of us, we will compete with them.\n  But there is a problem. Mr. Norby described what they see in Norby's \nevery day. We have heard it from other Senators. It is called \nshowrooming. The customers come and check out the merchandise, they get \nhelp from a sales associate, then they pull out their smart phones and \nsay: I can get this cheaper online. When Norby's has to collect sales \ntax and the other guys don't, it makes it impossible to compete. Mr. \nNorby describes this simply as an issue of fairness. And he is right.\n  Brick-and-mortar stores such as his should be able to compete on the \nsame terms as online retailers. That is what this bill does, and that \nis why Mr. Norby supports the Marketplace Fairness Act. But it is not \njust about fairness. When Mr. Norby is able to compete on fair terms, \nhe will be able to hire more people. That is what will happen when the \nMarketplace Fairness Act passes. And what goes for Norby's goes for \nother businesses around Minnesota. The Marketplace Fairness Act is \ngoing to help the local businesses in our communities that provide jobs \nto our constituents. And when customers shop at local retailers, that \nmoney then supports the local community and it stays in that community.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act will help our States and our communities \nin another way. State and local budgets have been hit really hard since \nthe great recession. One thing that has meant is that even though the \nprivate sector jobs have grown for the past 37 months, the public \nsector has shed a tremendous number of essential jobs--teachers, \nfirefighters, police officers. That is why so many Governors across \nthis country support efforts of reform, because it is the right thing \nto do for their States.\n  Republican Governors in Alabama, Arizona, South Dakota, Georgia, \nSouth Carolina, Idaho, and many other States support the concept of \nleveling the playing field for small businesses because it brings much \nneeded revenue to their States without creating a new tax. There is no \nnew tax created here. It is simply going to improve compliance under \nexisting laws.\n  Minnesota has lost an estimated $397 million in revenue in 2011 alone \nfrom taxes owed but not collected on remote sales. I am sure that $397 \nmillion could do a lot for the people of Minnesota, including hiring \nback some of those teachers and firefighters and police officers, \nmaking improvements in infrastructure, in education, and in so many of \nthe things that create prosperity and that affect the middle class.\n  I have heard from big retailers in Minnesota, such as Best Buy and \nTarget, about how important this issue is, but I have also heard from \ncountless mom-and-pop stores, such as Norby's Department Store. I have \nspoken with the Minnesota Retailers Association and the Metro \nIndependent Business Alliance. In addition to retailers, I have heard \nfrom the League of Minnesota Cities, from mayors across the State, and \nfrom our Governor--all who understand what that revenue they are \nmissing can do for our communities.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is bipartisan, and it is a commonsense \nbill. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business as my remarks will not relate to the business at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to talk about the bill \nthat is on the floor. I agree with Senator Franken--this is a bill that \nenjoys bipartisan support. We saw in the budget debate just how broad \nand how bipartisan that support is. It is the right thing to do. It is \nthe fair thing to do. It is a situation where government no longer \ndecides that one business located in a community that provides the \npolice protection, the sidewalk, and whatever else one might use as one \ngoes into a local store and looks something over, is disadvantaged over \na business that is located somewhere else.\n  Also, there is a fundamental policy of the importance of having laws \non the books that are actually enforced. In almost all the States--I \nthink the number is somewhere near 37 or 38 States--this tax is \ncurrently due. This tax is supposed to be voluntarily paid, and winking \nand nodding on not paying this tax creates real concerns. I think in \nMissouri last year--a State where this tax is supposed to be paid as a \nuse tax--300 people filed that they owed this tax and paid some of that \nuse tax. Now, my absolute certain guess is that more than 300 \nMissourians received something in the mail at their house that didn't \nhave taxes paid on it when they received it.\n  So my view would be that we should do one of two things: We should \neither take all of those laws off the books or determine a way where \nthe laws that States have are actually able to be enforced by those \nStates.\n  States have a right to decide, no, we don't want to be a part of this \ncompact. We don't want to be a part of it. We don't want this sales tax \nrevenue. We don't want to collect the money that is due on the same \nproduct in our State. But they also have the right to say, yes, that is \nour law, and we need to collect that tax, and we do not want to pick \nwinners and losers.\n  From the point of view of some of the most conservative leaders in \nthe country, including those who are in government--Al Cardenas, the \nchairman of the American Conservative Union, says:\n\n       When it comes to state sales taxes, it is time to address \n     the area where federally mandated prejudice is most \n     egregious--the policy toward Internet sales, the decades old \n     inequity between online and in-person sales as outdated and \n     unfair.\n\n  Governor Mike Pence from Indiana says:\n\n       I don't think Congress should be in the business of picking \n     winners and losers. Inaction by Congress today results in a \n     system today that does pick winners and losers.\n\n  Another Indiana Governor, Mitch Daniels, said:\n\n       Sales taxes that states impose ought to be paid, and paid \n     by everybody equally and collected by everybody in the retail \n     business.\n\n  Art Laffer, in a Wall Street Journal article just this week, said:\n\n       The principle of levying the lowest possible tax rate on \n     the broadest possible tax base is the way to improve the \n     incentives to work, save and produce--which are necessary to \n     reinvigorate the American economy and cope with the nation's \n     fiscal problems. Properly addressing the problem of e-\n     fairness on the state level is a small, but important step \n     toward achieving this goal.\n\n  Art Laffer--President Reagan's adviser on exactly that concept of \nhaving a tax that is fairly applied in the broadest possible way--is \nsupportive of this, along with Mitch Daniels and Mike Pence and Al \nCardenas and many other conservatives who have looked at this as both a \nfairness issue and an issue of simply providing a way that States are \nallowed to enforce their law.\n  Regulating interstate commerce is one of the principal reasons to \nhave a Constitution and a Federal Government.\n\n\n                         Essential Services Act\n\n  Mr. President, the other thing I would like to talk about is what \nhappened beginning on Sunday in the country as people tried to travel \nwhen approximately 47,000 Federal Aviation Administration employees \nwere furloughed, and furloughed in a way that created needless airport \ndelays nationwide.\n  The announcement came on the heels of a report that the President has \ncut other public services, such as the self-guided tours at the White \nHouse. I cannot imagine how much the self-guided\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\ntours at the White House cost, but I do know it was cut when for almost \nevery school student in America who comes to Washington, one of the \nthings they would like to see is the White House. So I guess there is \nsome immediate pain involved there, just like there has been pain \ninvolved at airports since Sunday.\n  The airline industry was not even told until late last week that this \nwas going to happen. This has been mismanagement, and intentional \nmismanagement. As late as September 28, the Office of Management and \nBudget sent out a notice to the entire executive branch of the \ngovernment that said: Spend your money--this is for the spending year \nthat begins October 1--spend your money like the law will not be \nobeyed. Suddenly, 6 months into the spending year, the spending caps, \nthe budget caps, the amount of money that had been appropriated beyond \nthat--it is twice as big a problem as it would have been October 1. \nThen you have to give notice to people that they are going to be \nfurloughed, if that is the option you have taken, and it is a bigger \nproblem than it needed to be.\n  During his sworn testimony before Congress last week, FAA \nAdministrator Michael Huerta admitted that the agency has the \nflexibility under current law to transfer up to 2 percent of funding \nfrom one activity to another without congressional action, and also \nthey could ask to transfer up to 5 percent--setting priorities--by \nasking Congress. It would be 2 percent without even asking Congress and \n5 percent by asking Congress that could be transferred.\n  There was a serious discussion and an amendment offered early this \nyear in the continuing resolution debate to give the agencies the \nauthority they needed to set priorities between now and September 30. \nBut the administration clearly said it did not want to be able to set \nthose priorities.\n  The idea that any reduction in Federal spending has to create the \nmaximum amount of pain is offensive to me. I think it is offensive to \nmost Americans.\n  The FAA currently spends $2.7 billion annually on nonpersonnel costs. \nThe day they started this, saving $600 million by furloughing \nemployees, they announced $474 million of new grants for sustainable \nand livable communities.\n  I am actually for sustainable and livable communities, but this is a \nnew program. It is a program that I would bet a considerable amount of \nmoney that if the Department of Transportation would have come to \nCongress and said: Could we spend this $474 million on keeping the \nairlines and the airports working--the freight that goes all over the \ncountry, the people who go all over the country to do business and \ncreate jobs--I will bet you Congress would have said: Absolutely, take \nthat $474 million. Do not announce those new grants that you have not \ntold anybody they have yet and use it to solve this problem, while we \nwork to see if there are better ways to solve this problem.\n  Last week, I introduced the Essential Services Act as a standalone \nbill. I introduced that same act, in fact, during the continuing \nresolution debate. We were able to get a part of it into the continuing \nresolution for food safety inspectors.\n  But what the Essential Services Act says is that people who are \nessential to public health and safety have to show up for work. The \nbasis for that is President Clinton, in 1995, on August 22, issued a \nletter, an excerpt from which I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 22, 1995.\n\n       MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\n\n     FROM: Alice M. Rivlin Director\n     SUBJECT: Agency Plans for Operations During Funding Hiatus\n       OMB Bulletin 80-14, dated August 28, 1980 (and amended by \n     the OMB Director's memorandum of November 17, 1981) requires \n     all agencies to maintain contingency plans to deal with a \n     possible appropriations hiatus. The bulletin requires agency \n     plans to be consistent with the January 16, 1981 opinion of \n     the Attorney General on this subject.\n       The Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     has issued an opinion dated August 16, 1995 that updates the \n     1981 opinion. A copy of the August 16th opinion is attached. \n     You should review your plans in light of this opinion, make \n     any changes necessary to conform to the opinion, and \n     otherwise ensure your plan is up to date.\n       Please send a copy of your updated plan to your OMB program \n     examiner no later than September 5, 1995. Any questions \n     should be directed to your program examiner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                      Office of Legal Counsel,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 16, 1995.\n\n MEMORANDUM FOR ALICE RIVLIN DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\n\n     From: Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General\n     Re: Government Operations in the Event of a Lapse in \n         Appropriations\n       This memorandum responds to your request to the Attorney \n     General for advice regarding the permissible scope of \n     government operations during a lapse in appropriations.\n       The Constitution provides that ``no money shall be drawn \n     from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made \n     by law.'' U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 9, cl. 7. The treasury is \n     further protected through the Antideficiency Act, which among \n     other things prohibits all officers and employees of the \n     federal government from entering into obligations in advance \n     of appropriations and prohibits employing federal personnel \n     except in emergencies, unless otherwise authorized by law. \n     See 31 U.S.C. 1341 et seq.\n       In the early 1980s, Attorney General Civiletti issued two \n     opinions with respect to the implications of the \n     Antideficiency Act. See ``Applicability of the Antideficiency \n     Act Upon A Lapse in an Agency's Appropriations,'' 4A Op. \n     O.L.C. 16 (1980); ``Authority for the Continuance of \n     Government Functions During a Temporary Lapse in \n     Appropriations,'' 5 Op. O.L.C. 1 (1981) (1981 Opinion). The \n     1981 Opinion has frequently been cited in the ensuing years. \n     Since that opinion was written, the Antideficiency Act has \n     been amended in one respect, and we analyze the effect of \n     that amendment below. The amendment amplified on the \n     emergencies exception for employing federal personnel by \n     providing that ``[a]s used in this section, the term \n     `emergencies involving the safety of human life or the \n     protection of property' does not include ongoing, regular \n     functions of government the suspension of which would not \n     imminently threaten the safety of human life or the \n     protection of property.'' 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1342.\n       With respect to the effects of this amendment, we continue \n     to adhere to the view expressed to General Counsel Robert \n     Damus of the Office of Management and Budget that ``the 1990 \n     amendment to 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1342 does not detract from the \n     Attorney General's earlier analyses; if anything, the \n     amendment clarified that the Antideficiency Act's exception \n     for emergencies is narrow and must be applied only when a \n     threat to life or property is imminent.'' Letter from Walter \n     Dellinger to Robert G. Damus, October 19, 1993. In order to \n     ensure that the clarification of the 1990 amendment is not \n     overlooked, we believe that one aspect of the 1981 Opinion's \n     description of emergency governmental functions should be \n     modified. Otherwise, the 1981 Opinion continues to be a sound \n     analysis of the legal authorities respecting government \n     operations when Congress has failed to enact regular \n     appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to cover a \n     hiatus between regular appropriations. . . .\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. That letter from Alice Rivlin, the Director of OMB, says: \nHere are the people who have to show up for work if the government \nshuts down. The government did shut down, we all remember, in 1995, and \nthese people did show up for work.\n  On April 6, 2011, it appeared we might have another government \nshutdown, and the Obama administration put out a similar letter based \non the same groups of people. These are not hard people to identify, as \nit turns out. On April 6, 2011, the examples they gave of essential \nemployees who would have to work would be: FAA employees who would keep \nthe air traffic control system open, FEMA disaster operations would \ncontinue, Social Security checks would be sent out to beneficiaries, \nthe National Weather Service alerts and forecasts would be maintained, \nthe U.S. Postal Service would continue to collect mail and deliver \nmail, the Customs and Border Protection activity would continue, and \nthe food safety inspectors would show up.\n  There is a list. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this \nnotice from the Obama administration printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n          Email Guidance From OPM to Agencies (April 6, 2011)\n\n                     Shutdown Contingency Planning\n\n       The Administration is committed to working out a compromise \n     for funding the remainder of the fiscal year so that we can \n     avoid a costly and disruptive shutdown that\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\n     would imperil our economic recovery. Yet, the Administration \n     is preparing for all possible outcomes.\n       In the event of a Government shutdown, Federal departments, \n     agencies, and the District of Columbia are legally prohibited \n     from incurring further financial obligations for those \n     activities that are funded by the annual appropriations that \n     have lapsed--with the exception that an agency may incur \n     those obligations that are necessary to carry out an orderly \n     suspension of operations and to perform certain legally-\n     defined ``excepted'' activities. Excepted activities include \n     the safety of life and protection of property. (Since the \n     general prohibition on incurring obligations relates to those \n     activities that are funded by the annual appropriations that \n     have lapsed, an agency may continue to carry out activities \n     that are supported by other sources of funding which continue \n     to remain available to the agency, such as existing balances \n     of a multiyear appropriation.) Across the Federal Government, \n     a shutdown would mean that many of the essential services \n     that Americans rely on would be suspended or required to \n     operate at lower levels, and many Federal employees would be \n     furloughed and unable to work.\n       Below is a snapshot of how many major Federal activities \n     would be affected. This is not a comprehensive list. For more \n     details, please contact the relevant Federal agency directly.\n\n\n              Examples of Services That Would Be Affected\n\n       The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) would not endorse \n     any single-family mortgage loans or have staff available to \n     process and approve new multifamily loans. FHA single-family \n     lending represents a market share of more than 20 percent of \n     overall loan volume (home purchases and re-financing).\n       No new approvals of SBA-guaranteed loans for business \n     working capital, real estate investment or job creation \n     activities would occur.\n       National Parks, National Forests, and the Smithsonian \n     Institution would be closed.\n       Those filing paper tax returns would not receive tax \n     refunds from the IRS, and many taxpayers would be unable to \n     receive service from the IRS to help them meet their tax \n     obligations. For example, 400 walk-in service centers would \n     be closed.\n       The Mine Safety and Health Administration would not be able \n     to conduct regular safety and health inspections.\n       Only emergency passport services would be open; normal \n     processing would not.\n       Department of Commerce grant-making programs for economic \n     development would cease, as would most payments by HUD's \n     Community Development Block Grant program to State and local \n     governments.\n       USDA would not be able to approve any grants, loans or loan \n     guarantees for its rural housing, utilities, business, and \n     community facilities programs.\n       Farm loans, farm payment, and enrollment in conservation \n     programs would cease.\n       Agricultural export credit and other agricultural trade \n     development and monitoring would stop.\n       The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund would \n     suspend its grants and technical assistance to communities \n     across the country, delaying investments that finance \n     businesses and create jobs in distressed neighborhoods.\n       Inspections of stock brokers, receipt and publication of \n     corporate financial disclosures, and routine oversight of \n     financial markets by Federal agencies would cease.\n       Enforcement actions would be postponed in all but a few \n     cases.\n       Certain FEMA flood mitigation and flood insurance \n     operations would be suspended.\n       Agricultural export credit activity and other agricultural \n     trade development and monitoring would cease.\n       Most of the Veterans Benefits Administration customer \n     support services would be suspended.\n       Most Department of Defense budget planning and preparation \n     would cease; military personnel would not receive paychecks \n     during a funding lapse.\n       Customer service would be reduced across the federal \n     government.\n       Department of Justice civil litigation activities, \n     including civil rights enforcement and defensive litigation \n     (where the U.S. government is a defendant), would mostly \n     stop.\n       Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) processing would cease.\n\n\n           Examples of Services That Would Remain Operational\n\n       The Federal Aviation Administration would keep the air \n     traffic control system open and safe.\n       FEMA disaster operations would continue.\n       Social Security checks would be sent to beneficiaries.\n       National Weather Service alerts and forecasts, as well as \n     volcano and earthquake monitoring by other agencies, would \n     continue.\n       The U.S. Postal Service would continue mail collection, \n     delivery, and other operations.\n       Customs and Border Protection activity would continue.\n       Military operations in Afghanistan, Libya, and Iraq would \n     continue.\n       NASA satellite missions currently in operation would \n     continue.\n       SNAP, WIC, and other child nutrition benefits would \n     continue.\n       Most Federal Student Aid operations would continue.\n       Core Federal law enforcement, such as the FBI and U.S. \n     Marshals, would continue, as would prison and detention \n     operations.\n       Medical services for veterans would continue to be \n     available.\n       FDA monitoring of drug imports would continue.\n       Meat and poultry inspection would continue.\n       Treasury's core payment and collection programs would \n     remain operational.\n       OMB is working diligently with Agencies to finalize \n     operational plans for all possible scenarios, including a \n     Government shutdown. We will continue to make new information \n     available to the media and general public as it is finalized.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. This is not very complicated. All the Essential Services \nAct says is that the people whom the government said had to show up if \nthere is no money to run the government would also be the people who \nwould be prioritized and would be allowed to show up if there is a 2.5-\npercent cut. Who can argue with that?\n  People are told: The weather is really bad today. If you think you \nhave some risk to your person to get to work, do not come in. But these \npeople are told: If you can possibly get to work, get to work. If the \nfood safety inspector does not get there, 500,000 Americans could not \nwork that day if they did not show up at every food safety facility \nwhere that one Federal employee has to be there for everybody to work. \nIf the air traffic controller does not get there, and the runways are \ncleared off and planes can land and planes can take off, that may not \nhappen if the air traffic controller is not there.\n  This says those people would not be subject to furlough under the new \nBudget Control Act. They would have the same priority on a day when \nthere is a reduction in the funding for a Department that they had in \nthe day when there was no funding for the Department. If people are \ntold they have to show up when there is no money to run the government, \nsurely those same people need to show up if there is a 2.5-percent \nreduction.\n  The definitions set by President Clinton and President Obama in their \nadministrations are fine with me for this purpose. Washington is living \noutside its means today. Federal spending has skyrocketed 19 percent \nsince 2008. The Federal debt is approaching $17 trillion. Clearly, we \nhave to do something about spending, and we can do that without \ninterrupting people's lives. We can do that by prioritizing what the \ngovernment should do.\n  Last week, we had Mr. Huerta before the Commerce Committee that \nSenator Rockefeller chairs and Senator Thune is the ranking Republican. \nI think it was on Wednesday. There was no discussion that on Sunday we \nare going to start furloughs of air traffic controllers.\n  In the legitimate oversight responsibility of our committee, we are \nto be told by the FAA Director: Our plans are drawn up. We are about to \nexecute them. I am here to testify before the Congress. I think one of \nthe things I should tell you is that all kinds of flights are going to \nbe delayed on Sunday and Monday because of this plan. It was not \nmentioned. Plenty of questions, even questions about how you were going \nto furlough employees, but no answers.\n  I encourage Americans to visit our Web site: bitly.com/cutwasteful\nspending. Let's find the things we can cut rather than finding things \nthat you cut--from the White House tours, to vaccines for kids, to air \ntraffic controllers, to border security guards. I hope we will do the \nright thing. I encourage Senator Reid to allow a vote on the Essential \nServices Act and prioritize the way we spend money.\n  Back to the start of my remarks, I am a proud cosponsor of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. Senator Pryor and I intend to offer an \namendment on that to just clarify current law, that we are not taxing \nuse of the Internet; we are just having a fair tax for products people \nbuy over the Internet.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise in response to my good friend, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, who obviously feels very passionately \nabout the bill, as do all of us who have worked for years and years to \ntry to create a marketplace that is fair and equitable for so many \npeople in this country, particularly our brick-and-mortar Main Street \nbusinesses.\n  I can certainly appreciate that remote sellers in New Hampshire who \nhave, in fact, enjoyed a nice opportunity to move products into the \nmarketplace free of any burden--unlike a Main Street business with any \ntax collection burden--that they do not want to lose that advantage \nthey have. In many States that advantage can be quite significant.\n  I want to give you an example. Today, in our news conference we heard \nfrom a woman named Teresa Miller. Teresa Miller sells pet supplies both \nin her store and remotely. She operates out of the State of Missouri, \nand in many of the jurisdictions where she sells pet supplies, the tax \nrate can be as high as 9.5 percent. She has a trained sales force that \nlistens to customers' concerns about their pets and what their pets \nneed in terms of nutrition.\n  The customer will walk out of the store, never to return. It is \npretty clear those customers are buying those products on the Internet \nhaving used the expertise of Ms. Miller's staff.\n  I would suggest that is exactly the situation that we are trying to \naddress. The Senator from New Hampshire raised a fair number of points \nwhich, ironically, can all be responded to and can be addressed by \nsimply reading the bill. The first point I want to make is the point \nthat someone will have to deal with upwards of 9,600 different \njurisdictions.\n  That is not true. In fact, this bill mandates that if you are going \nto expand your collection obligation to remote sellers, you need to \nparticipate as a State in a streamlined process either through the \nstreamlined process that is already set up or you need to look at a \nbill or some kind of process in your State that will reduce those \ncompliance burdens to simply 46 State jurisdictions.\n  The other concerns that have been raised--and I want to just take a \nmoment. Sometimes too often we do not actually look at what we are \ndebating. I want to take a moment and talk a little bit about page 3 of \nthe bill. Page 3 provides that in order to qualify, a single entity \nwithin the State responsible for all State and local taxes and return \nprocessing and audits for remote sales needs to be sourced to the \nState. There is a single audit requirement and a single State or use \ntax return.\n  So these jurisdictions will be limited to simply one within the \nState. The bill clearly provides that. In discussing the certified \nsoftware, talking about how that would provide additional burdens, \nagain, understand this bill requires that certified software be \nprovided for free to the remote seller. If the remote seller, in fact, \ndoes use the certified software, that certified software then gives \nthem immunity from any future tax liability and audits and gives them \nbasically the ability to say: I did my job. I did my due diligence. I \nused the software you told us to use. I do not expect that there is \ngoing to be an audit that could assess me any additional taxes having \nused that safe harbor.\n  The next issue the Senator from New Hampshire raised is the effect of \nthis bill on nexus requirements. It gets a little tricky because in law \nwe have an obligation in this body to regulate interstate commerce. But \nwhat we do not, I believe--and some people may disagree. I believe, as \na lawyer who has litigated a lot of cases, this body does not have the \nauthority to determine due process standards under the Constitution. To \nreiterate, it is clearly stated that nothing in this bill affects State \nnexus. So when the good Senator from New Hampshire suggests that this \nwill change nexus standards, that is absolutely incorrect.\n  The final issue I want to touch on is the issue of the financial \nservices tax. I want to make the point that in the bill itself it is \nclearly limited to imposing a sales and use tax obligation. It clearly \nstates no other tax will be, in fact, affected by this bill. So I think \nfrequently we get into discussions about what if. All of those \ndiscussions can be clearly clarified by simply reading the bill. That \nis what I would suggest. It is 11 pages. It is very straightforward. \nThere has been a lot of work put into this piece of legislation over \nvery many years, and a lot of accommodations, including an \naccommodation that you are only required to do this if you have $1 \nmillion in remote sales.\n  I am going to close with the words of Teresa Miller. When someone \nasked her how she would feel about this, because she also markets on \nthe Internet, she said she would be thrilled to have this obligation \nbecause it would mean that her remote sales exceeded $1 million.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. I would like to thank Chairman Rockefeller. I \nwould like to thank the two major sponsors of this bill, Senator Durbin \nand Senator Enzi, who have been working on this for years, and Senator \nHeitkamp for her longtime knowledge and leadership on this bill, as \nwell as Senator Alexander.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. It has \nbeen very important for years for businesses in Minnesota, both big and \nsmall, and across the country, giving them the certainty they need. \nThat is what this bill will do so they can succeed and grow.\n  I am encouraged to see the Senate coming together in a bipartisan way \nto create a level playing field for our businesses on Main Street to \ncompete. That is all they want to do. They just want an even playing \nfield to compete. The bipartisan support for the Marketplace Fairness \nAct is a reminder that when we put politics aside we can get things \ndone, something the Presiding Officer from the State of West Virginia \nknows about very much.\n  During the budget debate, 75 Senators came together and we succeeded \nin passing an amendment that I cosponsored to the budget resolution \nthat helped outline the broad support for a very simple idea: that all \nbusinesses need to play by the same set of rules.\n  When I go around my own State, as I know Chairman Rockefeller does in \nhis, I hear from small locally owned retailers, and competitive issues \nare raised all the time. We have small businesses--this gives a sense \nof what we are talking about--places such as the Uffda Gift Shop in Red \nWing, MN. I hope all of you will visit there. I have been there and did \nChristmas shopping there. There is Mary's Morsels, which is a bakery in \nEveleth, MN, on the Iron Range, northern Minnesota, where my dad grew \nup; Sleepy Eye Floral--I suggest all of you go to Sleepy Eye, MN, at \nsome point in your life. You can then go and buy some flowers at Sleepy \nEye Floral. You will find big support for this legislation, the \nMarketplace Fairness Act.\n  In my time in the Senate I have been committed to a competitive \nagenda that promotes long-term economic growth. Part of that agenda \nincludes not only bringing our debt down in a balanced way, promoting \nexports, making sure that our workforce is trained for the jobs of \ntoday, but it also means an even playing field and making sure that all \nbusinesses can compete.\n  That is what America has been built on. I know our businesses in \nMinnesota want that level playing field. It is time we give it to them. \nThat is exactly what this bill does. It allows brick-and-mortar \nretailers the ability to compete against out-of-State Internet \nretailers. States are currently unable to require out-of-State or \nonline-only retailers to collect sales tax. It puts local mom-and-pop \nshops at a significant disadvantage.\n\n  Not only that but this loophole--by the way, this is not about adding \na tax. That is why we have such strong bipartisan support. It is only \nabout allowing those taxes to be collected, something most people \nsupport. I have to tell you that because these taxes are not being \ncollected, it creates a loophole that is literally draining billions of \ndollars in lost revenue from State and local governments at a time when \nthey need it for police officers, they need it for firefighters, and \nwhen they need it for our schools.\n  Some $23 billion last year alone was lost because these laws were not \nbeing enforced in an even way. My State lost\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\nabout $394 million in 2011 from out-of-State sales taxes that are \nlegally due but not collected. This lost revenue translated into over 7 \npercent of Minnesota's general sales tax liability in 2011.\n  In our State, local brick-and-mortar retailers assess sales tax at a \nrate of 6.875 percent, while their online competitors typically assess \nno sales tax. That is simply not right. When this happens, city and \nState governments either have to find revenue from other sources, such \nas raising taxes, or they must cut critical services.\n  Let's also be clear about what the legislation that Senator Heitkamp \nhas so intelligently pointed out--let's be clear about what the \nlegislation does and does not do. It does not create any taxes or \nincrease existing taxes. It simply gives States the ability to enforce \ntheir own sales and use tax laws, which reduces the need to raise \ntaxes.\n  It also relieves customers of the legal obligation to report to State \ntax departments the sales taxes they owe. One of the longstanding \nprinciples of tax fairness is that taxpayers who engage in similar \neconomic transactions should face the same tax consequences.\n  Today, that is simply not the case. Minnesota is home to these \nthriving small businesses, but also to many large businesses that are \nin retail, such as Target and Best Buy. I have seen with my own eyes \npeople go into Best Buy, spend half an hour with a very eager \nsalesperson who is helping them in any way, looking at dozens of TVs, \nand then go back outside the store and buy it on the Internet.\n  That is not how things should work. We have to have fairness. That is \nwhy this bill is called the Marketplace Fairness Act. This bill has \nsuch strong support from business, such strong support in this Chamber. \nI am very excited about what is going on. We have been having this \ndebate for over 10 years now. It is one of the first things I heard \nabout when I got to the Senate 6 years ago. It is long past time to get \nthis done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend from Oklahoma is on the Senate \nfloor. I would ask if he would be kind enough to wait while I say a few \nwords and withhold offering the consent agreement to allow Senator \nSchumer to speak for 5 minutes. Following Senator Schumer, I will offer \nthe consent agreement. Would that be appropriate for the Senator from \nOklahoma?\n  Madam President, the arbitrary spending cuts in the Budget Control \nAct were designed to be painful--so painful that both parties would \ncome together to find a bipartisan way to reduce the deficit. Thus far, \nit hasn't worked. We have reduced the debt by doing a number of \ndifferent things by approximately $2.5 trillion. We have cooperated in \nthat regard. The deep cuts required by the sequester failed to bring \nthe Republicans to the negotiating table to find more savings or more \nrevenue.\n  Even after both the House and the Senate passed budget resolutions, \nthe House Republican leadership has refused to go to conference to work \nout our differences. Republicans have been telling us for a long time \nthat they want regular order. When we come to regular order, they don't \nwant regular order.\n  Republicans are afraid to even be seen considering a compromise with \nDemocrats. I speak more strongly, as the Republicans here in the Senate \nare doing their objection here on going to conference more to protect \nthe House. This applies much more to the House Republicans than it does \nto the Republicans in the Senate. The Republicans in the House are \nafraid to be seen considering a compromise with us.\n  Because Republicans have refused to negotiate a compromise, \nsequestration kicked in with devastating effect. We are just beginning \nto feel the impact of these deep cuts. Nationwide, the sequester will \ncut 750,000 jobs this year alone. More than 70,000 little boys and \ngirls will be kicked off the Head Start Program. Programs funding \nmedical research with Duke University, as I indicated on the floor \nyesterday, and scores of other programs that do the same and programs \nthat help get homeless veterans off the streets are being decimated. \nYesterday I spoke about Meals on Wheels. Meals on Wheels is one of the \nprograms that are so helpful. Homebound seniors receive one meal a day, \nand it is usually only during the day. These are being significantly \nhammered. I have spoken about Head Start for young children, but \neducation programs are being hit very hard. These are programs that \ndeal with impoverished children.\n  We know the sequester is causing massive delays. I am from Las Vegas. \nI am from Nevada. No place in America is more desperate to have the \nflights on time than tourist-oriented Las Vegas. It is the same in \nReno. These cuts are hurting tourism in Las Vegas and in all of the \ncountry.\n  It is not only the furloughs at the FAA, it is some of the programs I \nhave spoken about and many more. We have seen the dire effects of these \narbitrary budget cuts, and we have an obligation to stop them. That is \nwhy I am going to ask unanimous consent to take up and pass legislation \nthat would block sequestration until the end of this fiscal year, until \nthe first day of October. This would give us 5 months to sit down at \nthe negotiating table and work out an agreement to reduce the deficit \nin a balanced way, in a way that doesn't punish the American people and \nour economy in the meantime.\n  The legislation I am proposing is simple, and it deserves quick \napproval. There is no reason to go back, even though I would agree to \nit through the Buffett rule.\n  Let's do some spending cuts, let's do some more cutting.\n  We tried that. It wouldn't work.\n  Let's try the flexibility.\n  That also won't work because we are dealing with the same amount of \nmoney.\n  I hope this simple solution I am offering will be supported by my \nRepublican friends--establishing binding caps on the war spending. The \nwars are winding down, and currently there is $650 billion there. And \nas this bill proposes, the one on which I will ask consent, it will \nclose that loophole and propose more than enough savings to offset the \ncost of delaying sequestration for 5 months.\n  Let's put a stop to the furloughs, delays, and a stop to the job \nlosses. Let's put a stop to the devastating cuts to programs that keep \nour poor children from receiving an equal shot in life. Let's stop \nsenior citizens and homeless veterans, who are the most vulnerable \namong us, from falling through the cracks. They may not be as \ntransparent as what is happening at our airports, but these are \ndevastating to human beings. Let's do it in a fiscally responsible way \nand do it now. Then let's get to work finding a broader agreement to \nstrengthen our economy and reduce our long-term deficits.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend the Senator from New York as indicated \nwith the tentative agreement I requested earlier. Then I will resume on \nthe floor to ask for the consent, and my friend from Oklahoma will \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I rise in strong support of the proposal by our \nDemocratic leader. We all know that sequestration was a blunt \ninstrument, and now it is beginning to hurt. There is delay after delay \nat airports throughout the Nation.\n  This is not only a question of traveler inconvenience. Our economy in \nall likelihood will lose many more dollars in the next week or two than \nit costs to furlough the air traffic controllers when businesspeople \ncan't travel, when tourists can't travel. I know my home city of New \nYork is greatly affected. No one stays in the hotels, no one dines in \nrestaurants, and no one attends the shows. This may be repeated in \ndestination after destination throughout the country. If people are so \nuncertain of air travel that when they show up at the airport, they may \nwait 1 hour or they may wait 5 hours, they won't go. A good percentage \nwill stop their trips.\n  So it doesn't make sense to go forward. I think we are in agreement. \nThe problem is, how do we fix it? There aren't many ways to fix it \nbecause if\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\nyou simply say, give flexibility, the Transportation Department has \nvery little flexibility because many of its funds are off limits. The \nhighway trust fund, for instance, isn't affected by sequestration \nbecause those are our nickels and dimes that go into the gas tax per \ngallon, which wasn't affected by sequestration. An extremely high and \ndisproportionate number of the Transportation Department's expenditures \nare air traffic controllers themselves.\n  We have this problem. As Leader Reid pointed out, we have other \nproblems--stopping cancer research and cutting back on NIH and NSF, \nwhich has always been our seed corn. NIH created a biopharmaceutical \nindustry that is second to none and employs millions of people in your \nState and mine. NSF research basically created the Internet, which has \ncreated millions of jobs and makes the U.S. industry the envy of the \nworld.\n  So we are cutting our seed corn, the kinds of programs for our \nhomeless veterans, and the kinds of programs for our homebound seniors. \nThe meat-ax approach of sequestration cuts those across the board.\n  My preference would be to close some tax loopholes to get rid of \nsequestration. I don't think we should give tax breaks to oil \ncompanies. We should not give tax breaks to companies that send jobs \noverseas. That would be my preference. But we know our friends on the \nother side of the aisle are against any revenue increases right now, so \nto put this on the floor immediately would be an exercise in futility.\n  The leader's plan is the right plan. It is ingenious. We have $600 \nbillion on the budget that we know we won't spend the vast majority of \nbecause no one believes we will have troops in Iraq or Afghanistan 5 \nyears from now. Yet that money is sitting there on our budget and \npreventing cancer research, air traffic controllers, and money for \nhomeless vets from being used where it was supposed to be.\n  So the proposal to take a certain amount of money out of the OCO--the \noverseas contingency operations--which we know we won't spend, makes no \nsense. Now you say: Well, you know you won't spend it; it is a gimmick.\n  It is not a gimmick. It is sitting there in the budget occupying \nspace and could be used by these other agencies. And to insist the OCO \ncontinue is causing real pain, causing our economy not to grow as \nquickly, causing vulnerable people to be hurt, and causing research--\nthe seed corn of America--to decline.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying that \nPresident Obama is to blame for these delays. He has very little choice \nif we don't change things, and this is a way to change things.\n  If we want to get rid of these delays, which we all on both sides of \nthe aisle very much desire, I would propose to my colleagues that the \nsolution proposed by the majority leader is the best way to go given \nthe political necessities on the other side, the desire not to have any \nrevenues--even closing certain tax loopholes.\n  So I would hope we could come together and vote on this solution. \nCutting the OCO has been supported by Republicans. I remember Senator \nKyl, a former Senator from Arizona, was advocating this late last year \nto deal with the doc fix, the DRGs, and other things. The people will \ncome together on this. So I hope we can vote for this proposal, put the \nair traffic controllers back to work off their furloughs, get rid of \nthese delays, and then come together in a grand agreement in time for \nthe September budget.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2887-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2887-S2888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 788\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 788.\n  My friends on the other side have had this legislation for a short \ntime, not a long time, but it is not that difficult to understand. I \nhave tried to explain it the best I can.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof S. 788, the text of which is at the desk, which is a bill to suspend \nthe fiscal year 2013 sequestration and offset that with funds from the \nOverseas Contingency Operations; that the bill be read three times and \npassed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nplan to object, I will take some time to explain why I object.\n  What is happening in the Senate is phenomenal, and I want the \nAmerican people to see this. The Federal Government is 89 percent \nbigger than it was 10 years ago. We just heard the majority leader say \nflexibility can't work because we are already dealing with the same \namount of money--89 percent more than we were 10 years ago.\n  I didn't vote for the Budget Control Act. I think sequester is a \nstupid way to cut spending. But I want us to understand exactly what is \ngoing on. This is a contrived situation because no effort--zero \neffort--by the FAA or the Department of Transportation has been made to \nhave any flexibility in terms of how they spend their money. They have \nmade no request for a reprogramming of funds within the FAA. They have \nover $500 million unobligated sitting in balances that aren't \nobligated, so none of this had to happen. This has been a created \nsituation.\n  I want my colleagues to think for a minute about the number of people \nwho didn't make it to their aunt's funeral yesterday because of a \ncontrived situation; the number of people who may not get to the birth \nof a grandchild; the number of business meetings that aren't going to \noccur because we have created a contrived situation. Our problem is we \nare continuing to spend money we don't have.\n  So we have taken FAA, we have put the airlines at risk--and they are, \nby the way, suing the government because they haven't made a good-faith \neffort to do it in another way--and we have created a situation where \nwe are going to discomfit and inconvenience hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican people on a political point because we can't cut any spending \nin Washington.\n  Let me outline for my colleagues a moment what the FAA could do. They \ncould save $105 million by cutting their overhead expenses for \nconsultant supplies and travel by 15 percent. That is one-seventh or \none-sixth of all the money they need to keep all their controllers on. \nThey could save $41 million by eliminating funding the President has \nalready recommended eliminating in terms of programs for airports that \nare on the national plan of integrated airports. They have already \nrecommended doing that, but they are not doing that. They have the \nflexibility to do that but they are not doing it. That is another $41 \nmillion.\n  They can save $6 million on small community air service--flexible. \nThey could reduce the Airport Improvement Program. They have plenty of \nflexibility there. That is up to $926 million. They could do that. They \ncould reduce or eliminate--and they would have to have our help to do \nthis--the Essential Air Service Program where at many airports across \nthis country we are paying a $1,200 subsidy to fly less than 10 people \na day out of an airport less than 90 miles away from a major airport. \nSo to say there is no flexibility, they do not want any flexibility. \nAnd the fact is our country is headed toward bankruptcy.\n  Let me talk about OCO for a minute. It is true OCO money is in the \nbudget, because we thought we were going to have to spend it. But every \npenny of that money will be borrowed money--borrowed money. So if we \nweren't going to spend it, we are saying now we are going to go over \nhere and take care of sequestration? A 4-percent cut in the Federal \nbudget--4 percent. It is only 89 percent bigger than it was 10 years \nago and we can't find 4 percent within the FAA?\n  Let me outline a few other things going on at the FAA. They have \nposted requirements for nonessential employees since sequestration \nstarted. They have made no efforts at flexibility. They have made no \nefforts to do what they could do to keep the most number of controllers \nworking.\n  This isn't going to happen. We are not going to borrow money anymore \nagainst the future of our kids when in fact we have other ways to do \nit.\n  I will make my final point. The President is the CEO of this country.\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\nHe can make this happen with the least amount of inconvenience for the \nAmerican people. The question is: Will he or not? Will he or not? Will \nwe play this political shell game with the lives and perhaps the safety \nand certainly the inconvenience of the traveling public in this country \nto make the point there is no way we are going to cut any spending out \nof the Federal Government when it is 89 percent bigger? And, by the \nway, it is 48 percent bigger under President Obama.\n  It is a real choice. America is going to get a real choice: Can we in \nfact respond in a prudent way to run this government in an efficient \nmanner and eliminate low-priority items and put money for items such as \nNIH in a priority? We can. The question is: Do we have the will to do \nthat?\n  What we are hearing from the majority leader is: No, we don't want to \ncut anything. We will take some funny money that doesn't really exist, \nand if we use it, we are going to borrow, and that will take all the \npain away. There won't be any oversight, no streamlining, no priorities \nmade in terms of how we spend money.\n  Every other American family and business has had to make those \ndecisions. Yet we are refusing to do it. When we asked the President: \nDo you want the flexibility, he said no. He would veto the bill that \ngives him the flexibility to put high priorities up here and low \npriorities down here. That tells me it is all political. It doesn't \nhave anything to do with the FAA; it has to do with creating an event \nso we won't do what is in the best long-term interests of the country.\n  With that, I object.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2888-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2888-S2894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 16\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 19, S. 16, the Inhofe-Toomey bill on \nflexibility, with an amendment that reflects the current changes for \nsequestration; that the bill be read three times and passed, as \namended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the prior request.\n  Is there objection to the following request?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, earlier this year the Senate voted on \ndueling responses through the sequestration. Democrats had a balanced \nplan--half revenues, half spending. Republicans tried giving \nflexibility with, of course, no revenues whatsoever. The Senate voted \nboth of these down. We know these plans won't work so there is \nabsolutely no need to repeat what has already failed. So let us try to \nsolve the problem.\n  I appreciate the mini lecture of my friend from Oklahoma, but it is \nwrong. It is good to go back and talk about what has happened. When \nPresident Bush took office--and I hate to keep bringing this up; his \nlibrary is going to be dedicated in a few days--he had a surplus over \n10 years of $7 trillion. When he left office, he had a debt of almost \n$2 trillion. Why? Was it because government got bigger? Well, it got \nbigger because we had two wars, paid for with the $7 trillion that \nshould have been surplus, but it was all borrowed money. All borrowed \nmoney.\n  During the Clinton years, when Bush stepped into office, President \nClinton had created 22 million jobs in 8 years. During President Bush's \n8 years, we lost 8 million jobs and lost our entire surplus. So of \ncourse those two wars and the tax cuts that were unpaid really created \nsome problems.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma complains about government is larger than \nit was 2 years ago. Well, I have talked about that. But one thing my \nfriend fails to acknowledge is Simpson-Bowles. By the way, he voted \nagainst that--is that right?\n  Mr. COBURN. I voted for it.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. You were with Senator Durbin and voted for \nthat. Most Republicans voted against that. My liberal friend Dick \nDurbin voted for that.\n  The reason I mention that is because Simpson-Bowles wanted to arrive \nat a savings of $4 trillion, as I understand it. We have already done \n$2\\1/2\\ trillion. It is not as if we haven't done anything.\n  I would also talk about my friend from Oklahoma. I know he is smart, \nand I understand that, but just because you are smart doesn't mean you \nare always right. We have a situation where this country has been \ndriven by the tea party for the last number of years. When I was in \nschool, I studied government and I learned about the anarchists. They \nwere different from the tea party because they were violent. But they \nwere anarchists because they did not believe in government at any \nlevel, and they acknowledged that. The tea party kind of hides that. \nThey do not say we are against government, but that is what it amounts \nto. They are not doing physically destructive things to buildings and \npeople directly, but they are doing everything they can to throw a \nmonkey wrench into any form of government, whether it is local, State, \nor the Federal Government. That is what it is all about. So anything \nthey can do to throw a monkey wrench into the wheels of government, \nthey are happy doing that. And I am sorry to say my friend from \nOklahoma is helping them, maybe not directly but indirectly, and that \nis wrong. Government is not inherently bad. Government is inherently \ngood. That is why we have a Constitution, and we direct the activities \nof this government based upon that Constitution.\n  We have a situation here that is not good. We have programs being cut \nall over America. Rather than doing things with a meat cleaver, as my \nfriend from New York said, we should be doing it with a scalpel--doing \nthings that are fine-tuning and working to eliminate these programs.\n  My friend asks why doesn't the FAA cut other programs? Listen to \nthis: He wants to cut airport improvement programs. These are job \ncreating. They create jobs at airports--runways, terminals. These are \nprograms that create jobs. Essential Air Service may not mean much to \nhim, but we had a program where--I don't know if it was my friend from \nOklahoma but some Republican Senator offered an amendment to get rid of \nEssential Air Service. One of the places they indicated should be cut \nis Ely, NV. I said okay, too much per passenger, I will go along with \nthat. I could have stopped that but I didn't do it.\n  We have had this debate previously. Essential Air Service has been \nwhacked on a number of occasions. There are places in America where \nEssential Air Service is just what it says, it is essential, to give \nthose rural communities the ability to have an airplane come in there \nonce in a while.\n  The Congressional Budget Office would give us credit--it wouldn't be \ntoward the deficit--to do something for 5 months and take a little \nmoney out of Overseas Contingency Operations. We are going to cut money \nfrom that. We are not going to spend all that money that has been set \naside to take care of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  It is too bad we are right here with competing unanimous consent \nrequests and the American people are going to continue to suffer--\nwhether it is some little kid not able to go to a Head Start Program or \nsome senior citizen who will miss his Meal on Wheels or the other \nprograms--in addition to the devastation that is going to take place at \nairports.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Reid taking the \nleadership here, and as I understand it--and I want him to confirm it--\nwhat he has done is he has suggested the cuts that are hurting so many \nof our American citizens be restored and he is paying for that. He is \nnot putting it on a credit card. He is paying for it by taking funds \nfrom the overseas account because we are winding down wars. Am I \ncorrect that what the Senator is doing is paying a price that equals \nthe amount he is restoring of the sequester?\n\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I also want to say to my friend, I understand we are \ntruly suffering in this country. I have examples of people who were \nturned away from cancer clinics. They can't get their chemotherapy. The \nCancer Society--which is not a government entity--has said this is very \ndangerous.\n  Is my friend aware that patients are being turned away and not \ngetting the\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\nchemotherapy, grants are not being funded? I know he mentioned that. \nBut I think the fact that patients who need chemotherapy who live--some \nare being denied this. Is my friend aware of that?\n  Mr. REID. In addition to that, I say to my friend from California, \nthere is research dealing with dread diseases, in addition to cancer, \nwhich research is being curtailed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would also say, I wonder if my friend knew--and I take \njust a city from the Midwest. In Cincinnati, 200 children will be \ndropped or denied access to Head Start. Anita Wolf, a mother of two \nspecial needs children, said she may have to choose which child can \nremain in Head Start enrichment programs.\n  I say to my friend, we are here because this is hurting people. This \nisn't about statistics, and I am very disappointed we can't work \ntogether to restore this. How long does my friend restore these cuts?\n  Mr. REID. Five months.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding, and I will \nlisten to my colleagues from the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the reason patients can't get their \nchemotherapeutic treatments has nothing to do with the budget. It has \neverything to do with the administration's CMS and payment recognition. \nI have been working on this issue for 3 months. It has nothing to do \nwith the sequester. It has to do with what the CMS has ruled in terms \nof appropriate payments.\n  The majority leader is a wonderful man. He has a different view of \nwhat it takes to get our country back in shape. He has actually split \nwith the President this afternoon, because the President said the only \nway he would, in fact, turn off sequester is with a tax increase, and \nthe only way this can be considered a tax increase is spending money we \nweren't ever going to spend anyway and acknowledging we are going to \ncharge it to our children. So, in essence, it will be a tax increase--\njust not on us. It will be on every child.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. The President could agree for \nflexibility. His Secretaries could ask for reprogramming authority. But \nthey have not done that. Why have they not done that? Because, in the \nPresident's own words, he wants sequester to hurt.\n  What a position for the CEO--the leader of this country--to say: I \nwant to teach you a lesson. I am not going to use judgment and \nprioritize and categorize things that are most important and find \nthings that are least important; I am going to reject all attempts at \nflexibility.\n  I wish to make one other point. The President keeps saying we have \nsaved $2.5 trillion. The majority leader just said the same thing. What \nthe American people ought to know is $1.2 trillion of that ``savings'' \nis for increases that were planned that aren't going to happen.\n  Let me say that again: $1.2 trillion of the savings is for spending \nincreases that were planned that aren't going to happen.\n  Everybody who runs a family budget or runs a business knows that is \nno savings. You didn't save any money that you were going to spend but \nthen didn't spend. It wasn't saved because you never spent it. But it \nis a wonderful way Washington accounts that is different than the way \nthe rest of us have to live our lives.\n  So let's go back and review.\n  We as Republicans agree we ought to fund the most important functions \nof our government, and we believe there ought to be priorities to that. \nBut we also believe we ought to save the future for our children.\n  The answer to that problem we found ourselves in--sequestration--is \nto give the administration the flexibility for making priority choices \njust like the rest of us do. If they don't want to use it, then they \ndon't want to use it.\n  But the fact is we will not pass that. The same tools that we would \nall use ourselves, we will not pass that. Why is it we will not pass \nthat, to order things in priority, to do what is most important first?\n  I would tell you the conferences and the amount of travel for which \nthe FAA spends are a low priority compared to keeping controllers \nworking. We haven't seen any cut in those programs--none. As a matter \nof fact, the President's budget recommended taking $800 million out of \nthe airport improvement program--if you will read his budget. That was \nthe President's recommendation. So now we are really at odds with the \nPresident because he says we can save that $800 million.\n  It is flabbergasting to think there is absolutely no common sense in \nWashington and that we will not do the things that are in the best \nlong-term interests for the people of this country. So what we do is we \ncreate a situation that is going to tremendously impact our Nation--\nboth the business and the common citizen who is traveling--and we do it \nfor political gain to prove a point, not because we have to--because we \nare going to make sequester hurt.\n  The security the American people want is to know the future is OK. \nThe future isn't OK with us operating the way we are operating. I know \ngovernment isn't easy and I know it is messy, but there are some \nabsolute truths. The absolute truth is we can't spend our way out of \ndebt and we can't borrow our way out of debt, and we are taking $88 \nbillion over the next year out of the $3.7 trillion budget. If we are \nnot capable of doing that, none of us should be here, either party.\n  What we fail to recognize is what the real risk is for our country; \nand the risk is that we are running out of time and the ability to \ncontinue to borrow in the world. The only reason we look good today is \nbecause everybody else looks worse. We are the only rose in the bud \nvase that is not wilted right now, and that is going to change. When it \ndoes, the consequences for our kids, for our families, for our economy, \nfor our GDP is going to totally change.\n  If we went back to historical interest rates today, when we quit \nprinting money--which we will eventually have to do--it will add \nanother $650 billion a year to our expenses. It does nothing for \nanybody.\n  So this small 4.5 percent that the administration refuses to even \nwork on to make it less painful to the American public shows what kind \nof trouble we are in.\n  I am disappointed, as is I know the majority leader, that we can't \nwork out a way to solve this problem. But there are two totally \ncompeting philosophies; one ensures a productive, successful America, \nthe other shows an America drowning in debt. There has to be a point in \ntime when we say: Can't we run this government more efficiently, more \neffectively, and do it in a way that preserves the future for our \nchildren?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there are a number of people on the floor \nwho have been here for some time, and I thought I would try to add a \nlittle order to this.\n  I think Senator Manchin got here first. How much time does the \nSenator from West Virginia wish to take?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I have no more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How much time for the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think 10 minutes would be sufficient.\n  Mr. REID. And Senator Boxer, 15 minutes, I understand.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If I were allowed to go first, I would do 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have a deal. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama be recognized for 5 minutes, the Senator from California \nbe recognized for 10 minutes, and the Senator from West Virginia for \nwhatever time he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the proposal of my friend the majority \nleader--and I know he has a tough job--is how the Nation goes broke, \nhow the Nation loses the confidence of the people we serve.\n  In August of 2011, this Nation agreed to the Budget Control Act. My \nfriend Senator Reid said the Budget Control Act was as good as a \nbudget. It is not, but it has some teeth to it. What it did that is \nindisputable, it limited the growth in spending.\n  We said we would raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion immediately, \nwhich has already almost been spent--we have run up that much debt \nsince August 2011, another $2 trillion--but in addition, we would \nreduce spending over 10 years by $2.1 trillion.\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\n  The sequester involved $1.1 trillion of that if the committee didn't \nreach an agreement that would have specified cuts across the board. \nThey are not wise cuts. We shouldn't have done it that way, but it was \na reasonable amount of money for sure. So in the Budget Control Act \nthat was passed, spending would have gone up from a flat $37 trillion \nover 10 years to $45 trillion over 10 years instead of going up to $47 \ntrillion over 10 years. So the growth would be from 37 to 45 and not 37 \nto 47. That is not a real cut in spending. It is a reduction in the \ngrowth in spending.\n  Now the sequester comes along, and we have proposed many solutions \nwhere we could alter these cuts and give flexibility to the cuts so \nthey are not as sharp and as unwise as the sequester called for, so \nlong as the spending stays within that level.\n  We also agreed--and the President signed it and it was passed by both \nHouses and Democrats and Republicans and the leader voted for it--it \nhad no tax increases. It was simply an agreement that would reduce \nspending a little bit over 10 years and that we would raise the debt \nceiling by an equal amount. There were no tax increases in that.\n  Then the President submits a budget, and he wants to do away with the \nsequester and pay for it with tax increases. That is what the \nDemocratic Senate budget did also. It had increases in taxes and \nincreases in spending and a chunk of that was wiping out the sequester \nwe just agreed to.\n  We told the American people: Look, we made a little reduction in the \ngrowth of spending, American people. Forgive us for raising the debt \nceiling. A lot of people didn't want to raise the debt ceiling at all. \nBut we promised we had done something good. We were proud of ourselves.\n  Before the ink was dry, the President in January submitted his budget \non 2012 that wiped out those cuts and spent more money, and his budget \nand the Senate Democratic budget this year does the same thing.\n  How can we possibly ever get spending under control if we don't \ncomply with what we promised?\n  The majority leader has said: The war costs are coming down in the \nfuture. We will just score that as savings and, therefore, we don't \nhave to raise taxes. We will not have the sequester take effect. We \nwill just spend all that money, and we will pretend we saved it by not \nfighting a war 10 years from now.\n  Let me tell you what experts have said about this gimmick.\n  Maya MacGuineas, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal \nBudget--and they worked very hard in a bipartisan way to deal with \nthese issues--said this: ``This is such a glaring gimmick at such a \nserious moment.''\n  Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition out of New Hampshire, a long-\ntime respected bipartisan group, said this: ``The mother of all budget \ngimmicks.''\n  To pretend we are saving money because we are not spending emergency \nmoney on a war that ends, we could still be saving money on World War I \nat that rate.\n  Washington Post reporter Lori Montgomery said:\n  ``Counting money not spent on wars that the nation is already \nplanning to end is widely viewed as a budget gimmick.'' And it \ncertainly is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Basically our colleagues say: We cannot even reduce \nspending growth, even that much. We cannot stand any of that. We refuse \nto lay out alternatives to make the cuts less painful. We want them to \nbe as painful as possible so we can attack those and oppose even modest \nreductions in the growth of spending, and we are going to punish the \nAmerican people because they dared to reduce the growth of spending.\n  They basically say, the Government is saying: It is not our fault we \nhave a problem. It is yours, American people. You didn't send enough \nmoney. You send more money. You send more money. We refuse to reduce \nthe growth of spending.\n  I yield the floor and thank Senator Coburn for objecting to the \nproposal of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I worked with my colleague from Alabama \non a lot of issues. We do work together on occasion.\n  Mr. SESSION. We do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. But on this particular issue we see the world very \ndifferently, which is to be respected, and it is with full respect that \nI say this sequester is not necessary. These across-the-board cuts were \nput into place to be so difficult and so painful that both parties \nwould come together and come up with a solution. The President has \ntried and tried. He said to both parties: Why don't we meet in the \nmiddle? Let's replace the sequester, these mindless cuts, with other \ncuts that make sense and are not painful, and the other half with tax \nreform, doing away with subsidies, tax loopholes such as the billions \nof dollars a year oil companies have been getting that don't make \nsense, since they are the most profitable companies probably in the \nworld.\n  But Republicans' answer to that: We are not going to look at taking \naway these tax breaks from big companies. We are going to not look at \ntrying to see whether millionaires or billionaires can pay anymore. We \nwant to replace the sequester with more cuts.\n  I know it is a fast-moving country we live in. Lord knows you have \ngone through some difficult times in Massachusetts and I thank the \nPresiding Officer for her leadership. But we do not have that short a \nmemory. We remember this awful recession that almost turned into a \ndepression. We know because it is basic--I am an economics major; it \nwas a long time ago--but there was a basic understanding that when \ntimes are tough the government doesn't turn to austerity. The \ngovernment helps us by saying: You know what, maybe this is a good time \nto fix those bridges, to build those highways, to do the things we need \nto do because a great country needs an infrastructure and this is the \ntime to do it--because we need the jobs, too.\n  We have no partners over there. Now Senator Reid comes up with a very \nsensible plan and here is the plan: For the next 5 months we restore \nthe sequester. We take away those mindless cuts, get us back to \nnormalcy, try to find another solution, a long-term solution, but in \nthe meantime, pay for stopping the sequester by cutting from an \noverseas war funding account. As we bring home our soldiers from \nAfghanistan and Iraq, we have an account that can be drawn down. So \nwhen our colleagues say Senator Reid is raising taxes to do this, he is \nnot raising taxes No. 1. He is cutting spending by taking savings out \nof this overseas war account.\n  It makes a lot of sense. The American people want to see the \nAfghanistan war come to an end. The American people want to see the \nIraq war totally completed. We are saying take that money and how about \nspending it here?\n  Their answer today, which is so astounding, from Senator Coburn who \nobjected to this very important bill--Senator Coburn said he has the \nanswer. It is called flexibility. What does that mean? It means all of \nthese cuts, these billions and billions of dollars in cuts, we will \nthen tell the agency: Figure it out. You figure out where to fix it.\n  For example, in the FAA they have an airport improvement fund. They \nare saying we do not have to fire these air traffic controllers. Let's \nnot do that. Take the money from the airport improvement fund.\n  If you know anything about the airport improvement fund, it is not an \nidle fund. It is a fund that is paid for by taxes that people pay so \ntheir airports will be improved, hence it is called the airport \nimprovement fund. Whether it is making sure the runways are safe or \nmaking sure the terminals are secure--this is why we have airport \nimprovement funds. You cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  I want to say to my friend--he left the floor--and he is my friend, \nSenator Coburn: Flexibility is not the answer. If somebody comes to me, \na colleague, and says: Senator Boxer, I left my wallet home and I am \nstarving, can you lend me $10? And I say flexibility--what flexibility? \nHe left his wallet home. Flexibility does not pay for air\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\ntraffic controllers. Flexibility does not pay for teachers. Flexibility \ndoes not pay for FBI agents. If we ever learned anything from the \nhorror in Boston, it is the unbelievable first responders in addition \nto the citizens who rushed toward the blast. The people there, the \nprofessionals, the doctors who happened to be there--we pay those \npeople.\n  Earth to the Senate: Not everybody lives off a trust fund.\n  People need to get paid. Flexibility does not do it. I cannot say, if \nI get a call from an air traffic controller: Oh, why don't you just \nvolunteer on your day off? He will probably tell me he is going to \nfigure out a way--on his day off that he is forced to have, his \nfurlough--to make some money for his family.\n  Sometimes I wonder if we are in ``Alice in Wonderland'' around here. \nNothing could be more true than today.\n  I want you to know that I have people in Los Angeles who are stuck on \nrunways for hours and miss very important functions. How about one of \nmy people in Los Angeles--I have his name. It is not important. He said \nhe missed a funeral on Monday because his incoming flight was delayed. \n``We had to cancel our whole trip because the funeral is tonight and we \nare not going to make it.''\n  Flexibility is not the answer. The answer is to restore the money \nfrom sequestration. The FAA announced plans to close 149 airport \ncontrol towers nationwide, including many in my State.\n  How about people who are getting turned away who need chemotherapy \nand the American Cancer Society Action Network said that because of \nsequestration ``funding for cancer research and prevention programs are \ntaking a dangerous hit.'' Again I say to my Republican friend, this is \nfrom the private sector on what is happening around here.\n  The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program will \nprovide 32,000 fewer breast and cervical cancer screenings this year to \nwomen who have no other option for affordable, lifesaving screenings. \nThese are lifesaving screenings. Do you want to tell that woman: \nFlexibility? That is not the answer. The answer is restore the funds \nfrom the sequester.\n  Head Start, about to lose 70,000 of its 1 million slots for children. \nLet me tell you, in Cincinnati, 200 children will be dropped or denied \naccess to Head Start.\n  Anita Wolfe, a mother of two special needs children, said she may \nhave to choose which child can remain in Head Start's enrichment \nprogram. This is a bad situation.\n  In Oakland, the housing authority is losing $11 million, and expects \n800 to 900 fewer families will get housing assistance.\n  In Indiana Head Start programs in two towns resorted to a lottery \nsystem last month to determine which kids could remain in the program.\n  Riverbend Head Start in Illinois has had to cut its school year by 2 \nweeks, leaving its staff unemployed and its participating families \nwithout childcare for those two weeks.\n  The Santa Clara County Housing Authority has lost $21 million in \nfunding and is considering pulling housing assistance vouchers from \nsome of the 17,000 households it serves. Local resident and mother of \ntwo Alicia Diaz fears that she may become homeless as a result.\n  The Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency expects to lose $13.9 \nmillion, affecting housing assistance to 1,700 families.\n  Many of the 24,000 Los Angeles families relying on Section 8 vouchers \ncould lose all or part of their housing subsidy before the end of this \nyear.\n  Customs and Border Patrol has furloughed 60,000 agents nationwide and \nrestricted overtime. This is causing delays in cargo processing at the \nPorts of Hueneme, Long Beach and Los Angeles, which rely heavily on \novertime because they are extremely busy ports.\n  More than 100 dockworkers in Port Hueneme were idled due to delays, \nand shipments had to wait to be inspected. Every minute of delay costs \nmoney for businesses receiving their products late. Customs and Border \nPatrol estimates that delays could become as long as 5 days.\n  We are seeing delays in our ports. We are seeing dock workers idled. \nWith these delays, says one of my people, ``I have to hire the labor \nand pay them while I wait for Customs to clear the vessel.'' It is \nhaving an impact on our economy.\n  Just to finish up, Senator Reid took the leadership today. I am so \nproud to stand with him. He found a place to get the money to put the \nfunds back in and avert the sequester, stop the pain at the airports, \nstop the pain at the clinics, restore Meals on Wheels to our seniors--\nall the things I talked about, and he paid for it by going to the war \nfund that is winding down, and making sure we can fix this problem for \n5 months.\n  It is shocking that my Republican friends would object to this when \ntheir constituency is feeling the same pain as the rest of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I rise today to speak in support of the Marketplace \nFairness Act. I was a cosponsor of this important legislation in the \n112th Congress and I am proud to be a cosponsor in the 113th Congress, \nbecause this is truly a matter of fairness. The Marketplace Fairness \nAct will allow local Main Street--we call them brick and mortar, but \nthey are basically businesses, little stores with real people in them, \nworking hard to make a real living. It will provide much-needed \nfinancial relief to State budgets that have been cut to the bone in \nrecent years and are facing even more cuts in Federal assistance thanks \nto what we were just discussing here, the disastrous sequestration with \nthe Draconian cuts.\n  This bill is not a Washington handout to businesses. It is not a \nspecial treatment. It is not a new tax. It is leveling the playing \nfield. It is a leveling of the playing field. Every day we do not act \nto pass the bill is another day we risk another small business closing \nits doors--not only in West Virginia but all across this country.\n  There is always a lot of talk in Washington about helping small \nbusinesses, and rightly so, because small businesses, as you know in \nyour State, account for more than 60 percent of all the private sector \njobs. It is the small businesses, not the large businesses.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is a chance to do more than just talk \nabout it for once. We have a chance to do something to show we care \nabout small businesses. It levels the playing field and gives our Main \nStreet businesses a fighting chance competing with Internet vendors \nthat are not required to collect sales tax.\n  Let me give an example in a small rural State such as West Virginia. \nWe are expanding, working very hard on the Internet, broadband high \nspeed, trying to get to every little holler, up and down every nook and \ncranny. We are trying to help the people, and that is great. But it \nreally puts more pressure on small businesses, because now, with the \nconvenience, people will not travel. They may not go to the store. But \nif they want the service and they know the price is the same, there is \nno unfair advantage, there is a level playing field, the small \nbusinesses still have a chance. That is all we are asking for.\n  Business owners in West Virginia tell me all the time how unfair it \nis to watch their online competitors offer low prices on the exact same \nproducts. We have heard a lot of talk about that today. That is called \nshowrooming and that is basically people shopping. They used to go \nshopping in the old days. They would go to one store and compare and \nthen go to another store and compare and they worked back and forth and \nfigured out where they had the best deal or where they thought they had \nthe best deal with the best service. That does not happen on line.\n  First of all, in my State they have a 6-percent advantage because our \nState tax is 6 percent in all our counties, so that is a 6-percent \nadvantage from the get-go, and in these hard economic times price is \nthe driving force.\n  That is why this bill has so much bipartisan support: 74 votes. Mr. \nPresident, you have been here a short period of time, but you are very \nobservant. You know that. You have watched and seen very few times that \nwe have gotten that type of broad bipartisan support on anything, and \nthat is what is refreshing to see. With all of my\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nfriends who come from States that do not have the taxes, and friends on \nboth sides--my own colleagues on the Democratic side and Republican \nside--what I understand, and what I know will happen, is first of all \nthey do not collect the tax of in-State residents. If they buy it on \nthe Internet, they will not collect that tax because they do not have a \nsales tax. If they say it is unfair because they are collecting it for \nme in my State, even though someone in West Virginia might buy from a \nState that doesn't have a sales tax but they have an Internet business, \nthat is not going to cause undue pressure, I don't believe, or unfair \ncompetition in any way, shape, or form. They still need to use all the \nservices in my State while selling their product in a State where they \ndon't have a sales tax. They are going to use the roads to deliver that \nproduct to the customer in my State, they are going to use the people \nwho have been educated through the school system in my State, and all I \nam asking for is the fair share: the fairness--we charge our own \ncustomers and our own businesses collect for us in our State--for those \nwho are using my State as their business to do the same. I don't think \nthat is unfair. I really don't. I think the majority of businesses \ndon't think that is unfair, and a majority of Americans don't think \nthat is unfair.\n\n  This is not a complicated piece of legislation. It is only 11 pages. \nIt is pretty short compared to most of the bills we see around here. \nBasically, it just does what we said: It allows the States to collect \nsales tax on out-of-State sales, provided these States streamline their \ntax codes.\n  There are some restrictions that come with this. They must either \nvoluntarily adopt the measures in the streamlined sales and use tax \nlaw, which 24 States have already done, including my little State of \nWest Virginia--do my colleagues know we were the No. 3 State in the \nNation to join in this fairness movement many years ago. And when I was \nGovernor, we worked very hard to work with the other States, and we \nbuilt up to 24 States that basically were acceptable toward tax code \nfairness. That is really what it is about. Or a State can meet five \nmandates. There are five mandates they can meet. They can notify \nretailers of rate changes, they can create a single organization for \ncollecting sales tax, they can establish a uniform tax base, or they \ncan use destination sourcing for sales tax rates and provide free \nsoftware and hold harmless protection for retailers.\n  To simplify, what that means is some States might have different tax \ncodes in different counties. Some counties have different taxes they \nadd on to their State tax or they have a municipal tax, so they are \nsaying there will be 9,600 different tax codes, which is almost \nimpossible. For anyone to participate in this piece of legislation, \nthey have to make a decision on one of those five criteria I just \nmentioned. That brings the tax code down to 46. It simplifies it. So \nthat argument doesn't hold either, the complication of 9,600 \njurisdictions I heard being used by my good friend from New Hampshire.\n  The beauty is if a State without a sales tax doesn't want to \nparticipate, they don't have to. That is the beauty of it. They don't \nhave to. They don't have to participate. They don't have to collect the \nsales tax from their people, as I said earlier, so they have that \noption. I know all the arguments against the legislation, but, again, I \nwill say they are just wrong.\n  Some critics say this is a tax increase. That is wrong. If I am \npaying 6 percent in West Virginia when I go to a store in Fairmont, \nCharleston, Huntington, Martinsburg, Greenbrier, or Lewisburg--wherever \nI go it is the same, 6 percent. The only thing we are saying is if a \nconsumer buys on the Internet, the consumer will be charged the same 6 \npercent. It is not an increase. It is the same.\n  I think that makes it pretty simple also. It really does give our \nlittle stores, owned by the people who basically are the same people to \nwhom we go to participate, give donations and contributions to the \nLittle League--how many times do we see an Internet company giving to \nthe Little League in our hometown or contributing to the chamber of \ncommerce in our hometown, giving to any of the different fund drives \nthere might be, such as the volunteer fire department. What we are \nsaying is we have to do everything we can to keep them alive and \nhealthy.\n  Some critics say online services don't use the local services that \nare paid for by the sales taxes, and they should be required to declare \nthe sales taxes. That is wrong also, and I think we just talked about \nthat. They also say whatever product a customer orders online--let's \nsay it is a book from Amazon or shoes from Macy's or towels from \nTarget--if it was delivered, it still has to get to the customer. It \nstill has to use the infrastructure the State is responsible to invest \ninto, and that is our sales tax.\n  Sales taxes, in all States that collect them, go into general \nrevenue. General revenue supports a cadre of things--anything we can \nimagine--from schools to roads to programs people need to supporting \nsenior citizens. The taxes support every aspect of life in the State.\n  When we look at the whole overall bill, including the fact that the \nlittle stores and online retailers sell identical products and use the \nsame infrastructure to deliver those products, and collecting taxes \nowed on a purchase at the point of sale, whether they are relying on \nconsumers to pay that tax voluntarily, as some critics have proposed, \nwould mean $23 billion that is going uncollected. That is just the \nfairness we are adding to it. Just the fairness. But $23 billion is \nneeded revenue in States that are having difficult times.\n  We have heard a lot of people give testimony here today that if their \nlittle State gets the amount of money it would get by having a fair, \nlevel playing field in their taxes, they could reduce their taxes. \nWell, that is a good opportunity in these difficult times. If West \nVirginia could have collected sales tax on out-of-State sales during \nfiscal year 2012 only--not new taxes, just those already owed to the \nState--if we took the sales done over the Internet, we could have put \n$103 million more in our State's budget--$103 million more. Our budget \nis around $4 billion. That is a good chunk of money.\n  We could have used it to do a couple of things. Let me give an \nexample of what we could have done. With that extra money from Internet \nsales, we could have built 412 miles of new roads--412 miles. We could \nhire 2,000 schoolteachers with that money we didn't receive. We could \nhave built 5 high schools. We could have built 7 middle schools or 10 \nnew elementary schools.\n  Now, we talk about jobs. We talk about infrastructure. We talk about \nbasically investing back into the State, that is money we weren't able \nto do that with, and that would have helped us.\n  When we talk about the e-commerce growth, if we look at the growth of \nbusiness being done online versus business being done in retail stores, \nwe will see quite a disparity, and it is going to continue to grow and \nput more pressure on businesses. We think this is not going to \ninterfere with the Internet sales, and the reason we say that is \nbecause of our busy lifestyles. If that is the way a person wants to \nshop, that is fine. But they just would not be able to say, well, I can \nsave money because I don't have to pay the sales tax. It might make \nsomebody think they might go down to John's Hardware Store. I know \nthem, and they do a heck of a job. They have a fighting chance now. I \nwant to stay in my local community. They have a fighting chance now.\n  Trust me, we would not put any Internet businesses out of business. \nThat will not happen. In 2000, the U.S. economy supported $27 billion \nin e-commerce, which constituted only 9 percent of all retail sales. \nOver the next 12 years, e-commerce grew tenfold, totaling $224 billion, \nwhich is equal to 7 percent of all retail sales: Seven percent now of \nall retail sales, 10 years ago, 1 percent. One market analysis projects \nthat online retail sales in the United States will grow by 10 percent \nannually through 2017--10 percent annually. So when we look at that, \nfrom $224 billion in 2012, that will be over $370 billion in the next 4 \nyears.\n\n  I will just told my colleagues in 2012 what our little State lost and \nwhat we could have done with it. Think of all the missed opportunities \nwe are going to have not just in my State but in States all over the \nNation.\n  So just look at how the Internet use has soared in the United States \nsince\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\n2000. Some 240 million Americans are online today compared to half that \namount when the century began. So a little over 10 years ago we only \nhad about 120 million. We are going to have full integration of our \nInternet, which is good. I think it is good. I just want to make sure \nit is fair, that is all, just fair.\n  As broadband speeds grow, home and mobile Internet mobile users will \nspend more time online, and that means more time online shopping. That \nis fine too. They just will not be able to say: I am going to save 6 \npercent. They can't say that upfront. That means they are going to shop \naround a little bit more, and that means we have a chance. If I have a \nlittle store in Farmington, WV, where I came from, I have a chance to \nsurvive. It gives me a chance. I don't start out in the hole. I don't \nstart out with my hands in my pocket and 6 percent behind to begin \nwith.\n  Google researchers have found that already 97 percent of Americans \nlook for local products online. So, clearly, the businesses back home \nare at a huge disadvantage in competing with online retailers if tax \nrequirements are unequal. This makes sense. State governments are \nlosing billions of dollars in uncollected sales taxes that could build \nthe infrastructure we all need.\n  I have heard from so many businesses back home in West Virginia, and \nI can tell my colleagues there is overwhelming support for this \nlegislation, and there has been from day one, since we became one of \nthe first States to enter into this streamlined compact. That was in \n2003. It started with three States, up to 24 States now, and we have a \npathway for all the States to have equalization.\n  ``I own a small business that encourages local people to support \nlocal West Virginal artists.'' This is what a lady who wrote to me \nsaid. She is a small business owner. Her name is Parween Mascari. She \nsays:\n\n       I own a small business that encourages people to support \n     local West Virginia artists. Because we sell from a physical \n     storefront, we must collect and remit sales tax from our \n     customers. Online merchants do not currently have to collect \n     or remit a comparable tax on sales they make online. That is \n     not only fundamentally unfair, but seriously impairs our \n     ability to be competitive in the market when we have to \n     charge our customers a tax that they don't have to pay when \n     they shop online.\n\n  I wish to commend Senator Durbin and Senator Enzi and my senior \nSenator Rockefeller for taking leadership on this important issue and \nfor introducing the Marketplace Fairness Act. I am a proud cosponsor of \nit because I believe it is fair and good for America. I believe this \nlegislation restores fairness and balance to our tax system and \nstrengthens our businesses and revitalizes our downtowns. It creates \njobs and helps States struggling to provide the services their citizens \nexpect.\n  This measure has broad support in both parties, as we have seen by \nthe votes we have already taken. It is backed not only by mom-and-pop \nstores and Main Street merchants, but also by giant online retailers \nsuch as Amazon. I urge Senators to act without any further delay.\n  I thank my colleagues and, again, I say this is a matter of fairness. \nIt is a matter that I think restores the fairness in American retail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, my friend from West Virginia says this \nbill is important for his State. I understand that, but this is a bill \nthat doesn't work for my State of New Hampshire. His suggestion that if \nStates don't like it they have the option not to participate just \ndoesn't work because the businesses in my State of New Hampshire are \ngoing to be affected.\n  This is a proposal that fundamentally violates State sovereignty. It \nenables one State to impose the enforcement of its laws on the 49 other \nStates and territories without their approval. This legislation would \nimpose new burdens on small businesses not only in New Hampshire but \nactually across the country.\n  I represent a State that does not have a sales tax. There are still \nsome States in this country that don't have sales taxes. So my \ncolleagues can understand why I oppose this measure, because this \nlegislation will hurt small, online, family-owned businesses in New \nHampshire--businesses that have no experience collecting sales taxes \nwhatsoever.\n  The proponents of this legislation have said small businesses will \nnot be affected, thanks to the exemption for businesses with less than \n$1 million in revenue. That is just not true. This legislation creates \na disincentive for Internet firms to grow and create jobs for American \nworkers. We know that the margins for so many small online retailers \nare very slim. I will give you an example.\n\n  I have heard from a small business owner in Hudson, NH. Hudson is \ndown along the border of Massachusetts. I know the Acting President pro \ntempore knows it well. This small business owner's business is \napproaching $1 million in revenues, and he has about six employees--\njust six employees.\n  Now, under the Internet sales tax legislation before us, this company \nwould be considered a large business--revenues over $1 million--because \nthey are almost there. But if this legislation passes, the company's \nplans to grow will be in doubt. They are going to be forced to \nreconsider whether they are going to continue to grow, continue to hire \nmore employees, because this arbitrary threshold creates a real \ndisincentive for them to grow.\n  Now, e-commerce has been a real boon to small businesses in New \nHampshire and across the country. It has helped companies find new \nmarkets. It has helped them add new revenues. But for companies looking \nto grow through online sales, this legislation represents a real \nceiling for growth.\n  That is why I have joined with a number of my colleagues to call on \nthe Senate to rethink this legislation. We need to think through its \nunintended consequences. Small businesses across the country--not just \nin non-sales tax States, such as New Hampshire, but small businesses \nacross the country--will see their tax burdens increase. I want to give \njust a few examples of the new burdens that are going to come with this \nlegislation.\n  First, as I mentioned, each State has different sales and use taxes, \nso businesses would need new software to figure out how to collect and \nremit the right taxes. It is my understanding that the States, under \nthis legislation, would be responsible for providing that software to \nthe businesses in their State. I think this creates an unfunded \nmandate, for the State of New Hampshire to have to provide that \nsoftware for the small businesses in the State that would be affected.\n  Small businesses would also need to collect personal information from \neach buyer to make sure they are complying with all State and local \nsales taxes.\n  These small businesses would also have to deal with audit and \nenforcement actions from out of State. In other words, they would have \nto answer to taxing authorities in places where they have no \nrepresentation whatsoever. And as States and localities consider new \ntaxes, these small businesses would have no voice in that process \nbecause they have no representation in those jurisdictions.\n  So these are just a few examples of the many unintended consequences \nthis legislation would create.\n  I intend to join with a number of my colleagues in filing amendments \nto improve this bill, including ways that we can protect States rights \nand small businesses. If the State of New Hampshire does not want to \nparticipate because we have no sales tax and we do not think our \nbusinesses should be forced to collect Massachusetts sales taxes or \nMaine sales taxes or Vermont sales taxes online, then it seems to me we \nought to be able to opt out of this legislation.\n  The citizens and small businesses in New Hampshire that will be \naffected by this legislation deserve a full hearing on these issues, \nand I urge my colleagues to join us in addressing these defects before \nwe pass this bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. This bill would level the playing field \nbetween brick and mortar retailers and their online counterparts by \nallowing States the right to collect sales taxes on remote Internet \npurchases.\n  The current system of collecting online sales taxes puts brick and \nmortar retailers at a significant disadvantage. Mom-and-pop stores \ninvest in office\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\nspace, inventory, and hire salespeople in order to provide service to \ntheir customers.\n  Increasingly, those efforts are falling victim to a practice known as \nshow rooming, where potential customers enter the physical store, take \nup the salesperson's time, then make their purchases at home online at \na discount because no sales tax is collected.\n  I have witnessed this firsthand. Imagine you are in the women's shoe \ndepartment of a nice retail store. An attentive salesperson spends a \nconsiderable amount of time with a potential customer finding the right \nsize, trying several pairs of shoes, and answering the customer's \nquestions.\n  Then the customer pulls out their phone and orders the same pair of \nshoes online at a lower price, in effect bilking the salesperson for \nthe time spent with the customer. Some people are brazen about doing \nthis.\n  Effectively, brick and mortar retailers are providing services to \nonline retailers at no charge.\n  This bill simply brings State sales and use tax collection into the \n21st century. When the Supreme Court first considered the issue of \ncollecting out of State online sales taxes, it was in the early 1990's \nand there were only a trivial amount of online sales.\n  The ensuing two decades have brought sweeping changes to the online \nmarketplace and the technology that facilitates online sales tax \ncollection.\n  Online sales continue to increase relative to conventional retail \nsales. And applications exist that allow retailers to easily collect \ntaxes on out of State sales.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act would level the playing field by doing \nthe following:\n  Allow States the option to collect remote sales taxes; require States \nto set up a streamlined tax collection process in order to simplify \nremittance for online businesses, require States to provide the tax \ncollection software to retailers free of charge, and exempt online \nretailers with less than $1 million in remote sales from having to \ncollect and remit online sales taxes.\n  It is important to note that many States are already moving to \ncollect sales taxes on remote sales. Just last year, California came to \nan agreement with amazon.com that required the online sales giant to \nstart collecting sales taxes on purchases made in California.\n  Furthermore, State laws currently require the collection of online \nsales taxes. However, rather than the retailer being in charge of \ncollection, it is up to individual taxpayers to calculate and remit the \nsales taxes they owe on online purchases.\n  It is estimated that only 1.4 percent of Californians actually remit \nsales taxes from online purchases, a number roughly in line with other \nStates. State and local governments, which rely in part on sales taxes \nto fund local schools and infrastructure, are increasingly burdened by \ntheir inability to collect sales taxes on online purchases that are \nlawfully owed.\n  So this is not a new tax. It is not overly burdensome on small \nbusinesses. And it accounts for the fact that more and more retail \nsales will be taking place online.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act puts every business on a level playing \nfield and ensures that tax loopholes do not create unfair advantages \nfor certain retailers. It is time that our tax policy reflects \nfundamental changes in the retail marketplace, and I strongly encourage \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize an \nimportant anniversary--the 25th anniversary of the signing of the \nConvention Against Torture--and would like to do so in the context of \nthe recent publication of an important report on the U.S. policies and \nprograms put in place following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001.\n  After 9/11, Americans came together and set aside their differences. \nThose terrible events unified this country in a common desire to bring \nto justice those responsible and to do whatever was necessary to \nprevent future attacks.\n  We have spent over a decade successfully reducing al Qaida's ranks, \nand--until last week--doing so without another major attack on U.S. \nsoil. Yet there have been countless mistakes and costs incurred in the \npursuit of these goals.\n  One of these key mistakes is the program that the Central \nIntelligence Agency initiated after 9/11 to detain and interrogate \nterrorist subjects. The details of how this program came to be and how \nit was conducted are outlined in the Senate Intelligence Committee's \n6,000-page report on the CIA's detention and interrogation program--\nbased on a documentary review of over 6 million pages of CIA and other \nrecords and including 35,000 footnotes. In December I voted with a \nmajority of my colleagues on the committee to report out the study and \nto send it to the CIA for its review and comments.\n  I believe that the CIA's detention and interrogation program was \nseverely flawed. It was mismanaged. The ``enhanced interrogation \ntechniques'' were brutal. And perhaps most importantly, the program did \nnot work. Nonetheless, it was portrayed to the White House, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Congress, and the media as a program that \nresulted in unique information that ``saved lives.''\n  At his confirmation hearing, I urged CIA Director John Brennan to \nlead in correcting the false public record about the CIA's program and \nin instituting the necessary reforms to restore the CIA's reputation \nfor integrity and analytical rigor. I firmly believe that the CIA \ncannot be its best until its leadership faces the serious and grievous \nmistakes of this program.\n  Some say that by looking backward, we are focusing on ``archaeology'' \nto the exclusion of our national security interests today. I would \nargue that acknowledging the flaws of this program is essential for the \nCIA's long-term institutional integrity--as well as for the legitimacy \nof ongoing sensitive programs. The findings of this report directly \nrelate to how other CIA programs are managed today.\n  The CIA, the White House, and other agencies continue their review of \nthe committee's report on the CIA's detention and interrogation \nprogram, and the Senate Intelligence Committee expects to see an \nofficial response soon. But this is not a report I can talk much about \nor share, since it remains classified.\n  That is why I am thankful for the release of a report by the \nConstitution Project's Task Force on Detainee Treatment. The task force \nwas led by former Representative Asa Hutchison and former \nrepresentative and retired Ambassador James Jones and made up of former \nhigh-ranking officials and experts from across the political spectrum. \nThis was a 2-year effort, based on an examination of available public \nrecords as well as interviews with over 100 former detainees, military \nand intelligence officers, interrogators, and policymakers.\n  In a news article on the report, Mr. Hutchison--who served in several \nroles in the Bush administration, including as undersecretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--said that after researching this issue \nfor nearly 2 years, ``he had no doubts about what the United States \ndid.'' He concluded that ``it's incredibly important to have an \naccurate account not just of what happened but of how decisions were \nmade.'' He added, ``The United States has a historic and unique \ncharacter, and part of that character is that we do not torture.''\n  I couldn't agree more with his sentiments. As one of the task force's \ncontributors, former Ambassador Thomas\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\nPickering, states in a Washington Post opinion piece I will ask to have \nprinted in the Record, ``Admitting our mistakes is the only legitimate \nbasis on which we can reassure the world that America remains committed \nto the rule of law and to upholding human rights and democratic \nvalues.''\n  I commend the report of the Constitution Project's Task Force to my \ncolleagues. I also urge the administration to work closely with the \nSenate Intelligence Committee as it conducts its review of the \nCommittee's report.\n  In marking the 25th anniversary of President Reagan's signing of the \ninternational Convention Against Torture, I remind my colleagues and \nthis administration that the government has an obligation to the \nAmerican people to face its mistakes transparently, help the public \nunderstand the nature of those mistakes, and correct them. Director \nBrennan and this administration have an important task ahead in this \nregard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objective the material was printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 16, 2013]\n\n            America Must Atone for the Torture It Inflicted\n\n                        (By Thomas R. Pickering)\n\n       Thomas R. Pickering is a member of the Constitution \n     Project's Task Force on Detainee Treatment. He was \n     undersecretary of state for political affairs from 1997 to \n     2001 and served as ambassador and representative to the \n     United Nations from 1989 to 1992.\n       It's never easy in this volatile world to advance America's \n     strategic aims. For more than four decades, in the service of \n     Democratic and Republican presidents, it was often my job to \n     persuade foreign governments to adhere to international law \n     and observe the highest standards of conduct in human \n     rights--including the strict prohibition of torture. A report \n     released Tuesday by an independent task force on detainee \n     treatment (to which I contributed) makes it clear that U.S. \n     officials could have used the same advice.\n       Unfortunately, the U.S. government's use of torture against \n     suspected terrorist, and its failure to fully acknowledge and \n     condemn it, has made the exercise of diplomacy far more \n     daunting. By authorizing and permitting torture in response \n     to a global terrorist threat, U.S. leaders committed a grave \n     error that has undermined our values, principles and moral \n     stature; eroded our global influence; and placed our \n     soldiers, diplomats and intelligence officers in even greater \n     jeopardy.\n       It's not just the Bush-Cheney administration that bears \n     responsibility for diminished U.S. standing, although the \n     worst abuses undeniably took place in the years immediately \n     after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The Obama administration \n     also has failed to be as open and accountable on such \n     fundamental questions of law, morality and principle as a \n     great power that widely supports human rights needs to be.\n       What can be done to mitigate the damage and set this \n     country on a better course? First and foremost, Americans \n     need to confront the truth. Let's stop resorting to \n     euphemisms and call ``enhanced interrogation techniques''--\n     including but not limited to waterboarding--what they \n     actually are: torture. Torturing detainees flies in the face \n     of principles and practices established in the founding of \n     our republic, and it violates U.S. law and international \n     treaties to which we are a party. Subjecting detainees to \n     torture, no matter how despicable their alleged crimes, runs \n     counter to the values embodied in the U.S. Constitution.\n       Too much information about the abuse of detainees remains \n     hidden from the American people. Specifically, the Obama \n     administration's ongoing concealment of the details about our \n     use of torture has made it impossible for the United States \n     to comply with its legal obligations under the U.N. \n     Convention Against Torture and has contributed to a \n     disturbing level of public support for torturing suspected \n     terrorists.\n       President Obama should direct relevant officials to \n     declassify as many related documents as possible as quickly \n     as possible--starting with the more than 6 million pages of \n     classified documents that were the basis for the Senate \n     intelligence committee's recent report on the CIA's \n     interrogation program, and the still-secret report itself--so \n     that the American people may finally learn what was done in \n     our name. Admitting our mistakes is the only legitimate basis \n     on which we can reassure the world that America remains \n     committed to the rule of law and to upholding human rights \n     and democratic values.\n       Second, Congress needs to work with the administration to \n     close the loopholes that allowed torture to occur under a \n     pretense of legality. In 2009, Obama signed an executive \n     order giving interrogators clear instructions about \n     permissible techniques. But future presidents could reverse \n     course with the stroke of a pen--and no public notice.\n       To ensure that cannot happen, the federal Anti-Torture \n     Statute should be amended to make clear that the deliberate \n     infliction of severe pain and suffering is torture--\n     regardless of the duration of the torment being inflicted. \n     The War Crimes Act should be amended to make clear that \n     cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees is a \n     federal crime even when it falls short of torture. Instead of \n     being told to rely on secret legal memos or doctors' \n     unethical monitoring of brutal interrogation sessions, \n     interrogators should be given unambiguous orders that all \n     detainees are to be treated in strict compliance with Common \n     Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which is the basic \n     provision of international law outlawing torture. And there \n     should be clear, public rules ensuring prompt access to \n     detainees by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n       Third, the United States must not transfer detainees to \n     torture in other countries. Such transfers, known as \n     ``renditions,'' have occurred under Presidents Bill Clinton, \n     George W. Bush and Obama--despite the fact that they violate \n     the Convention Against Torture. In part, this is because of a \n     policy of reliance on ``diplomatic assurances'' from other \n     countries that detainees would not be tortured, despite clear \n     evidence that these assurances were not credible. In part, \n     this is because the United States has refused to acknowledge \n     that the prohibition against transfers to torture is legally \n     binding outside of U.S. territory. Both must change.\n       Democracy and torture cannot peacefully coexist in the same \n     body politic. Successful human rights diplomacy and torture \n     can't either. Our country and its place in the world--as well \n     as the Americans bravely serving in military, intelligence \n     and diplomatic posts around the globe--deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2895-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ALASKA RESCUE COORDINATION CENTER\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I would like to take the time today \nto congratulate the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center, RCC, for \ncompleting their 5,000th mission since July 1, 1994.\n  The Alaska Rescue Coordination Center has operated in Alaska since \n1961, but since July 1, 1994, the RCC has been staffed solely by Alaska \nAir National Guardsmen under the operational active-duty commander of \nthe 11th Air Force. Since that time, the men and women of the Alaska \nAir National Guard have kept watch 24 hours a day, seven days a week, \ncoordinating an average of more than five missions a week for nearly 19 \nyears.\n  The 12 Alaska Air National Guard members who work in the RCC on a \nrotating schedule all have a background in either rescue operations as \na member of the Alaska Air National Guard's 210th, 211th or 212th \nRescue Squadrons, or are command and control specialists with \nexperience in rescue control operations.\n  On March, 27, 2013, the RCC coordinated the Alaska Air National \nGuard's successful recovery of a pilot who crashed a Super Cub aircraft \nnear the Bering River northeast of Cordova, AK, completing their \n5,000th mission.\n  The RCC relies heavily on the support of other agencies during \nsearch-and-rescue missions. Aside from the Alaska Air National Guard \nand Alaska Army National Guard, during a mission, these agencies can \nalso be called upon: Alaska State Troopers, U.S. Coast Guard District \n17, Civil Air Patrol, National Park Service, North Slope Arctic Borough \nSearch and Rescue, Alaska Mountain Rescue, SEADOGS K-9 Search and \nRescue Team, Anchorage Nordic Ski Patrol and various other volunteer \nsearch groups.\n  Their busy season follows the weather trends with an increase in \nsearch-and-rescue missions toward the end of summer into the fall \nhunting season. Ask anyone in the rescue business, and you will hear \nthat no two search-and-rescue cases are alike. Throughout the years, \nthere have been many high-profile missions adding up to the 5,000 \nmissions and Alaskans are thankful for their knowledge, dedication, and \nexpertise.\n  Thank you for allowing me to take a moment to recognize the heroic \nefforts of the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center and their 5,000 \nmissions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2895-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2895-S2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ARLENE MULDER\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Arlington \nHeights Mayor Arlene Mulder. After 20 years of service to the village \nas mayor, she is taking a well-deserved retirement.\n  For 34 years, Mayor Mulder has been a tireless public servant--from \npark\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\ndistrict commissioner to village trustee and eventually mayor. She has \nserved on countless boards and commissions, but the title that I was \nmost grateful for was that of ``friend''.\n  I have known Arlene since the days I was a congressional staffer for \nCongressman John Porter. Arlene was a ``get things done'' mayor. It is \nwhy she was tapped by both Democrats and Republicans to partner on \nissues. When I first took office as Congressman for the 10th \nCongressional District, Arlene quickly became my go-to mayor for a host \nof issues.\n  Whenever we wanted to schedule a townhall meeting in the northwest \nsuburbs, Arlene was my first call. I remember during the health care \ndebate we had a townhall meeting at the village building. When hundreds \nof citizens showed up and it was clear our room would not be large \nenough to hold everyone, Arlene immediately went into action and helped \nus have not one townhall meeting, but two back-to-back. Her \nresourcefulness ensured that we could communicate with twice the number \nof constituents on a very important issue.\n  While we Senators may feel as if we have a full workload between \nconstituent and committee meetings, votes and briefings, Arlene's \nmembership in outside organizations is enough to make even the best \nmultitasker dizzy. She has served on more than a dozen outside boards, \ncommissions, and committees, many focused on the importance of \ntransportation. As a member of Metra's board of directors, she became \nan advocate for thousands of suburban commuters who rely on commuter \nrail to get to their jobs. As chair of the O'Hare Noise Compatibility \nCommission, she led efforts to ensure a balance between the economic \ndevelopment role of O'Hare International Airport and the impact on \nsurrounding communities.\n  But what I will miss most is our time at the Arlington Heights \nMemorial Day Parade. Each year, we would honor a local veteran with a \nmilitary award that was earned but never received. It was always a \nmoving day, and while she will not be the mayor at future ceremonies, I \nknow I will see her there for many years to come.\n  While I am honored to serve as Arlene's Senator, I am more proud that \nArlene was my mayor. Her dedication to the village and people of \nArlington Heights will not be forgotten. I wish Arlene and her husband \nAl and their entire family all the best as she begins the next phase of \nher public service. Arlington Heights and the State of Illinois were \nlucky to have her. Thank you, Arlene for all that you have done for \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2896-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2896-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2896-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 6:42 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1246.

A bill to amend the Helium Act to improve helium stewardship, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Murkowski and I are \nintroducing the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013. This legislation is \ndesigned to establish a responsible management strategy for the Federal \nHelium Reserve that will prevent the disruption of the entire helium \nsupply chain that impacts major parts of the U.S. economy.\n  Helium is a valuable national resource that is used for a wide range \nof applications such as a coolant for magnetic resonance imagining \nmachines, semiconductor manufacturing, military aviation, aerospace, \nand Federal R pressurizing and purging systems; leak detection; \nwelding; and breathing mixtures. Helium uses are diverse. Substitutes \nare often unavailable. The current global supply is constrained.\n  The Federal Government has long been in the helium business. In the \n1920s, helium was used to float blimps or national defense purposes. \nSince that time the Federal Government has continued to play a \nsignificant role in the production, refining, and storing of helium. \nThis has included establishing a U.S. underground stockpile known as \nthe Federal Helium Reserve located just outside of Amarillo, TX. The \nReserve currently supplies 40 percent of the domestic and 30 percent of \nglobal helium demand. Eventually, the helium supplies in the Reserve \nwill become too depleted to be used, but for now they provide a \ncritical source of supply.\n  Current law requires the Federal government to sell off the crude \nhelium remaining in the Federal Helium Reserve in order to repay the \nU.S. Treasury the $1.3 billion debt incurred creating it. That debt \nwill be fully repaid this fiscal year. As a result, the helium program \nwill terminate in October absent Congressional action. The result, if \nCongress does not extend operation of the Reserve, will be significant \ndisruption in sector after sector of economy--everything from medical \nimaging to semiconductor manufacturing.\n  We need to act. It is important that we act now.\n  Our bottom line goal is to keep the Federal Helium Reserve open, \nuntil new sources of supply can be developed, and prevent significant \ndisruptions to a number of critical U.S. industries.\n  This bipartisan bill has two primary objective; one is to ensure \nhelium market stability for end-users, and to ensure a fair return on \nthis Federal asset to American taxpayers. We believe that it is \nessential that there be an adequate price discovery mechanism for the \nsale price of helium to nongovernmental organizations. Our bill would \nrequire the Secretary of Interior to establish an auction process to \nensure that government prices for helium reflect its value in the \nmarketplace based on an initial auction of 10 percent of supply and \nincreasing that amount by an additional 10 percent a year. But it is \nalso important to keep in mind that the Reserve currently provides \nmajor shares of the domestic and global helium supply and we do not \nwant this legislation to disrupt the many industrial and heath care \nactivities that are dependent on helium.\n  I believe this legislation strikes the right balance. The bill \nprovides for an orderly, gradual transition among three phases, \nresulting in minimal market disruption to end users. It introduces a \nprice discovery mechanism and transparency measures that will increase \nthe taxpayer return and stimulate investment in private-sector sources. \nIt further gives priority to meeting the needs of Federal users at \nFederal agencies, national laboratories, and universities. This \nlegislation maintains access to crude helium for Federal users to \nperform the experiments that lead to the discoveries that drive \neconomic growth, while requiring the development of a long-term plan \nfor Federal helium purchases.\n  Helium may not be the most high profile natural resources, but it is \none resource that is central to our economy. This legislation is \nurgent, critical, and necessary to ensure that we continue on a \ntrajectory for economic growth that protects the jobs of domestic \nmanufacturers and industrial partners as well as Federal users across \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand agricultural opportunities for military \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in 1787, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter \nto George Washington in which he wrote ``Agriculture is our wisest \npursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, \ngood morals, and happiness.''\n  Those words remain true for our farmers and ranchers today but they \nalso ring true to for veterans who are returning from service and \nreturning to the land.\n  Our veteran unemployment rate is shameful, and it really hits home in \nrural States like Montana where so many folks volunteer for service. I \nbelieve we must think outside the box and look for ways to boost jobs \nfor our veterans in everything we do. Which has me turning to the Farm \nbill.\n  Today I, with my colleague Senator Johanns, have introduced the \nAgricultural Opportunities for Military Veterans Act which will help \ncreate new opportunities for our veteran populations hoping to become \ninvolved in farming and ranching.\n  With over 45 percent of those who serve in the military coming from \nrural communities Congress must ensure our returning servicemembers \nhave a variety of resources at their disposal.\n  My bill will help boost veteran employment through the Farm bill. It \nwould create a veteran preference in programs that make it cheaper and \neasier to institute best practices in farming and ranching.\n  The bill also creates a new Military Liaison Office to assist \nveterans at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and expands outreach \nprograms to help make sure veterans are aware of the resources \navailable to them.\n  I urge my colleagues to join myself and Senator Johanns in supporting \nveterans through our programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 788.

Res. 105\n\n       Whereas, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (referred to in this preamble as the ``FDIC''), \n     at least 28.3 percent of households in the United States, or \n     nearly 34,000,000 households with approximately 67,888,000 \n     adults, are unbanked or underbanked and therefore have not \n     had the opportunity to access savings, lending, and other \n     basic financial services;\n       Whereas, according to the FDIC, approximately 30 percent of \n     banks reported in 2011 that consumers lacked understanding of \n     the financial products and services banks offered;\n       Whereas, according to the 2012 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling--\n       (1) approximately 42 percent of, or nearly 98,000,000, \n     adults in the United States gave themselves a grade of C, D, \n     or F on their\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n     knowledge of personal finance, and 4 out of every 5 adults \n     admitted that they could benefit from additional advice and \n     answers to everyday financial questions from a professional;\n       (2) the number of adults in the United States who admit to \n     not paying their bills on time has increased from 28 percent \n     in 2011 to 33 percent, or nearly 77,000,000, in 2012;\n       (3) only 43 percent of adults in the United States keep \n     close track of their spending, and more than 13,000,000 \n     adults do not know how much they spend on food, housing, and \n     entertainment, and do not monitor their overall spending; and\n       (4) 2 out of every 5 adults in the United States, or more \n     than 93,000,000, are saving less than they did in 2011, and \n     approximately 39 percent of adults report that they have no \n     non-retirement savings;\n       Whereas the 2012 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that--\n       (1) only 14 percent of workers were ``very confident'' \n     about having enough money for a comfortable retirement, which \n     is a sharp decline in worker confidence from the 27 percent \n     of workers who were ``very confident'' in 2007; and\n       (2) approximately 56 percent of workers say they or their \n     spouses have not calculated the amount of money they need to \n     save for retirement;\n       Whereas, according to a 2012 ``Flow of Funds'' report by \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \n     aggregate household debt in the United States was \n     $12,800,000,000 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012;\n       Whereas, according to the Survey of the States 2011: \n     Economic, Personal Finance, and Entrepreneurship Education in \n     Our Nation's Schools, a biennial report by the Council for \n     Economic Education--\n       (1) only 22 States require students to take an economics \n     course as a high school graduation requirement;\n       (2) only 16 States require testing student knowledge of \n     economics; and\n       (3) only 12 States require students to take a personal \n     finance course either independently or as part of an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement;\n       Whereas, according to the Gallup-Operation HOPE Financial \n     Literacy Index, only 54 percent of students in the United \n     States have money in a bank or credit union account;\n       Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system \n     will provide individuals with less expensive and more secure \n     options for managing finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, \n     credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of \n     household, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and \n     citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by an increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas, in 2003, Congress determined that coordinating \n     Federal financial literacy efforts and formulating a national \n     strategy is important;

Res. 108\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is recognized throughout the United States as \n     the number to call in an emergency to receive immediate help \n     from police, fire, emergency medical services, or other \n     appropriate emergency response entities;\n       Whereas, in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a \n     ``single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and various Federal \n     Government agencies and governmental officials supported and \n     encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas, in 1968, the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (commonly known as ``AT'') announced that it would \n     establish the digits 9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Congress designated 9-1-1 as the national emergency \n     call number in the Wireless Communications and Public Safety \n     Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81; 113 Stat. 1286);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the 9-1-1 \n     system works, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the eyes \n     and ears of the public and the emergency response system in \n     the United States and is often the first place emergencies of \n     all magnitudes are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant \n     homeland security asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas dispatchers at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population of the United \n     States, including individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, \n     or deaf-blind, or have speech disabilities, is increasingly \n     communicating with nontraditional text, video, and instant \n     messaging communications services and expects those services \n     to be able to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas numerous other ``N-1-1'' and 800 number services \n     exist for nonemergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, 5-\n     1-1, 7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental health \n     hotlines, and the public needs to be educated on when to use \n     those services in addition to or instead of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the population of the United States \n     each year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited \n     knowledge of the emergency calling system in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are highly likely to need to access \n     9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use new \n     technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made every year by \n     children properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which saves \n     lives and underscores the critical importance of training \n     children early in life about 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, including by the \n     placement of prank and nonemergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources and \n     needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and all other caregivers need to \n     play an active role in 9-1-1 education for children, but can \n     do so only after first being educated themselves;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas children, parents, teachers, and the National \n     Parent Teacher Association make vital contributions to the \n     education of children about the importance of 9-1-1 through \n     targeted outreach efforts to public and private school \n     systems;\n       Whereas the United States should strive to host at least 1 \n     educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in every \n     school in the country every year;\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     National 9-1-1 Education Month could include--\n       (1) public awareness events, including conferences, media \n     outreach, and training activities for parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, other caregivers, and businesses;\n       (2) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (3) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2013 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges governmental officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies, training events, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/23/senate-section/article/S2903-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 740.
