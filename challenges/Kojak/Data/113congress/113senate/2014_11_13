Mr. President, I note that we are going to have some \ndiscussions between the leaders about the agenda coming up. I would \nlike to take a few minutes to make it perfectly clear that I think one \nof the first steps we need to take to assure voters that we have heard \nthe message and that I myself have heard that message is to get our \nwork done on the floor of the Senate.\n  I am a centrist. I am a proud centrist. The record expresses that I \nam a centrist. As I have said a thousand times on the floor and 10,000 \ntimes at home, I have been part of the coalition that has helped make \nthis place work when it did, and I have been part of the coalition that \nhas tried to make this place work even when it didn't. The record is \nclear. I don't have to say more about that.\n  But yesterday when I arrived in Washington thinking that it would be \na very good time to begin our work and came to the Senate floor, I was \nactually very surprised that neither leader on either side--neither \nHarry Reid nor Mitch McConnell--was prepared to move us to a vote that \nis so obvious that we should do and has been obvious for a long time, \nand that vote is on the Keystone Pipeline.\n  As chair of the energy committee, I moved this out of my committee \nmonths ago--I said I would, and I did--and worked every day that I \ncould to get this vote up on the Senate floor.\n  I wish to submit for the Record and talk for a few minutes about it \nbecause I came here at 2:00 yesterday--it has been 24 hours. What a \ndifference 24 hours can make when a Senator is willing to stand up and \nspeak and lead. My leadership didn't give me permission to do this. \nNobody asked me to do it. And I waited for Mitch McConnell and John \nCornyn to call for a vote on the Keystone Pipeline, and neither one of \nthem did.\n  I would like to read what Leader McConnell said yesterday because at \n4:00 he is going to come to the floor and try to convince us he said \nsomething else. But the reporters have the Record, I have the \ntranscript, and I am going to take just a minute to read it now.\n  I am going to get to that in just 1 second because I have it, but I \nam going to paraphrase it now while the staff brings it to me.\n  Mitch McConnell came to the floor--and I was here when he spoke, so I \nknow it pretty well--he came to the floor, and then he took a few bows \nfor the win, and then he said there is some work we need to do in this \nlameduck session. He did not mention the Keystone Pipeline. It is not \nin the transcript. He said three things: He said something about the \nbudget, he said something about retroactive taxes, and he said a third \nthing. I will read the transcript into the Record in just a minute.\n  So I waited patiently, hoping he would say something about the \nKeystone Pipeline since it was talked about a lot on the campaign trail \nlast year, but he didn't. He said that he has his agenda and that it \nwas clear there were a few things we had to do in the lameduck, but the \nKeystone Pipeline wasn't one of them. So I was disappointed.\n  I had to wait for the second leader on the Republican side, John \nCornyn, to speak. There is a likely transcript that he has--here it is. \nHere is the McConnell transcript. This is what Mr. McConnell said \nyesterday. This is 24 hours later, after this Senator stood on the \nfloor and made some pretty pointed\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nremarks about the leadership on both sides here. This is 24 hours \nlater. But this is what Leader McConnell said yesterday:\n\n       In the weeks that remain in this Congress, we should work \n     to accomplish the essential task of funding the Congress and \n     preventing retroactive tax increases. We must address the \n     expiring authority passed earlier this session for the \n     Department of Defense to train and equip moderate, vetted \n     Syrian opposition, and we must continue to support the \n     efforts to address the Ebola crisis.\n\n  No mention of Keystone. Not one. If I were the leader of the majority \nparty and came back and said there is some unfinished business, after \ntalking incessantly about Keystone for the last 6 years, the first \nthing I would do is say----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We can have a short Thanksgiving break. We don't have \nto have a long break for Christmas. The problem is we haven't been \nworking.\n  Here is my list. He mentioned three things; Keystone was not on them.\n  Then, to shorten this, John Cornyn, the Senator from Texas, came to \nthe floor and he gave a very long list. He did in fact mention \nKeystone, but it was in the context of, as soon as we convene again in \nJanuary--a long list--we will vote on Keystone.\n  I came to the floor yesterday and said that was not good enough to \nthe leader of my leadership and the leadership of the Republican Party \nand said: You know what, I would like to vote on Keystone now.\n  So yesterday, because I gave that speech and because the public wants \nus to do this--more than I, the public wants a vote on Keystone and has \nwanted it for a long time. The House of Representatives took the bill \nthat Senator Hoeven and I had drafted, stripped the language of theirs, \nwhich would never have passed the Senate of the United States and would \nnever have gotten to the President's desk, and put our language in--\nlike I would be upset about that. I am not upset about that. I am happy \nabout that. I am grateful that I was able yesterday, in 3 hours, to \nmove the leadership of the Democrats in the Senate, the leadership of \nthe Republicans in the Senate, the Republican leadership in the House \nto get a vote on Keystone on Tuesday.\n  So I am going to come back and say more about this, but for the \nreporters who are not used to people being as direct as I am being now, \ngo read the transcript for yourselves so when they call press \nconferences later today and claim victory, please remember who was on \nthis floor talking about it. Mitch McConnell didn't mention it--the \ntranscript is right here--did not mention the word ``Keystone.'' John \nCornyn mentioned the word ``amnesty'' several times and ``Keystone'' \nonce. I am the Senator who came to this floor as chair of the energy \ncommittee to say: Let's get our business done; let's start now. And \nthat is what we are going to do. I am glad we are going to be voting \nvery soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Tribute to Former Congressman Lane Evans\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in this week of Veterans Day, I would like \nto take a few moments to speak about a very brave marine who was a \ngreat friend of mine and a true champion of America's veterans. \nCongressman Lane Evans of Illinois passed away last Wednesday. He was \nonly 63 years old. Lane had been battling Parkinson's disease for \nnearly 20 years. A few years ago, another illness, Lewy body disease, \nbegan attacking his memory. One cruel disease ravaged his body as the \nother assaulted his brain. But his spirit and his quiet courage \nremained unbroken to the end.\n  Lane Evans and I were both elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1982, two surprised Democrats who were elected in \ntraditionally Republican, conservative, downstate congressional \ndistricts. We were both sons of blue-collar families. We both learned \nour values from our parents, our neighbors, the nuns and priests at \nschool. We both learned from politicians who were leaders in our State, \nsuch as Senator Paul Simon.\n  Lane and I worked closely together in Congress. Parkinson's forced \nLane Evans to retire from Congress in 2007, long before his time. We \nremained friends. I used to visit him. When I did, we would share our \nfavorite stories about political adventures. Lane Evans was a kind and \ngood person. He was funny, with a razor-sharp intellect, and he was \ncourageous.\n  He joined the Marines 2 weeks after graduating from high school. It \nwas 1969. Lane was 17 years old. Military service was a tradition in \nthe Evans family. Lane's dad had served in the Navy. One of Lane's \nbrothers was already serving in Vietnam so Lane was stationed stateside \nand then in Okinawa. After 2 years in the Marines, he came home and \nused the GI bill to earn a college degree, graduating magna cum laude \nfrom Augustana College in Rock Island. Then he earned a law degree from \nGeorgetown. He came home again and started a successful law practice in \nRock Island serving children, the poor, and working families.\n  In 1982, Lane Evans decided to make a run for Congress. He may have \nbeen the only person in the beginning who thought he had a prayer of \nwinning. He had never run for office before. He was all of 31 years of \nage. He looked as though he was 21 on a good day. History was against \nhim. Voters in that district had only elected a Democratic Congressman \nonce in the previous century. That had been only for 2 years.\n  Lane Evans worked hard. He got lucky when the incumbent Congressman, \na lifelong Republican and moderate, lost to a hard-right challenger. On \nelection night in 1982, Lane Evans and I were both elected to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives for the first time. It was my third try to get \nelected. It was Lane's first. He never lost after that. He served 24 \nyears in the House. His voting record was often to the left of many of \nhis constituents, but he was unapologetic. Voters reelected Lane over \nand over because they knew he was honest, forthright, and he cared \nabout them. He was straightforward and sincere. People knew he was a \nman of principle who would always vote his conscience no matter what.\n  When it came to constituent service, Lane Evans set the standard. \nLane and his staff were so good at cutting through bureaucratic redtape \nthat the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee \nonce joked that ``two-thirds of the people in his district think that \nhe signs their Social Security checks.''\n  Lane's speeches were always packed and not because he was a great \nspeaker. People came to Lane's speeches because of what happened after. \nHe never left a speech until everyone in the audience who wanted to \nspeak to him had their chance. Lane's dad was a firefighter, his mom a \nnurse.\n  In the blue-collar neighborhood where he grew up, their steady \nincomes made the Evans family better off than most of their neighbors. \nAs a young lawyer and Member of Congress, Lane Evans fought for people \nsuch as the parents of his childhood friends who worked shifts in \nfactories and fire houses. He was a champion of blue-collar workers and \nsenior citizens.\n  Lane fought for fair trade, a fair minimum wage, and the right to \ncollectively bargain. He worked for a cleaner environment and \nprotection of family farmers. He fought to give students from working-\nclass families the same chance he had to get a good college education. \nHe was a giant on the House Armed Services Committee. He understood the \nRock Island Arsenal was more than just an arsenal for our Nation's \ndefense, it was a major, important employer in his district. Most of \nall--most of all--Lane Evans fought for veterans. This week of Veterans \nDay is a good time to remember how much Lane Evans of Illinois meant to \nAmerica's veterans and their families. He made veterans's concerns the \ncornerstone of his congressional career. He was the first chairman of \nthe Vietnam-era Veterans Congressional Caucus and the first Vietnam-era \nveteran to serve as ranking member of the House Veteran's Affairs \nCommittee.\n  He was also the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. \nDuring his time in Congress, there was no Federal program for veterans \nthat did not bear Lane Evans' mark. Veterans today enjoy increased \neducation benefits, improved health care, strengthened home \nloans, judicial review of their benefits, additional opportunities for \nveteran-owned businesses, and a host of other improved benefits because \nof the leadership, determination, and heart of Lane Evans.\n\n  From his earliest days in Congress, Lane Evans pushed for action on \nissues helping Vietnam veterans. He was an outspoken advocate to \naddress the problems and embarrassment of the homeless and substance \nabuse among Vietnam veterans. In his first term he led the effort to \ncreate a pilot tram establishing community-based veterans centers to \nhelp with job and marriage counseling and post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome long before it was a popular term.\n  The program has since grown to include veterans centers all across \nAmerica. Lane Evans led the fight to give compensation for Vietnam \nveterans exposed to Agent Orange and for their kids born with spina \nbifida as a result of that exposure. It was not just his war that \nconcerned him. He was one of the first Members of Congress to push for \nmore information about the Gulf War Syndrome. He supported increased \nopportunities for women in the military, an early supporter for full \ncivil rights for gays in the military.\n  Paul Rieckhoff, the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nhere is what he said about Lane:\n\n       In the early days of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, Lane \n     was one of the first members of Congress to take on issues \n     like PTSD and TBI.\n\n  Traumatic brain injury.\n\n       He helped put our issues on the map.\n\n  Lane Evans worked to include Parkinson's research as part of funding \nfor the VA, to make sure veterans suffering from this disease received \nthe best possible care. He worked with Senator Leahy, then-Senator \nHagel, and the Vietnam Veterans of America to push for a U.S. and \ninternational ban on the production of antipersonnel landmines.\n  He was awarded the Vietnam Veterans of America's first annual \nPresident's Award for Outstanding Achievement in 1990. In 1994, the \nAMVETs gave him the Silver Helmet Award, known as the ``Oscar'' of \nveterans' honors.\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\n  This is how Lane explained his commitment to veterans. He said:\n\n       Our veterans--those returning from Iraq, those who scaled \n     the cliffs above the beaches of Normandy, those who walked \n     point in the jungles of Vietnam, those who survived the \n     brutality of Korea and other battlefields, all who honorably \n     served or who are now serving, have earned the assurance that \n     VA--their system--will be there when they need it. ``Just as \n     we practice on the battlefield that we leave no one behind, \n     we should not slam the door on any veteran who needs the VA \n     system.''\n\n  The best way we can honor Lane Evans' memory is by more than just a \nspeech on the floor of the Senate, it is to continue his work on behalf \nof America's veterans, continue to work to make the VA responsive to \nthe massive number of disability claims that have been filed since Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and make sure every veteran receives respect, health \ncare, job training, and the opportunities they have earned.\n  There is another way we can honor this champion of veterans; that is, \nby naming the year-old VA medical center in Galesburg, IL, the Lane A. \nEvans VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic. This center is in the heart \nof what was Congressman Lane Evans' congressional district for so many \nyears.\n  Nearly 4,000 veterans a year seek services there. I am honored it is \na bipartisan effort to name this center after Congressman Evans, led in \nthe House by Congresswoman Cheri Bustos. Lane used to say he loved the \nMarines because the Marines salute their lowest members. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in honoring one of the Marines' finest members \nby supporting this proposal to name the VA outpatient clinic in \nGalesburg, IL, in honor of Congressman Lane Evans.\n  Lane Evans was laid to rest at the Rock Island Arsenal on the date of \nthe 239th anniversary of the Marine Corps. I remember so many years \nago--18 years ago--when Lane and I were in a Labor Day parade in \nGalesburg, IL. I did not think much of it at the time. It was just \nanother parade in another campaign. Lane told me later that he noticed \nsomething was wrong on that date. As he was waving his left hand, he \nrealized it was numb and he had no feeling.\n  He continued to work even after he had been diagnosed with early \nParkinson's. It made it difficult for him to stand without pain or to \neven smile easily. He never, ever complained. When his legs locked up \nwhen he was in terrible pain, he would tell his closest friends: I am \nso lucky. I couldn't carry mail, I couldn't be a meat cutter, but I can \nstill do my job as a Congressman.\n  As we say in Illinois, thank heavens for Lane Evans, and I thank the \ngood Lord he devoted so much of his life in Congress to the people he \nloved in his district and to the veterans of America.\n  I offer my condolences to Lane's family, especially his three \nbrothers, to his brothers and sisters in arms, and to all of us who \nloved him and were touched by his gentle life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Remembering Tom Menino\n\n  Ms. WARREN. I rise today to honor a departed friend and committed \npublic servant, Tom Menino. He was a devoted husband to Angela, loving \nfather to Susan and Tom Junior, and adoring grandfather to six \ngrandchildren.\n  For 20 years Tom served as mayor of Boston and led the resurgence of \nour city. He believed in economic growth and building communities, \nfighting for hospitals, scientific research, and innovation, while \nsimultaneously strengthening our neighborhoods, expanding our parks, \nand knitting diversity into a community of equals.\n  Mayor Menino succeeded because he knew all along that our fortunes \ndepend on our working together as one people, one community, one \nBoston, and he did everything he could to create that united Boston.\n  Reports are that Mayor Menino had personally met more than half the \nresidents of Boston, and we believe it. In our happy moments--Red Sox \nchampionships--and in our darkest moments--when smoke arose at Copley \nSquare--we knew we could always count on Tom Menino to be there.\n  Mayor Menino's Boston lived up to the vision of its founders: a city \nthat all eyes can see is a model for the country and for the world.\n  On behalf of a grateful people, I urge my colleagues to come together \nto pass a resolution that was introduced only yesterday by Senator \nMarkey and me celebrating the life of Mayor Tom Menino.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Keystone Pipeline\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleagues for allowing a 10-minute \ndiscussion today by unanimous consent on an important issue the \nCongress is taking up today.\n  On the House side, debate on the Keystone Pipeline is starting, and I \nunderstand there could potentially be a vote as early as tomorrow. I am \nso pleased to have been one of the spark plugs that helped to get us \nmoving not in the next Congress but in this lameduck session of this \nCongress.\n  The American people spoke loudly and clearly not only in my State of \nLouisiana but around the country, wanting us to work together to get \nthe job done.\n  I was very pleased that the Republican leadership brought to the \nfloor the early childhood education bill that Senator Lamar Alexander \nhas been leading. It is a very important bill. I, frankly, don't think \nit is more important than the Keystone Pipeline, however. So I was \npleased yesterday to come to the floor and offer, as chair of the \nenergy committee, my own priority list of what I think is most \nimportant. I say that with sincerity because I actually support both \nvery strongly.\n  I have several amendments to Senator Lamar Alexander's bill which \nhave not been adopted and which I understand, unfortunately, will not \nbe allowed for debate. So I don't know if I will be able to vote for \ncloture on his bill, although I strongly support it. My record is as \nstrong as anyone's in this Chamber. So I will be interested to see if \namendments to the Lamar Alexander bill will be allowed on the floor. I \nam hoping they will. If I can get at least a vote on the amendments I \nhave pending to that bill, I will absolutely--whether my amendments \npass or fail--vote for it because it is the will of the body and we \nmust do something. We must invest more money. We must have more quality \nprograms for early childhood education. It is an absolute cornerstone \nof strengthening and building the middle class.\n  In my State, that is what we are focused on, and I can't go anywhere \nwithout people telling me: Senator, thank you for your fight for \neducation. Senator, thank you for your fight for early childhood \neducation. Senator, thank you for fighting to take student loans down \nfrom 11 percent--the rate on student loans--to 3 percent.\n  On almost every day of this last election cycle, that is what I was \ntalking about at home, and I know Members who were in elections or even \nnot in elections heard clearly from the American people, during the \ntime we were home working, how much what we do in Congress can matter, \ncan make a difference in their lives. They don't want government \nintrusion, but they do want government to function so they can get a \ngood college education, so they can get good job training, so they can \nstart businesses that can grow profits for themselves and their \ncommunities.\n\n  I look forward to that debate, and I am very happy the Republican \nleadership rushed to the floor to put down a bill on early childhood \neducation because I think they heard from the American people that just \ntalking about tax cuts for the wealthy, tax cuts for people making over \n$1 million a year, and tax policy--yes, it is important, but what is \nvery important is fighting for the middle class.\n  I say congratulations to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. That \nis the first bill the Republicans have put down in this lameduck, and I \nlook forward to working with him.\n  But the first bill that we put down and I put down as chair of the \nenergy committee--unusual for Democrats because we don't have our whole \ncaucus supporting it, but we have a good strong part of our caucus \nsupporting it--is a bill that is going to actually create immediate \nhigh-impact jobs for this country today, soon, as it is being built. As \nsoon as this bill passes and as soon as the President signs it into \nlaw, there will be an immediate, dramatic push from the oil and gas \nindustry and\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\nfrom the energy industry broadly--alternative energies, wind, solar, \ncoal, and clean coal technologies--because the vote on Keystone and the \nPresident's signature on Keystone is a signal, a strong signal, it is a \ngreen light that America is ready to go, that we are following the \nscience, that we are following our process, that we are respecting \nprivate property rights. And, yes, we are respecting States in their \nviews of where these pipelines should be sited. No State--not Nebraska, \nnot West Virginia, and not Louisiana--wants to be told by the Federal \nGovernment where pipelines are coming through on private property. No \nState. So Nebraska does have an issue that has to be resolved. They \nhave an issue that has to be resolved about where that pipeline should \nbe laid, and the Republican Party should most certainly respect States \nrights on where that pipeline should be laid.\n  The bill Senator Hoeven and I have acknowledges that process. It also \nacknowledges private property rights, and it says it is time to build \nthe Keystone Pipeline.\n  This was not a last-week election wake-up call; I have been working \non passing the Keystone Pipeline before I was the chairman, all during \nmy chairmanship, years ago, as a senior member of the committee, and \nnow as chair. I have not stopped and came very close to getting a vote \non this floor before the election. Frankly--and the reporters should \nknow this--it was really held up by the politics of both sides. That is \nnot what is said, but that is the actual truth--the politics of both \nsides. I see Senator Manchin on the floor, who is a strong supporter, \nand he might talk a little bit about that. Both sides have some blame \nas to why we couldn't get to a vote, but I will let the record speak \nfor itself.\n  This is the pipeline. This is what has to be built. As you can see, \nit doesn't come into Louisiana, but it most certainly impacts my State. \nIt impacts the entire country.\n  These are already pipelines that we have in America. This is just \nanother important pipeline because it connects Canada--our greatest \nally and our great economic partner--with the refining strength of \nAmerica, which is not only in Louisiana and Texas but primarily in \nLouisiana and Texas. It begins to move a great product, produced with \nthe highest environmental standards in the world, approved by this \nadministration's environmental department saying it meets the \nenvironmental standards of transportation, et cetera, and it meets the \nstandards of this administration's State Department when it comes to, \nis it in America's interests. They said yes, it is in America's \ninterests. That standard has been met. So let's build the pipeline.\n  I came to the floor yesterday. The Republicans brought their early \nchildhood education bill to the floor. I am so proud they did. I \nbrought Keystone Pipeline. Because I did, it seemed to have moved lots \nof things, which I am pleased about, and I think the Senator from West \nVirginia may wish to comment. But it seemed to have shaken up a few \nthings and moved a few things, and that is good because Senators who \nare energetic and motivated and can build coalitions--like Senator \nManchin and I do every day when we are here--can actually get things \ndone.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me say to all of our colleagues and all of my \nfriends on the Republican side and my friends on the Democratic side \nthat this is the greatest opportunity we have had in the 4 years since \nI have been in the Senate to have truly a jobs bill, a quality jobs \nbill that pays high wages. Almost every State in the Nation benefits by \nthe Keystone Pipeline.\n  If you want to take politics out of this, take all of our names off. \nSenator Landrieu says take her name off. Take my name off. Take \neverybody's name off, and let's find out who really rises to help \nAmericans.\n  This is one bill that we have been trying to bring to the forefront. \nSenator Landrieu has brought it how many times? She was the first \nperson--I said yesterday--who, 4 years ago when I came to the Senate, \nexplained to me how important it was and how it interconnected all of \nus. I am very appreciative of that.\n  Now Mary is in the political fight of her life. I pray to the good \nLord that the good people of Louisiana understand the fighter she is \nand what she produces for America every day.\n  With all that being said, she is willing to take her name off if this \npiece of legislation will move forward so that the Presiding Officer in \nMontana and I in West Virginia can get some high-quality jobs. We all \nbenefit from this.\n  Next, it makes our Nation secure. If you want to protect your people, \nhave a secure nation and don't go chasing energy all over the world. It \ntakes us places we don't want to be and shouldn't be. This does all of \nthat as far as securing our energy and making us energy independent.\n  But I just saw after the election--and we accept that. I am on the \nDemocratic side. I heard loud and clear the people of West Virginia and \nthe changes they want. What they really told us is: We want you all to \ndo something. If you have a chance to help us with a good job, do it. \nDon't argue over your politics. It seems as if you are more concerned \nabout your own status of being a politician or being an elected \nofficial than you are about mine, which is basically paying my bills, \ntaking care of my family, and being able to be a good American.\n  What we are saying, we thought we heard that loud and clear. So I \nwill say to all of my friends on the Republican side and all of us on \nthe Democratic side, take a moment and listen to what was just told to \nus. What was told to us is to do our job--that is what Senator Landrieu \nwas trying to do--move this important piece of legislation forward and \ndo the job we are supposed to.\n  The best politics is good government. If we do something good as a \nRepublican and as a Democrat, we all get credit for it. We do something \nbad, and then we try to blame each other--who did it worse than the \nother. We all get blamed for it. This is the best thing we have had for \nthe last 4 or 5 years. We have had a hard time getting to this point, \nto almost get a vote for it, and now they want to say: Well, one-\nupmanship--we will see if it can come over from the House side with a \nperson who is involved in a race against Senator Landrieu. Forget about \nthose people.\n  Forget about all of us who cosigned and cosponsored this bill, \napparently.\n  Just pass it. Give us a vote and pass it. That is all we are asking \nfor. I think if we do that, the people will say: I think they heard us, \nand I think they are starting to do something. That is why I am on the \nfloor with Senator Landrieu and the people willing to fight for the \njobs that Americans need--not just in Louisiana but in West Virginia, \ntoo, and also in Montana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I think the Senator pointed out some key points--not \nonly how important this pipeline is for the middle of America but for \nthe economy of the whole country.\n  The pipeline and the supplies that are coming and the workers to \nbuild this pipeline come from all over the country. The businesses that \nsupply the gadgets, the widgets, the steel, the trucks, the forklifts, \nthe equipment, the cranes that come to build this pipeline come from \nall over the country.\n  But more important than the pipeline itself, which is going to move \nhundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from Canada--which we \nwould much prefer to deal with and trade with, than, let's say, \nVenezuela or some other countries that don't share our values. More \nimportantly than that, it is going to transport it in the safest way.\n  Without this pipeline, this oil will be produced. We cannot stop \nCanada from producing it. They are going to produce it, and it is going \nto be moved east and west by rail or moved south by truck. We cannot \nput any more trucks on our highways, and we can't crowd our rails.\n  I know there are people, like my good friend from Massachusetts, \nSenator Markey, who is going to surely speak against this pipeline and \nwhy, from his perspective, it is not the right thing to\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\ndo. And I respect those views. I strongly disagree with him, but I \nrespect him. I strongly disagree with his arguments--and we will have \nthis debate in the coming days--and I respect him.\n  But the point is this. Whether you support the Senator from \nMassachusetts' or you support the Senator from Louisiana's views, the \npoint is we need to vote. That is the process. I believe we have the 60 \nvotes on this floor to pass this bill. I believe we have always had the \nvotes to pass this bill, if we can just get it to a vote.\n  Now, as is the process, the Senate has to pass the bill, it has to go \nto the House, and then it has to go to the President. He can sign it or \nhe can veto it. I do not have at this date any indication that he will \nveto this bill. He could issue a veto warning on it in an hour, he \ncould do it tomorrow, he could do it next week. That is not the point.\n  The point is the Senate must begin to be the Senate again. Let the \nPresident worry about being the President. Let the House worry about \nbeing the House. Let the Senate be the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let the Senate be the Senate. That is what my voters \nsaid. I think that is what voters in Tennessee said. I think that is \nwhat voters in North Carolina said, and I think that is what the voters \nin Massachusetts said. Let the Senate be the Senate.\n  We are the greatest deliberative body in the world. Let's debate. \nLet's vote. Let's get the work done. Let the chips fall where they may. \nThe public can accept that. They cannot accept--and they should not \nhave to accept--gridlock, game playing, and raw politics on the great \nfloor of this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Louisiana, and \nthere is no more fierce advocate for this pipeline in our country. She \nhas been a relentless advocate for that pipeline. I am not going to \nspeak on this issue today, but I look forward to a much more extensive \ndebate that we will have next week. But there is no one more vulnerable \nthan the Senator from Louisiana in her advocacy.\n\n\n                         Remembering Tom Menino\n\n  I rise today to speak about Tom Menino, our great mayor from the city \nof Boston who just passed in the last month. He always looked out for \nthe little guy. He always stayed true to the people who elected him, \nand he stuck by his principles.\n  In every neighborhood across the city, Boston mourns the loss of our \ngreat mayor, Tom Menino. We mourn along with his wife Angela, his \nfamily, and everyone who ever was touched by Mayor Menino. But we will \nfill that void with the love and respect that we have for the life and \nthe legacy of this extraordinary man.\n  Boston loves Tom Menino because Tom Menino loved Boston with all of \nhis heart. Tom Menino wasn't satisfied with leading the best city in \nAmerica. He wanted Boston to be the best city in the world. He was an \nurban architect without equal, attuned to every detail in every \nneighborhood. He forged a more inclusive Boston, where diversity is \nembraced. Tom Menino was everyone's mayor.\n  In a poll a few years back, half of all Bostonians in the poll said \nthey had personally met Tom Menino. That really captures how Tom Menino \napproached his job, but we all know how he viewed those poll results--\nthat his job was only half done.\n  Yet Mayor Menino's vision for Boston was global, and he pushed the \ncity into a new era of innovation. He helped our shining city on a hill \nilluminate its light of innovation across the world, building a beacon \nof entrepreneurship and ingenuity. He laid the foundation for Boston's \neconomic leadership in the 21st century, including spearheading \nBoston's Innovation District and developing the seaport area.\n  The Innovation District is supporting the companies and industries \nthat are creating jobs today, and Mayor Menino has ensured that Boston \nwill continue to be a national leader in biotechnology, clean energy, \nand health care for generations to come. He did all of this while \nkeeping Boston's historic character alive. Tom knew what potholes \nneeded filling, but he also knew when to leave the cobblestones alone.\n  So today, if you take a drive around Boston--or, as Tom would want \nyou to do, take a bike ride--you would see there is no place in Boston \nthat hasn't felt the caring imprint of Tom's hand: kids playing on new \nplaygrounds in safer neighborhoods; poor communities with better access \nto life-saving health care; entrepreneurs and investors collaborating \non the next big thing.\n  Boston will move into the future a stronger, brighter, safer, and \nhealthier city because of Tom Menino. So today we honor his life and \nhis legacy. Tom Menino is a man and a mayor for the ages.\n  Rest in peace, Mayor Tom Menino.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2650\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be asking a unanimous consent \nrequest to bring up S. 2650, the Corker-Graham-McCain-Ayotte-Rubio \nlegislation. Senator Murphy, I think, is going to speak here in a \nsecond, but if I may do two things: I wish to reserve 20 minutes of \ntime to be divided between myself, Senator Corker, and Senator Rubio to \nspeak about the topic. But I would now like to make a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined \nby the two leaders, but no later than November 24, 2014, the Committee \non Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration of S. \n2650, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill \nbe read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of \nthe bill with no intervening action or debate. Further, if passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, just to \nmake a few brief comments prior to my colleagues speaking on their \nrequest on the underlying bill, it is my understanding that the request \nis to bring a bill to the floor that would create an \nextraconstitutional process by which the House and the Senate would \nconvene on a possible statement or resolution of disapproval on an \nagreement that has heretofore not been negotiated between the United \nStates and our allies and Iran with respect to that country's nuclear \nprogram and nuclear ambitions.\n  I think we are all of one mind in that we are hopeful that these \nnegotiations are concluded successfully, that we are able to stand \ntogether and say that we have used diplomacy rather than military might \nin order to dislodge from Iran any prospect of obtaining a nuclear \nweapon. But we are at an absolutely critical moment in these \nnegotiations, and I believe the underlying bill which is being asked to \nbe brought to the floor today would undermine those negotiations by \nsending a message that Congress does not stand with the President as he \nand his team negotiate these final agreements.\n  There is going to be a legitimate question as to what Congress's role \nis, but we won't know that until we see the agreement. We won't know \nwhether it rises to the level of a treaty. We won't know whether we \nneed to pass legislation to immediately repeal sanctions versus having \nthem temporarily suspended. This bill has not gone through the \ncommittee process.\n  While it raises, I think, some legitimate questions of what \nCongress's role is going to be, if there is ultimately an agreement \nworked out between the P5+1 and Iran, it is premature at this point to \nset into law a process by which we would vote an agreement up or down \nuntil we understand what the agreement is in the first place.\n  That is my primary reason for standing here and ultimately \nregistering an objection. I do worry as well that it would send a \nfairly chilling message to our negotiators and to those who are in the \nroom if the signal is that the Congress is not giving the full \nauthority to\n\n[[Page S5968]]\n\nthis President under the Constitution in order to negotiate an \nagreement which is ultimately going to be, we hope, to the benefit of \nthe United States and global security.\n  I know my colleagues have time constraints and want to speak on this \nunderlying bill. So, with that, I object to the unanimous consent \nrequest\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague very much for \nspeaking in a way so we can all have time on the issue.\n  No. 1, about the chilling messages, this is a chilling message from \nthe Supreme Leader of Iran about 3 days ago: Nine questions about the \nelimination of Israel. In this tweet--and I will read some of it \nlater--the Ayatollah, the Supreme Leader in Iran, talks about how to \nannihilate the State of Israel during the negotiations.\n  Also, recently an IAEA inspector was talking about elements of the \nIranian nuclear program that have been hidden that would make it larger \nthan we all suspect.\n  What are we trying to do? I would like to bring the Iranian nuclear \nprogram to an end through peaceful means, and by an end, I mean the \nfollowing: I would welcome a deal that would allow the Iranians to \nproduce peaceful nuclear power but without the capability of turning \nthat program into a weapons program.\n  I fear that we are on the road to a North Korean outcome, where the \ninternational community gave a rogue regime a small nuclear program to \nbe monitored by the United Nations--and the rest is history regarding \nNorth Korea.\n  I have asked several times to the administration: Tell me the \nsafeguards that exist in these negotiations with Iran that did not \nexist in North Korea, and I have yet to get an answer.\n  It is pretty openly known that the administration and the P5+1 have \nconceded a right to enrich uranium as part of any deal with Iran. To \nthat I say: Of all the nations on Earth, given their behavior, name one \ncountry that you would put in the category ahead of Iran when it comes \nto denying them the ability to have a centrifuge that one day could be \nused to make a weapon. The idea of giving an enrichment capability to \nthe Iranians, given 30 years of lying, deceit, American blood on their \nhands, and recent tweets about annihilating Israel to me is insane.\n  So all we are asking is that any deal negotiated between the P5+1 \ncome to this body for a discussion and a vote. Senator Corker is the \nprimary author of this legislation.\n  Here is what I can tell the world: Nobody wants any more war. But we \ndo not want to allow the Iranians, given their behavior, the capability \none day to develop a nuclear weapon, and that is exactly what they have \nbeen trying to do. They have lied about their program. They have been \ndeceptive about their program. They have blood on their hands when it \ncomes to killing Americans in Iraq. They are one of the largest state \nsponsors of terrorism in the world.\n  The idea that we would give them an enrichment capability just \nastounds me. We are telling our allies--South Korea, and the UAE: If \nyou want a nuclear program, fine--don't enrich the uranium.\n  There are 15 nations in the world that have nuclear programs without \nan enrichment capability. To concede one to the Iranians is the \nultimate act of throwing the Mideast into further chaos, because the \nSunni Arabs, the mortal enemy of the Shia Persians, will want a \ncapability of their own of like kind or greater. The worst possible \noutcome is to give a regime this dangerous the capability or the \npotential to one day make a bomb. One centrifuge in the hands of people \nwith this mentality is one too many.\n  To the Iranian people, my beef is not with you. My beef is with your \nleaders who have taken the world down a dark path.\n  This legislation is pretty simple. Bring the deal to the Senate. We \nwill have a right to file a motion of disapproval. We will have a vote, \nwe will have a debate, and if it is a good deal, it will be approved. \nIf it is a bad deal, we will stop it.\n  I cannot imagine the Senate and the House sitting on the sidelines \nand ignoring something this important.\n  To Senator Corker, who will soon be the Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, this was his original idea. We have tried to \nperfect it, but what I really believe is what he tried to do months ago \nto make sure the Congress would have a check and balance over any deal \nwith the Iranians was smart. It would enhance the administration's hand \nwhen it comes to negotiating because they would have to tell the \nIranians, it is not just us you have to please, you have to go before \nthe representatives of the American people. That would lead to a better \noutcome. If it truly is a North Korea in the making, we will have a \nchance to stop it.\n  President Obama wants a deal too badly, in my view; but at the end of \nthe day, let's wait and see what happens. I just want to let the \nIranians and the administration know beforehand, we will not sit on the \nsidelines and watch you go it alone. This is one decision the President \nwill make that the Congress has to be read in on and have a say about. \nThis is not the time to let President Obama go it alone. The stakes are \ntoo high for Israel, for the United States, for the world at large.\n  What do I fear the most? I fear that over time we will give the \nIranian ayatollahs the capability to develop a nuclear weapon. Name one \ntechnology they developed that they haven't shared with terrorists. And \nit will surely come our way.\n  To our friends in Israel: No Israeli mother can ever go to sleep at \nnight thinking her children are safe and the future of that country is \nsecure if the Iranians have a nuclear capability. When the ayatollahs \nsay openly they wish to destroy the State of Israel, to annihilate the \nState of Israel, I believe they mean it. When the Jewish people say \nnever again, they speak based on past experience.\n  Of all the scenarios in the world that could throw this world into a \nchaotic situation beyond what you see today, it would be to allow the \nayatollahs a nuclear weapon. The Sunni Arabs will have one of their \nown. Israel will never know a minute's peace, and I fear that it would \ncome our way.\n  I would like to now yield to Senator Corker who can explain the \ndetails of the legislation, why we are asking this to be taken up \nbefore the end of negotiations.\n  A week from Monday the deadline comes to an end. I want everybody at \nthe negotiating table to know this deal is so important to the United \nStates and the world that the Congress needs to have a say. Barack \nObama should not be able to make any deal with the Iranians that is \nbinding unless the Congress approves, and the Iranians should never be \nallowed to have a nuclear capability, period, that could be turned into \na weapon.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Corker.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator. I want to thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his distinguished leadership on so many national \nsecurity issues. I understand his frustration with our inability to \nactually take a vote on something that is such a commonsense measure. I \nalso respect the committee process, as you could imagine, with the role \nI play and wished that our committee would actually take up this piece \nof legislation.\n  I actually tried to offer something very similar to this in \ncommittee, and I actually did offer it, and the bill that was being \noffered, too, was taken down and no votes taken, because, again, of not \nwanting to deal with this issue.\n  So I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for desiring to make \nsomething happen on this. As he mentioned, all of us want to ensure a \nsuccessful negotiation. I cannot imagine there is a person in this body \nwho doesn't want the negotiations between the P5+1 to end up with a \ngood long-term conclusion. I agree based on the signals that are being \nsent. There are a lot of bipartisan concerns that have been expressed \non this floor by people of both sides of the aisle, because people \nunderstand that this body, along with working with the House, put in \nplace the sanctions that have actually gotten us to the place where we \nare in the negotiations. The initial agreement that was put in place \nwas so much weaker than even the U.N. security resolutions that passed \nover and over and over relative to Iran.\n  So I agree that by having us making the final say on this negotiation \nthat it gives the administration some added\n\n[[Page S5969]]\n\nstrength that they were unable to show in the beginning. Obviously Iran \nis trying to tilt toward those within their own body, their own \ncitizens, who certainly are concerned about negotiations and continue \nto bring that out throughout the negotiations. It seems to me that \nCongress would be an outstanding countervailing force. And obviously \nsomething of this magnitude--especially when Congress brought us to the \ntable--this is the kind of thing that should be weighed upon.\n  What the bill would do is obviously give us the opportunity within a \ndefined amount of time to vote up or down on whether we agree that this \nshould be put in place. It also puts in place some enforcement \nmechanisms. Then it also puts a clock on the negotiations, so, again, \nwe cannot have these continual extensions.\n  I recently read the newest book Henry Kissinger wrote. It was a great \nbook to read, but it put in place one of the chapters that focused on \nthese Iran negotiations and lays out the fact--and I know the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer today knows this well because he \nfocuses so much on nuclear issues and, like me, is very concerned about \nproliferation around the world. I have enjoyed working with him on the \nForeign Relations Committee. Interestingly, one of the chapters lays \nout the progression that occurs. And Iran, just by stalling each time \nthese negotiations take place, ends up in a better place. Again, I \nthink all of us were very shocked with the interim agreement that was \nput in place first. I think this is a very commonsense piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let me point out something my friend from South Carolina did not \npoint out. Without this, this is what is going to possibly happen--I \nhope it doesn't, but possibly happen. The administration can enter into \na deal. The way we have crafted the sanctions, no permanent--no \npermanent--arrangement can be made to undo the sanctions. Only Congress \ncan do that. But the way the sanctions regime has been put in place, \nthe President in many cases does have the ability on a temporary basis \nto do away with the sanctions. It is evident that the administration \nvery much wants something to happen. I want to see something happen, \nbut the way this has gone, it appears they want something to happen \nthat possibly will not stand the test of time.\n  Let's say they enter into an arrangement by November 24. They undo \nthe sanctions temporarily. If that happens, basically the work that has \nbeen done around here for years is over. It is done because it will be \nimpossible from a practical standpoint to ever get those sanctions back \nin place, especially sanctions with the many other countries that are \ninvolved.\n  So if the President enters into an agreement and temporarily does \naway with sanctions, I think everybody in this body understands it is \ngoing to be almost impossible for those to be put back in place. So the \ndamage is already done. And that is why it is so important from my \nperspective, with Congress having played the role that Congress has \nplayed to help put us into this position, very important for Congress \nto have the opportunity to have the congressional review this bill lays \nout.\n  Look, I think it is pretty evident with the denying, if you will, of \nthis bill coming to the floor, which was expected, I think it is very \nevident that Congress is not going to have the opportunity between now \nand the 24th to weigh in. It is my hope that somehow if these \nnegotiations unfortunately end up putting us in a very bad place--I \nhope that doesn't happen. I hope the outcome is much better than what \nis anticipated. But if it ends up unfortunately being something that is \nnot good for our country, I hope what will happen is the next time we \nask to bring this bill up--because of time being of the essence, the \nnext time it would be brought up, hopefully Members of this body would \nagree that Congress would weigh in in a rightful manner. Congress would \nweigh in to make sure we don't enter into a deal as a nation that puts \nus in a very bad place in the longer term relative to what Iran is \ndoing.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to speak. I do not see \nSenator Rubio here in the body.\n  I yield the floor. It is my sense that Senator Rubio may come down \nand want to speak to this.\n  But I do want to say in closing, all of us here hope the \nadministration puts our Nation and the world in a place to know that \nIran will not have the capability of developing nuclear weapons. That \nis what this piece of legislation is about. Without it, I hope the \nadministration still does that, obviously, and that we wake up on \nNovember 25 surprised--but happily surprised--that we ended up in a \nplace that will stand the test of time.\n  I yield the floor and it has been a while, but I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Keystone Pipeline\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as you know--and many know--I have come \nto the floor now on several occasions since we arrived back here at 2 \np.m. yesterday to talk about an important piece of legislation I have \ncosponsored with Senator Hoeven. I understand Senator Hoeven is going \nto be speaking about the Keystone Pipeline in a few moments, and the \nRepublicans have reserved some time to speak this afternoon. I will \nonly take 5 minutes and will stay as the discussion on the Keystone \nPipeline goes forward.\n  Yesterday at 2 o'clock I came to the floor of the Senate when the \nSenate opened to say how important I thought it was that we listen and \nhear what the voters said not only in my State but in Kentucky, Texas, \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, and all over the country. Regardless of \nwhether the people were Democrats, Republicans, left or right or \ncenter, they want us to get our job done.\n  I think one of the most important jobs we have as Senators is to \nvote, and I have been frustrated, along with many Members on both sides \nof the aisle, about why we have not been able to vote on some very \nimportant pieces of legislation.\n  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation, and that is \nwhy I came down at 2 o'clock to claim time at my seat. I have been here \nfor 18 years. This is Louisiana's seat. One of the things we have to \ntalk about right now--not next year or not next week--is the Keystone \nPipeline.\n  I know the Presiding Officer and other Members of this body, mostly \non the Democratic side, are not strong supporters and have expressed \nthat view. I understand it, I respect it, but I don't agree with it. It \nis time for us to have a vote.\n  Because of the advocacy yesterday when the Senator from West Virginia \nand the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp--she has been a \nvery strong and effective advocate. I wish to give a shout-out to both \nof my colleagues from West Virginia and North Dakota. They have been \ntireless in their effort to try and build a 60-vote margin.\n  In the old days we could pass bills with just 51 votes, and some \npeople want to go back to that. I have mixed feelings about it, but it \nwould be great if we could pass things by a simple majority. But the \nrules of the Senate which we operate under--and have not requested to \nchange, and I don't believe will change any time in the near future--\nrequires us to have 60 votes.\n  We worked and worked and worked to try to get 60 votes. Since May, if \nwe could just get this vote to the floor, I believe we have the 60 \nvotes to pass it. It looks like that is going to happen, and I could \nnot be happier. I could not be more grateful to the House of \nRepresentatives for taking up not their bill but Senator Hoeven's bill \nand my bill. They are debating it right now, and I believe we will pass \nit.\n  I don't know how many Democrats will vote for that bill, but I think \nthere will be some Members who will vote for that bill. I don't know \nhow many, but I believe there are 60 votes in this Senate to pass the \nKeystone Pipeline bill and send it to the President's desk.\n  What President Obama does with it, I don't know. I am urging him to \nsign it. Seventy-five percent of the people in our country want this \nKeystone Pipeline built. There are jobs at stake. It is\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\na signal that America is ready to be energy independent.\n  When I say ``energy independent''--to my good friend, the Presiding \nOfficer from Massachusetts--I, of course, mean more oil and gas. I am \nfrom an oil-and-gas State. We have coal States, but we also have States \nthat have solar and wind and drop-in fuels and new technologies.\n  This pipeline is a symbol that America is ready to do what it takes \nto become energy independent and to use our resources so we can create \njobs for the middle class.\n  I see the Republican leader, and I appreciate that signal. So I will \njust conclude with my statement, but I do wish to be a part of this \ncolloquy today, if allowed, so I may continue to talk about the \nimportance of this issue.\n  I am happy the House has taken up the Hoeven-Landrieu bill--the exact \nlanguage of the bill. We can call it whatever they want. They can put \nany name they want on the bill as long as it gets passed because that \nis what we need to do for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for 6 long years the Obama \nadministration has been dragging its feet on the Keystone Pipeline. For \nas long as anyone can remember one Senator has worked harder than any \nother to ensure that those feet are always held to the fire; that is, \nour friend the senior Senator from North Dakota.\n  Senator Hoeven has been a tireless advocate for the shovel-ready jobs \nproject. The people of North Dakota are lucky to have him in their \ncorner. Similar to the experts, Senator Hoeven knows the Keystone \nPipeline will create literally thousands of jobs, and similar to the \nexperts, Senator Hoeven knows the Keystone Pipeline would have almost \nzero net effect on our climate, and similar to the people we represent, \nhe understands that the Keystone Pipeline is just common sense. He has \ndone just about everything possible to make the administration come to \ngrips with that obvious point.\n  Senator Hoeven, along with leaders in the House, such as Congressman \nCassidy, succeeded in assembling and leading an impressive Keystone \ncoalition that literally crossed party lines. That is why the opponents \nof Keystone have been so afraid to allow the Senate to take a free and \nopen vote on it, because they feared Senator Hoeven and Congressman \nCassidy were right; that there is overwhelming bipartisan support for \nending the President's blockade of these very good jobs.\n  After so many years of obstruction, we finally get the vote. After 6 \nyears, we finally get the vote. We can credit the people's choice of a \nnew Senate majority for finally getting these gears turning. But we \nnever would have gotten to this point without the tireless leadership \nof Senator Hoeven in the Senate and Congressman Cassidy over in the \nHouse.\n  I wish to thank Senator Hoeven for all of his great work on this \nmatter. We hope we can soon celebrate a well-deserved victory for the \nAmerican people.\n  I understand we have colleagues on the floor as well, and I will be \nhappy to yield at this time for any thoughts or questions they may \nhave.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have a question, if I could ask the Republican \nleader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from North Dakota have a question? I \nbelieve I have the floor, and I believe Senator Hoeven is going to ask \na question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the minority leader, but I \nask him to repeat his question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As the Senator from North Dakota was engaged in \nconversation, I was talking about his leadership role in this endeavor \nthe last 6 years and the difficulty of getting action here in the \nSenate. It almost seems to me as if it took an election by the American \npeople to choose a new majority for next year to begin to get the \nattention of the current majority to go forward on the issue that \nSenator Hoeven has been talking to us about on a virtually daily basis \nhere for 6 years.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the minority leader. \nThat has been the case, that we have worked for some time to get a vote \non this important issue. We actually had passed a measure back in 2012 \nattached to a payroll tax holiday. At that time the President turned \ndown the Keystone XL Pipeline project on the basis of the route in \nNebraska. So that work has been done. It has been rerouted.\n  Some time ago, we put together a bipartisan bill. It is a bill I \ndrafted and wrote. Senator Landrieu from Louisiana agreed to cosponsor \nit. We have all 45 Republicans on the bill, and we have 11 Democrats. \nWe have 56 cosponsors on the legislation, but we have not been able to \nbring the bill to the floor. So I really had anticipated that we would \nhave to wait until the new Congress in order to get a vote on the bill, \nbecause as the minority leader said, the American voters spoke. And \nparticularly with the new Members we have coming, we will have more \nthan 60 Senators who support the legislation. So I had anticipated that \nwe would have to go into the new Congress to get a vote on the bill.\n  However, the cosponsor on the bill, Senator Landrieu, yesterday \nrequested that we call the bill up, and she worked on her side and we \nhave worked on our side to get unanimous consent to get a vote on the \nbill. So we are certainly happy to vote on this important issue for the \nAmerican people. We will have a vote in the House on the very same \nbill. They now have taken up the very same bill. I believe it will pass \neasily tomorrow in the House. And then on Tuesday, we will have a vote \non our bill here, S. 2280. We will have 45 Republicans, and we hope to \nhave 15 Democrats. And if we do, we will pass the bill and send it to \nthe President for signature.\n  If we don't get to the 60 votes, I believe we will still be able to \nbring the bill back in the new Congress and have the 60 votes. So I \nbelieve we will now be able to advance this bill to the President. The \nquestion is, What will the President do? The indication was from one of \nhis spokespersons traveling with him yesterday that he may well veto \nthe legislation. If that happens, I still think, again, based on the \nfact that the American people overwhelmingly support this legislation, \nthat we will be able to come back, work with our colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis and perhaps make this legislation part of a broader \nenergy bill, or attach it to an appropriations measure. But I think we \nwill be able to find other legislation that we can attach approval of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline--this bill--to. That makes it very likely that \nwe could either override a veto or maybe the President wouldn't veto \nit. Because at the end of the day, what this is all about is more \nenergy for this country, produced here and working with our closest \nfriend and ally, Canada.\n  This is about jobs. By the State Department's own environmental \nimpact statement, 42,000 jobs. So it is about energy. It is about jobs. \nIt is about the infrastructure we need to build the right kind of \nenergy plan for our country. Whether one comes from North Dakota or \nKentucky or Texas or Louisiana or wherever, we have to have \ninfrastructure as part of our energy plan.\n  It is also about national security. Americans do not want to have to \ndepend on getting oil from the Middle East. They want to produce it \nhere at home, and they want to work with our closest ally, Canada, and \nwe want the jobs and the economic activity that come with it.\n  So that is where we are. That is the game plan, to get this important \nlegislation passed, and that is what this is all about. This is about \nmoving forward on approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. When asked, the \nAmerican people in the polling showed anywhere from 65 up to about 75 \npercent overwhelmingly support it. So that is what this issue is all \nabout.\n  Now is our chance to show that we can move forward, and in a \nbipartisan way, and get this done for the people of this great Nation. \nWe are hopeful that we can get it in the lameduck. That is great. We \nhave cleared the way to get a vote, and if we can't, then we will be \nright back to work on it in the new Congress.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I could, it strikes me that there \nwas some intervening event here between the difficulty of getting a \nvote over the past few years and the apparent ease of getting a vote \nnow. It strikes me--and I would be interested in the observations of my \ncolleague from North Dakota--it strikes me this intervening\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\nevent was the election and it could be that the voices of the American \npeople have already altered the agenda in the Senate even before the \nSenate officially changes hands in January. Maybe the voices of the \nAmerican people have finally been heard on this important issue that \nthe Senator from North Dakota has been speaking about week after week \nafter week for a very long time.\n  I would say to the Senator from North Dakota, when there is a new \nmajority here, if we come up short between now and the end of the year, \nwe will be back and back and back, looking for ways to make sure that \nthe voices of the American people are heard, and all of these new jobs \nare created.\n  So I hope--the Senator from North Dakota has indicated we will come \nto a favorable conclusion sooner, but I assure the Senator from North \nDakota that we will come to a favorable conclusion later, if not \nsooner.\n  I see the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I agree with the Republican leader that \nour leader on this issue for years now in the Senate has been the \nSenator from North Dakota, and North Dakota is a big energy-producing \nState--second, I must point out, to my State of Texas, but they are \nmaking some rapid developments in that area, and a lot of Texans have \ngone temporarily to North Dakota to help them with the technology, and \nthey are doing a great job. Believe me, it is creating a lot of jobs. \nThese aren't minimum wage jobs, these are high-paying jobs. As a matter \nof fact, there are labor shortages, and what we need to do is train \nmore people to qualify for these good, high-paying jobs.\n  But I wonder whether the Republican leader--or really I would be \ninterested in anybody's point of view--beyond the election, I think \nthere are going to have to be some changes of heart on the other side \nof the aisle, because as the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \npointed out, we have gotten close, but never quite achieved that 60-\nvote goal. So if we are going to vote on this now as a result of the \nintervening election, there are going to have to be some folks on the \nother side of the aisle who are going to have to have a change of heart \nand vote for the bill, which I hope they do.\n  But this has been the main impediment--no opportunity for a vote--\nbecause the majority leader, Senator Reid, has refused to grant a vote \nup until this point. He has changed his mind. That represents progress. \nBut I think we have two impediments. One is the need for additional \nDemocratic votes to actually meet that threshold; and then, as the \nSenator from North Dakota points out, we don't know whether the \nPresident has been chastened or has learned anything from the election, \nor if he is going to be influenced at all in his decision.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota has been a bulldog on this \nissue. He is not going to let this one get away from him, nor should \nhe, for all the reasons mentioned earlier, including the 42,000 jobs. \nAlso, a lot of this oil, if it doesn't come in this pipeline across \nfrom Canada to the United States, most of it is going to be refined in \nsoutheast Texas and turned into gasoline and jet fuel, which is going \nto help bring down prices, because we will see a glut of additional \nsupply. But if we don't use it in the United States, this is going to \nbe shipped to China or other places that are rapidly buying natural \nresources.\n\n  So I would be interested if the Republican leader has a view of how \nwe get over those final hurdles of getting Democratic votes next \nTuesday to get to that 60-vote threshold. Then, how do we get the \nPresident to sign this, for a President--at least so far--who has \nrefused to listen to the American people?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend, we were both in an election \nthis year and there is no question that this jobless recovery is the \nbiggest issue in the country. Here we have had a project which has \ncleared all of the environmental hurdles, it has been sitting around \nfor literally 6 years, and--I don't know what the latest estimate of \njob creation is. I would ask my friend from North Dakota, what is the \nlatest estimate on that? How many new people would be put to work \nconstructing this pipeline--ready to go to work?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, there have been a whole range of numbers \noffered. But I think to cut through to a number that people should be \nable to accept and to agree on is to take the number the State \nDepartment has put forward in the environmental impact statement. As a \nmatter of fact, I think there have been either four or five \nenvironmental impact statements done on this project over a 6-year \nperiod, going all the way back to starting in September 2008 when \nTransCanada initially applied for approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline, \nwhich is the sister pipeline to the Keystone Pipeline, which was \nalready built--permitted in 2 years and built in 2 years--and that \nhappened when I was Governor. I actually started working with this \nproject when I was Governor and it continued when I came to the Senate. \nBut TransCanada originally applied for their permit back in September \nof 2008. So for 6 years this has been going on, and in the final \nenvironmental impact statement, which stated the project will have no \nsignificant environmental impact--it stated that very clearly--they \nalso said it will create about 42,000 jobs. And these are good-paying \njobs, construction jobs and other types of jobs that are good-paying \njobs.\n  So here is a project, when we include Canada, about $7.9 billion. It \nis not going to cost the government one penny--not one penny. By the \nState Department's own admission, it will create 42,000 jobs. It will \ngenerate hundreds of millions in tax revenue to help the States and \nhelp with our deficit and debt, and it is to move oil not only from \nCanada, but from my State of North Dakota and Montana to refineries in \nTexas and Louisiana and other places that need the crude, and right now \nthat crude is coming from places such as Venezuela or the Middle East.\n  It is a job creator, and there are all of these other benefits. \nAgain, it is an excellent example of the kind of infrastructure we need \nto build the energy plan this country needs.\n  I ask the minority leader if I have answered his question adequately.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, it strikes me what the \nadministration is best at is either destroying jobs or preventing new \njobs from being created. In my State, as a direct result of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, we have lost 7,000 coal-mining jobs \nduring the Obama years. For every coal-mining job, we lose three more \njobs. We have a literal depression in eastern Kentucky, largely caused \nby the Obama Environmental Protection Agency. So you begin to get the \npicture.\n  Whether it is preventing 42,000 people from going to work or taking \nthe employment away from up to 21,000 Kentuckians, what this \nadministration seems to be best at is either destroying existing jobs \nor preventing new jobs from being created. I am happy there was an \nenergy bill in Texas and an energy bill in North Dakota. I am pretty \ndarn unhappy we don't have an energy bill in Kentucky. We have a \ndepression again as a result of this administration and its \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, would the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the Senator from Kentucky--I think you described \nhow the administration appears to not just have a war on coal but a war \non hydrocarbons, a war on anything other than wind turbines and solar \npanels.\n  The President said he is for all of the above. We are a big ``all of \nthe above'' State. We have a lot of sunshine and wind. We actually \nproduce more electricity from wind energy than any other State in the \ncountry, but it is hard to understand this ideological battle against \ncoal and oil and gas from anywhere other than just an ideological \nperspective.\n  I think the Senators have pointed out well--both the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and the Senator from Kentucky--that these are good, high-\npaying jobs. One of the biggest problems we have had in the country for \nthe last 30 years has been stagnant wages.\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\n  The middle-class wage earners are not seeing their wages go up. One \nof the surefire ways to make them go up is to develop more domestic \nenergy, whether it is coal or whether it is oil or gas, because these \nare good, high-paying jobs.\n  I can tell you not just in North Dakota, where I am sure it is hard \nfor restaurants to find people to work there because there is so much \ndemand in the oil and gas business, but the Permian Basin, in the \nMidland Odessa area, where I know the Senator from Kentucky visited \nmany times, there is a shortage of labor, and wages skyrocketed because \nof the demand as a result of taking advantage of this natural resource.\n  I would just ask--obviously the Members of the Senate who have been \nvitally interested in this issue under the leadership of our friend, \nthe Senator from North Dakota--it has been acknowledged, but I think it \nis only fair, wouldn't the Senator say, to acknowledge the leadership \nin the House of Representatives of Congressman Bill Cassidy. As a \nmatter of fact, the bill that the House will pass tomorrow and send \nover here is chiefly the work product of Congressman Bill Cassidy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It certainly is. We commend him for his good work and \nthat bill will be headed over this way. I would also make the \nobservation with regard to the President's approach to energy, the \nannouncement in China yesterday which, as I read it, gives the Chinese \n16 years to do anything to reduce their carbon emissions while we are \ngoing full speed ahead here, visibly destroying American jobs or trying \nto prevent the creation of new jobs in North Dakota.\n  My goodness, as I said earlier, it seems to me what this \nadministration is best at is either destroying existing jobs or \npreventing new jobs from being created because of this obsession, as \nthe Senator from Texas pointed out, with hydrocarbons of any kind.\n  I see the Senator from South Dakota here as well and wonder if he may \nhave a question.\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes. I would say to my colleague from Kentucky--and I \nappreciate the leadership of our colleague from North Dakota in \nconstantly, persistently trying to get this in the Senate for a vote. \nMy State of South Dakota, similar to so many others, stands to benefit \nenormously from this. We wish we had the direct energy production that \nthe Senator of North Dakota has. We have a lot of indirect benefit from \nthat. In fact, the State Department, the President's own State \nDepartment--not the oil companies--the State Department has said that \nin my State of South Dakota it would create 3,000 to 4,000 jobs, add \n$100 million to the economy, and generate $20 million in property tax \nrevenue.\n\n  I happen to come from a county through which the pipeline would pass, \na small rural county in South Dakota. My father still lives there. He \nis 94 years old. The school district there is very concerned about \nstaying open. They know that when this pipeline is built, the easement \nthey will have to get will generate property tax revenue that very well \ncould keep the school district going. So many of the local governments \nout in my area in the State are very supportive of this important \nproject.\n  I guess as I have looked at this--we have now had plenty of time to \nlook at it since it has been kicking around here for about 6 years and \nfive now environmental impact statements, all of which came back and \nsaid they have minimal impact on the environment.\n  If we are serious about job creation, and we have all talked on our \nside about the jobs this would create, the economic activities it would \ncreate, and the lessening of the dependence we have on foreign sources \nof energy--I have to say one other thing about my State; that is, we \nhave a rail crisis. We have been battling now for a long time with the \nlimited capacity in rail and much of the oil moving out is going on \nrail.\n  That makes it harder for us to get our agricultural commodities to \nthe marketplace, and so what is happening is that we are consistently \nstressed. The one thing the pipeline would do in addition to moving \nCanadian oil down is it would allow for about 100,000 barrels a day of \nthat--what do you call it--sweet light crude--to be put on the pipeline \nand therefore not on the rail car. That saves about a unit train a day, \nwhich is significant.\n  I guess I would say to my colleague from Kentucky--and I appreciate \nthe arguments he has made not just with respect to this specific issue \nbut also with what the administration's policies are doing to energy \nproduction in this country and the cost of energy and what that means \nfor middle-income families, what that means for businesses, and what \nthat means for jobs. It is like an all-out assault.\n  The Keystone Pipeline is one example of many of policies where this \nadministration is in a position to do something good for the economy, \nsomething good for jobs, and something good for energy development in \nthis country, lessening the dangerous dependence we have on foreign oil \nsources of energy.\n  I would say to my friend from Kentucky and I would ask him in terms \nof--the Senator doesn't have the direct and indirect benefit we have in \nNorth and South Dakota, but I know he has an awful lot of energy \ndevelopment in his State--what these policies are doing to jobs in a \nState such as Kentucky.\n  I know the Senator hears every day from his constituents about this \nadministration's assault on the industries that are so basic and so \nimportant to our economy, so important to jobs, and providing a better, \nstronger, if you will, future for middle-income families in this \ncountry.\n  I would be curious to know if the Senator from Kentucky shares the \nsame concern about the jobs and economy and cost of energy and \neverything else that I do and that we do in the northern part of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from South Dakota. I think the \nenergy revolution is wonderful and we ought to embrace it. As I was \nsaying earlier, what has happened in my State as a result of the war on \ncoal, 90 percent of our electricity in Kentucky comes from coal-fired \ngeneration. We have been among the top five of the lowest utility rates \nin the country in any given year for as long as anyone can remember.\n  The war on coal is not only a war on coal miners. It is a war on all \nof Kentucky because our utility rates are beginning to go up, which is \ngoing to make the energy less affordable for people on fixed incomes in \nmy State and make us less able to compete for other industries.\n  I repeat. I am thrilled at what is going on in North Dakota and what \nis going on in Texas. We would like to have some of that job growth \nourselves and calling off this Environmental Protection Agency which \nseems to be just hell-bent to take coal out of the equation.\n  It is a heavy price to pay for this ideological crusade which the \nPresident seeks to lead on a worldwide basis and says to the Chinese \nthey don't have to do anything for 16 years while we take away our own \njobs and opportunity.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for one last \nquestion. I see the Senator from Alaska, and I hope she will join us in \nthis discussion.\n\n  To follow up on a very important point made by the Senator from North \nDakota that hadn't been explored a lot, he talked about the \nimplications of more North American energy self-sufficiency and what \nthat might mean in terms of geopolitics.\n  We know, for example, that Vladimir Putin used his energy as a weapon \nin Ukraine and Europe to try to intimidate people and to keep them from \nresisting his invasion of independent republics such as Ukraine.\n  I think it is significant because for so long we have been dependent \non imported energy from the Middle East, which we know has been a real \nchallenge because of the instability there, millennia old conflicts and \nsectarian strife.\n  I would be interested if the Senator from Kentucky or perhaps other \nSenators have observations about what this means in terms of the safety \nand the security of the United States as we become increasingly North \nAmerican energy self-sufficient. We haven't even talked about New \nMexico. They are just now beginning to open their domestic energy \nproduction to the kinds of things we are already seeing in North \nDakota, Texas and Alaska and elsewhere.\n  It promises not only jobs but a great opportunity for us to become a \nsafer\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\nand more stable source of this necessary energy supply.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, obviously what is happening is \nAmerica is on its way to being energy independent in natural gas and \noil. We have the ranking member of the energy committee on the floor as \nwell. I wonder if she had a question.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, and to our leader on the floor and to \nthe colleagues who have come together to talk about this important \nissue for us as a nation from an energy perspective--and we mentioned \nthe jobs and the benefits that flow to our Nation's economy. When we \ntalk about the issue of energy independence, there was a time when \npeople would scoff at the notion that as a nation we would ever have a \nlevel of independence. I guess I look at it and say energy independence \nto me is a place where we are no longer vulnerable for our energy \nsources from those who would wish us ill. What has happened to this \nNation in the past half dozen years has been transformational.\n  We talk about the shale revolution. We talk about a renaissance. What \nthis means to us is that we are truly approaching that point where we \nare more energy secure and from a national security perspective. The \nvulnerability we once had is greatly lessened because of our own \nability to produce our own resources for our people.\n  It is not just within the continental United States. It is Alaska as \nwe point out, but it is North America. We are talking about North \nAmerican energy independence and what that entails and what that means. \nWhen we think about where we have come and the fact that next year we \nwill be producing more oil than Saudi Arabia, who would have thought \nthat the United States would be in this perspective. Who would have \nthought we would have a conversation about energy abundance rather than \nenergy scarcity.\n  It hasn't happened because this oil has just suddenly migrated to \nNorth America. It has always been there. It has been our technology. It \nhas been our ingenuity that allows us to access it. Think what we can \ndo when we partner with our friends and neighbors whether it is Canada \nto the north or Mexico to the south. So when we talk about energy \nindependence and energy security, the Keystone XL Pipeline is kind of \nthat corridor that helps connect us as two nations. The benefits that \nderive to both of us are quite considerable.\n  We are talking about jobs for America and we should be. I think we \nalso need to recognize that when we are talking about the Keystone XL \nPipeline, it is about a trade relationship with our closest neighbor \nand truly our closest ally and the benefits that come to both of us \nbecause of this relationship.\n  There is a phrase that is used. We say the United States and Canada \nare joined at the well--literally joined at the well. This is something \nthe Congressional Research Service actually says.\n  There are currently 19 cross-border oil pipelines that are already \noperating between the United States and Canada or Mexico. This is in \naddition to all of the dozens of natural gas, electric transmission \nlines. These are oil pipelines that are crossing the border with Canada \ninto Montana and into North Dakota, into Michigan, into New York, into \nWashington, into Vermont.\n  One would think this Keystone XL was the first pipeline to ever cross \nthe border from the north to the south. It is some new precedent \nsetting. There were 19 cross-border oil pipelines.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Back in 2009 this administration, this Obama \nadministration, came to a decision about the Alberta Clipper project. \nThis was yet another pipeline from Canada to the United States. There \nwere arguments for and against. But ultimately Clipper was approved \njust as Keystone XL should be approved. So when we are talking about \nplowing new ground here, I think it is important for people to \nrecognize there is no new ground that we are plowing here. This is just \na reticence and a reluctance from an administration to do what I think \npeople across the country believe is the right and the reasonable \nthing, not only from a jobs perspective, from an economic perspective, \nbut from an energy security perspective as well as a relationship with \nour closest friend and ally.\n  I know my colleague from Kentucky had an opportunity to serve with \nour former colleague here, Senator Ted Kennedy. I am not going to ask \nthe Senator whether he recalls the quote, but I think it is important \nto kind of put this in context. We have not as a nation always been \nopposed to importing this crude from Canada. As I mentioned, 19 cross-\nborder agreements are in place today. But back in 1970 the Nixon \nadministration announced they were going to place a quota on Canadian \noil exports. This was when things around the country were getting \ndicey.\n  It was Senator Ted Kennedy who led the fight against this. He said--\nand this is a quote from a Senate hearing back in March of 1970. \nSenator Kennedy said:\n\n       The reason why Canadian oil has never been restricted in \n     the past is obvious. Canadian oil is as militarily and \n     politically secure as our own and thus there can be no \n     national security justification for limiting its importation.\n\n  So not only is this an issue that has been going on for a long time, \nboth sides of the aisle recognize that there is an imperative when you \ncome together with your allies for a resource that we recognize is a \nbenefit to all, creates jobs for all.\n  So I ask my colleague from Kentucky, because he has not only served \nin this body for considerable years, but he has been through these \ndebates over the decades. The question is: Why is this Keystone XL \nPipeline being held out to be such a groundbreaking initiative that \nthis President would put a hold on it for 5 years?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Alaska, I am as \nperplexed by that as she is. The Senator pointed out that having a \ncross-border pipeline is not exactly something new. As our chairman, \nSenator Hoeven, has pointed out repeatedly, it has cleared every \nenvironmental test. We cannot figure out why this has happened other \nthan some misplaced ideological crusade the President wants to lead, \nnot approved by Congress.\n  We all remember what it was like here in 2009 and 2010. Our friends \non the other side had 60 votes. They could do whatever they wanted to. \nThey could not pass cap-and-trade when they owned the place. They \npassed ObamaCare. They passed the stimulus. They passed Dodd-Frank. \nThey couldn't pass cap-and-trade.\n  The President obviously feels so strongly about this, he is willing \nto give the Chinese a 16-year pass, ignore Congress and go full speed \nahead. Part of that ideological rigidity is reflected in the challenge \nour friend from North Dakota has had here for a number of years in \ngetting a decision made, which by any objective standard ought to be a \nno-brainer. My goodness, this is about as close to a no-brainer as you \nwill ever run into.\n  I came out here for the specific purpose of praising the great work \nof the Senator from North Dakota. Without him we would not be where we \nare today on this issue.\n  I wonder if the Senator has any further question or observation to \nmake?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would like to thank the minority \nleader. I would like to thank all the Members of our caucus for joining \non this bipartisan legislation. You know, we are continuing to work \nacross the aisle to get 60 votes. At the end of the day, you have got \nto go back to what this is all about. This is about building an ``all \nof the above'' energy plan for this Nation. You cannot build an ``all \nof the above'' energy plan for the Nation if you do not have the \ninfrastructure to move that energy around the country. We are seeing \nwhat is happening. Because we have been blocked on building these \npipelines, now we are not able to move our grain to market, because \nthere are so many rail cars now trying to move crude oil--700,000 \nbarrels a day out of our State alone, and it is growing.\n  Keystone alone will replace 1,400 rail cars a day that are now \ncarrying oil. That is 10-unit trains. So, you see, this is about so \nmany aspects of our economy, strengthening our economy and creating \ngood-paying jobs that people want. That is why the American people--and \nthat is who we work for, that is who we represent. That is what this is \nabout. That is what we heard loud and clear in the election, is that \nthe American people want us to work together. They want us to get jobs \ngoing,\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\nget this economy going, build the right kind of energy future, get our \nbudget deficit under control.\n  That means we have to do the fundamentals. When we talk about \nbuilding infrastructure, we are talking about the fundamentals. That is \nwhat is going on here. This has been 6 years. We need to get this \neconomy going. That starts with common sense. This is common sense. \nThis is common sense because it is about energy, it is about jobs, it \nis about growing the economy, it is about national security, it is \nabout not having to get oil from the Middle East, and it is about doing \nwhat the American people overwhelmingly time and again have told us \nthey want us to do.\n  Again, I want to thank the minority leader. I will turn to him and \nagain say: You know, I believe we can find a way, either in this \nlameduck or in the next Congress--and I would ask the leader--in the \nnext Congress, and I believe it to be true, as the majority leader, he \nwill make this a priority as part of an energy plan for this country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me wrap it up by thanking again the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his extraordinary leadership on this issue and assure \nthe American people that we will be back. Hopefully it will be approved \nand signed by the President sooner. If not, he will have another \nopportunity later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I most certainly have enjoyed this \ncolloquy and have been down on the floor most of the day. I am \nextremely disappointed I could not get any Member of the other side to \nrecognize me for questions. I see the minority leader leaving the floor \nnow, although he knows I have many questions for him that he does not \nwant to answer. But that is his prerogative. You know, I thought we \ncame here to work together. I am standing here. I have worked with \nSenator Hoeven on this bill. Before Senator Hoeven leaves the floor or \nSenator Barrasso or Senator Murkowski, if they would stay, I would like \nto thank Senator Hoeven for his extraordinary leadership on this bill.\n  Although the other side does not acknowledge any of the leaders over \nhere, such as the Presiding Officer or Senator Manchin or Senator \nBaucus, who is no longer here but was a strong voice for Keystone many \nyears ago, or some of the other Democratic Senators, I want to \npersonally thank Senator Hoeven for his leadership and thank Senator \nMurkowski for her extraordinary leadership on this issue.\n  The Senator has been a real partner to me in the truest sense of the \nword and in the greatest spirit of bipartisanship. Of course, she had \nan experience that not many Senators have. She was defeated by her own \nparty in her own State. They chose someone else and ran against the \nSenator, which is unusual, and did not support her in her reelection, \neven though the Senator and her father have chaired, on and off, the \nenergy committee for years. I have been a strong partner not only with \nLisa, the Senator from Alaska, but with her father Frank.\n  But the Republican Party did not support the Senator in her last \nelection. So the Senator had to sign in on an Independent ticket. I was \none of the first people to call her and say: Go, girl. Let's get it \ndone. She did. So I have the utmost respect for Senator Murkowski. I \nhave the utmost respect for the Senator's father. I have the utmost \nrespect for Ted Stevens. I stood with Ted Stevens until the end, even \nthough my party went against him. I would fight for him to this day if \nhe were here, because some of us actually believe in bipartisanship. \nLots of people around here talk about it, but that is really it.\n  The evidence I am going to give--I am sorry the Senator from Kentucky \nis not here to defend himself. I want the quote he wrote down. He might \ncome back to the floor when he hears what I am going to say. I am going \nto speak for 1 hour.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, who will be the majority leader, has not \nleft his partisanship in Kentucky because you just saw it on display \nhere. He cannot help himself. He cannot speak for 3 minutes without \nmentioning the President. He had his back turned the whole time, would \nnot even acknowledge anyone over here. So he does a lot of talking \nabout bipartisanship. But his statement just yesterday was, ``I am \nconfident Dr. Cassidy will use his position to succeed where Senator \nLandrieu failed.''\n  I do not necessarily think this is failure to get a vote on the \nKeystone Pipeline. I think this is a great victory. I want to share \nthis victory with Senator Hoeven who is a leader. I also want to have \nprinted in the Record--the Senator from Kentucky had a lot to say about \neverybody else not doing their job. I want to say that on at least one \noccasion, he did not do his either. On March 16, there were 15 \nSenators--March 16 of 2011, not 2012. I mean not 2014, not 2013, not \n2012, but 2011. I think that was before the Presiding Officer was here. \nOn March 16, 2011, when Secretary Clinton was still the Secretary of \nState, there were 16 Members of the Senate who signed a letter to her \nasking her to approve the Keystone Pipeline. I am going to read those \nnames because I think it is important. My name is first, amazingly. I \nam very proud of that, didn't even remember it. Mary Landrieu. Orrin \nHatch circulated a letter with me. Max Baucus. Kay Bailey Hutchison, my \ndear friend from Texas. Pat Roberts from Kansas, another dear friend. \nMike Enzi from Wyoming. Lisa Murkowski--of course her name would be on \nhere--from Alaska. Senator John Cornyn from Texas. John Barrasso from \nWyoming. Mark Begich from Alaska who just unfortunately lost his race \nbecause of several reasons, one of which is that people talk a lot \nabout bipartisanship who do not really honor it. Nobody better than \nMark Begich has shown a willingness to work across party lines. He is \nno longer with us, but he signed this letter. Roy Blunt from Missouri. \nJohn Hoeven from North Dakota, and Ron Johnson.\n  But you know a signature that is not on this letter is Mitch \nMcConnell's. Maybe Mitch McConnell was too busy to sign this letter. \nBut his name is not on here. Now am I saying Mitch McConnell has not \nbeen a supporter of the Keystone Pipeline? Absolutely not. Senator \nMcConnell has supported this project. But what I am saying is that \nSenator McConnell has not been truthful with the American people about \nactually how this has always evolved. To support that claim, which is a \nstrong one, on May 7, 2014, Senator Reid offered a vote on the XL \nPipeline. Senator McConnell objected. On May 12, 2014, Senator Reid \noffered a vote on the Keystone Pipeline. Senator McConnell objected. On \nMay 12, I offered a vote on the Keystone Pipeline. Senator Flake \nobjected for Senator McConnell. On June 24, Senator Shaheen offered a \nvote on the XL Pipeline. That, of course, I believe, was connected with \nthe energy efficiency bill with Senator Portman. Senator Inhofe \nobjected. Senator McConnell did nothing to help. Then on June 25, \nSenator Reid offered a vote on the XL Pipeline. Senator McConnell \nobjected.\n  I want to underscore this. I am not saying Senator Reid is a \nsupporter of the pipeline. He has never been. He is not a supporter of \nthe pipeline, but he has asked for a vote on Keystone a number of times \nand Senator McConnell has objected.\n  Senator McConnell will come to the floor and show a list such as this \nwhen he has asked for votes on the Keystone Pipeline and Senator Reid \nhas objected. That is the truth of the Congress. The saddest thing \nabout this is I have believed for over 1 year that if we could actually \nget a vote, we have the 60 votes to pass it.\n  I have said that on any number of occasions. I believe we have the 60 \nvotes to pass Keystone. I believe the coalition of oil and gas and \nenergy and manufacturing companies that are very strong, with the \ncoalition of the strongest labor unions and organizations that \nrepresent working people, and with the vote in this last election, and \nwith the people of the United States--mostly because of the people of \nthe United States asking us to do our jobs, I, on faith, and with \nstrong evidence that I have--but on faith in what is right, what is \ntrue, and what is best--we have the 60 votes on this floor. That is why \nI came to the floor yesterday--on that faith.\n  I said that I believed that it was time to vote on the Keystone \nPipeline now. The most important reason is to show the American people \nthat we are willing to put partisanship aside. I called Senator \nHoeven--the first thing I did.\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\nThe Senator has left the floor because I am not really sure anyone \nwants to debate me on this. But that is OK. I am used to it. I don't \nhave anybody to debate at home in my election because my opponent won't \nshow up. So I am very used to debating all by myself. So they have all \nleft the floor.\n  But when I arrived in Washington, the first thing I did was to call \nSenator Hoeven. I spoke to him because I have done that on any number \nof occasions. I said to him: John, I think this is a very good time, \nand there are several reasons why. I think the politics are cleared up. \nI think the people spoke--cleared up, not meaning me. It is not about \nmy politics, but it is about the politics of some people who lost and \nwon.\n  Some people who were opposing the vote have lost. Some people who \nsupported having the vote are here. I have said it looks to me as if \nthis is a perfect opportunity to do two things--to get done something \nthat you and I have wanted to do now for over 1 year.\n  This letter most certainly suggests that there were a number of us--\nnot many. There were only 15 of us who signed the letter to Secretary \nClinton asking her to push forward on the pipeline. Other people were \neither too busy to sign it or didn't think--whatever--but it is a \nbipartisan letter and it was very good.\n  So I called the Senator, and he said that he didn't think that it \nwould happen until the next Congress.\n  So I said: Well, let's try. Maybe we could get it done. He said that \nhe would talk to his leadership, and that was the last conversation I \nhave had with him.\n  I came down to the floor yesterday just thinking: Well, maybe I will \njust kick it up a little bit, and sure enough, I did. It got kicked up \npretty high. I was actually here around 2 o'clock because I have been \naround here enough to know that if you show up early you actually might \nget something done. Don't show up late; don't be late. My dad taught me \nto be on time, so I was here at 2 o'clock.\n  I was very interested to see what Majority Leader Reid would say and \nMinority Leader McConnell would say, and the Senator from Texas, who is \nusually always with the Senator from Kentucky, what they would say \nabout what we should do.\n  I sat here fully expecting the minority leader from Kentucky--soon to \nbe the majority leader--to say OK, the people have spoken; let's get on \nwith a bill that is very important. Everyone in the country--not \neveryone, but many people--many people in this country, in all regions, \nsupport the Keystone Pipeline--not everyone. There are strong feelings \nagainst it, but every poll I have seen shows people from many different \nareas of the country, many different political persuasions. This is not \nas if only Democrats are against it and only Republicans are for it. \nThere are many Democrats in my State that have supported it--poor \npeople, rich people, black people, white people--Democrats who support \nthe Keystone Pipeline. I am certain that is true in the State of the \nPresiding Officer, North Dakota. I am sure that it is not even a party \nissue in the State of North Dakota. This is just a commonsense issue to \nget the Keystone Pipeline bill.\n  At approximately 2:15 yesterday I sat on the floor, ready to go. I \nhad called my leader and John Hoeven. His name is first on this bill. I \ncould have asked for my name to be first on the bill because I actually \nchair the committee, but I was trying to be bipartisan, gracious, and a \nteam member. It hasn't gotten me very far, but I just used it as an \nexample.\n  I said: John, this means the world to you, although it means the \nworld to me, put your name first. So it is called the Hoeven-Landrieu \nbill. I called him since it is his bill and asked him what he thought. \nHe said he thought we could do it in the next Congress. I said, I \nactually think we can do it now. He said he didn't think so. So I just \ncame to the floor.\n  I waited for Mitch McConnell to say something. This is what he said:\n\n       Mr. President, last week the American people sent a strong \n     message to Washington. They voted for a new direction. They \n     called for a change in the way we do things in the Senate, \n     and they sent a new team to Washington to carry their wishes \n     forward, and we plan to do just that.\n       But several items remain for the outgoing Congress to \n     consider and that is our immediate focus.\n\n  So I am sitting in my chair thinking OK, here we go. I am ready. I \nhave been ready since we started, but definitely my staff can't find \nanything before that which I can show for any evidence, other than this \nletter. So I can just say I think I was for it since I heard about it. \nBut since I can't prove it, let's go back to March 16, 2011, because my \nsignature is the lead on this letter. So that is some indication that I \nhave been leading at least since then.\n  I get a tremendous amount of credit, of course, from my own caucus \nbecause they understand that even though most of my caucus doesn't \nagree with me and thinks I have been--and I have really pushed them on \nthis issue and will continue to, because that is what good Senators do. \nWe don't represent our caucuses. We represent our States, and we fight \nhard for what we believe is right. I have, for the longest time, felt \nthis was the right thing to do. So that was that letter.\n  I was sitting and thinking: Here we go. But this is what the minority \nleader went on to say:\n\n       In the weeks that remain in this Congress, we should work \n     to accomplish the essential task [not of building the \n     Keystone Pipeline] of funding the Congress and preventing \n     retroactive tax increases.\n\n  I thought he could say the essential task of funding Congress--which \nI will put first, although a lot of people don't think we should fund \nourselves because we are not doing a very good job--but I will give him \nthat.\n  The second I would put--and let's show the people that we mean \nbusiness by passing a bipartisan bill, the Keystone Pipeline, and \nmoving it to the President's desk. But he said:\n\n       . . . preventing retroactive tax increases. We must address \n     the expiring authority passed earlier this session for the \n     Department of Defense to train and equip a moderate, vetted \n     Syrian opposition [I agree that is very important] and we \n     must continue to support the efforts to address the Ebola \n     crisis [equally important].\n\n  But then something interesting happened. They brought to the floor a \nchildhood bill--the majority and minority together. The leadership \nbrought a bill that has bipartisan support--but so does Keystone. But \nthe majority leader and the minority leader didn't think Keystone could \nget votes or couldn't pass or maybe they didn't want to pass it.\n  But as long as I am a Senator--I hope to be for many years to come--I \nam going to continue to fight for what is right and do it in as \ngracious a manner as possible to give credit where credit is due, to \nhonor the Members on the other side and on my side who work very hard \nand just don't talk about bipartisanship but actually work at it every \nday.\n  I am sorry that it doesn't seem possible for the minority leader--\nsoon to be majority leader--to do that. When he finished speaking, I \njust sat here because I can't get leader time because I am not the \nleader of the caucus. Then I thought well, maybe Senator Cornyn will \nsay something.\n  Senator Cornyn spoke at approximately 2:30, the record says. He spoke \nlonger than the majority leader. He also talked about dysfunction, but \nhe never called for a Keystone vote either. So I thought that was \nstrange.\n  He said: ``We will pass a budget next year--something our friends \nacross the aisle have failed to do . . . ''\n  He said: ``I know Republicans and Democrats will continue to have \npolicy disagreements.''\n  He also said:\n\n       So last week's election will not change some of the \n     fundamental policy differences we have between political \n     parties on ObamaCare, on what we need to do to preserve and \n     protect Social Security and Medicare and the like . . . but \n     it will give us a chance to make some steady incremental \n     progress on issues where we do agree.\n\n  He talked about Ted Kennedy, the lion of the Senate. He talked about \nMike Enzi and how Mike Enzi, who is a wonderful Senator--someone I have \nworked with very closely--said: Let's work on the 80-20 rule.\n  He said: What is that? He said: Let's work on the 80 percent that we \ncan agree on and the 20 percent we cannot.\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       That strikes me as eminently practical and a way for us to \n     begin to get back to work again.\n       When I talk about the easy stuff we can do, I am referring \n     to the bipartisan majority\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\n     that supports things such as the Keystone XL Pipeline \n     authorization . . .\n\n  I want to repeat that:\n\n       When I talk about the easy stuff we can do, I am referring \n     to the bipartisan majority that supports things such as the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline authorization . . .\n\n  So I thought he would call for us to see what we could do in this \nlame duck. We are going to vote on an early childhood education bill. \nMost certainly we would have the time to vote on a jobs bill.\n  Now I believe early childhood education in the long term is the best \njobs bill we can do. I have said that over and over, and my life has \nbeen committed to early childhood education, good schools, excellence \nin education, and accountability. I am not saying this to diminish the \nbill the Senate is poised to pass, which is for early childhood \neducation. But if we started today with 2 year olds, it will literally \ntake us 20 years until they are 22, and the American people want jobs \nyesterday. They want jobs now. They don't want jobs in 22 years.\n  So I was hoping the majority would see that there is a clear path for \nthe Keystone Pipeline to pass--a clear path. You can see it. You don't \nneed a magnifying glass. You just need a brain in your head, an \nunderstanding of what happened in the election, and the votes that are \nhere. It is--yes, what happened in the election, not only that the \nAmerican people spoke, but that some Members who were opposed to it and \nwho didn't want to vote have lost their elections.\n  The votes are here to pass this bill. It was clear to me; I thought \nit should be clear to the majority leader. So people are going to have \nto go ask the majority leader. He left the floor, and he will not \nanswer this question, but I am going to continue to ask it until I get \nan answer from him because I think the people of the United States \ndeserve it. Why didn't he? He has been talking about it incessantly \nevery day, not only beating up on Democrats, even though about 15 of \nus--maybe more--will vote for it, but he has been beating up on the \nPresident incessantly, every day. And when he had the microphone, when \nhe had the chance, when he was elected overwhelmingly in his State, he \nwalked to the floor and didn't say a word about the Keystone Pipeline. \nNot a word. He didn't even refer to it.\n  Then the Senator from Texas, who I thought, well--because they do \ntheir scripts together, they coordinate them very well. I thought maybe \nthe Senator from Texas was going to give the signal. The Senator from \nTexas didn't give the signal, either.\n  So as all Senators here who are elected have the right to stand up at \ntheir desk and ask for recognition--it is about as simple as that. I \ndidn't even have a script. I was just sort of thinking that they were \ngoing to do it. That is why I was here, because I thought at least I \nwould like to say I agree with it, and I am prepared to do what I have \ndone to rally our side to get the votes.\n  So neither one of them said anything. And we can read it for \nourselves. It is very clear. The Senator from Texas said we should do \neasy stuff like the Keystone Pipeline. We will do that. Next time we \nwill work on workforce training. He said: No. 4, we can work on \ninfrastructure; No. 5, he said we should discourage abusive, costly \nlitigation; No. 6, we are going to repeal ObamaCare, particularly \nrestore the 40-hour workweek; repeal the medical device tax; and No. 8, \nwe are going to abolish the Independent Payment Advisory Board under \nMedicare. Each of these things I have mentioned has bipartisan support. \nIf we can pass these measures, we will send them to the President for \nhis signature. So starting with the easy stuff we have already \nidentified that has bipartisan support.\n  Well, I lead the bipartisan effort on the Democratic side, and I am \nproud to say that I lead it with the Senator from North Dakota who is \npresiding, who has been an equally ferocious and sometimes more \neffective, I will admit, champion than I have been, and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, who has also been an absolute bulldog on the issue.\n  There are other Senators. Max Baucus was a strong supporter of \nKeystone. Senator Tester. Is it impossible for Republicans to utter the \nwords? Senator Tester. Senator Heitkamp. They don't have to say my \nname. I am clear about why they are not doing that, but they could at \nleast be gracious enough to recognize the leadership of the other \nSenators here who have worked hard.\n  When we start this next Congress--and I am going to do everything I \ncan to be a part of it--I really hope the reporters in this Chamber and \npeople who are following this will start reporting what really happens \nhere instead of what happens at press conferences, instead of what \npeople say in press releases, instead of what people say when they buy \nstaged television ads. If the reporters would actually just report what \nhappened, I think that would be a good start.\n  Sometimes they are going to say: This is what Senator Landrieu did, \nand I disagree with her. This is what Mitch McConnell did, and I \ndisagree with him. But at least they would report what actually \nhappens.\n  So when they finished speaking, I stood up and said I think the votes \nare there. I have reason to believe they are. I worked for a couple of \ndays last week just calling around because I am the chair of the \ncommittee, and my job is to pass legislation. I passed some significant \npieces of legislation even before I was the chair of the energy \ncommittee, although you would not believe that listening to some \npeople. We passed the RESTORE Act. I led the pushback against Biggert-\nWaters, although I didn't put my name on it because I knew if I did, it \nwould never pass because they wouldn't have allowed it under any \ncircumstance. So Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson were gracious to \nstep up, and they led the effort, and I just kind of organized behind \nthe scenes--it is clear that happened--and we passed it. I am grateful \nto this day that I didn't put my name as the lead because they never \nwould have passed it in an election year, and we would have had 5 \nmillion people in this country literally turning their homes back to \nthe banks or telling their children: The home that I built and that we \nbuilt together that has $300,000 or $400,000 of equity--I am just \ntelling you we are bankrupt.\n\n  I am so glad that didn't happen. I am thrilled.\n  So we did that bill. We did the RESTORE Act. I passed early in my \ncareer a revenue-sharing bill that is going to serve the State of \nLouisiana and the gulf coast beautifully for years to come.\n  Harry Truman offered us a portion of offshore oil and gas revenues \neven before I was born. When I got through college and read about it, I \nthought: Geez, that was a good idea. I liked Harry Truman's idea, and \nso I filed a bill and passed it as a junior member of the committee--I \nremind people, over the objection of my own chairman, who was a \nDemocrat at the time, the Senator from New Mexico, Jeff Bingaman, who \nwas adamantly opposed, adamantly fought every day, not just voted \nagainst me but lobbied against me, fought against me, spoke against \nit--not me personally but the bill. He just didn't believe in it--not \nme personally but the bill. I passed it over his objection, which is a \nvery hard thing, for a junior member of the committee to pass it over \nthe objection of their own chairman. But the reason I did it is because \nI figured out the votes, and we drafted it in a way that could secure \nthe votes and passed it. That is the truth.\n  So I am happy tonight. I am not sad. I am happy tonight that the \nHouse of Representatives is again--because this is like the third time \nthis has happened in my career. It is a great honor for a House that I \nhaven't spent 2 minutes on the floor of--I mean, I know my delegation, \nbut I haven't spent any time in the House. I wasn't even a Member of \nthe House. This is the third time in my career that the House of \nRepresentatives has actually taken a Hoeven-Landrieu, Landrieu-Hoeven \nbill, stripped their bill--and I didn't even ask them to do it--and put \nmy bill over there and passed it, and then they are going to move it \nover here. I could not be happier because we need to get the Keystone \nPipeline done. They did sort of the same thing with revenue sharing, \nthe RESTORE Act--well, four times--and the Biggert-Waters bill.\n  So I could not be happier that I was here at 2:00, that I listened to \nmy father, who is listening now--he should be happy to say: Show up on \ntime. You might not ever figure out what could happen if you aren't \nthere on time.\n  So I was, thinking absolutely they wouldn't put the early childhood \nvote\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\non the floor, they would put Keystone on the floor because they talked \nabout it every single day--every single day in my State, in Alaska, in \nNorth Carolina, in Georgia, and in Kentucky. Every single day.\n  What was wrong with yesterday? What was wrong with yesterday? It was \na good day. I am going to let that question sit because there are a lot \nof people around here who know the answer; I don't have to tell it to \nthem. What was wrong with Tuesday? So when they didn't mention it, I \nthought that I would because, as is the truth, I have been leading it \nsince 2011. I am not going to stop until we get a vote on the Senate \nfloor, for as long as I am here as chair, as ranking member--which I \nwill be, and not as happy as being chair but thrilled to be able to \nwork with the Senator from Alaska. If I had to pick one person in this \nbody on that side of the aisle to work with, it would be Lisa Murkowski \nwithout a doubt, not only because she is a woman but because she is an \nindependent woman. She is strong. And since I was raised by one, I \ncotton to them.\n  So I am a happy camper. It does not bother me because, as I have \nsaid, I have now worked here long enough to have worked in the majority \nand in the minority. I have worked with Republicans. I have worked with \nDemocrats. I have worked with three Presidents of different parties and \nsix Governors. Why would I be sad? This is kind of like somebody said \nto me: This is the gig you signed up for. Yes, it is. It is strange to \nmany people, and I don't blame our constituents for getting aggravated, \nbut it is a gig I signed up for because my dad signed up for it, my \nbrother signed up for it, and my sister signed up for it because it is \nwhat we do, and we do it well. And every single member of my family--\nand my husband signed up for it, and his mother signed up for it. I \nthink it is worth signing up for, is why I am here.\n  Other people can have their opinions about the people who are here. I \nthink they are some of the best people in the world. Maybe the \ninstitution is dysfunctional--it is. It is dysfunctional at this \nmoment, but the people are not. The individual people who are here on \nboth sides are not dysfunctional individuals; they are some of the most \nextraordinary people on this planet. I know I am going to get \ncriticized for that statement because people will say: There she goes, \njust talking about politicians. But I have served long enough to know \nthere are really some extraordinary human beings who serve in this \nSenate--smart, capable, caring--on both sides of the aisle, and I am \nproud to be a part of it.\n  I was not proud of the minority leader from Kentucky on Tuesday. I \nwas not proud of him today. I was not proud of the Senator from Texas \ntoday. I was very disappointed in the Senator from North Dakota. But \nthey are my friends. We will get through it, and we will work forward \ntogether.\n  I am glad the House is debating and voting. I look forward to being \nback here on next Tuesday, where our vote will occur, and I am very \nhopeful we will have and I believe we will have not 60 but probably 61 \nvotes for the Keystone Pipeline. What the President does is a different \nmatter, and I would like to challenge the Senators on Tuesday to just \nfocus on the Senate.\n  Let the Senate's will work. Let us pass this bill. We will then send \nit to the President, and under the Constitution--which is read to us on \na frequent basis--the President has the right to sign it or to veto it. \nIf he vetoes it, it is going to take 67 votes to override his veto. \nMine will be one of them if he vetoes this bill. If I am here, my vote \nwill be there to override his veto. I don't believe there are 67 other \nvotes in the Senate to do that. There might be. I don't know what \nmindset people will have, but let's cross that bridge when we get \nthere.\n  Stop talking about the White House and talk about the Senate. If the \nSenate can function, then maybe the House will do a little bit better, \nmaybe the White House will do a little bit better. My mother taught me \nif you want to criticize others, start with yourself first. Get \nyourself straight before you start criticizing everybody else. All I \nhear around here is what this one didn't do and what that one didn't do \nand what the President didn't do. Let us work as a Senate. Let us show \nthe American people how the Senate works.\n  The House is going to do their job on Keystone. We are going to do \nour job on Keystone, and that will break the gridlock, which we \ndesperately need on a significant--not an easy bill, not an easy bill--\nbut easier, such as early childhood education. Who could be opposed to \nthat? But let's break the gridlock on a tough bill that is hard on our \nMembers to vote on. There are Members here who think it is the worst \nthing in the world. I understand that. I think there are things that \nhave passed here that I thought were the worst things in the world and \nI didn't like them, but voting is important. Senator Durbin has said \nthis and others have said this over and over again; Senator Leahy, who \nhas been here a long time. Let us vote and let us stop criticizing \neveryone else, and do our job, and I am proud that I helped to get us \nmoving in that direction.\n  I am going to ask--Senator Carper is seeking to speak on another \nmatter. I understand my hour of postcloture is about to expire. I don't \nneed any additional time. I note that Senator Carper is here, but \nbefore that, Senator Heitkamp, I would respectfully say to the Chair, I \nthink may have some comments she would like to make, and I yield the \nfloor, but if Senator Heitkamp could go now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). For the information of the \nSenate, cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank my very good \nfriend Mary Landrieu for everything she has done for our country, for \nher State, for her tenacity, and for her willingness to shepherd this \nthrough at a very critical time.\n  We talked yesterday on the floor about how important it is to send \nthe right messages to the American public. A lot of people will say, \nwell, they pick this agenda or this agenda. They just want us to start \nworking together. And they want us to turn on the television and watch \nC-SPAN and say, there they are in the sandbox again, fighting about \nthings that don't matter to the American public. You know, picking \nfights with each other, bad-mouthing each other, as opposed to working \ntogether.\n  It is a little tough right now, because I think that if we are going \nto set the tone today, yesterday, today and in the days that follow \nduring this lameduck, the tone that will establish the relationships \nand the courtesies we are going to have going forward in the next \nCongress, we need to make sure we are communicating when the tone goes \na little wrong.\n  To me, I have fought this issue. I have been in favor of the Keystone \nPipeline ever since I looked, and I somewhat famously likened it to \ncaring about a reality TV show that has nothing to do with people's \nlives, and wondering why we care so much about Keystone, because it \ndoesn't have a whole lot to do with carbon. It doesn't. Keystone \nPipeline is about transportation of oil. That oil is going to get \ntransported, it is going to get produced, and it is going to move. It \nis going to move on rail or it is going to move on pipe someplace. When \nyou look at all the studies that have been done, the environmental \nstudies, you turn it around 100 different ways, you come to the same \nconclusion, that the Keystone Pipeline makes an incredible amount of \nsense.\n  It is a job-ready project, shovel-ready project, with good trade \nunion jobs. That is something you don't see every day in America. New \nthings coming--it will help us transport 100,000 barrels of oil. That \nis less than 10 percent of what we produce every day but it will take, \nas my senior Senator said, a lot of unit trains off the rails so we can \nmove grain, and it will be state of the art in terms of the quality of \nthe pipeline. I have seen the pipeline. I have seen the oil sands. I \nhave been there. We are headed for North American energy independence \nif we don't get in our own way.\n\n  Keystone has taken a role larger than life, and it has been this hot \nbutton issue that doesn't belong in this debate. It should have been \napproved, in my opinion, years ago, absolutely years ago. It has taken \nus longer to analyze Keystone than what it has taken us to beat \nHitler--by far, almost 50 percent more time spent analyzing the \nKeystone Pipeline.\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\n  The people of the United States are tired of this issue. They are \ntired of our gridlock, and they are tired of the partisan bickering \nback and forth. So I would ask as a way to move forward on a lot of \nvery difficult energy issues that we are going to have here, whether it \nis what I believe, we need to begin to lower the barriers and eliminate \nthe barriers for exportation of crude oil. It has been something I have \ntalked about a lot. I believe we need to export and to facilitate the \nexportation of natural gas. I believe we need to do everything we can \nto continue to develop our renewables. I believe we should have a \nrenewable fuel standard that encourages--encourages--the development of \nrenewable fuels. I believe a lot of things on energy, and we frequently \nhear in this body we are all of the above and people start talking and \nyou know they are not. They are not all of the above. They are \npolarizing this issue.\n  At the heart of it, as I said yesterday, one of the reasons why the \nUnited States of America has not experienced an economic downturn or \nthe slowdown that you see globally is because of this energy \nrenaissance. This is what the American public has sent us to do, to set \npublic policy, but more importantly, to get out of the way of private \ninvention and entrepreneurship.\n  So I would respectfully, very respectfully, ask that when our \ncolleagues from the other side come to the floor, think about how we \ncan use language that brings us together, that doesn't tell the \nAmerican public, there they go again. You know, here we are again in \nthe sandbox trying to figure out who gets credit. You know what, when \nthis place works, we will all get credit. And more importantly, when \nthis place works, the American public will have their faith in their \ngovernment restored.\n  So let's be very careful with language. Let's recognize everyone for \nthe commitment they have made, and for the leadership they provided. \nAnd I have said many times in my home State, Senator Hoeven has led \nthis effort. He talks about it. He has been a champion for the Keystone \nPipeline. I hope I have been a champion. But I certainly have not done \nthe time that he has done on this issue. Senator Hoeven deserves an \nincredible amount of credit; but equally, Mary Landrieu deserves an \nincredible amount of credit for moving this issue right at this point \nof time and moving this issue forward. We who are working on this side \nto gather the number of votes that we know we are going to need to pass \nthis--that is not easy work. Trust me, that is not easy work, but we \nare making tremendous progress. We are making tremendous progress.\n  Now what happens next week? We hope we pass it. And we will cross the \nbridge of a Presidential veto when we come to it and if we come to it. \nBut let's not presuppose what people are going to do and let's not \nstand here at a time when the American public wants to see us all come \ntogether, let's not stand here and worry about who gets credit. Let's \nnot stand here and call out people for what you consider past wrongs. \nLet's move forward on behalf of the American people.\n  I wanted to personally say thank you, Senator Landrieu, for your \nleadership, for your tenacity. And if I could add one point, and I will \nsay this because I was with you every step of the way on flood \ninsurance. Flood insurance would not have happened without Mary \nLandrieu. We had great support on the other side, great bipartisan \neffort, but she sounded the alarm before anyone knew we were going to \nhave this problem and had already built that groundwork.\n  You know, I am sure there are a lot of things her opponents and her \ndetractors can say about the positions she has taken over the years. Be \nhonest about it. She has been a leader on Keystone. She has been a \nleader on oil and gas. She has been a leader on flood insurance. She \nhas been a tenacious voice for all of those issues. And she has in her \nheart the best interests not just of the people in this country, but \nparticularly the great people of the great State of Louisiana. So, \nthank you, Mary, for everything you do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I did not come to the floor to praise \nSenator Landrieu, but while I am at it, I would like to say a few \nwords.\n  I have the privilege of chairing the committee on governmental \naffairs. Senator Landrieu chairs the appropriations subcommittee that \ndeals with Homeland Security. She is also a member of the authorizing \ncommittee. So she works both vineyards. She is as tenacious and \ntireless in her defense of our country against cyber attacks, against \nterrorist attacks, against all kinds of ills that would otherwise be \nvisited on our country. She still finds time as chairman of the energy \ncommittee to focus not only on issues that are important to her State--\nand this is one of them--but also issues that are incredibly important \nto our country.\n  I said to my wife the other night--we were talking about Senator \nLandrieu and her tenacity. That word has been used tonight a couple \ntimes about her, as an unrelenting advocate for her State and the \ncauses she believes in. Others have mentioned that she is a tireless \nadvocate not only for Louisiana but for the causes that she sees that \nare just.\n  There is no quit in this one, as I said to my wife this week. She \nsaid, ``How is Mary?'' I would never want to run against this woman, \nand fortunately I would never have to. And for those who have to, good \nluck and God bless. But I am proud to be here with Mary, and with \nSenator Heidi Heitkamp as well.\n  The reason I come here tonight is to discuss a number of nominations \nthat have been considered and approved by the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee that both Senator Landrieu and Senator \nHeitkamp and I serve on. Senator Coburn, our colleague from Oklahoma, \nis the ranking Republican on that committee, and we have worked \ntirelessly ourselves for the better part of the last 2 years to try to \nmake sure there is a full complement of leadership in the Department of \nHomeland Security to provide the leadership for one of the most \nimportant agencies in our government. I have spoken with people on this \nfloor and wherever else I could find a venue about the large and very \ntroubling backlog of nominations in this Senate. I call it executive \nbranch Swiss cheese. Executive branch Swiss cheese.\n  There are a couple of ways you can cripple an administration. No. 1, \nyou can refuse to provide appropriations and funding. Another way to \ncripple an administration is to not approve the nominations of people \nwho fill key leadership positions. The most important ingredient I \nfound in any organization--I don't care if it is a legislative body \nsuch as this, a State such as Minnesota or Delaware or Louisiana or \nNorth Dakota--I don't care if it is a college or a business, a church. \nThe most critical factor in all of those is leadership.\n  When we deny a President or a Governor or a mayor, for that matter, \nthe ability to put his or her leadership team together--even when they \nare nominating well-qualified, competent people, people of integrity--\nwe do not do just a disservice to that person who has been nominated \nand has gone through the process, but to the State or the county or the \ncountry in which they have been nominated to serve.\n  I think it is every Senator's constitutional role to provide advice \nand consent on the President's nominations in a thorough and timely \nmanner as part of the Senate confirmation process. I have exercised \nthat constitutional role and our right and our obligation. I think we \ndo our country no service and do ourselves no honor when we leave \ncritical agencies--and Homeland Security is certainly one of those--\nwithout proper leadership and leave honorable men and women who are \nwilling to serve in the government twisting in the wind.\n  I am a big believer in the Golden Rule, as our Presiding Officer \nknows: treat other people the way we want to be treated. How would we \nlike it if we were nominated, and we have a job--maybe it is an \nimportant job, maybe it is a job that pays a lot more than what they \nhave been nominated to do in service to our country. All too often \npeople are asked to put their lives and their family on hold. They \ndon't know if they are going to be uprooted from wherever they are in \nthe country to come here and live or for their spouse or father or \nmother to work. It is not fair.\n  In some cases, it is just to put people before committees and berate \nthem\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\npublicly for sins of omission or commission that may be fabricated. No \nwonder it is hard to get good people to serve.\n  In this case, I have several people that I will talk about tonight. \nThese people deserve not just our consideration but our strong support.\n  During my 2 years as chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I have made it one of my top priorities \nto work closely with our ranking Republican, Dr. Tom Coburn, who is a \nphysician and also a Senator, and to vet the President's nominees that \nwe have jurisdiction over and move them in a timely manner when they \nmeet muster, scrub them good, make sure we have drilled down on what \nthey believe in, their credentials and competency for serving, and when \nthey do pass muster, try to move them along and bring them through our \ncommittee--almost every time--with a bipartisan vote and then bring the \nnomination to the floor.\n  Tom Coburn and I try to do that religiously with respect to our \nnominees. We try to do the same kind of bipartisan approach with our \nlegislation. We have had a lot of success and we are grateful to our \ncolleagues for supporting what we have done in our committee. We are \ngrateful to Majority Leader Reid and Senator McConnell and their \nstaffs. They have been valuable partners in this effort. Gary Myrick, \nwho works on the floor for the Democratic side, and Laura Dove, who \nworks on the Republican side for Senator McConnell, have been terrific \nto work with, and we thank them for their stewardship.\n  Just yesterday our committee reported out three more outstanding \nnominees, one of them, Sarah Saldana, to be head of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security. It is a big \njob, it is an important job, and it is a tough job. Russell Deyo has \nbeen nominated to be the top management official at the Department of \nHomeland Security. Mickey Barnett has been nominated by the President \nto serve another term on the Postal Services Board of Governors.\n  I believe Ms. Saldana and Mr. Deyo will almost certainly be confirmed \nin short order. I urge my colleagues to review their qualifications and \nwork with Dr. Coburn and me to fill these two vacancies at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the coming days.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes of my time tonight discussing the \nnomination of Mickey Barnett, who is already serving on the Postal \nBoard of Governors. He is a Republican and nominated again by the \nPresident. I will then talk about a couple of lower profile nominees \nthat I think we urgently need to confirm as quickly as we can--\ncertainly this year during this lameduck session.\n  Mickey Barnett is among a group of five partisan nominees to the \nPostal Board of Governors. His nomination was submitted by a Democratic \nPresident. Two of the nominees are Republicans, and Mickey is one of \nthose, and three of them are Democrats.\n  If we don't confirm Mr. Barnett and his colleagues by December 8--a \nlittle more than 4 weeks from now--Mr. Barnett, who is currently the \nBoard's chair, will be forced to leave the Board. If that happens, the \nPostal Board of Governors will no longer have enough members to achieve \na quorum and will not be able to conduct business.\n  At a time when the Postal Service is struggling to address a number \nof financial challenges and adapt to the digital age and the Internet \nworld we live in, being unable to conduct business would not be good \nfor the Postal Service. In fact, it would be very bad. We need to avoid \nthat from happening. I think if it does happen, we will be inviting a \ndisaster.\n\n  Today, because of our inability in Congress to come to a consensus on \npostal reform legislation--and they are actually creeping closer--the \ngood work by Dr. Coburn and a number of other people to actually \ndevelop a bipartisan consensus around the legislation that was reported \nout of our committee--I believe in a 9-to-1 vote earlier this year--the \nPostal Service will continue to twist in the wind, able to only do so \nmuch to address the financial challenges they face and to transfer \nthemselves in a digital age. They need to figure out how to make \nthemselves relevant--a 200-some-year-old establishment--in delivering \nthat work that goes to every business and every residence in this \ncountry, for the most part, 6 days a week.\n  How do we enable the Postal Service to make money? They are figuring \nit out, and we can help them with our legislation.\n  Meanwhile, the customers of the Postal Service are left with \nuncertainty about what the future holds for the Postal Service. Are \nthey going to be around? Are they going to be able to do the job? Are \nthey ever going to modernize their fleet? Are they ever going to \nmodernize their processing centers and the post offices themselves? We \ncan answer that question and enable them to be financially viable once \nagain. We would make that uncertainty that surrounds the Postal Service \neven worse if December 8 comes and goes and our five Postal Board \nnominees are still waiting for us to act.\n  The same goes for our nominees to fill vacancies, not on the Postal \nBoard of Governors, but on something called the Postal Regulatory \nCommission. It is a five-member commission. It is the regulator, if you \nwill, for the Postal Service. The two people who have been nominated by \nthis President are Nanci Langley and Tony Hammond. They have been \nwaiting since the spring of 2013 to be confirmed. As a result, the \ncommission has been working with only three commissioners out of five. \nWe need to do something about that as well, and waiting for another \nyear--waiting for another month is foolhardy.\n  These people deserve a vote. We ought to vote them up or down. They \nhave been unanimously approved and confirmed by our committee, and I \nthink they need a vote. When they get a vote, I am sure they will be \nconfirmed.\n  Also pending before the Senate are two nominations to the District of \nColumbia Superior Court, Judge William Nooter and Judge Steven Wellner. \nThey are both well-qualified nominees who, like the Homeland Security \nand Postal nominees I have discussed, won bipartisan support in the \ncommittee and are needed to fill vacancies on the District of \nColumbia's very busy trial court.\n  Judge Nooter and Judge Wellner were reported out of our committee \nwith unanimous bipartisan support months ago. In Judge Nooter's case, \nit was more than a year ago.\n  As I have discussed, these men are not alone in waiting so long for \nconfirmation, but the problem is particularly unfair when it comes to \nthe District of Columbia's court system. Earlier this fall during the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Hearing on DC \nstatehood, the current vacancies on the DC Superior Court were included \nas just one of many injustices the District faces simply because it \nserves our Nation's capital.\n  The District of Columbia already suffers from not having control over \nits laws or even its own local dollars. The citizens of this city \nshould not have to face a compromised legal system as well. While we in \nCongress may not be able to fix everything, I do think this is one of \nthe few issues we can and must address now.\n  The DC Circuit Court is a local court. It hears primarily local \nmatters. Most nominees are entirely uncontroversial and used to go \nthrough the Senate without a recorded floor vote. But because these \nlocal judges go through Senate confirmation, they have been caught up \nin a broader political stalemate of the Senate floor. I hope that is \ngoing to come to an end.\n  Meanwhile, no other local or State jurisdiction must have its non-\nFederal judges approved by the Congress. If we are talking about \nFederal District judges or Circuit Court of Appeal judges or Supreme \nCourt Justices, of course they should come through and be debated and \napproved here. These are local judges, and it is only by a quirk in the \nlaw that they have to come here for a confirmation at all. They are \nlocal judges in the District of Columbia.\n  How would we like it if we had been nominated and held up for over a \nyear--particularly in courts where there are huge backlogs. We are \ntalking about caseloads of tens of thousands of people, and they don't \nhave a full complement of judges because of us. How fair is that? Well, \nit is not.\n  No other local or State jurisdiction must have its non-Federal judges \napproved by Congress, and no other State\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\nor locality is without a vote in the Senate to help push for action on \nnominations of concern to that community.\n  The DC Superior Court is operated by the Federal Government and its \njudges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for \n15-year terms. It is important to note that although this court is \noperated by the Federal Government, it is separate from the Federal \nGovernment. Instead, the Superior Court is the local trial court for \nthe District of Columbia. It handles matters such as local crime and \ndomestic and civil disputes.\n  Nevertheless, because this court is operated by the Federal \nGovernment, the President nominates candidates for judicial vacancies \nfrom a slate prepared by a nonpartisan nomination commission and the \nSenate must confirm the nominees.\n  Currently, there are four vacancies on the Superior Court. Due to \nplanned retirement and medical leave, this number will rise by the end \nof the year, and it is going to get worse. These vacancies hinder the \nSuperior Court's ability to administer justice for DC residents. The \nSuperior Court judges already carry, as I said earlier, enormous \ncaseloads. The existing vacancies--the majority of which are in the \nfamily court division--threaten to undermine the judge's ability to \ngive proper attention to each case, including those cases in family \ncourts that affect the welfare of families, and particularly the \nwelfare of children.\n  Recently the chief judge of the Superior Court and the Bar \nAssociation in the District of Columbia sent to both Senate leaders and \nDr. Coburn and myself a letter raising these concerns and ultimately \nseeking a Senate vote on Judges Nooter and Wellner. They are preaching \nto the choir.\n  Judge Nooter is currently the presiding magistrate judge on the \nSuperior Court and has served as a magistrate judge for the past 14 \nyears. As presiding magistrate judge, he manages 23 fellow magistrate \njudges and serves on the leadership team of the chief judge of the \nSuperior Court.\n  Meanwhile, Judge Wellner currently serves as an administrative law \njudge for the District of Columbia Office of Administrative Hearings. \nSince 2011, he has led the unemployment insurance division, and by all \naccounts skillfully coordinates a team of 10 administrative law judges \nand support staff to adjudicate over 3,000 unemployment insurance cases \nper year.\n  Given the caliber of these nominees, the lack of controversy over \ntheir nomination, and the unanimous bipartisan support they have \nreceived from the committee of jurisdiction, I urge--and I am sure I \nurge with the full support of Dr. Coburn, our ranking Republican member \nof the committee--this body to move their confirmations forward as soon \nas possible. Justice delayed is still justice denied. It has been that \nway for centuries and these delays are insufferable.\n  I will close by saying that what we are doing is not just bad \njudgment, it is not just bad form, I think it is shameful, and we need \nto fix it.\n  With that, I am finished, and I am looking around to see if there is \nanybody else seeking recognition. I don't see anyone, so with that, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, after the election, I have heard a number \nof my colleagues in the House of Representatives and in the Senate say \nthey are going to come to the floor of the Senate and to the floor of \nthe House and again try to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  I said last night on the floor that it strikes me that during an \nelection I would think Members of Congress would hear from their \nconstituents, whether it is in Minnesota or Ohio--the Presiding \nOfficer's State or mine, or around the country--and once we start \ntalking to real people--not campaign rallies, not a country club \ndinner, not a fundraiser, but real people--about their lives, we would \nunderstand what the Affordable Care Act has meant to a whole lot of \npeople.\n  In my State, there are a lot more than 500,000 people who have health \ninsurance today who did not have it 1 year ago because of the \nAffordable Care Act. In addition, there are 97,000 and counting young \npeople--18--20--25-years-olds--who are on their parents' health care \nplan who wouldn't have insurance without it. There are a million \nseniors in my State, from Gallipolis to Troy to Toledo to Zanesville, \nwho have gotten free--meaning no copay, no deductibles--free cancer \nscreenings, preventive care, diabetes checks--all of these kinds of \npreventive care, including when their doctor prescribes getting a \nphysical for seniors that is free, all because of the Affordable Care \nAct. There are thousands and thousands of people in Ohio who have a \nchild with diabetes or a son or a daughter with asthma, and that family \nhas been denied coverage year after year, but now, because of the \nAffordable Care Act, they have coverage. So we know what this has \nmeant.\n  I heard Pope Francis say a few months ago, speaking to his parish \npriests--he exhorted them to go out and listen to people and understand \ntheir lives, as should others, before they come to the floor and try to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act. There is something a bit untoward where \npeople of privilege--we are Senators; we have great titles, we are paid \ngood salaries, most of us dress well, most of us have nice haircuts--we \ncome to the floor with government-paid insurance, and we say we are \ngoing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take insurance away from \n500,000 Ohioans and tens of thousands of Minnesotans, and take away \nyoung people's and their parents' plan, and take away these benefits \nfor seniors.\n  I came to the floor to share a handful of letters because I want to \nput a face on some of these, what this actually means, if we were to--\nif Congress, thinking that is what the voters want--come to this floor \nand say we are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Let's talk \nabout what that means.\n  Connie from Hamilton County, in Cincinnati--the Presiding Officer has \nbeen in that city a couple of times--writes: As one of your \nconstituents, I want you to know the deleterious impacts of the DC \nCircuit Court's ruling on my well-being. Because of a change in both my \nemployment status and marital status, I have looked at the Affordable \nCare Act as a godsend. I worked full-time in a well-paying job for more \nthan 35 years when I was organized out of a position at the worst time \nduring the recession. I have been able to maintain limited and \ntemporary part-time contract work since. But the income I net is \nsubstantially reduced from what it was.\n  She said she worked for 35 years, so I assume she is at least in her \nfifties.\n\n       As an older worker, I'm having a difficult time securing \n     permanent employment. I believe strongly in the importance of \n     health care. I have recently qualified for a catastrophic \n     health plan with tax credits on healthcare.gov. Paying for it \n     is a stretch, but I have willingly bit the bullet.\n       As you know, Ohio is one of those States that has opted out \n     of establishing its own state plans. That wasn't a problem \n     until recently. Now, facing a plan that may be ineligible for \n     the Federal tax credit, I face a dire financial situation. If \n     I were the only one caught in this Catch 22, I would not be \n     writing. I understand there are approximately 5 million \n     Americans in similar straits.\n\n  Living in a State where the Governor did not want to set up an \nexchange, and the Supreme Court--nine privileged men and women who are \nlawyers, who get government health insurance--may take these benefits \naway from these 5 million people. That was my editorial comment.\n  She writes:\n\n       Please, please, help find a way to ameliorate the impact of \n     this circuit court ruling. Many of us are dependent upon it \n     so we don't become burdens on the health care system.\n\n  So the question: Why do people who dress like this, who have titles \nsuch as ``Congressman'' and ``Senator, who get health insurance paid by \ntaxpayers, why do they want to take it away from so many other people? \nWhy do they want to take these benefits away? Why do they want to \ncancel these consumer protections? So when they cast these votes on \nrepeal of the Affordable Care\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nAct, they should be thinking about the Connies of the world.\n  Sharon from Franklin County in the middle of State, Columbus, is a \nlupus patient. She writes:\n\n       I urge you to maintain the health care reform that helps us \n     afford coverage. Before Congress starts gutting the health \n     care reform, please visit a support group for any chronic \n     illness, and listen to the stories of people struggling to \n     pay their medical bills, about people being denied insurance \n     due to preexisting conditions, cutting their meds in half to \n     try to stretch them to the end of the month.\n\n  My wife was in a drugstore not too long ago. Right in front of her, \nsomebody was trying to figure out: Can I skip, take half this number of \npills so they last twice as long? That happens all the time. If more of \nus would get out to a drugstore, if more of us would get out and talk \nto people, we would learn that.\n  Sharon writes:\n\n       I have got a good education, a good job, good insurance, \n     but I know I could be wiped out in a matter of months if my \n     job were outsourced or discontinued. Since I work at home and \n     telecommute due to my illness, my chances at a new job and \n     new health insurance are grim. The health care reform bill \n     isn't perfect, but when it was passed, a collective sigh of \n     relief went up for millions of Americans who are struggling \n     to maintain their jobs, their families, and their lives while \n     suffering with chronic illnesses like lupus. Please don't \n     play politics with our lives. Please don't gut the health \n     care bill.\n\n  Again the question is, Why do my colleagues--almost all of whom have \nhealth insurance provided by taxpayers--why do they want to take these \nbenefits away from Sharon and Connie?\n  A couple more.\n  Rose from Hamilton County writes:\n\n       Senator Brown, please vote no to repeal the health care \n     law. My family and friends appreciate the added benefits we \n     are getting from the current health care law. My son's \n     fiancee is currently finishing her graduate degree.\n\n  She is 25.\n\n       Thank God she is able to remain on her parents' insurance; \n     otherwise she would not be able to afford the high cost of \n     private insurance.\n\n  This a young woman about whom Rose is writing. This is a young woman \nwho wants to get more education, wants to do better in life, wants to \nfurther her career, but what will happen? If she cannot stay on her \nparents' plan, if my colleagues are successful in repealing the \nAffordable Care Act, what will happen to her? Why should we even be \nasking that question?\n\n       My niece graduated last year from college and has not been \n     able to find a full-time teaching job.\n\n  She is doing what we need more of--good teachers in our country.\n\n       Fortunately, she too can now stay on her parents' insurance \n     because of the health care law. In addition--\n\n  She has an illness--\n\n     the current health care law ensures that when it's time for \n     her to get her own health insurance, she will not be \n     discriminated against.\n\n  This woman, Rose's niece, is in this situation. She is right out of \nschool. She wants to teach. She does not have a job yet. She is on her \nparents' health insurance plan. Then when she gets a job, if it were \nnot for the Affordable Care Act, she probably would be denied coverage \nbecause she has a preexisting condition. So she is a perfect example of \ntwo things about this law that my colleagues for whatever reason want \nto take away.\n  I will close with this. Chris from Fairfield County--kind of \nsoutheast of Columbus--writes:\n\n       Senator, I just wanted to thank you for standing by the \n     health care law. I now have insurance after 4 years without \n     it. I am now receiving treatment for my knee after 3 years of \n     pain and swelling. Turns out I have arthritis and I go to an \n     orthopedic surgeon next week for further diagnosis and \n     treatment. Without the insurance I purchased through the \n     exchange, the x-ray that discovered the arthritis would have \n     never been possible because I could not afford it.\n\n  So, again, why would my colleagues--almost all of whom have health \ninsurance--why would they want to take those benefits away? Why would \nthey say to this person in Fairfield County--why would they say to \nChris: Well, sorry, you are not going to get that x ray.\n  In the end, what would happen? Chris would not get the x ray, would \nnot know about the arthritis until it gets worse, and then it would \ncost the health insurance company more money.\n  Part of what the Affordable Care Act does--and the Presiding Officer \nplayed a role in writing many provisions of this law--part of what it \ndoes is it encourages and gives people incentives to get preventive \ncare.\n  So if we repeal this law, if my colleagues--again, I know I said this \nover and over, but almost all of whom have health insurance provided to \nthem by taxpayers--if they have their way, all of these people--Chris \nand Rose and Sharon and Connie--where do they turn? Where do they turn? \nTheir lives end up worse. They end up being sicker. They possibly die \nyounger. They end up costing the health care system more money. They \nare less productive as citizens. The niece and the son-in-law and the \nfiancee one of these ladies talked about would not be able to get an \neducation, get ahead--all of the things we say we value in this \ncountry.\n  How can any anybody think in good conscience that repealing the \nAffordable Care Act makes sense for our families, makes sense for our \ncommunities, makes sense for the States of Minnesota and Ohio, makes \nsense for our country?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as another polar vortex bears down on \nStates across the country this week, we must consider how the dropping \ntemperatures across the Nation will impact those who do not have refuge \nfrom the cold. The issue of homelessness is especially urgent in places \nlike my home State of Vermont. For those of us lucky enough to have \nwarm homes, winter brings a magical beauty. But for those without \nshelter, the cold\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\nnights can be deadly. Unfortunately, for homeless teens, winter can \nalso mean even greater vulnerability to being victimized by human \ntraffickers.\n  That is why we must pass the Leahy-Collins Runaway and Homeless Youth \nand Trafficking Prevention Act today. This should be unanimous. We are \ntalking about helping homeless children and victims of human \ntrafficking. There is no good reason to oppose this measure.\n  The programs supported by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program \nprovide essential resources to homeless children who need our help. \nAmanda, for example, is an 18-year-old living in Bellows Falls, VT, and \nparticipating in the Transitional Living Program at the Youth Services \nof Windham County. Amanda's mother gave her and her four siblings up \nfor adoption when she was 2. When she was 13, her adoptive mother died \nof a stroke. Amanda was devastated, suffered academically, and \neventually dropped out of school, then struggled with substance abuse \nand became homeless.\n  Fortunately, Amanda was connected with the Youth Services of Windham \nCounty and has turned her life around. She is sober, she is on track to \ngraduate from high school, and she has a job. Amanda says of her youth \nworker Danielle, ``She is part of the reason why I try to keep doing so \ngood . . . Without her, I wouldn't have what I have today.'' Funds \nauthorized by this bill made Amanda's transformation possible. Once \nheaded for a life of dependency, she is now poised to become a \nsuccessful and contributing young adult.\n  There are currently 1.6 million homeless teens in this country like \nAmanda, and they need us to do our job and pass this bill. This bill \nreauthorizes critical outreach and emergency shelter services that have \nprovided lifesaving support for the last 40 years. It takes historic \nsteps to address the growing population of homeless LGBT youth by \nensuring that no young person is denied services based on sexual \norientation or gender identity. It also addresses new dangers that our \nyoung people face, like sexual exploitation and human trafficking, \nwhich urgently require our attention.\n  Human trafficking is a growing problem in the United States, and \ntraffickers prey upon our weakest young people, especially those in \nneed of money or shelter. Too often, homeless children become trapped \nin devastating cycles of abuse and exploitation.\n  Runaway and homeless youth service providers are our first line of \ndefense. This bill makes sure they are trained to identify victims of \nsexual exploitation and trafficking, so they can help victims become \nsurvivors.\n  After this bill was first introduced in July, it was considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee and was voted out in September with strong \nbipartisan support. We had bipartisan input on the legislation, \nincluding from Senator Cornyn, who offered an amendment that included \nnearly every provision of his Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. \nThis amendment gives law enforcement new tools to combat human \ntrafficking and provides expanded support for victims of sexual \nexploitation.\n  Working across the aisle to enhance this bill and get it passed \nreminds me of the way both Houses of Congress came together to pass the \nLeahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act just last year. \nDomestic violence, like youth homelessness, is not new. However, the \nchallenges faced by victims are constantly changing, and we must be \nresponsive to the needs of our most vulnerable citizens. We cannot \nbecome complacent in the face of suffering. We need to pass this bill.\n  I thank Senator Collins for working with me on this legislation and \nfor joining me as an original cosponsor. I ask for the support of every \nSenator to pass the Leahy-Collins Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act. The American people expect it, and our \nhumanity demands it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/13/senate-section/article/S5982-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING MIKE HALEY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career of \nSheriff Mike Haley, who has served as the Washoe County sheriff since \nJanuary 2, 2007.\n  For more than 30 years, Mike Haley has been dedicated to protecting \nthe people of Washoe County. He started his career in 1980 as a deputy \nsheriff and proceeded to work and supervise in every division within \nthe Sheriff's Office. When he was elected sheriff, his vast experience \nand understanding of the community he served enhanced Washoe County. \nSheriff Haley spearheaded groundbreaking projects, such as the Northern \nNevada Counter-Terrorism and Cyber Center and the Area Crime Evaluation \nSystem, and used these technological advances to make the Washoe County \nSheriff's Office more efficient. Under his leadership in an extremely \npoor economic situation, county law enforcement overcame budgetary \nchallenges and continued his efforts to make Washoe County safer.\n  Mike Haley has helped Nevada immensely beyond his role as sheriff. He \nserves as vice-chair for the Nevada Commission on Homeland Security and \nis chairman of the Nevada High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program. \nIn previous years, he was the president of the Nevada Sheriffs' and \nChiefs' Association. These notable positions only begin to demonstrate \nSheriff Haley's dedication to the community, and the constructive \nimpact he has had on the Silver State.\n  Prior to his career in law enforcement, Mike Haley served our Nation \nas a first sergeant in the U.S. Army. He graduated with honors from \nNortheast Missouri State University with a Bachelor's Degree in \ncriminal justice. His commitment to extending his education and \ntraining is evident in all he has done. Mike Haley graduated from the \nFBI National Academy, the Secret Service Executive Academy, Senior \nManagement Institute for Police Executives at Harvard University, \nSouthwest Command College for Law Enforcement Executives, and the Drug \nEnforcement Academy.\n  Throughout his prolific career and his exemplary life, Sheriff Mike \nHaley has been a great boon to the State of Nevada. I congratulate him \non his many successes while serving as the Washoe County sheriff and \nappreciate his dedication to public service.

GEORGE D. EDWARDS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \ndedicated his life's work to education in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nDr. George D. Edwards is the founding president and CEO of Big Sandy \nCommunity and Technical College, BSCTC, and he will step down from that \nposition in January of 2015.\n  Although Dr. Edwards is originally from Virginia, it is fair to \nconsider him an adopted son of the Bluegrass State. He first came to \nKentucky in 1970 to attend Berea College, and upon finishing his \nundergraduate studies, he decided he wasn't in a hurry to leave. Dr. \nEdwards went to Murray State University to earn his master of business \nadministration and master of economics, and despite some absences from \nthe Commonwealth in the interim--including when he earned his doctor of \neducation from the University of Southern Mississippi--he returned to \nPaintsville where he has lived for the last 14 years.\n  When Dr. Edwards first moved to eastern Kentucky in 2000, he became \nthe third president of Prestonsburg Community College and the first CEO \nfor the Big Sandy Community and Technical College District. When the \ncolleges merged in 2003 to become Big Sandy Community and Technical \nCollege, he became the institution's first president and CEO.\n  In this capacity Dr. Edwards has worked tirelessly to strengthen Big \nSandy's commitment to its students. He has cultivated ties with the \narea's business community through his work with the local chambers of \ncommerce, he has instituted an honors program for students, a \nLeadership institute for faculty and staff, and created a music and \ndrama program for students and the community. He has also overseen over \n$23 million in infrastructure projects on campus.\n  Although Dr. Edwards and his wife, Dr. Joyce Edwards, plan to move to \nVerona, VA, in their retirement, their impact on the State and the \nregion will undoubtedly remain. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate \ncolleagues join me in honoring this exemplary educator, Dr. George D. \nEdwards, and wishing him well in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, the Big Sandy Community and Technical College recently \npublished an article on their Web site detailing the life and career of \nDr. George D. Edwards. I ask unanimous\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nconsent that the article be printed in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                             [Aug. 5, 2014]\n\n          Founding President/CEO of BSCTC Announces Retirement\n\n       After 14 years, Dr. George D. Edwards, founding president \n     and CEO of Big Sandy Community and Technical College (BSCTC), \n     will step down as college president and CEO on January 5, \n     2015. He will work on a special assignment through June 30, \n     2015.\n       ``This is a bittersweet day for our family,'' said Dr. \n     Edwards. ``I have had the honor of working with a dedicated \n     board of directors, foundation board, a great leadership \n     team, and a group of passionate faculty and staff who are \n     committed to our mission. Together, we have made great \n     strides in providing the people of the Big Sandy region a \n     comprehensive community and technical college that is devoted \n     to student success, access and transfer.''\n       Dr. Michael B. McCall, founding president of the Kentucky \n     Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), issued the \n     following statement on Dr. Edwards' retirement: ``Dr. \n     Edwards' outstanding leadership during the past 14 years has \n     enabled BSCTC to provide the local community with educational \n     programs in high-wage, high-demand fields, designed to \n     enhance the eastern Kentucky economy. We are currently \n     working with Dr. Edwards to ensure a seamless transition plan \n     is in place as we move forward in our mission to provide \n     Kentuckians with a quality postsecondary education that is \n     both accessible and affordable.''\n       Dr. Edwards and his wife, Dr. Joyce Edwards, plan to \n     relocate to Verona, Va. upon his retirement.\n       ``This will allow us to be within two hours of all of our \n     children and grandchildren,'' he said. ``Family is very \n     important to Joyce and me, and we look forward to spending \n     time with them, traveling and volunteering in the \n     community.''\n       Dr. Edwards became the third president of Prestonsburg \n     Community College and the founding president of the Big Sandy \n     Community and Technical College in November 2000, shortly \n     after the passage of House Bill 1 which created KCTCS. Under \n     his leadership, Prestonsburg Community College and Mayo \n     Technical College together formed Big Sandy Community and \n     Technical College in 2003.\n       Student success has been the cornerstone of Dr. Edwards' \n     administration. Since 2008, the college has increased \n     credentials awarded to students by 140 percent and graduates \n     earning associate degrees by 64 percent.\n       Dr. Edwards has overseen more than $23 million in building \n     projects during his tenure. BSCTC opened the Student Center \n     in 2002 and the Postsecondary Education Building and East \n     Kentucky Science Center and Planetarium in 2004. The Mayo \n     campus benefitted from a more than $7.5-million renovation in \n     2002. Additionally, more than $4 million have been spent on \n     infrastructure upgrades in the areas of technology and \n     sustainability.\n       Dr. Edwards' strong and compassionate leadership has led to \n     many accomplishments, including: the creation of the Floyd \n     County and Johnson County Early College Academies; a highly \n     responsive Workforce Solutions program; the creation of the \n     Big Sandy Singers, Big Sandy Idol and Fine Arts department; \n     the Honors Scholarship program; leadership development for \n     employees; and the continued growth of the Big Sandy College \n     Educational Foundation, Inc.\n       ``I'm most proud of the students we've helped,'' said Dr. \n     Edwards. ``It's rewarding to be in a position and represent \n     an institution that has unwavering commitment to students. \n     It's also been rewarding to watch our employees grow and \n     develop over the years. I hope that my efforts have made a \n     difference.''\n       Karen Sellers, chair of the BSCTC board of directors, said \n     Dr. Edwards transformed an already well respected community \n     college into a remarkable place to work and study.\n       ``As a result of his strategic leadership, BSCTC has seen \n     significant growth in student enrollment, faculty achievement \n     and campus improvements,'' she said. ``Dr. Edwards has done a \n     terrific job of reaching out to the business community, \n     fundraising and recruiting talented students, faculty and \n     staff. Every step of the way, he has reminded this community \n     of the vital importance of Big Sandy Community and Technical \n     College.''\n       Charles ``Rusty'' Justice, vice chair of the BSCTC board of \n     directors, said: ``I would like to thank Dr. Edwards for his \n     leadership of this wonderful institution over the last 14 \n     years. Under his guidance he has overseen growth and progress \n     in all facets of the organization. I would also like to thank \n     him for his friendship. He is a man of intelligence and \n     character and I have benefited from that relationship.''\n       Bobby McCool, chief institutional officer, said Dr. \n     Edwards' leadership has elevated the importance of \n     postsecondary education in economic development.\n       ``Big Sandy Community and Technical College has brokered \n     the dialogue of conversation on the role of our college in \n     workforce development,'' he said.\n       Dr. Nancy B. Johnson, provost at BSCTC, said Dr. Edwards' \n     leadership and commitment to students and communities served \n     by the college has been phenomenal.\n       ``The many successful programs initiated--increased \n     scholarship access; the improvement of facilities; the access \n     to technology and its infusion into the learning process; the \n     responsiveness to workforce needs; and the continual \n     encouragement and support to faculty and staff through \n     professional development opportunities--all provide evidence \n     of this leadership and commitment. Working as a member of his \n     team at Big Sandy has truly been a gift for me.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/13/senate-section/article/S5983-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5983-S5984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Lieutenant General Peter M. Vangjel\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished public servant and officer in the U.S. Army, LTG Peter M. \nVangjel. General Vangjel served as the 64th Army inspector general and \nretires on February 1, 2015, after more than 37 years of selfless \nservice to our Nation. Throughout his professional life, General \nVangjel personified the Army values of duty, honor, and selfless \nservice in leadership roles around the world and here at home. Many of \nus on Capitol Hill know General Vangjel by these qualities and have \nenjoyed the opportunity to work with him on a wide variety of Army \nissues and programs. It is my privilege to recognize his many \nsignificant contributions.\n  General Vangjel is a native of New Hampshire and graduated from the \nUniversity of New Hampshire in 1977. He served in a variety of command \nand staff assignments and has led our soldiers in both peace and war, \nin combat and humanitarian missions, in the United States, Europe, \nAsia, and the Middle East. He has proven himself as a stellar leader \ndemonstrating unselfish devotion to the Nation, our leaders, soldiers \nand their families.\n  For the final 3 years of his noteworthy career, General Vangjel \nserved as the Army inspector general, providing independent and \nunbiased advice to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army. His \nadvice, assistance, and detailed oversight of timely, high-visibility \ninspections and investigations proved critical for an adaptive Army in \ntransition. He personally led multiple efforts to promote readiness, \nresource stewardship and accountability of equipment, funds, personnel \nand leader behavior.\n  As he has throughout his career, General Vangjel embraced his charter \nto conduct outreach to our Army's leaders, soldiers, families, and the \npublic at every opportunity, stressing the importance of resource \nmanagement and creativity. Nowhere was this more evident than during \nhis 2-year assignment to the Middle East, where he supervised efforts \nthat provided nearly $8 billion dollars in cost avoidance and \nstreamlined contracting and logistic support efforts as our troops \nsurged in to Afghanistan and retrograded from Iraq. His vision, \npassion, and energy kept key military and civilian leaders aware of \nemerging trends enabling them to correct problems and anticipate future \nchallenges.\n  General Vangjel led his team in conducting many significant \ninspections enabling our Army to address critical issues, revise \npolicies, and improve processes. His special inspections of Arlington \nNational Cemetery restored effective oversight and reinstilled public \nconfidence in the effort to honor our fallen heroes at a place sacred \nto all Americans. Likewise, his team's work to help our suffering \nsoldiers receive more efficient behavioral health treatment within the \nIntegrated Disability Evaluation System brought to light new \ninformation about process issues and the need for better coordination \nand support from Veterans Affairs. In addition, during his tenure, the \nArmy inspector general performed vital compliance oversight inspections \nfor some of our Nation's most sensitive activities, including nuclear \nand chemical research and development centers, intelligence oversight, \nand information assurance operations.\n  LTG Peter M. Vangjel has consistently provided superb leadership, \nadvice, and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of \nenduring importance to the Army and our Nation. On behalf of Congress \nand the United States of America, I thank General Vangjel, his wife \nJoanne, and his entire family for their commitment and contributions to \nour Army and the Nation, and I congratulate them both on an exceptional \ncareer of selfless service.\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/13/senate-section/article/S5984-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING NANCY J. COX\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to recognize the outstanding career of a \ndedicated civil servant, Iowan Dr. Nancy Cox, who will retire in \nNovember 2014 after 37 years of distinguished Federal service at the \nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Cox started \nworking on influenza at CDC in 1976. Thirty-seven years and 278 \npublications later, she has transformed the surveillance and science of \ninfluenza viruses and vaccines. Her scientific work has been critical, \ngiven the tremendous global burden of human seasonal influenza--1 \nbillion cases, 3 to 5 million severe illnesses, and 300,000 to 500,000 \ndeaths each year. In addition, avian or swine influenza viruses can \nadapt to human-to-human transmission, leading to global and devastating \npandemics with disruption in commerce and tragic numbers of illnesses \nand deaths. The breadth and depth of influenzas impact is vast, \nunderscoring Dr. Cox's vital contribution from her science and service.\n  Dr. Cox began her senior leadership duties years ago directing a \nsmall branch of 40 to 50 staff. Today she oversees more than 320 staff, \nand the Influenza Division she directs has broad responsibilities as \nthe U.S. Government, USG, lead for influenza prevention and control, \nand as one of five World Health Organization Collaborating Centers for \nthe Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza. Dr. Cox \nrecognized that influenza prevention and control requires a broad, \nmultifaceted surveillance effort. Through her scientific leadership, \ndirection, and publication of scientific findings, CDC established \nsurveillance for various aspects of influenza illness to improve the \nunderstanding of influenza impact and to provide ongoing influenza \nsurveillance data throughout the season to inform clinical management \nand to monitor effectiveness of influenza prevention efforts.\n  During her 37 years at CDC, Dr. Cox has served as mentor, educator, \nsupervisor, and supporter to hundreds of individuals: undergraduates, \nmedical and PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, laboratory and \nepidemiology staff members, journalists, and visiting researchers. As \nDirector of the WHO Collaborating Center for the Surveillance, \nEpidemiology and Control of Influenza at CDC, Dr. Cox has worked \nclosely with public health laboratory officials from Russia, Vietnam, \nand China, leading to transforming their capabilities in influenza \nvirology and surveillance. Her oversight of influenza laboratories at \nCDC has set the standards for measuring immune response in infected and \nvaccinated people and also has led CDC to be the global reference \ncenter for antiviral resistance and for measuring transmission of \ninfluenza viruses in animal models. Her leadership at WHO has also led \nto significant changes in the methods, reporting, interpretation, and \npolicy development for selecting candidate vaccine viruses for use in \nannual vaccine production. Dr. Cox has been able to see where the field \nof influenza prevention and control needs to go to address emerging \nproblems, and the successes of her scientific intuition and persistence \nare present in many places around the globe.\n  Dr. Cox has been recognized by virologists, public health officials, \nleaders in State and Federal governments, international leaders, \nacademics, and others. She is the recipient of 10 National Center for \nInfectious Disease recognition awards, 7 Nakano Awards, 4 Shepard \nAwards, Lancet Paper of the Year, Time Magazine's The Time 100: People \nWho Shape Our World, Service to America Award, CDC's Lifetime \nAchievement Award, and the USG-wide award for Federal Employee of the \nYear. She has served as a reviewer for numerous scientific journals and \nresearch grant efforts. She is frequently invited by editors of \nScience, New England Journal of Medicine, and other journals to write \neditorials and opinion pieces.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of Indianapolis, IN \nMetropolitan Police Officer Perry Renn. Dedicated, loyal, and above all \ncompassionate to those in need, Officer Renn served with the \nIndianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, IMPD, for 21 years.\n  On Saturday, July 5, 2014, Officer Renn responded to a report of \nshots fired on the northeast side of Indianapolis, the district where \nhe was a patrolman throughout his career with IMPD. When Officer Renn \narrived, he joined another IMPD officer already on the scene, and they \napproached a group of individuals standing in a nearby alley. As they \napproached the group, one of the individuals brandished a gun and began \nshooting at the officers. Despite the fact that he was wearing a \nprotective vest, Officer Renn was struck by the gunfire. After \nadditional officers arrived and detained the shooter, Officer Renn was \ntransported to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition. Sadly, despite \nthe best efforts of his fellow officers, EMTs, and medical personnel, \nOfficer Renn, 51, succumbed to his wounds.\n  A native of Indianapolis, IN and raised in Phoenix, AZ, Officer Renn \njoined the U.S. Army after graduating from high school. For the \nmajority of his 10-year enlistment, Perry was stationed in Fort Bragg, \nNC with the 82nd Airborne Division as a paratrooper and jumpmaster, \ncompleting more than 100 jumps. He achieved the rank of staff sergeant \nand was awarded achievement and commendation medals during his tenure. \nPerry was stationed in Korea for 2 tours, spent 18 months in New York \nCity as a recruiter, and served in Operation Urgent Fury, the military \nconflict in Grenada in 1983.\n  Officer Renn was awarded two Medals of Bravery during his career with \nIMPD, in the years 1999 and 2003. Prior to becoming a police officer, \nhe worked at the Marion County Sherriff Communications Department as a \ndispatcher and control operator. In 2011, Officer Renn received a \nletter of commendation for his efforts to assist individuals after a \nstage collapse at the Indiana State Fair injured 58 and killed 9 \npeople. Always seeking to help those in need, Officer Renn chose to \nserve in a district on the northeast side of Indianapolis because he \nknew it was an area of the city where many citizens would need help.\n  Officer Renn is survived and deeply missed by his wife of 25 years, \nLynn Sappenfield-Renn; mother Phyllis Renn; father David Renn (Tina); \nsister Sherri Jones (Michael); five nieces; two nephews; four great \nnieces; four great nephews; numerous aunts, uncles and cousins; the \nIndianapolis Metropolitan Police Department family; and his beloved \npets.\n  Officer Renn loved his work, and he gave his life to serve and \nprotect the citizens of Indianapolis. Although he would have never \nthought of himself as a hero, Officer Renn demonstrated his character \ndaily by conducting himself with courage, bravery, compassion, honor, \nand integrity. Thus, he was a true American hero--in his everyday life \nas a police officer, husband, and community member--and in his final \ncall to duty. Let us always remember and emulate the shining example \nthis stalwart, modest yet brave man set for us, and honor him for his \nselfless commitment to serving his fellow citizens. May God welcome him \nhome and give comfort to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/13/senate-section/article/S5984-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5984-S5985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING MASTER SERGEANT JOSEPH B. SMRT\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I also wish to recognize and honor \nthe extraordinary service of U.S. Army MSG Joe Smrt. Dedicated, loyal, \nand above all compassionate to those in need, Mr. Smrt was drafted into \nthe Army in 1942 and served throughout World War II.\n  On September 23, 2014, Joe passed away at the age of 98. A native of \nNorth\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\nJudson, IN, Joe was a shining star in the ``greatest generation,'' \nforced to learn the virtues of hard work, frugality, and self-reliance \nat a young age after losing his father when he was just 6 years old.\n  Joe was always proud of his service to our country during World War \nII. He served as a combat engineer in the 94th Division--a part of \nPatton's Third Army and earned the European Medal with four bronze \nstars--signifying his participation in four separate military \ncampaigns, including the Battle of the Bulge.\n  Recognized for his love of country, Joe was well-respected by those \nin his community. As one of the most patriotic men in Knox, his \nneighbors often referred to him as ``Mr. Patriotism.'' Many considered \nhim a pillar of the Knox community, and over the past several decades, \nwhenever there was a veterans function or celebration of patriotism in \nStarke County, chances are Joe was deeply involved. Joe worked to \neducate our youth about the sacrifices of our veterans and \nservicemembers by giving presentations about World War II at Knox \nschools and Veterans Day events. He also served as commander of VFW \nPost 748 in Knox from 1991 to 1994, and he was elected Starke County \nsurveyor for 7 terms spanning 28 years.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Joe in 2009 when he visited \nWashington, DC through the Honor Flight Network. I am honored to have \nmet such an admirable and patriotic man. Last month the State of \nIndiana laid this public servant--a veteran, a Yankees fan, and most of \nall, a hero--to rest. We are forever grateful for his service to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Smrt is survived and deeply missed by his wife of over 63 years, \nUrsula Kelly, and their four children--Terry Smrt of Knox, Kevin Smrt \nof Knox, Christopher Smrt of Louisville, Kentucky, Madonna Johnson of \nAustin, Texas and five grandchildren and five great grandchildren, as \nwell as friends, the United States Army family, and Hoosiers across the \nState of Indiana.\n  Joe Smrt was an American hero. He conducted himself with courage, \nbravery, compassion, honor, and integrity--both while serving our \nnation and throughout his time as a civilian back home in Indiana. Let \nus always remember and treasure the memory of this stalwart, brave man \nand honor his selfless commitment to serving his fellow citizens. May \nGod welcome him home and give comfort to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/13/senate-section/article/S5985-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING JACKSON TOWNSHIP ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY.

Since its inception, this program has \noffered the opportunity for schools in every State to gain recognition \nfor educational accomplishments in closing the achievement gaps among \nstudent groups.\n  Recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department \nof Education is based on a school either being measured as an Exemplary \nHigh Performing School, where schools are among the State's highest \nscorers in English and mathematics, or as an Exemplary Achievement Gap \nClosing School, where schools with at least 40 percent of their student \nbody coming from disadvantaged backgrounds have reduced the achievement \ngap in English and mathematics within the last 5 years. Jackson \nTownship Elementary School has made great strides in the area of \nimproved proficiency in both English and mathematics.\n  In 2014 alone, Jackson Township Elementary School's combined ISTEP+ \npassing rate for English and mathematics was around 96 percent for \nthird through fifth grades. Jackson Township Elementary School's \neffectiveness can be found in its Character Education program. In this \nprogram, students are familiarized with positive characteristics that \nare connected to character development introduced first in the home \nenvironment. Jackson Township Elementary School affirms that every \nstudent's success is directly related to family and community support. \nWith over 40 percent of its students identified as economically \ndisadvantaged in a primarily rural farming town, Jackson Township \nElementary School is seen as a beacon of light for the development of \nIndiana's youth.\n  I would like to acknowledge Jackson Township Elementary School \nPrincipal Bradford C.

Students are \ntaught complex problem solving, innovative collaboration, and the \nmerits of integrity. Also, by offering mobile technology labs and \nfocusing on college and career readiness, students are prepared for \nfuture success. These standards have led Hamilton Southeastern Junior \nHigh School to consistently achieve an A-rating and a four-star \ndesignation by the Indiana Department of Education.

Bob was also honored \nwith the Equitable's Community Leadership Award twice.\n  A compassionate community leader, Bob served as chairman of the Board \nof the Freestore Foodbank and founded its most popular fundraiser, the \nRubber Duck Regatta. Proceeds from this fundraiser have provided \nmillions of meals to Cincinnatians in need. This\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\npast August, the Freestore Foodbank hosted the 20th Annual Rubber Duck \nRegatta. To celebrate this milestone, Bob set the ambitious goal of \nraising $1 million dollars, which equates to approximately 3 million \nmeals for hungry children and families. With Bob's leadership, that \ngoal was reached.\n  In 2002 Bob received the Bengals Community Quarterback Award, the NFL \nleague-wide volunteer recognition program, and in 2006 he received the \nVolunteer of the Year Award from Feeding America. Bob also served as \npresident of the Dan Beard Council, Boy Scouts of America and founded \nthe Council's United Food and Clothing Drive, serving as its general \nchairman for 2 years.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \nnational nonprofit organization within Las Vegas known as Horses4Heroes \nfor being awarded the American Horse Council Time to Ride 100-Day Horse \nChallenge by introducing the most newcomers to horses in just 100 days. \nThis unique program works to improve the lives of more than 6 million \nAmericans who serve in the military, National Guard, as first \nresponders and their families, by making horseback riding more \naffordable and accessible. As a longtime horse owner and horse \nenthusiast myself, I recognize the importance horses play as both \ncompanion animals and to our Nation's economy.\n  The brave men and women who have served the United States and fought \nto protect our freedom have often come home suffering from the effects \nof post-traumatic stress, PTS. Veterans faced dangerous situations in \norder to protect Americans from harm, and we owe them a debt of \ngratitude. Horses4Heroes is a shining example of the kind of \ninitiatives that will help to reintegrate our veterans into civilian \nlife, combat the effects of PTS, and help reduce the rates of suicide, \nwhile also providing comfort to grieving families.\n  There is no way to adequately thank the men and women that lay down \ntheir lives for our freedoms, but the founders and volunteers at \nHorses4Heroes are working to assist our Nation's veterans by giving \nthem the opportunity to use horses to help reconnect and get \nreacquainted with their families. The organization was founded by \nSydney Knott in 2006 operating out of her backyard and has now grown to \nincorporate affordable recreational, instructional, and morale-boosting \nhealth & wellness programs at more than 200 therapeutic equestrian \ncenters across the country. This organization's continued dedication to \nserving veterans in the Silver State and the country is commendable.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning home from the \nbattlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals, but to ensure they receive the quality care they \nhave earned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise \nfor our veterans and service members in Nevada and throughout the \nNation. I am very pleased that veterans' service organizations like \nHorses4Heroes are committed to ensuring that the needs of our veterans \nare being met.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nHorses4Heroes, an organization whose mission is both noble and \ncharitable. I am both humbled and honored to recognize Horses4Heroes \nand I wish them the best of luck in all of their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/13/senate-section/article/S5986-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5986-S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING OKLAHOMA UNIVERSITIES\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President \n     and Congress of the United States to encourage international \n     intervention on behalf of the Iraqi civilians in dire need of \n     protection from religious persecution; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 402\n\n       Whereas, Sunni Islamist insurgents and the terrorist group \n     known as the Islamic State or IS (also known as ISIS or ISIL) \n     have expanded control over areas in northwest and central \n     Iraq. IS has a stated mission of establishing an Islamic \n     state and is moving forward through extremist attacks on \n     Christians, Shiites, and other unprotected minorities in \n     certain parts of the region.\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n     Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people in the Nineveh Plain \n     face ethnic and religious cleansing, persecution, and \n     harassment due to attacks by the terrorists; and\n       Whereas, Over two-thirds of the Christian population in \n     Iraq is made up of Chaldeans and Assyrians, with smaller \n     populations of Syriacs and Armenians. More than 500,000 \n     people have been displaced by the current violence in Iraq, \n     with nearly 80% of Iraq's 1.5 million Christian population \n     having fled since 2003. These communities in Northwestern \n     Iraq have recently been given an ultimatum to convert, flee, \n     or be killed. Mosul's 1800-year-old Christian community no \n     longer exists. Many of these individuals have resettled in \n     the United States, including Michigan. Over 130,000 Chaldeans \n     currently reside in our state, the largest population outside \n     of Iraq. This community has, and continues to be, a strong \n     asset to our state, among other states in our union; and\n       Whereas, The United States has provided over $73 million in \n     humanitarian assistance to Iraq's minority populations since \n     2003. Yet, the crisis currently gripping northwestern Iraq \n     has serious potential to undo all international efforts to \n     restore stability to Iraq. Action by the United States is \n     necessary to reaffirm our commitment to protecting minority \n     groups facing persecution: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     President and Congress of the United States to encourage \n     international intervention on behalf of the Iraqi civilians \n     in dire need of protection from religious persecution; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-343. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to take \n     action forthwith to amend the United States Constitution; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 106\n\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution states that, ``The powers not delegated to the \n     United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to \n     the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to \n     the people''; and\n       Whereas, the states primarily regulate today's health \n     insurance market and provide aggressive oversight of all \n     aspects of this market and enforce consumer protection as \n     well as ensure a local, responsive presence for consumers; \n     and\n       Whereas, states like Idaho are working hard to create \n     public-private health care partnerships and facilitate local \n     solutions; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has passed \n     legislation that will impose restrictions on the states' \n     ability to regulate health plans and will require citizens to \n     acquire health care insurance coverage; and\n       Whereas, the creation of a new federal system of regulation \n     for health insurance would be inefficient, unnecessary, not \n     cost-effective and an additional burden on states; and\n       Whereas, the legislation passed by the Congress will impose \n     a legacy of untold debt on our children and grandchildren; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is in the interest of the citizens of the State \n     of Idaho to have an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States prohibiting the Congress from making any law \n     that would require citizens to enroll in, participate in or \n     secure health care insurance and that would penalize any \n     citizen who declines to purchase or participate in any health \n     care insurance program: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixtieth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, that the Idaho \n     Legislature urges Congress to take action forthwith to amend \n     the United States Constitution by adding a Twenty-eighth \n     Amendment as follows:\n       The Congress shall make no law requiring citizens of the \n     United States to enroll in, participate in or secure health \n     care insurance or to penalize any citizen who declines to \n     purchase or participate in any health care insurance program; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives of Congress, the congressional \n     delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of \n     the United States and the presiding officers of both houses \n     of the Legislature of each of our sister states in the Union.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-344. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the United \n     States Congress to investigate the United States Department \n     of Veterans Affairs' treatment of military veterans seeking \n     health care at facilities throughout the country; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 385\n\n       Whereas, The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been \n     aware of a backlog of patients seeking to see doctors or have \n     specific tests completed at several VA hospitals around the \n     nation for several years. As many as 7,000 veterans have been \n     on the backlog list, often waiting over a year for necessary \n     procedures or tests. The VA admits that 23 veterans have died \n     while waiting to see a doctor. However, many believe the \n     number of veterans to have died while waiting to be seen is \n     much higher; and\n       Whereas, It has now come to light that VA facilities have, \n     not only a backlog of patients, but also secret waiting \n     lists, keeping veterans' names out of the computer system \n     until they could be seen by a doctor within the required 14-\n     day wait time. The secret waiting lists made it appear the VA \n     facilities were meeting their performance goal to see \n     patients in a timely manner; and\n       Whereas, The men and women who serve our country deserve \n     better than lackluster medical care or no care at all. Many \n     of them have been injured in the line of duty and come home \n     to face medical challenges that require timely diagnosis and \n     care. All veterans are entitled to the best care we can give \n     them. To be deceived by a system more interested in \n     performance goals than health care is intolerable: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     United States Congress to investigate the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, treatment of military \n     veterans seeking health care at facilities throughout the \n     country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/13/senate-section/article/S5992-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. TESTER, from the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n       Report to accompany S. 2041, a bill to repeal the Act of \n     May 31, 1918, and for other purposes (Rept.

Res. 578\n\n       Whereas, prior to 2000, the distribution of, and the \n     resources for, vaccines for children in the developing world \n     were declining, immunization rates were stagnant or \n     decreasing, and nearly 30,000,000 children born in the \n     developing world each year were not fully immunized;\n       Whereas, prior to 2000, it was common for new life-saving \n     vaccines to take up to 15 years to be introduced in the \n     world's poorest countries;\n       Whereas access to routine immunization and vaccines protect \n     children from deadly but preventable disease and contribute \n     to national economic growth and poverty reduction by ensuring \n     people live longer, healthier, and more productive lives;\n       Whereas, in 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the \n     United States, the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund \n     (UNICEF), the World Health Organization, the World Bank, \n     bilateral partners, developing countries, the private sector, \n     including the vaccine industry, civil society, and other \n     partners joined forces to create a public-private partnership \n     called the Global Fund for Children's Vaccines (now Gavi, The \n     Vaccine Alliance) in order to expand access to new and \n     underused vaccines and support the introduction and scale-up \n     of these vaccines into routine immunization systems in the \n     world's poorest countries;\n       Whereas partnership and sustainability are at the core of \n     the Gavi model by requiring eligible countries to contribute \n     financing to some portion of their vaccine costs and directly \n     invest in immunizing their children;\n       Whereas, by 2012, more than 65 developing countries working \n     with Gavi were co-financing new and underused vaccines and \n     more than 20 countries are projected to graduate between 2016 \n     and 2020, moving toward fully funding their national \n     immunization programs;\n       Whereas Gavi has transformed the market for vaccines by \n     pooling demand from developing countries matched with secure, \n     predictable financing to make vaccines more affordable and \n     their supply more reliable, and encouraging research and \n     development of new vaccines;\n       Whereas, as a result, Gavi has played a critical role in \n     increasing the number of global vaccine manufacturers selling \n     to the world's poorest countries from 5 in 2001 to 13 in \n     2014;\n       Whereas the price for the pneumococcal vaccine, which \n     prevents pneumonia, is now more than 90 percent lower for \n     Gavi-eligible countries than elsewhere, and the price of \n     rotavirus vaccines, which prevents diarrhea, is 67 percent \n     lower in Gavi-eligible countries;\n       Whereas, with innovative financing mechanisms like the \n     Advance Market Commitment and International Finance Facility \n     for Immunisation (IFFIm), Gavi ensures that appropriate and \n     affordable vaccines are available throughout the developing \n     world;\n       Whereas Gavi supports the financing and delivery of 11 \n     vaccines, including those against pneumococcal disease and \n     rotavirus, the leading vaccine-preventable causes of \n     pneumonia and diarrhea, which kill more children under the \n     age of five than any other disease;\n       Whereas Gavi collaborates closely with the Global Polio \n     Eradication Initiative on the final push to end polio, \n     strengthening and bringing the inactivated polio vaccine into \n     routine immunization programs;\n       Whereas strong immunization systems are critical to \n     ensuring continuous coverage and sustainability of new and \n     routine immunization programs in implementing countries;\n       Whereas Gavi supports the strengthening of health systems \n     and local civil society organizations to ensure effective \n     immunization and health services;\n       Whereas, since 2000, with support from the United States, \n     the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF, the World Health \n     Organization, the World Bank, implementing countries, donor \n     governments, the private sector, and other donors and \n     partners, Gavi has supported country-led vaccine roll outs in \n     77 countries to support the immunization of an additional \n     440,000,000 children and will avert an estimated 6,000,000 \n     deaths in the world's poorest countries;\n       Whereas, in 2013, Gavi was ranked the second most \n     transparent aid program in the Aid Transparency Index, behind \n     only the Millennium Challenge Corporation;\n       Whereas, even with significant contributions by Gavi, only \n     a small percentage of young children worldwide receive all 11 \n     life-saving vaccines universally recommended by the World \n     Health Organization;\n       Whereas vaccines are widely regarded as one of the ``best \n     buys'' in global health and recognized as one of the most \n     efficient, cost-effective, and successful health initiatives \n     in history;\n       Whereas, in 2012, leading experts on health economics \n     ranked childhood immunization as one of the three most cost-\n     effective solutions to advance global health;\n       Whereas, as one of the initial six donors, the United \n     States has been an important supporter of Gavi and through \n     the generosity of the people of the United States has \n     contributed almost $1,200,000,000 for the acquisition of life \n     saving vaccines;\n       Whereas, at Gavi's first pledging conference in June 2011, \n     the United States increased its support and pledged \n     $450,000,000 for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 to increase \n     access to new and underused vaccines, including pneumococcal \n     and rotavirus vaccines;\n       Whereas, in addition to this three-year pledge, the United \n     States contributed an additional $90,000,000 to Gavi in \n     fiscal year 2011;\n       Whereas United States investment in Gavi complements and \n     enhances the effectiveness of other bilateral and \n     multilateral United States investments in global health, \n     particularly in child survival;\n       Whereas Gavi is committed to working with partners, \n     including United States bilateral programs run by the United \n     States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to ensure \n     children in developing nations have access to vaccines and \n     immunizations;\n       Whereas, in June 2012, the United States Government, \n     together with the Governments of Ethiopia and India as well \n     as UNICEF, mobilized the world around the goal of ending \n     preventable child deaths by 2035;\n       Whereas access to immunizations is a key component of \n     reaching that goal;\n       Whereas, in May 2014, at the World Economic Forum meeting \n     in Abuja, Nigeria, African leaders pledged to increase \n     investment in their countries' immunization programs by \n     endorsing the Immunise Africa 2020 leaders declaration;\n       Whereas, on May 20, 2014, Gavi called on donors to support \n     an ambitious plan to immunize an additional 300,000,000 \n     children against potentially fatal diseases and save an \n     additional 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 lives between 2016 and \n     2020;\n       Whereas Gavi needs donors to invest an additional \n     $7,500,000,000 to support immunization programs in developing \n     countries from 2016 to 2020;\n       Whereas, at the same time, implementing countries are \n     expected to co-finance an additional $1,200,000,000, an \n     increase from almost $500,000,000 in 2011 through 2015; and\n       Whereas, with this support from donors and the global \n     vaccine community, Gavi can reach its 1,000,000,000th child \n     with critical vaccines by the early 2020s, nearly double the \n     number of lives saved since its founding, and unlock between \n     $80,000,000,000 and $100,000,000,000 in economic benefits \n     through health care savings and productivity gains: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, the Bill & Melinda \n     Gates Foundation, the United Nations Children's Emergency \n     Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization, the World Bank, \n     civil society, the private sector, faith-based organizations, \n     the international community, and implementing countries on \n     the progress that has been made on reducing child mortality \n     through the increased availability and distribution of \n     vaccines;\n       (2) affirms the continued support of the people and \n     Government of the United States for the purchase of vaccines \n     for the world's poorest countries through Gavi as a cost-\n     effective, efficient means to reduce child mortality and as a \n     critical component of meeting the United States goal to end \n     preventable maternal and child deaths;\n       (3) supports the ideals and goals of Gavi to--\n       (A) accelerate equitable uptake and coverage of vaccines;\n       (B) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of \n     immunization delivery;\n       (C) improve sustainability of national immunization \n     programs; and\n       (D) shape markets for vaccines and other immunization \n     products;\n       (4) upholds that the United States is a critical donor in \n     its work with other donors to perform diplomatic outreach in \n     seeking additional funding for Gavi in order to leverage its \n     commitment;\n       (5) recognizes that the United States, in addition to being \n     an important donor, is a critical technical partner to Gavi, \n     and the impact of United States investments to Gavi\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\n     is leveraged by providing direct technical assistance to \n     implementing countries and global bodies;\n       (6) encourages the continued use of United States Agency \n     for International Development (USAID) maternal and child \n     health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n     global immunization resources to strengthen local public \n     health capacity to introduce and sustain new and \n     underutilized vaccines, that are supported by Gavi, through \n     routine immunization systems; and\n       (7) encourages continued commitment and investment by the \n     United States Government and international donors, through \n     Gavi, to the global effort to ensure that children in \n     developing nations have access to vaccines and immunizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url":
