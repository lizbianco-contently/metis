Mr. President, on the anti-gun violence legislation before \nthe Senate, we are making good progress in the effort to schedule a \nseries of votes on amendments.\n  I have had constructive conversations with my Republican counterpart, \nSenator McConnell.\n  The American people deserve to know where we stand on these important \nantiviolence proposals. There are disagreements as to what we should do \nwith gun legislation, if anything, and I understand that. We have \nalready spent a week and a half on this legislation, so it is time to \nbegin processing these amendments.\n  I hope we will be able to reach an agreement earlier rather than \nlater--hopefully, sometime by early afternoon--to hold votes on a \nnumber of amendments, including both Democratic and Republican \namendments.\n  That series of votes would include a number of issues, not the least \nof which is the compromise background check proposal crafted by \nSenators Manchin, Toomey, Kirk, and Schumer. This bipartisan measure \nhas the support of antiviolence advocates and law\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\nenforcement groups as well as second amendment advocates, including the \nsecond largest gun rights group that exists, consisting of more than \n650,000 members.\n  The measure would keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals \nby requiring background checks for private gun sales at gun shows and \nover the Internet.\n  Mr. President, whether you are from a pro-gun State such as Vermont \nor Nevada--even in those States, huge amounts, huge numbers of people \nsupport this legislation. Nationwide, about 90 percent of the people \nsupport this legislation, including 75 percent of NRA members.\n  So I am optimistic and hopeful that cooperation from both sides will \ncontinue and that victims of gun violence will get the debate and votes \nthey deserve, including pro-gun advocates who want votes of their own \nliking.\n  So I hope we can move forward. It would be a shame if we got into a \nprocedural hassle on all this stuff. We want to debate the issues. And \nas I have indicated to the Republican leader, we are not trying to cut \noff amendments. The ones we agree to start debating, that is not a \nlimit as to what we are going to do. I want to have a full, complete \ndebate on guns, and we will carry this on just as long as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2658-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the thoughts of every American \nare with the people of Boston but especially with the many victims of \nyesterday's horrendous attacks and their families.\n  Many who were looking forward to celebrating the achievement of a \nloved one yesterday woke up to the grim reality of facing the rest of \ntheir lives with a disfiguring injury. For them, yesterday's attacks \nwere the beginning of a long and difficult journey. Three others who \nlined up to encourage others, including an 8-year-old boy who was there \nto cheer on his dad at the finish line, lost their lives in the blast.\n  We pray in a special way for these families.\n  As the President said yesterday, the two parties stand united today \nin our deepest sympathy for all those who were affected firsthand by \nthese heinous attacks and in our unshakable--unshakable--resolve to \nbring those responsible, and any others who are contemplating acts like \nthis, to justice.\n  These horrific attacks are a grim reminder of the hatred and contempt \nthat many continue to harbor in their hearts not only for our Nation \nand its freedoms but for innocent human life. On 9/11 we were forever \ndisabused of the notion that attacks like the one that rocked Boston \nyesterday only happen on the field of battle or in distant countries. \nWith the passage of time, however, and the vigilant efforts of our \nmilitary, intelligence, and law enforcement professionals, I think it \nis safe to say for many the complacency that prevailed prior to \nSeptember 11 has actually returned. So we are newly reminded that \nserious threats to our way of life remain.\n  Today, again, we recommit ourselves to the fight against terrorism at \nhome and abroad.\n  Another point: As always, we marvel at the courage and the \nselflessness of those who rushed to the scene after yesterday's blasts. \nIn moments like this, we see the worst of humanity and the best of our \nfellow citizens: whether it was the exhausted marathoners who became \nhelpers and healers the moment they realized what had happened; the \ndoctors and nurses who had expected the usual marathon day uptick in \ncases of dehydration or exhaustion but who spent the rest of their day \nhandling far worse; or the first responders and law enforcement \nofficials who rushed to the scene with total disregard for their own \nsafety, including those who tore down a fence to get to the wounded \nbefore they were even sure the area was safe.\n  We honor all of them today.\n  Those responsible for this act of terror will be brought to justice \nfor their deeds. But today our thoughts are mainly with the victims, \ntheir families, and friends--and all those whose lives have suddenly \nbeen turned upside down by the wicked designs of those responsible. For \nmost of us, it is hard to imagine how anyone could even contemplate \ndoing something like this. But, as always, as a nation, we will face \nthis sad reality head on and show the world that America does not cower \nin the face of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2658-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Baltimore, like many other major cities, \nhas struggled to educate its children. Recent statistics indicate that \nthe number of third graders reading below grade level in Baltimore is \ndouble the State average. This is especially troubling in light of the \nnumerous national studies showing that for every six students who are \nnot reading proficiently by third grade, one will not graduate.\n  Across the United States, research has shown that students in schools \nwith good school libraries learn more, get better grades, and score \nhigher on standardized tests than their peers in schools without \nlibraries.\n  We have a program, the qualified zone academy bonds, that is \navailable to help school districts in areas such as improving their \nlibraries. Since 2001 Baltimore City has used those funds. Recently we \nextended the program through 2013. Academy bonds are important, but \nmuch more needs to be done to help our students.\n  Let me share with my colleagues a wonderful initiative, the Baltimore \nElementary and Middle School Library Project, which is leveraging \nacademy bonds and bringing in additional partners to maximize the \nresources available for hard-pressed schools and students. The Harry \nand Jeanette Weinberg Foundation is spearheading this initiative. The \nWeinberg Foundation is one of the largest private charitable \nfoundations in the United States. The Weinberg Foundation provides \napproximately $100 million each year to nonprofits that provide direct \nservices to low-income and vulnerable individuals and families, \nprimarily in the United States and Israel. Since 1990 the foundation \nhas made grants totaling $1.6 billion--that is billion with a ``b.''\n  The foundation was created by Harry Weinberg. His family emigrated \nfrom Eastern Europe to the United States in 1911. Harry Weinberg began \nhis life in poverty, but he eventually built a transportation empire \nwhich extended into real estate. The fortune Harry Weinberg amassed now \nhas grown to more than $2 billion. These are the assets behind the \nWeinberg Foundation's grant-making.\n  Senator Mikulski and I are very proud that the Weinberg Foundation is \nbased in our Baltimore City. I knew Harry Weinberg. I know the Weinberg \nfamily. I am very fortunate to have that relationship. The foundation \nhas helped so many people, particularly in affordable housing, \nimmigrant services, poverty issues, and humanitarian needs.\n  I would like to acknowledge the role my former State director, Bailey \nFine, has played with the Weinberg Foundation.\n  I could list dozens of major charitable projects and initiatives that \nbear the name of the Weinberg Foundation, including a $10-million grant \nto fund emergency services for Holocaust survivors in North America; a \n$9.6 million commitment to make Maryland a model for care of lower \nincome, older adults; a $3 million investment in affordable housing for \npersons with disabilities, which includes a joint venture with the \nState of Maryland--the\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\nfirst of its kind in the Nation. The Weinberg Foundation also has \nstepped up in times of global crisis, providing millions of dollars of \nrelief grants in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and emergency \nfunding for humanitarian efforts following the Haiti earthquake in 2010 \nand the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.\n  In 2011 the Weinberg Foundation joined forces with a group of \ninnovative and committed individuals to initiate a simple vision: \ntransform Baltimore City school libraries to create larger, lasting \nchange by increasing literacy rates and inspiring students. Words such \nas ``partnership'' and ``collaboration'' are often overused, but these \nconcepts are central to the library project, a real-world demonstration \nof the power of combining resources directed toward a common goal.\n  To date, with the help of more than 30 government, nongovernment, and \ncommunity partners and individuals, many who have traveled to \nWashington today, the library project has gone far beyond a simple \nmakeover by creating completely transformed, well-designed, well-\nequipped spaces that send a simple but powerful message to young \nstudents in Baltimore City: They deserve the best. The Weinberg \nFoundation and its partners believe this manuscript for meaningful \nchange can be applied to any city where people from nonprofits and \npublic and private entities are willing to focus on a plan and then \nroll up their sleeves to make it happen.\n  The first of these refurbished libraries was dedicated in the fall of \n2012. I was privileged to be able to visit and see firsthand how \nimpressive this refurbished library is. Three more are scheduled to \nopen this fall, with a total of 12 planned through 2015. The Weinberg \nFoundation has supported 30 percent of the capital project cost, is \nproviding 4 years of additional staff support and professional \ndevelopment funds for the library. The Weinberg Foundation's support \nalso goes to fund new books, up to 4,000 per space. Overall, the \nfoundation has made a $5 million, 4-year commitment to this initiative, \nand the children of Baltimore will benefit.\n  Each transformed library features thousands of new books and the \nlatest in learning technology, including new computers and e-readers. \nAs you can see from the photo I have brought to the floor, these are \nvery impressive spaces and really go a long way to making them friendly \nplaces for students.\n  In addition to the direct educational benefits of these new spaces, \none of the goals of the library project is to help each transformed \nlibrary become a hub for greater school community. Because the Weinberg \nFoundation wants this project to be a successful model for years to \ncome, it has partnered with the Baltimore Education Research Consortium \nto evaluate the impact of this space within the school community. \nEvaluations are underway at the first three libraries and involve \nstudents, teachers, and community members.\n  In addition to supplying books as part of each renovation, the \nWeinberg Foundation and its partners wanted to do even more to equip \nthese new spaces with the gift and adventure of reading. As part of the \nfirst year of the library project, the foundation launched a huge book \ndrive with more than 40 partners and 100 pickup locations. It was clear \nthat my fellow Marylanders were eager to contribute directly to this \nproject, donating some 13,000 books valued at over $75,000.\n  I share the story with my colleagues and the rest of the country \nbecause, just like a favorite book, it should be shared. The library \nproject goes beyond funding, blueprints, bright new designs, and even \nstate-of-the-art learning technologies. These libraries will improve \nreading and learning opportunities for countless children, helping to \nbreak the grinding cycle of poverty by providing young people with the \nhope and the tools for success in life.\n  As I said, this is a story that needs to be shared. The devoted \nofficers and staff of the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation and \nall the other participants in the library project would welcome the \nopportunity to tell this marvelous tale over and over and see it \nduplicated across the country.\n  Time constraints prevent me from talking about all of the partners in \nthe library project. I mentioned the Federal partners, and I have \nhighlighted the Weinberg Foundation's lead role, but everyone involved \ndeserves recognition and our heartfelt thanks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of the other partners and the \ndescriptions of their contributions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                         Federal/State Funding\n\n       In 2001, Baltimore City Public Schools began applying for \n     Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) funds that are used for \n     the renovation of public school libraries. The QZAB funds \n     renovate the physical space at each location and ensure \n     proper configuration, environmental abatement, quality air \n     control, lighting, and flooring for a few approved libraries \n     each year. To qualify for QZAB funds, the school must be \n     located in either an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community \n     with 35% or more of its students eligible for the free or \n     reduced price meal program.\n       As of 2011, 53 City School libraries have been renovated \n     with $14.2 million in QZAB funds and with more than $2.5 \n     million of donated in-kind volunteer hours. City Schools have \n     also contributed an additional $8.5 million for \n     architectural/mechanical work, construction costs and \n     furniture. The Baltimore Elementary and Middle School Library \n     Project has leveraged these funds and brought in additional \n     partners to maximize additional resources for schools and \n     students.\n\n\n                     Baltimore City Public Schools\n\n       As a partner in the Library Project, the district is \n     providing guidance and academic and facilities support in the \n     creation of new and newly renovated school libraries that \n     will contribute to 21st-century learning and position \n     students for success.\n\n\n                       Annie E.

ABAG \n     will write a Daily Record article, and will be helpful in \n     other ways identified over the life of the initiative.\n\n\n                     Baltimore Community Foundation\n\n       The Baltimore Community Foundation encourages its donors to \n     participate in the Library Project, which fits into BCF's \n     overall vision for successful schools and successful \n     students. The Library Project is a prime example of how a \n     foundation can attract private sector partners to address a \n     public need, inviting businesses and individuals to find ways \n     to join together in promising Baltimore's youth a brighter \n     future.\n\n\n            Baltimore Education Research Constortium (BERC)\n\n       In relation to the Baltimore Library Project, BERC will \n     examine the change experienced at the first three library \n     openings at Moravia Park Elementary, Southwest Baltimore \n     Charter, and Thomas Johnson Elementary/Middle School.\n\n\n                            Baltimore Reads\n\n       Baltimore Reads assures that teachers have classroom \n     libraries and that students receive books that they may take \n     home. The Library Project complements the work of the \n     Baltimore Reads' Book Bank, which collects and redistributes \n     children's books all over the Baltimore region at no cost to \n     recipients.\n\n\n                             Baltimore Sun\n\n       The Baltimore Sun commitment at this time will be to \n     deliver 25 papers each day (M-F) to each of the first six \n     schools.

Volunteers take a free \n     20-hr training course in preparation for tutoring. The \n     program works to achieve the following: (1) Train teachers in \n     Orton-Gillingham, a proven method of teaching reading, \n     writing and spelling; (2) Tutor students that are accepted \n     into our program by providing free tutoring; (3) Provide In-\n     Service Workshops to school staff to help identify potential \n     students.\n\n\n                        Enoch Pratt Free Library\n\n       The Enoch Pratt Free Library will be a major partner in the \n     library project. Each elementary school library will include \n     an ``Enoch Pratt Parent Corner'' with a computer connecting \n     parents to the Enoch Pratt system. In addition, each library \n     will have a permanent loan collection on parenting books and \n     other appropriate adult literature. Enoch Pratt will also \n     provide four Family Reading Circle programs during the school \n     year. This six-week program brings a library professional to \n     the school, with high-quality books and dinner for the group. \n     Enoch Pratt will also provide limited funding for students to \n     take public transportation from their homes or from school to \n     the closest Pratt Library. Finally, Enoch Pratt Free Library \n     will host students from each school for field trips to the \n     central library each year. The estimated value of this \n     partnership is $20,000 per library, or $80,000 for the first \n     four libraries.\n\n\n                    Fund for Educational Excellence\n\n       The Fund for Educational Excellence has worked side by side \n     with Baltimore City Public Schools for over 25 years securing \n     the financial, human, and knowledge resources necessary to \n     support policy and practice resulting in increased student \n     achievement for Baltimore City Public School students.

Mr. President, I rise to perform a solemn duty today, \nwhich is to commemorate the shooting at Virginia Tech of 32 students \nand faculty members who were killed 6 years ago today and many others \nwho were injured:\n  Ross Alameddine, Jamie Bishop, Brian Bluhm, Ryan Clark, Austin \nMichelle Cloyd, Jocelyne Couture-Nowak, Daniel Alejandro Perez Cueva, \nKevin Granata, Matthew Gwaltney, Caitlin Hammaren, Jeremy Herbstritt, \nRachael Elizabeth Hill, Emily Hilscher, Jarrett Lane, Matthew La Porte, \nHenry Lee, Liviu Librescu, G.V. Loganathan, Partahi Mamora Halomoan \nLumbantoruan, Lauren McCain, Daniel O'Neil, Juan Ramon Ortiz-Ortiz, \nMinal Panchal, Erin Peterson, Michael Pohle, Julia Pryde, Mary Karen \nRead, Reema Samaha, Waleed Mohammed Shaalan, Leslie Sherman, Maxine \nTurner, and Nichole White.\n  I read those names to honor those who were killed and had their lives \nsnuffed out on April 16, 2007. I acknowledge also that many students \nand faculty members were injured. We have with us today both family \nmembers of those who are deceased and even some students who were \ninjured. I also honor all in the Hokie, the Virginia Tech community \nthat is very close, that still suffers the wounds from this horrible \nshooting.\n  In the aftermath of the shooting at Virginia Tech 6 years ago today, \nwe learned a lot. We learned that we have\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\nto make fixes to the mental health system: that school security and \nsafety is incredibly important, that alert systems that can notify \npeople when bad things happen are incredibly important. We also learned \na tragic but important lesson; that is, background record checks make \nus safer. The young, troubled individual with no criminal record who \ncommitted those horrible crimes had a long history of mental illness. \nHe had been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous. Because of that \nadjudication, he was not supposed to be able to own or purchase \nweapons, but a flaw in the background record check system kept that \nrecord from being entered into the national database. So when he \ndecided and went to purchase the weapons he used in committing this \nhorrible homicide, he was allowed to purchase them.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, with the strong support \nof the Virginia Tech families, we fixed that problem in the background \nrecord check. As Governor, I worked with my Republican attorney \ngeneral, the current Governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell. We fixed the \nbackground record check system that facilitated this gruesome crime. \nBackground records checks make us safer. The better the system, the \nsafer we are.\n  I later went to my legislature and tried to get them to fix the \nbackground record check in another way--by closing the gun show \nloophole, to require records checks at gun shows. I failed in that \ntask. I not only could not convince my legislature to do it, I could \nnot even convince a single committee to report a bill out to the floor.\n  That is why I am so glad we are debating on the floor meaningful \nfixes to gun violence, including a fix to our background record check \nsystem when it comes to gun shows or online purchases. I look forward \nto the debate, and I look forward to supporting the proposals that have \nbeen advanced by Senators Manchin and Toomey.\n  I read the names, the 32 names of those who were killed. As I \nconclude, I wish to take a couple of minutes to tell the story of one \nof the individuals.\n  I read the name of Liviu Librescu, who was a professor at Virginia \nTech, a professor of engineering. He was teaching a course in Norris \nHall on the day of this horrible tragedy, and as shots rang out, he \nheard the shots. He went to the door, and he barricaded the door with \nhis own body, and on the second floor of Norris Hall, he told his \nstudents to get out of the window and get to the ground and get to \nsafety. He stood there against the door as Seung-Hui Cho, the shooter, \nfired repeated rounds through the door, striking his body many times \nand eventually killing him. But not until the last shot when he was \nkilled did he stop saying to the students: Hurry. You have time. You \ncan get out of the window. And all but one of Liviu Librescu's students \nwere able to get out of the window. One student, Minal Panchal, ended \nup being killed because he bravely waited for the other students to go \nout the window first.\n  What heroism and bravery. Yet the Liviu Librescu story is even more \npowerful than that because Liviu Librescu, the professor, was 76 years \nold--long past retirement age. He had continued to teach because he \nloved teaching.\n  He was born in 1930 in Romania. When the Romanian Government became \nallied with Nazi Germany in 1940, because he was Jewish and his family \nwas Jewish, he was subjected to the persecution Jews in Romania were \nsubjected to, his family was sent into forced labor camps, and Liviu \nLibrescu lived in a crowded ghetto in a Romanian city, being \npersecuted, but he came through the Holocaust as a survivor. Many Jews, \nafter the war, left Romania because of the persecution of Jews, but it \nwas Liviu Librescu's home, and he stayed. He went to a university, and \nhe became a world-renowned aerospace engineer, and he continued to \nteach.\n  But now Romania fell under the influence, as a puppet state, of the \nSoviet Union. He would not pledge allegiance to the Communist Party. He \nwould not relinquish his tie to his Judaic faith. Because of that, he \nbegan to be subjected to persecution for a second time, to be \npersecuted because of his religion, to be denied the ability to publish \narticles or travel to academic conferences. Eventually, he lost his job \nat the university because of his Judaism and because he was unwilling \nto take the oath of allegiance to the Communist Party.\n  He was persona non grata in his home country of Romania. However, \npeople in the outside world who knew of his scholarship never let go, \nand they continued to speak on Liviu Librescu's behalf. He was \neventually allowed, in 1977, to emigrate to Israel.\n  He lived in Israel for 8 years and received a 1-year teaching \nfellowship at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. He came for 1 year and \nnever left. He taught as a popular teacher and researcher in \nBlacksburg, VA, from 1985 until the day he was killed in 2007.\n  This horrible day, April 16, 2007, started as a normal Monday for \nvirtually everyone who ended up sharing the tragic fate. It was not a \nnormal day. It did not start as a normal day for Liviu Librescu. Liviu \nLibrescu, as a proud Jew, observed that day, from sundown on the 15th \nof April, the evening before, until sundown on the 16th of April, as \nYom HaShoah, Holocaust and Heroism Memorial Day.\n  Yom HaShoah, in the Jewish religion since 1953, has been a day \nworldwide where Jews and their allies remember the Holocaust, \nperpetrators, victims, and the bystanders--the bystanders who wouldn't \ndo anything to stop the atrocity.\n  They also remember the heroism of those who fought against the \nHolocaust.\n  As Professor Librescu went to his class on this day, while it was a \nnormal Monday for most, I know he walked into his class thinking about \nYom HaShoah, perpetrators, victims, bystanders, and heroes. He made a \ndecision, in the split second he heard shots being fired, to be a hero \nand to save others' lives.\n  He survived the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany, and anti-\nSemitism in Romania. He survived the persecution perpetrated in his \ncountry by the Soviet Union. However, Liviu Librescu could not survive \nthe epidemic of gun violence in this country, the country which he \nadopted and loved.\n  In conclusion, I would encourage all of us to take a minute, \nSenators, staff, pages, people in the gallery, members of the press, \ntake a moment and ask yourselves would you do what Liviu Librescu did. \nWould you put your body against a door, allow yourself to be shot, and \nencourage others to be safe? Would you do that? Would we do this?\n  As I thought about this question, being honest, I would say I hope I \nwould do that. I pray if it comes to that I would act to protect others \nahead of myself.\n  If I am honest with myself, what I have to say is I don't know \nwhether I would do that. I don't know whether I would be a hero like \nLiviu Librescu. I don't know if I would have the courage to do what \nLiviu Librescu did.\n  The good news for those of us who have the honor and blessing to \nserve in this Chamber is we do not need to put our body in front of \nbullets to keep people safe. We do not need to put our bodies in front \nof bullets to protect kids and protect students. All we need to do is \nhave an infinitesimal portion of the courage Liviu Librescu had and \ncast votes. We need to cast votes on the floor of this body to keep our \ncommunity safer and to keep our children safer.\n  I have heard it said this will be a hard vote. For 20 years there has \nnot been a meaningful discussion of these issues on the floor of the \nSenate because interests are too powerful, the NRA is too powerful. It \nwill be a vote which will be scored, and we need to worry about it. It \nwill take courage. It does not take courage, to any degree, when we \nthink about Liviu Librescu, who saved his students.\n  Last week I met the daughter of Mary Sherlach, who was the guidance \ncounselor in Sandy Hook who ran to save her students and was killed. \nWhen we think about the courage and heroism shown by these individuals, \nwhat we are being asked to do on the floor of this body is the least we \ncan do.\n  It is about heroism. We honor heroes such as Liviu Librescu. The \npeople who put us in office expect us to have at least a small measure \nof courage, a small measure of heroism. We owe it to those students and \nothers who were shot, killed, and wounded at Virginia Tech. We owe it \nto the people who were killed or wounded in Newtown. I would ask all my \ncolleagues to reflect upon\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\nthe example of Professor Librescu and the heroism he showed as we \ndebate what might be a controversial proposal this week.\n  Again, the blessing we have as Senators is that we do not have to \ninterpose our bodies in the way of violence to make a difference and \nmake people safer. It is my wish we do that as we debate and vote in \nthe coming days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me first say I also am on the floor \nbecause today is April 16, the sixth anniversary of the horrible \nshootings at the campus of Virginia Tech. I think every Virginian and \nevery American--I can say Virginians at least--remember when we first \nreceived those news reports of the violence perpetrated by Seung-Hui \nCho.\n  I say to my colleague and friend, the Senator from Virginia, in the \n33 years we have known each other I have valued his friendship and \nappreciate his intellect, grace, and knowledge. There was never a \nmoment I was prouder of then-Governor Tim Kaine than those moments \nafter the tragedy.\n  I don't know if in his comments he noted he had been on a trade \nmission in Asia when these incidents happened. He barely had landed \nwhen he turned around--he and his wife Anne--boarded a plane and came \nback with virtually no rest. As a Governor you bear these \nresponsibilities in remarkable ways when Virginians are hurt, and in \nthose days he spoke for all of us.\n  The words he said at the Virginia Tech campus in the ceremony \nafterward brought together the community and brought together our \nCommonwealth. In many ways he spoke for our whole Nation, as he has so \neloquently spoken this morning. I thank him for what he did as a \nVirginian in those days afterward and thank him for the eloquent \ncomments he made this morning.\n  In the aftermath of the tragedy at Virginia Tech, under the \nleadership of Governor Kaine, Virginia acted. We were within the \nlegislature able to close the legal loophole which allowed Cho, who had \nbeen adjudicated mentally unsound, we closed the loophole so he could \nno longer--or someone who had been adjudicated in such a way--be able \nto purchase firearms. In the aftermath of the tragedy, then-Governor \nKaine appointed a nationally respected commission of experts to \nrecognize what happened and recognize ways we might make all our \ncolleges and universities safer.\n  This leads me to some of my comments this morning. We are about to \ntake on a debate around how we keep America and Americans safer in a \nway that also respects our constitutional amendment of the right to \nkeep and bear arms.\n\n  An underlying amendment of the bill we are about to debate has at \nleast one part of the legislation which is relatively noncontroversial, \na piece of legislation I have been working on for some time. I know \nSenator Kaine has supported this as well. The issue is to look at \ncampus safety. It has been one of the top priorities of those victims \nof the Virginia Tech massacre.\n  Those families who have spoken with me repeatedly, and with Senator \nKaine as well, said let's at least make sure, if a tragic event takes \nplace on a college campus somewhere in America, there are ways we can \nlearn from these tragedies.\n  So the CAMPUS Safety Act, which is embedded in this legislation, will \nbring together research and resources on campus safety to strengthen \ntraining and improve collaboration. Today, campus public safety \nofficers are the only first responders who don't have access to Federal \nsupport to assist in sharing the best practices, relevant research, and \ntraining opportunities.\n  The CAMPUS Safety Act, which received bipartisan support in the \ncommittee markup, seeks to address this by consolidating scattered \nFederal efforts into a national center for campus public safety housed \nwithin the Department of Justice. This Center would not only provide a \none-stop repository of relevant research but also examples of best \npractices. It would have an ability to issue grants to colleges, \nuniversities, and nonprofit organizations to strengthen efforts to help \nmake our campus community safer.\n  This kind of planning and training will help prevent future violence \non our campuses and will help improve responses in the event of another \nhorrific outbreak of violence on our campus or other university. I am \npleased our bipartisan CAMPUS Safety Act is included in the discussions \nwe are having in this body in the coming days and weeks.\n  I wish to take a moment to speak about a specific aspect of this \ndebate which will, I imagine, be coming up for a vote in the next few \ndays. I stand before my colleagues to say a few words in support of the \nManchin-Toomey amendment we will most likely vote on this week. Both \nSenators Manchin and Toomey have shown courage in working together on \nwhat Senator Kaine said is a difficult issue. I support the bipartisan \ncompromise on background checks they proposed.\n  Their amendment will strengthen our background check system, close \nthe gun show loophole, and prohibit the commercial sale of guns to \nthose who are seriously mentally ill or have a criminal record. Let me \nalso say their amendment also contains appropriate exemptions so \nresponsible gun owners will still be allowed to make direct \ntransactions between family and friends to ensure a father or \ngrandfather could pass that shotgun along to their son or daughter.\n  Our shared goal is to ensure we keep guns out of the hands of the \nwrong people while respecting the basic constitutional right to bear \narms. I have been disappointed by some who said somehow this amendment \nwill infringe upon this right. I couldn't disagree more. This has been \na common refrain on both sides of the aisle since we started this \nconversation in December after the tragic events in Newtown.\n  If we are serious about achieving this goal, the Manchin-Toomey \namendment achieves a thoughtful, effective, and balanced approach to \nachieving our background check system. It strengthens the instant check \nsystem of all States to put their information into the NICS, the \nNational Instant Background Check System. One of the outgrowths we saw \nafter the horrible tragedy at Virginia Tech was so many States, while \nthey may have collected this information, didn't even put it into the \nnational database.\n  One other amendment Senator Toomey put forward would establish a \nnational commission on mass violence to study all the causes of mass \nviolence in our country, including school safety, mental health, issues \nabout firearms, and also issues around some of the images all of us and \nour children are exposed to in television and film.\n  This amendment, combined with provisions to prevent gun trafficking \nand our proposal to improve campus safety, represents a reasonable path \nforward. In our efforts to reduce violence--as Senator Kaine has so \neloquently stated--we are trying to ensure we don't have to create the \nkinds of heroes which took place 6 years ago on the campus of Virginia \nTech.\n  Let me also add, as I am sure all my colleagues will express, our \nhearts go out to the families of the victims of the most recent tragedy \nwhich took place in Boston. I think I can relate, as a former resident \nof Boston--and I know Senator Kaine, former Governor Kaine, then-law \nstudent Tim Kaine--he and I first met at a law school in Boston--\nremembering Patriots' Day in Boston, when even if you were not going to \nrun in the marathon, the kind of joy that swept through Boston on \nPatriots' Day. We all know Boston will be back. We all saw those images \nyesterday of the horrific tragedy.\n\n  I talked to a friend whose wife had literally finished the race 4 \nminutes before the bombing took place. If she had finished 4 minutes \nlater, he or his daughter or his wife might have been one of the \nvictims of that tragedy. I know, as a father, I called my daughters \nlast night to try to enforce how much I love them, how valuable life \nis, and how at any moment, whether in a classroom in Virginia Tech or \nrunning the Boston Marathon, life can be snuffed out.\n  I agree with Senator Kaine that in the coming days and weeks, as we \nhave this debate, we are not going to be asked to make acts of courage; \nwe are simply going to be asked to do our job. I believe the Manchin-\nToomey amendment and the CAMPUS Safety Act are part of our role and \nresponsibility in doing our job, and I hope we will be able to act on \nthat matter.\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono).

Madam President, yesterday afternoon we were reminded \nthat America faces determined enemies willing to engage in barbaric \nacts against innocent civilians--men, women, and children. On Patriots' \nDay--a day that has always been a celebration of American heritage and \nAmerican freedom--terrorist bombings took the lives of at least three \npeople standing near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, including \nan 8-year-old boy. His name was Martin Richard. He was watching runners \ncomplete the race alongside his family. His mother and his sister also \nsustained injuries, along with more than 150 other people.\n  We still don't know who is responsible for this terrible atrocity, \nbut we do know the people of Boston responded to this attack with \ncourage and compassion. As the smoke rose, the American people saw \ntheir fellow citizens running toward--not away but toward--the scene of \nthe blast. From the police officers and the first responders who \nsecured the bomb site and loaded the injured into ambulances to the \nmarathon participants who literally ran to hospitals to donate blood, \nto the doctors and other medical professionals who performed emergency \nlifesaving treatments on the victims, to the Boston area residents who \nopened their homes to those who had been left stranded, this attack \nbrought out the very best in our country.\n  In fact, in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, so many people \nrushed to donate blood, the Red Cross literally had to turn them away. \nDr. Richard Wolfe, the head of the emergency medicine department at \nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, called it ``the smoothest sort of \nhandling of mass casualty I've ever seen in my career''--something I \nhope none of us have to see again.\n  This Chamber has spent the last 4 months, and even years before that, \ndebating issues such as taxes, spending, and health care. But the No. 1 \nresponsibility of the Federal Government is to keep the American people \nsafe and secure. Our response to this attack must be firm and \nunequivocal. We must send a clear message that we will never compromise \nour values or our freedom in the face of terrorist violence. We must \nstay on the offensive against the enemies of civilization and remain \nvigilant in our day-to-day lives. The victims of Boston deserve nothing \nless.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 649, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 649) to ensure that all individuals who should \n     be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the \n     national instant criminal background check system and require \n     a background check for every firearm sale, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Manchin amendment No. 715, to protect Second Amendment \n     rights, ensure that all individuals who should be prohibited \n     from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant \n     Criminal Background Check System, and provide a responsible \n     and consistent background check process.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be for debate only.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad we are proceeding on this very \nimportant legislation. The American people might be wondering why the \nSenate has not been voting on any amendments to the pending gun \nlegislation.\n  The Senate voted on Thursday to proceed to the bill. This followed \ncalls that the Senate should debate the bill, and that is why I said I \nam glad we are getting to it. There has been very little debate. The \nPresident has said various proposals deserve a vote. We, on this side \nof the aisle, don't intend to stand in the way of proceeding on those \nvotes, particularly on the amendments. So I hope we are able to vote \nvery soon.\n  Last week Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey unveiled an amendment on \nbackground checks. The media hailed the agreement as a way to pass gun \ncontrol. The majority announced that the Manchin-Toomey amendment would \nbe the first one we vote on. Since we are just starting the debate now, \nobviously we have not voted on the amendment.\n  We have not voted because despite claims from the other side, \nbackground checks are not and never have been the sweet spot of the gun \ncontrol debate. We have not voted on it because supporters don't have \nthe votes to pass it--at least at this point that is the way it appears \nto me--and I think they know it.\n  They don't have the votes even though published reports indicate that \nVice President Biden, the President of the Senate, has been calling \nSenators and asking them to support the Manchin-Toomey bill. They must \nnot be telling him what he wants to hear. They don't have the votes for \nbackground checks even though the Vice President has reportedly stated \nthat the opposition to the proposal comes only from the ``black \nhelicopter'' crowd.\n  Well, it doesn't come from that point.\n  The Manchin-Toomey amendment would impose new obligations on law-\nabiding gun owners. It would do so even though expanding gun background \nchecks would have done nothing to stop Newtown or other mass killings. \nIt would do so even though expanding background checks would do nothing \nto prevent these killings in the future.\n  I often quote the Deputy Director of the National Institute of \nJustice, who recently wrote that background checks could work only if \nthey were universal and were accompanied by gun registration. Of \ncourse, most Members of the Senate oppose gun registration. They know \nwhat has happened historically with gun registration. In other \ncountries it has led to gun confiscation, and Members of the Senate--\nbut more importantly, lots of people appearing at our town meetings--\nfear that could happen and don't want to go down that road.\n  Supporters of the background check amendment claim that it \nstrengthens the rights of gun owners; but, in fact, it does not. The \nfact is the opposite is true. Opposition to the amendment does not come \nfrom the fringe elements of society. In fact, one of the reasons the \nSenate has not voted on the amendment is the widespread opposition to \nthe amendment from many quarters. If only fringe elements had problems \nwith it, we would be voting on this amendment. So keep watching. If we \ndo not vote on the Manchin-Toomey amendment, it means the proponents of \nthat idea know they don't have the votes to pass it. If we turn to \nassault weapons or magazines, then it is clear to all that the majority \nknows it is far from the number of votes they need. I think people are \ngoing to be waiting while they try to pick up the votes that will \nprobably never be there.\n  Meanwhile, on this side of the aisle, our caucus hopes to have their \namendments considered soon and to vote on those amendments. Our \namendments, unlike the Manchin-Toomey amendment, will actually \nstrengthen the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners and \nhelp thwart gun violence by criminals. In fact, there are reports that \nthe other side of the aisle wants to block one of our amendments which \nwould do exactly that.\n  So that is the situation. Maybe there are leaders around here who \nwould dispute me, but that is the way I see it. The majority doesn't \nhave the votes to pass their amendment, so we are not voting. The \nmajority wants to block Republican amendments that they fear would \npass, so we are not voting on the Republican amendments either.\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\n  The Senate voted to proceed to the bill. The Senate voted to have a \ndebate. The Senate was promised an open amendment process which would \nmean we would conduct votes on the various amendments that will be \noffered, but so far that has not happened. I hope it will happen soon, \nso I ask that the audience stay tuned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are debating one of the most important \nbills we have had before the Senate in a long time. The reason we are \ndebating this subject is because of what happened in Newtown, CT, on \nDecember 14, and the gun violence that takes its toll every day in \ncities all across America, including in my home State of Illinois. We \nknow because we read and hear about it in the news and from the \nvictims.\n  At this moment our Nation is saddened by what happened yesterday in \nBoston. We still don't know what the cause of that was or who was \nresponsible for it. I just have to say we are stunned by it.\n  Members of the Senate and I--who have worked on the immigration \nbill--had planned to announce that bill today in a press conference. We \nhave postponed that announcement out of respect to the people who have \nfallen, those who were injured, and their families. It is a moment of \ngrave concern across America which was expressed well by the President \nlast night.\n  We are waiting for the information and details to build a case on \nthose who are responsible. I, for one--and I am sure my colleagues feel \nthe same way--don't want to rush to judgment until we have the facts as \nto the parties responsible. The sadness we feel for the victims and the \nsadness we feel for America--an open and free America where people \nstand on the sidelines cheering marathon runners--is one that is \nprofound in the Senate today.\n  The issue before us now is gun safety. It comes before us because 20 \nbeautiful little first graders were massacred at their grade school--at \nSandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT. Six of their teachers and \nadministrators literally gave their lives in defense of those children. \nThere is not a parent or grandparent alive who doesn't identify with \nthat horrible loss.\n  Last week I met with a group of parents, still grieving, from Sandy \nHook Elementary School who came to Congress to beg us to do something \nto spare future families and future children from this type of \nmassacre. I met with them in the morning. As you can imagine, there was \nnot a dry eye in the room as they showed me the photographs of their \nbeautiful children who are now gone. I commend them for their courage \nand stepping forward.\n  Now the question is whether the Senate has the courage to step \nforward. This is not an easy vote politically. I think we know what is \nat stake. I come from a pretty diverse State. I come from downstate \nIllinois, which is more rural. They have small towns and more gun \nowners than the great city of Chicago.\n  For 14 years, as a Congressman in downstate Illinois, I ran in an \narea where gun issues were very volatile and very important to many \npeople. I took some positions which the gun lobby did not care for, and \nseveral times they decided they would wage a campaign against me when I \nran for reelection. I survived their attacks and eventually was elected \nto the Senate.\n  This is the first meaningful gun safety legislation we have taken up \nsince I was elected to this body over 16 years ago. We are here because \nof what happened in Newtown, CT. There is no question about it.\n  I often remind people that it was a little over 2 years ago that one \nof our own, Gabrielle Giffords, a Congresswoman from Arizona, was at a \ntown meeting when she was gunned down and shot pointblank in the face. \nWe did nothing about it. There were no hearings or changes in the law. \nIt was just another gun statistic to many people.\n  But Newtown touched our hearts: to think that those beautiful little \nchildren could be massacred in their grade school classroom. One child \nwas shot 11 times with a semiautomatic weapon that was firing off \nrounds as fast as this deranged individual could load it.\n  We are here today in the beginning of a debate on this important \nlegislation. What is at stake? Well, this is about background checks. \nHere are the basic questions we need to ask: Do we believe the current \nFederal law, which prohibits a convicted felon, a person who is under \nan order from the court to avoid domestic abuse, a person who has been \njudged mentally incompetent--should they be able to buy a gun in \nAmerica?\n  Now, 90 percent of Americans say that is an easy question, and the \nanswer is, no; they should not be able to buy a gun. In fact, 75 \npercent of gun owners say that.\n  I come from a family of gun owners. They are responsible, law-abiding \ncitizens who would never dream of looking the other way if a convicted \nfelon or mentally deranged person wanted to buy a gun. They store their \nguns safely. They use them in a safe manner, and they represent the \nmajority of gun owners across America.\n  So if this is such an obvious question where 90 percent of Americans \nagree we should not sell guns to those who have been convicted of a \nfelony, for example, why is this being debated? What is the big deal? \nIt comes down to the second part of the question: What would you \nthink--and this Capitol is filled with tourists, many of whom flew on \nairplanes to get here today--if before the plane took off, the flight \nattendant said: Welcome aboard; fasten your seatbelts. We hope everyone \nhas a safe flight. Incidentally, the TSA would like to inform everyone \nthat they have closely checked the passengers onboard the plane to see \nif they are carrying guns or bombs. We are happy to report we have \nchecked 60 percent of them, and they are not carrying guns or bombs. \nHave a nice flight.\n  Sixty percent--does that give anybody refuge, consolation, or peace \nof mind? That is what is going on today with the sale of guns. Up to \nforty percent of firearms sold in America today are not subject to \nbackground checks.\n  What difference does that make? I want to tell the story which goes \nback to a moment in history in my State of Illinois which illustrates \nwhy this is so important. Ricky Byrdsong was the head coach of the \nNorthwestern University men's basketball team back in the 1990s. He was \na great fellow. He was a loving father of three children and a man of \ndeep Christian faith.\n  On July 2, 1999, Coach Byrdsong was walking with two of his children \nthrough his neighborhood in Skokie, IL, a great town. A White \nsupremacist drove up and shot Ricky Byrdsong to death in front of his \nkids. He was 43 years old.\n\n  This gunman ended up going on a shooting spree for days across \nIllinois and Indiana, randomly targeting African Americans, Jews, and \nAsian Americans. In the end, he killed two and wounded nine.\n  Here is the reality. The man who did the shooting never, ever should \nhave owned a gun. He was prohibited by law from buying guns because of \na domestic violence restraining order against him. Before his murderous \nrampage, he tried to buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer in \nPeoria Heights, IL. He was rejected when it was revealed he was \nprohibited from purchasing a gun. But this white supremacist took \nadvantage of a gap in our background check laws that still exists \ntoday. He found an advertisement for guns in the classified ad section \nof a newspaper.\n  A gun trafficker named Donald Fiessinger had been buying guns from a \ndealer--over 72 guns in a 2-year period--then turning around and \nreselling them through classified ads to buyers who wouldn't have to go \nthrough a background check. Ricky Byrdsong's killer bought two handguns \nfrom Fiessinger without a background check. He then used those guns on \na shooting spree and killed Ricky Byrdsong on the streets of Skokie in \nfront of his children.\n  The amendment before us today would make that more difficult, if not \nimpossible. Under the Manchin-Toomey amendment, a background check \nwould be required to sell guns advertised in a newspaper. This would \nhave shut down the opportunity for Ricky Byrdsong's killer to get this \nmurderous weapon. That is one of the issues before us, and it is \ncritically important.\n  Joe Manchin is from West Virginia. Joe Manchin is a conservative \nDemocrat, no question about it; no debate on that issue. Pat Toomey is \none of the\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\nmost conservative Republicans from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nThe two of them came together and said, Let's write something that is \nrespectful of the Second Amendment, respectful of the rights of gun \nowners, but closes the gaps in the law when it comes to background \nchecks. I think they have done a good job. But let me add quickly they \nput some things in this amendment I don't like at all. Let me be \nspecific.\n  The amendment repeals the law that prevents gun dealers from selling \nhandguns to out-of-State buyers, and it expands civil immunity to \nunlicensed gun dealers. I don't want to vote for those two things, but \nthis is the nature of a compromise and this is the nature of the \nSenate. If we are going to pass this, I have to be prepared to take on \nand accept some issues I personally don't agree with because of the \nlarger good. To me, the notion of plugging this 40-percent gap in the \nsale of firearms is so compelling I am prepared to accept parts of this \namendment I don't like. I am never going to get exactly what I want on \nthe floor of the Senate, nor will any Senator, nor should they expect \nto. We have differences of opinion, differences of party, differences \nof philosophy.\n  I commend Senators Manchin and Toomey for stepping up. This wasn't \neasy. They could have stepped back and said, Let somebody else do this. \nThey haven't. I know they have taken some grief over it. The major gun \nlobby organizations oppose this Manchin-Toomey amendment, but we need \nto do this. Would it have saved the lives of those children at Newtown, \nCT? No. This measure would not have, because the guns he used were \npurchased by his mother who could legally purchase the guns. But it \ncould have saved the life of Ricky Byrdsong and it could also save the \nlives of so many others who are being gunned down on the streets \nbecause people are owning and using guns who have no legal right to \nthem. The Manchin-Toomey amendment moves us in the direction of closing \nthat gap in the law.\n  I know the gun lobby opposes this amendment. I don't know what their \nposition is on the underlying bill, but I know that Americans and gun \nowners overwhelmingly support it. So here is the question: Can the \nSenate rise above the political pressure and vote for this measure? We \nneed 60 votes, and it means it has to be bipartisan, not just the \nmajority on this side of the aisle, but a good number on the other \nside.\n  I am encouraged by last week's vote because last week we had a \npreliminary vote, a procedural vote, about whether we were even going \nto debate this issue, and there was a question about it. Before the \nvote came up, 13 Republican Senators, supported by the Republican \nminority leader, sent a public letter saying they were going to oppose \nany effort to even debate the gun issue on the floor of the Senate. It \nlooked pretty bad when the Republican leader took that position. But 16 \nRepublican Senators stepped up and showed, I thought, courage and a \ncommitment to this institution by voting with us to move forward on \nthis debate. I am not assuming their votes on any issues, but I want to \ncommend them in the spirit of this institution which has failed in \nrecent years to accept its mandate and deliberate and vote on the most \nimportant issues of our time. I commend them for remembering that and \nfor committing themselves to at least engaging in this debate on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  What about background checks and the Second Amendment? Well, the gun \nlobby argues that background checks are unconstitutional, even though \nJustice Scalia made it clear in the Heller decision, which was the \ndecision on the Second Amendment that said, basically, the Second \nAmendment is a personal right to bear arms, not the right of a militia, \nwhich had been argued for years. Scalia said in that decision: ``laws \nimposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms'' \nare ``presumptively lawful.'' So there is no doubt, at least in Justice \nScalia's mind or mine, that a background check is consistent with the \nSecond Amendment.\n\n  The gun lobby also argues that background checks are ineffective. We \nhave heard this argument: Well, go ahead and pass all the laws you want \nand all the law-abiding citizens will live by them but the criminals \nwon't. Here is what they failed to note. Nearly 2 million prohibited \npurchasers have been blocked from buying a gun since background checks \nwent into effect. They were so stupid, so careless, they tried to buy a \ngun anyway. They were stopped. The argument, of course, then goes: \nWell, why are there so many gun crimes committed? Well, because they \nget guns through other means which are also addressed by the bill. \nStraw purchases, for example; or through the ads in the newspaper I \nmentioned earlier. And the argument that unless a law is air tight and \nwill stop all gun violence we shouldn't pass it--are we going to use \nthat standard for speeding on highways or for texting on highways? I \ndon't think so. We do our best to set a reasonable standard for the \ngood of this society, understanding there will be those who violate the \nlaw. The same thing holds true for this argument.\n  The gun lobby argues we should not improve background checks until we \nprosecute more cases where buyers fail their background checks. Well, \nwhat of the agency that gathers information for that prosecution--ATF \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives? If we look to \nthat agency, we will note that for years now the gun lobby and the NRA \nhave worked to keep this as a leaderless agency and to make sure it \ndidn't have the power to enforce the laws on the books. They can't have \nit both ways. They can't stop the ATF from its job and then argue they \ndon't prosecute these gun violations seriously.\n  Here is the bottom line: We are going to have votes soon to see where \nMembers of the Senate stand. Are they going to stand with our police \nofficers, religious leaders, teachers, prosecutors, doctors, mayors, \nand the victims of gun violence and their families? Are they going to \nstand with the strong majority of 90 percent of Americans who support \nthese reform proposals to save lives in this country? Or, will they \nstand with the gun lobby that refuses to compromise even when lives \ncould be saved?\n  I know where I am going to stand. I am going to stand with Ricky \nByrdsong's family and his widow Sherialyn. She wrote me earlier this \nyear when I held a hearing on gun violence and this is what she said:\n\n       How a criminal is able to buy a gun with no questions asked \n     is absurd. Something must be done about this.\n\n  An important question from an important person whose life was changed \nforever because we do not have a strong law. I stand with so many other \nfamilies who have suffered tragedy, including those families from \nNewtown who were here last week, as well as the families and the \nvictims in my hometown of East St. Louis, IL, and the city of Chicago I \nam honored to represent. They are sick and tired of the gun lobby that \nputs industry profits before common sense and they are tired of the gun \nlobby having its way in Congress year after deadly year.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with the majority of Americans who \nsupport commonsense reforms for gun safety. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the compromise Manchin-Toomey amendment and the bipartisan \nlegislation on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the period for debate only on \nthe firearms bill, S. 649, be extended until 3:30 p.m. and that I be \nrecognized at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We will continue to work on getting an agreement setting \nforth some initial amendments and votes in relation to the gun safety \nlegislation. The Republican leaders said they needed to have their \ncaucus first. We are hopeful that we will receive a positive response \nto our efforts soon after the two caucus lunches and begin moving \nforward on some initial amendments and votes in relation to gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2666-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, my colleagues, the week is finally here \nwhen we come to the floor to have votes on a piece of legislation we \nhave been waiting on for decades. This Chamber is finally talking about \nwhat we can do to stop the plague of gun violence which has rippled \nthrough every single corner of this country.\n  As I watched these mass shootings play out over the course of the \nlast 10 years--whether it be in Colorado or Arizona or Virginia--we \nthink to ourselves that this is just something we are watching. This is \njust something that has happened somewhere else to someone else. We \nnever think it could happen to us.\n  I will never forget that day I was in Bridgeport, CT, and it was \nright before Christmas. We were getting ready to take a train so I \ncould bring my two little boys, along with my wife, to look at the \npageantry of New York City. That was the day I got the call that there \nhad been a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n  I thought it must have been a mistake. I thought, well, to the extent \nthere is something going on at Sandy Hook Elementary School--this quiet \nhamlet in western Connecticut--it must be some disgruntled employee who \nwalked in and had a grudge.\n  What I learned over the next few minutes during the half-hour drive \nto Newtown made my blood freeze. I learned this was a mass shooting \ninvolving dozens of adults and kids. I realized it was now happening in \nmy neighborhood, in my State, in my town.\n  Unfortunately--as I stood at the firehouse where the community \ngathered that day and all the parents stood waiting for their children \nto come back or not come back from that school--I realized I had way \ntoo many colleagues I could call upon for advice on how, as an elected \nofficial, to deal with a tragedy of this magnitude. I could call my \nfriends in Arizona, I could call my friends in Colorado, or I could \ncall my new colleague, Governor Kaine, from Virginia. There were too \nmany places to turn, and it happened to us in Connecticut in a place we \nnever, ever thought would be subjected to gun violence. We are finally \nat the tipping point on a debate of what we can do. Through all of the \nback and forth this week and last week about whether we would have a \nvote on this floor or would we have to overcome a filibuster, could we \ncome to a compromise on background checks, would we add provisions to \nban high-capacity magazines, underneath it all are these victims. There \nhave been thousands of victims. There were the little girls and boys in \nNewtown, but also 16-, 17-, 31-, and 68-year-olds from across the \ncountry who have been gunned down over the course of the last several \ndecades without this body raising a finger to try to make things \ndifferent. Well, it is time for those victims' stories to be told.\n  As I did last week, I will be on the floor this week so I can share \nthe stories of victims of gun violence. I will tell stories of lives \nwhich were cut way too short because of guns, and, in part, because \nthis body has not been serious enough to stand up and do something \nabout it.\n  I want to start this afternoon's remarks by returning to the place \nwhere it all started for me, and that is Sandy Hook Elementary School. \nThere are 26 stories to tell of the people who lost their lives at that \nschool that day, and I think I have gotten to about 20 or 21 of them. I \nwill talk about the last few stories. It is unbelievable.\n  I have not had a chance to tell the story of Anne Marie Murphy, even \nthough I told the story of what she did that day on the floor at least \nonce. I just shared her story with my Democratic colleagues.\n  Before that fatal day, Anne Marie Murphy was an amazing person. Anne \nMarie was a special education teacher, and she loved her work. She \nsought out working in the area of special education because she knew \nshe had a talent, as so many of her students and the parents who worked \nwith her found out. They knew she had a talent for reaching out and \ntouching little boys' and little girls' lives.\n  In fact, it is not a coincidence that a number of the kids who were \nkilled in Sandy Hook Elementary School that day were kids with autism \nbecause Sandy Hook was known as a school that had a talent for reaching \nout to kids on the autistic spectrum. And Anne Marie was part of that \nstory. She was a special education teacher. She was a mother of four \nwonderful children: Kelly, Colleen, Paige, and Thomas. She grew up in \nKatonah, NY. She graduated from St. Mary's School there before \nattending JFK High School in Somers, NY. Then she got her degree in \nConnecticut at a school that actually was in the process of educating \none of the other teachers who was killed that day, Victoria Soto. \nSouthern Connecticut State University is where she got her degree.\n\n  She was remembered by her friends and family as sweet, happy, \noutgoing, and caring, and all of those characteristics came into play \nthat day. I shared this story with my colleagues last week and then \nbehind closed doors today, but I will share it quickly again.\n  That day, Anne Marie Murphy had in her charge a little boy named \nDylan Hockley. When the bullets started flying, Anne Marie took Dylan \ninto her arms and did her best to comfort him and perhaps shield him. \nWhen the police came into that classroom, that is how they found Dylan \nand Anne Marie--in each other's arms. To the Hockleys, the fact that \nthere was some small measure of love being expressed to Dylan in the \nlast horrible moments gives them some small measure of peace. She died \na hero doing what she did best.\n  Anne Marie had been doing this for awhile, but she had a lot of years \nto give. She was only 52 years old. She could have continued to change \nthe lives of children in need, children with autism, for another 10-\nplus years. Just think of all the lives she could have affected. How \nmany more Dylan Hockleys could she have found and nurtured and helped \nwork through their autism? We will never get to know. She was killed \nthat day.\n  Grace McDonnell's parents are amazing. They have been down here to \nWashington a number of times already. They have led a lot of the debate \nin our communities in Connecticut about what we do to change the issue \nof guns and gun violence. They do so because they lost their daughter \nGrace McDonnell that day.\n  Grace was 7 years old when she died. Grace had asked for a purple \ncake with a turquoise peace sign and polka dots when she turned 7. That \nis what she wanted, I guess, for her birthday, was that purple cake. \nShe loved the color purple and she loved the color pink, as so many of \nthese girls did, and her funeral, which I had the honor of attending, \nwas just buried in pink.\n  Grace loved the beach. One could always find Grace McDonnell on the \nbeach. She loved country music. Taylor Swift and Kenny Chesney were \namongst her favorites. She played soccer. She participated in \ngymnastics. She had a dog, Puddin', that she absolutely adored.\n  She was a very kind, wonderful little girl, so her parents have tried \nto think of the ways, big and small, in which they can try to pass \nalong the kindness their 7-year-old little girl Grace showed for the \nworld. They have done that by trying to explain to this country who she \nis. They have done that by taking all the art she produced--Grace was a \nfantastic artist, and many of us\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nhave pieces of original art that Grace McDonnell did hanging on our \nwalls in our offices or at our homes. But the McDonnells do small \nthings. Following her memorial service, they stopped at a local \nrestaurant and they ordered a cupcake for every patron who came into \nthe establishment that day--white cake, chocolate frosting, pink and \nwhite sprinkles--just to do a small little thing to spread Grace's love \nthroughout this devastated community.\n  Coincidentally, it was after Grace's funeral that I received word \nthat the NRA was going to oppose virtually everything we did. Up until \nthat moment, I had hoped the NRA was going to be a partner with us. I \nremember walking out of Grace McDonnell's funeral--amongst the dozens \nof wakes and funerals I went to over those 2 weeks--and getting a copy \nof the NRA statement handed to me. It was that day that I understood we \nwere in for a fight, one a lot of us who were in the midst of that \ngrief didn't expect we were going to have. We thought Newtown was going \nto bring us all together. Unfortunately, for some, it has not.\n  Allison Wyatt died that day. Allison was 6 years old. Allison was an \noverwhelmingly kind girl.\n  All of these little boys and girls were kind because, frankly, that \nis what most little boys and girls are when they are 6 and 7 years old. \nThey are wonderfully kind. This tragedy kills us inside because we know \nthat 6- and 7-year-olds remind all of us about what we want to be.\n  Allison once gave her snack to a hungry stranger on a plane. She gave \nit away as a simple act of kindness. She had a passion for drawing. She \nwanted to be an artist when she grew up. She would cover the walls of \nher house with her drawings, turning every room in the Wyatts' house \ninto her own little art studio. In fact, just before her death, she had \ndrawn a picture for her teacher Victoria Soto, and she had written on \nthat picture, ``I love you, Love, Allie.'' Both Victoria Soto and her \nstudent Allison Wyatt died that day. Her daycare teacher said of \nAllison that ``she would come and put her head down on your shoulder if \nshe was upset. It would make her feel better. She was just such a sweet \nand caring girl.''\n  Twenty-six teachers and students died that day in Sandy Hook, and we \nwill remember every single one of them. Twenty-eight people died that \nday, and we have to remember that. As much anger and often hatred as we \nhave for the shooter and as much confusion as we have about his mother \nand the questions we ask about why she would give him access to those \nkinds of weapons, knowing how troubled he was--28 people did die that \nday, 26 at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. But here is the thing. \nEvery day more than that die in this country from gun violence. Every \nday, on average, 30 people die from gun violence across this country.\n  I have had this chart up for the last week, and it is hard to read if \nthe viewer is in the gallery or in this Chamber or watching from \nsomewhere else because each one of these little figures represents \nsomeone who has been killed by guns since December 14, 2012. In the now \nalmost 4 months since that day--I think it is over 4 months now--over \n3,400 people have died from guns all across this country.\n  We, as a legislative body, over the past several decades, seem to \nhave become immune to the everyday gun violence that happens. We are \njust sort of used to picking up our local paper and reading about \nanother shooting, reading about another victim, such as those who have \ndied in my State, in New Haven and Hartford and Bridgeport, on a pretty \nregular basis.\n  This debate has to be not just about what we can do to try to lessen \nthe likelihood that anyone has to call me and ask for advice on how \nthey should handle the latest mass shooting in their State or their \ndistrict, but it also has to be an answer to the thousands of people \nwho are losing their lives on the streets of America due to routine, \neveryday gun violence. That is what the compromise that is on the floor \nfor debate right now will do.\n  Since we put into place our background checks law, there have been \nhundreds of thousands of people who have been legally prohibited from \nbuying guns because they were felons or they had been convicted of \ndomestic abuse or they were judged so mentally ill that they shouldn't \nown guns. Hundreds of thousands of people have walked into gun stores \nand have been prevented from buying guns because of our background \ncheck law. The problem is that only about 60 percent of gun sales go \nthrough those background checks, and 90 percent of Americans agree we \nshould apply background checks to as many people as we can to make sure \ncriminals don't have guns. If criminals didn't have guns, I can \nvirtually guarantee my colleagues that this visual would be a little \nless stunning than it is today. It wouldn't erase these figurines. \nBackground checks, if they were universal, wouldn't erase the scourge \nof violence across this country, but it would certainly lessen the \nimpact of this chart.\n\n  So let's talk about some of the victims of urban gun violence--of gun \nviolence in our communities that is a 1-day story in the paper, not the \nmultiday episode a mass shooting may be.\n  We can talk about someone like Kwante Feliciano. Kwante was killed \njust about a month ago in Hartford, CT. The shooting occurred on March \n25. Kwante was shot in the chest, and a companion, 30-year-old Kelly \nCooper, was shot in the head. Both of them were pronounced dead at St. \nFrancis Hospital.\n  Kwante was a product of the Hartford public school system, and he was \ntrying to do better for himself. There are a lot of kids who drop out \nof the Hartford public school system, but Kwante had figured out a way \nto graduate and was also trying to get himself employed in a tough \neconomy. He was attending Lincoln Technical Institute, and he was \nstudying to be an automotive technician at the time of his death. His \nobituary said that he was loved by everybody who came in contact with \nhim and that what defined him to most of his friends and his family was \nhis 100-watt smile.\n  Hartford is a tough place to grow up. There are a lot of kids who \ndon't see a way out of their situation. But this young man did. He had \ngotten his high school diploma. He was trying to do something to make \nhimself better by becoming an automotive technician, and he was shot \ndead in the chest just a few short weeks ago. Kelly, by the way, who \nwas shot with him, leaves behind four children, four brothers, and one \nsister.\n  Kanasha Isaac was 16 years old. She was described by her friends as a \nsocial butterfly. She was full of energy and life. Her family was her \ncenter. Her uncle's home was always the place where her friends and her \nfamily congregated when they were there. Kanasha was the center of all \nof her family's life.\n  After exiting a local restaurant, Kanasha and her boyfriend got into \ntheir car. Another car pulled up beside them, blocked them as they were \ngoing into a parking space, and a man shot at their car. He shot \nKanasha in the face. She died shortly thereafter at 16 years old. This \nwas in Florida on February 24 of this year.\n  Kanasha was going to the local high school. She wasn't the first \nvictim of gun violence in recent months. In December two high school \nclassmates of hers, Coby Deleon and Natalia Trejo, were killed in a \nmurder-suicide. Three students in this one local high school in Florida \nwere killed in about a 2-month, 3-month period of time.\n  Christopher Walker was 19 years old, and he was shot on March 12 of \nthis year in Milton, GA. It was an attempted robbery. He was a \nmarketing student at Georgia Perimeter College, and he had just been \naccepted into Kennesaw State University for the upcoming fall semester. \nThat is a big deal. He had been trying to do right for himself and his \nfamily. He had been studying marketing, and he had just gotten accepted \ninto Kennesaw State University. He was excited about getting into that \nschool. He was already working to pay for his degree. He was a \nsuccessful salesman at a local Sears store, and he was doing all of \nthis with a goal toward the long term. He was a great salesman. He was \nstudying marketing.\n  He was going to get his degree, but he really loved music. His dream \nwas to become a musician. Even as this 19-year-old college student was \nlooking for a job, he was recording as much music as he could, and his \ngoal was to\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\ntake his music and not keep the money he collected from it for himself; \nhe was going to donate it to charity. So he was going to pursue his \ncollege degree, go out and continue to be a salesman, and do music on \nthe side simply to make enough money to give to charity.\n  What an amazing kid, 19 years old. In an attempted robbery on March \n12 of this year, Christopher Walker was shot dead in Milton, GA.\n  Dominique Boyer was 18 when he was shot in Atlanta, GA, on March 28.\n  All of these victims, by the way, are part of this chart. \nUnfortunately, I do not have to go back 6 months or a year or a year \nand a half to find an endless list of victims. We are just talking \nabout March of this year.\n  Dominique was 18 years old and just months away from his high school \ngraduation when he became an unintentional, innocent victim of a \nshooting in DeKalb County, GA. Dominique was a senior at Columbia High \nSchool and he had been planning to go to college to become an \naccountant.\n  His classmates remember him as happy, as outgoing, as a very \nrespectful kid with a lot of friends. He was the oldest of four \nsiblings. He was just months away; he was going to graduate this fall. \nHe was going to go to college, and he was an unintentional, innocent \nvictim of a shooting.\n  We hear this over and over and over. I have read now probably 50- or \n60-plus stories of kids--18, 19 years old--who have been killed. The \nhighest incidence of gun violence occurs to 19-year-olds, I think, \nfollowed by 18-year-olds, followed by 17-year-olds. It is really \nteenagers who are getting killed out there. Unfortunately, in \nConnecticut, it was 6- and 7-year-olds, but kids who are not much older \nthan the kids who died in Sandy Hook are dying every day in this \ncountry from gun violence, and most of them are unintentional, innocent \nvictims. At some level a lot of people want to believe that the people \nwho are killed in urban gun violence are killed in connection with a \ncrime or are wrapped up in gangs. Some of that is true, but the stories \nwe are hearing are of good kids who were doing the right thing; who, as \nthe President has said, were not in the wrong place at the wrong time \nbut were in the right place at the right time.\n  Dominique Boyer was a respectful kid who treated everybody well but \njust happened to be in the way of a bullet that maybe was not \ndesignated for him but should not have been flying through the air in \nthe first place.\n  Hakeem Jackson was 17 years old when he was killed a couple weeks \nbefore Dominique on March 11, 2013, in Knoxville, TN. He was just on a \nweekend visit to Knoxville visiting his family and his grandmother. \nHakeem's mom described him as a quiet and bashful boy but sometimes a \nlittle bit of a prankster.\n  On a Friday night he asked his grandmother for some money. He was 17 \nyears old. He just wanted to go down to the store. While he was walking \ndown a street in a city that was not even his own, a gray sedan pulled \nup and shot Hakeem several times. Those shots eventually killed him. He \nwas 17 years old, just visiting his grandmother in Knoxville, TN.\n  Let me share a couple more stories with you.\n  Kay Cornell Janus was on the other end of life's spectrum. She was 72 \nwhen she was shot just 1 day before Hakeem in Marietta, GA. She was \nknown for her grace and her poise, and, again, as you have heard about \na number of these victims, her radiant smile--something her family and \nfriends remembered about her.\n  She was full of class. She loved fine food and wine and traveling and \nentertaining. Many of these hobbies became, over the course of her \nlife, her passion. She was the mother of four, and she was the \ngrandmother of two.\n  She was shot in her garage by her longtime boyfriend. Neighbors \nsuspect that the murder may have been the result of a simple dispute \nthey were having over finances. It ended in Kay, 72 years old, being \ngunned down.\n  Zachary Rose was killed in January of this year. He was celebrating \nhis 22nd birthday. Two days later, after his 22nd birthday, he was \nkilled. His loves were skateboarding and cars and dogs--dogs at the top \nof his list. He absolutely loved dogs, and he had a Great Dane, \nMathias, that all of his friends said after he was killed was really \n``his baby.''\n  He actually loved dogs so much that he ran his own dog training \ncompany. Zachary's friend dedicated a page of their company's Web site \nto help raise money for Zachary's funeral because his family was going \nthrough very tough times, and when he was killed, leaving behind three \nsiblings--a brother and two sisters--they did not have enough money to \npay for his funeral.\n  His friends said Zachary was the kind of guy who ``literally had no \nenemies''--killed by guns on January 28, 2013.\n  His family did not have the money to pay for his funeral. It is the \nstory of a lot of these families. Families are already going through \ntough times. Luckily, a lot of these communities rally to the victims' \ndefense to raise the money for these funerals. But think about that. \nThink about going through the pain and the grief of losing your child \nor your son or your daughter or your grandson or your sister or your \nbrother, and then looking into your family's accounts and not even \nhaving enough money to bury them. That is the reality of what is \nhappening across this Nation today because it happens too often.\n  There has been another trend in the last several months that has in \nsome ways been even more disturbing than the overall incidence of \n3,000-plus people having died across our country. We have seen a very \ndisturbing trend, in the last several months even, of accidental deaths \nfrom guns. As we have said, there is no one solution to this plague of \ngun violence. It is getting tougher on our gun laws: making sure \ncriminals do not have them who should not, trying to take some of these \ndangerous weapons--the assault weapons and the dangerous high-capacity \nammunition--off the streets, having a better mental health system. But \nit is also about gun safety. It is also about making sure if someone is \ngoing to be a gun owner they be a responsible gun owner, that they put \na lock on their gun and keep it away from children.\n  Over the past several months there have been four absolutely tragic \nshootings involving toddlers.\n  A Tennessee woman was shot in the stomach by her 2-year-old child who \ndiscovered a Glock 9 stored underneath a pillow. The child picked it \nout from under the pillow, discharged the weapon, and shot Rekia Kid \nwhile she was sleeping.\n  Josephine Fanning was shot and killed in Tennessee when a 4-year-old \nboy discharged a handgun owned by Fanning's husband, who had just kept \nthe gun loaded, in his words, ``for just a moment.'' A 4-year-old boy.\n  A 6-year-old boy was accidentally shot and killed by his 4-year-old \nplaymate in a quiet residential New Jersey neighborhood. ``This never \nshould have happened,'' the victim's uncle said. ``It's horrible.''\n  A 3-year-old died recently of an accidental self-inflicted gun wound \nin South Carolina after finding a gun in an apartment and discharging \nthe weapon.\n  A 2-year-old shooting his mother, a 4-year-old shooting an adult, a \n6-year-old getting shot by a 4-year-old, and a 3-year-old shooting \nthemselves--these accidental shootings are likely not going to be \nsolved by a background check law or by a ban on high-capacity \nammunition, but it just speaks to how big this problem is. It speaks to \nhow many guns are out there.\n  It also speaks to the fact that as part of our debate on background \nchecks and on specific weaponry that should be kept in the hands of the \nmilitary, we should be having a conversation about gun safety as well.\n  Lastly, I want to talk about the importance of today.\n  Senator Kaine, I believe, was down on the floor earlier talking about \nthe 6-year anniversary of the worst mass shooting in this country's \nhistory at Virginia Tech. I want to close by just telling a few final \nstories about those victims. I have told some of them when I have been \ndown here before, but that shooting was in some ways just as tragic.\n  In Sandy Hook, we had a little glimpse into who these little boys and \ngirls would be. When we heard these stories about their intellectual \ncuriosity and their kindness and their grace, we had a window into what \namazing people folks such as Dylan Hockley and Grace McDonnell and\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nMadeleine Hsu would eventually grow up to be.\n  In Virginia Tech, though, we had a much better window into these kids \nbecause though they had not reached maturity, they had already \nsucceeded by getting into Virginia Tech, and we could really see the \nkind of contributions they were going to leave.\n  Austin Michelle Cloyd lived life boldly. She had traveled the world \nwith her family. She was interested in everything from politics to \nenvironmental issues to international relations. She was a very tall \ngirl and everybody remembered what Austin looked like because she had \nflaming red hair and a big, bright smile. She played basketball \nthroughout her middle and high school years, and she worked four \nsummers with the Appalachia Service Project to help make homes better \nfor people--to make them warmer and safer and dryer.\n  She loved reading and scuba diving and music and concerts, and she \nwas just a girl who was absolutely full of life. She lived her life for \na purpose. She knew she wanted to help people.\n  She had a brilliant mind and a compassionate heart and she had an \niron will. We will never know what Austin was going to truly grow up to \nbe. She was killed that day at Virginia Tech.\n  Jocelyne Couture-Nowak was a French Canadian who had a passion for \nteaching French. She was a faculty member who was killed that day. \nBefore she moved to Virginia, she was very well known for being \ninstrumental in helping to develop a school to ensure access for \nfrancophone families who wanted a safe school environment and a French \nlanguage education.\n  She went between Nova Scotia and southwest Virginia. She loved the \nbucolic countryside, and she loved to go on hikes, whether it was in \nVirginia or back in Nova Scotia.\n  She was passionate for French education. She was passionate that \nother people would learn the language, and she still had a lot of \npassion to give. But she was killed that day as well.\n  Matthew Gwaltney was a second-year master's student in the Civil and \nEnvironmental Engineering Department. His professional goal was to go \nout and increase awareness and education about environmental issues. He \nwanted to encourage people to be proactive in their individual lives to \ntry to better our environment, whether it was just leaving a smaller \nand more confined footprint on this world or going out and creating \nsystems in their community to lower the impact of pollution.\n  His passion was environmental awareness, but he was also a big fan of \nsports. He was a detailed expert in sports statistics, and you could \nnot beat Matthew in a game of trivia. He loved his Hokies and was a \ndevoted fan, and he went to every ACC sporting event he could. \nProfessionally, he loved the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago White Sox \nand the Chicago Bulls.\n  Matthew was going to lead a great life--one that was lived outwardly. \nBut we never got to see the maturity of his passion for environmental \nawareness, nor his passion for the hobbies he loved because Matthew was \nkilled that day at Virginia Tech.\n  The list just goes on and on and on--3,400 people killed since \nDecember 14. I have in the Chamber just a few of the pictures of the \nyoung men and women who have been killed in Hartford and Bridgeport and \nNew York and Washington and Newtown, CT. It is their memories we will \nhonor this week as we go forward on one of the most important public \nsafety debates this Chamber and this city has ever had.\n  I will be back down to the Senate floor later this week to continue \nto engage my colleagues in talking about the real reason we are here; \nthat is, the victims of gun violence all across this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period for debate \nonly on S. 649 be extended until 5:30 p.m., and that the majority \nleader be recognized at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to begin by saying my thoughts \nand prayers, similar to those of so many Americans, are with Boston \ntoday, with the families and loved ones of those who have lost lives or \nbeen injured. I offer my deepest condolences to the families of those \nvictims and my sincere gratitude to the courageous first responders, \nincluding many of the runners who courageously went to the aid of \npeople who were grievously injured and some maimed by this horrific act \nof terror. Whether we call it a terrorist act or an act of terror or \nsimply a criminal murder, it is certainly to be condemned and \ninvestigated as thoroughly and promptly as possible. I know the full \nresources of the Federal Government have been devoted to this purpose.\n  We are an open society. We appear soft-hearted to people who want to \ndo harm to a democracy. We are vulnerable because we are a democracy \nand we are open. We have resolved that we will not become totalitarian \nor antidemocratic; that we will remain a free and open society. That is \nthe wonder and strength and uniqueness of America, the greatest Nation \nin the history of the world.\n  Horror has brought us to this debate, the horror of gun violence, the \nhorror of what has happened in our schools, our streets, our \nneighborhoods, in places where the public is admitted, indeed welcomed, \nwhether it is movie theaters or places of worship or schools, places \nwhere the public has access and where, therefore, all our citizens, \nmost especially our children, are vulnerable.\n  Last week when we opened this debate we spent a lot of time talking \nabout victims. Senator Murphy and I spent a lot of time on the Senate \nfloor discussing Newtown and the victims of that unspeakable and \nunimaginable tragedy. Today we remember another similar tragedy, \nfacilitated by the same extraordinarily dangerous weapons in the hands \nof people who should not be permitted to have firearms or guns. Six \nyears ago today, Seung-Hui Cho used two semiautomatic handguns and nine \n10- and 15-round magazines to kill 32 innocent victims and injure 23 at \nVirginia Tech University. Many of those weapons he used were purchased \nonline. Others were purchased at local stores without a background \ncheck.\n  As somebody who has seen my own State grapple with this tragedy, I \nextend my condolences to the families of Virginia Tech victims--some of \ntheir families were here earlier today--and all who have felt the \nimpact of this absolutely senseless slaughter, as senseless and \nunspeakable as what happened in Newtown just 4 months ago.\n  I wish to recognize the leadership of our two Senators from Virginia \nand their efforts to prevent another Virginia Tech. As he discussed \nearlier, Senator Warner has been actively engaged in efforts to bring \nresearch and resources together to make our schools and campuses safer. \nHis leadership has been extremely important. Colleges and universities \nplay an extraordinarily important role in my own State of Connecticut. \nI know they are constantly working to keep their campuses safe. The \nSchool and Campus Safety Enhancements Act included in the gun violence \nlegislation currently before this body would be an important step \ntoward giving these very institutions of higher learning what they need \nto protect our students and support the kind of research that is \nnecessary to develop new means and possibly new technology, new tools \nthat our institutions of higher learning but also institutions of \nlearning across-the-board, beginning with our elementary schools, need \nto do better.\n  I am proud to be cosponsor of this legislation. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure its passage. Senator Kaine spoke \nso powerfully and eloquently on the floor earlier today, showed such \ngrace under pressure--which is one of the definitions of courage--in \nresponding to the Virginia Tech tragedy. He has worked to deal with the \nwounds. He has resolved to learn from Virginia Tech and indeed he \nworked as a Governor to seek safer campuses across Virginia and across \nthe country. He fought to put in place commonsense laws that would \nprevent shooters such as Seung-Hui Cho from having access to the \narsenal\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nhe used 6 years ago. I thank Senator Kaine for helping to lead the \neffort for a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines such as the ones \nused at Virginia Tech and used at Newtown and used in so many other \nshootings across the country over the years. With his support, I plan \nto offer a high-capacity magazine ban, on behalf of Senator Lautenberg, \nin an amendment to the gun violence legislation currently before the \nSenate.\n  I am proud to be working with others, such as Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Schumer, and my colleague Senator Murphy, in that effort. I \nencourage my colleagues to work with me and Senator Kaine to pass \ncommonsense legislation as we mark the tragedy at Virginia Tech and we \nremember the victims of Newtown.\n  I thank the families of the victims of these shootings from all \nacross the country who have come to Washington over these past days, \nand indeed weeks, working so hard and so diligently, working through \ntheir grief and pain, doing something that is so difficult for them so \nothers can be spared this pain and grief.\n  Many will face difficult votes, perhaps as early as tomorrow. We have \napproached the cusp of these vital and historic votes. Many of these \nvotes will be difficult for my colleagues. But as difficult as they are \nfor them--and for many whose difficulty I respect--let's remember how \ndifficult it has been for those families of the victims to come here to \nlook you in the eye as they have done and say: Let's now do something \nabout gun violence. That is what I heard in the wake of Newtown, as \nearly as the evening that horrific tragedy occurred. Let's do something \nabout the guns.\n  We have the opportunity to do something about the guns. As Gabby \nGiffords said to the Judiciary Committee just weeks ago: Be bold. Be \ncourageous. America is counting on you.\n  That is her urging to us. That is our obligation and our historic \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2670-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BARONESS MARGARET THATCHER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the resolution that is at the desk \nhonoring the life, legacy, and example of British Prime Minister \nBaroness Margaret Thatcher.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 98) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have just agreed to a resolution \nhonoring the late Margaret Thatcher before her funeral tomorrow. It is \nour intention for that resolution to be a statement equal to her \nlegacy. Her work with Ronald Reagan reinvigorated the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization.\n  Margaret Thatcher was one of the most influential and revolutionary \nfigures of the 20th century, and failing to name her achievements would \ndo her memory and legacy a great disservice. It would be unheard of to \ncommemorate Churchill, for example, and ignore his heroic role in \nsteering his countrymen through the Battle of Britain, nor would we \nthink of honoring Lincoln without mentioning the Civil War. Doing the \nright thing when it is not easy or popular is what defines leadership, \nand it defined Margaret Thatcher. It is fitting that the Senate honored \nher legacy just a few moments ago.\n  Margaret Thatcher didn't just change a country or give people hope, \nshe helped alter the course of history. It is true that she did not \njust go along to get along. Had she done so, I am sure we would have \nlong since forgotten her.\n  Let's honor her for all she did. Let's acknowledge the enormity of \nwhat she accomplished. Let's mention her achievements by name, and the \nresolution does that. As I said, we owe Margaret Thatcher a tribute \nequal to her legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2670-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2670-S2676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SAFE COMMUNITIES, SAFE SCHOOLS ACT OF 2013--Continued\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today as a mother, a grandmother, \nand a Senator--a Senator whose State has been touched far too many \ntimes by gun violence, including mass shootings. I also wish to \nreiterate my support for the people of Boston who are dealing with the \naftermath of senseless, tragic, and cowardly violence.\n  I think I need to put into context why I have for so long been an \nadvocate of gun safety measures. In January 1989, a gunman stepped onto \nthe grounds of Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, CA. He fired at \nleast 106 bullets from an AK-47 rifle across the schoolyard. He killed \n5 children, ages 6 to 9, and 1 teacher, and he injured 29 other \nstudents before fatally shooting himself. This horrific crime led \nCalifornia to enact an assault weapons ban and, of course, we know that \nassault weapons ban in California is still in place. I so appreciate \nSenator Feinstein's leadership in trying to, once again, authorize at \nthe Federal level an assault weapons ban.\n  Californians still remember this tragedy in Stockton, just as the \nNation will always remember the victims of the horrific events of \nFriday, December 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n  I flash forward to from 1989 and the Stockton tragedy to a law office \nin San Francisco in 1993, where a crazed gunman--I remember his name, \nbut I will not say it--with an assault weapon killed eight people and \nwounded six. One of those people was a brave lawyer who threw his body \nover the body of his wife, sacrificing his own life to save hers. That \nyoung man was one of my son's best friends, and I know personally how \nthese horrific and senseless tragedies live on with the survivors--the \nparents, the spouses, the children, the families, and the friends. It \nchanges their lives and it pierces their hearts forever.\n  I have told you a couple of stories about California. But let me say \nthis: Let's look at what has happened across this Nation since Sandy \nHook. In the 120 days since Sandy Hook, more than 2,200 Americans have \nbeen killed by gun violence. Hardly any place was spared.\n  We know there are many, many firearms in America. There are 300 \nmillion firearms in the United States. If you were to divide that up, \nthat would be one gun per person, of course. There are many people who \nhave many, many guns.\n  This is a 50-percent increase--the number of guns in circulation--\nsince 1995, when there were, as I say, about half that number.\n  When I go home and I speak about this--and I write about it--I say: \nThere are 31,000 reasons why we need to pass sensible gun laws \nbecause--31,000--that is the number of people who die every year in \nAmerica from gun violence. That is 87 people every single day, on \naverage.\n  You look at this: 31,000 people dying every year from gun violence. \nSo how do you get a sense of what that is? I think back. One of the \nreasons I got into politics in the first place was the war in Vietnam \nand trying to end it, first as an activist and then, actually, as an \nelected leader in my country. I think about how many people died in the \n10-year war of Vietnam and it was\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\na little bit more than 50,000 in that 10-year period and it turned our \ncountry upside down--upside down. I can tell you, I lived through it: \ngeneration against generation. It was a very tough time in this Nation. \nPeople lost faith in the country. It was tough.\n  Yet we have 31,000 people killed every year in America from gun \nviolence, and it is something where we all kind of just say: OK, that \nis terrible, but we do not do anything about it. But we are about to do \nsomething about it that is very important. It may not be everything I \nwould want to do, given my history on this issue, but I will say, if we \ncan move forward with sensible background checks--and I thank Senators \nManchin and Toomey so much, so much, for their work--and if we can do \nsomething about straw purchasers, and if we can do something about \nmaking our schools safer--which I am pleased to say I wrote the \nlegislation that is in the underlying bill before us--if we can do a \nfew of these things, it would be a big step forward.\n  Do I want to see more done? Yes. Do I want to see the ban on assault \nweapons reinstated? I do. But I do feel we are at a point in time where \nwe may be able to get something done that matters.\n  I think we ought to look at mass shootings in the last 30 years. \nFirst of all, 40 percent of mass shootings have occurred since 2006. So \nif you go back 30 years, you see 40 percent took place since 2006.\n  According to the Washington Post, in 2012 alone, 175 people were \nkilled or wounded from mass shootings. People who should not get these \nweapons are getting these weapons. People with severe mental illness \nare getting these weapons. We know that.\n  Today, we got to see in the Democratic Caucus lunch a heroine, \nsomeone who is unbelievable, Gabby Giffords, struggle with each step, \nwith every word. Why? What did she do? She held a townhall meeting so \nshe could bring government to her people in the most personal of ways. \nAnd someone who was very sick got access to weapons, and the rest we \nknow.\n  In the name of those who were lost, Gabby Giffords and her husband \nMark Kelly have been truthtellers. These people--Mark and Gabby--are \ngun owners, proud gun owners. They are not coming from a different \nplace. Yet they are standing for sensible gun laws. I am so grateful to \nthem for dedicating their lives to this, and I am so grateful to the \nparents of the children and all the victims at Sandy Hook for putting a \nhuman face on these numbers.\n  Madam President, 175--what does that mean? If you saw the faces you \nwould know what it means. And sometimes the wounds, as we see with \nGabby, are so hard to deal with.\n  We can make it harder for people who are criminals, who have no right \nto have a gun, we can make it harder for them by making sure they have \nto undergo a background check.\n  Today, I learned from Mark Kelly that we, through the background \nchecks that we already have--that is when people go to a regular retail \nstore--we have stopped well over a million gun sales, well over. Yet we \ndo not have that same system in place for gun shows or private sales.\n  So Joe Manchin and Senator Toomey have been working together, and \nthey have crafted a way to move toward a sensible background check--\nyes, protecting family members who want to give a gun to the next, but \nthey have preserved, the most important part of their bill, which is to \nsimply make a uniform standard for a gun sale wherever you purchase \nyour gun.\n\n  Some of the strongest proponents of this are people who run retail \nstores who go through the laborious situation--although it is pretty \nquick now--of doing a background check. Yet somebody can go across the \nstreet to a gun show and make a deal and never be asked, and they could \nbe a criminal, they could be mentally unbalanced, they could be a \nterrorist, OK, and still get a gun.\n  I want to look at the issue of school shootings in America. The \ntragedy that took place at Sandy Hook is a tragedy that far too many of \nour Nation's communities have faced in recent years.\n  I have in the Chamber a chart that shows that since the year of \nColumbine, 262 students, teachers, and others have been killed or \nwounded in K-12 school shootings. People go to school. It is supposed \nto be a protected zone. Who thinks about this? Look how many people \nsince Columbine. And we swore we would never allow that to happen \nagain. It is happening. So we have to do more.\n  I tell you, this is just K-12. But if you look at America's colleges \nand universities, in my own State, at California's Oikos University, in \n2012--it is in Oakland--a former student returned to the campus and \nkilled seven people and injured three. We have these horrible violent \nincidents at colleges and universities.\n  School shootings are on the rise in America. I am telling you. I have \nthe numbers to show it on this chart. Divided up by decades, we go \nback. From 1979 to 1988--this is the number of incidents at schools; \nnot the people killed, but the number of school shootings--there were \n27. This is just for K-12. This does not include the universities. So \nfor K-12, from 1979 to 1988, 27 incidents; from 1989 to 1998, 55 \nincidents; from 1999 to 2008, 66 incidents.\n  This is a number we do not want to keep going up. In so many of these \ncases it could have been prevented. I am not saying every case, but \ncertainly in some cases. If we were able to do something about the \nmagazine capacity here, that would have a big impact on the numbers as \nwell. So we are moving up, and that is not a good number.\n  The parents of the fallen children at Sandy Hook and Oikos in my home \nState have joined countless other parents who have lost their children \nin violent assaults on our Nation's schools and colleges. They have \njoined with parents of Colorado's Columbine High School, California's \nSantana High School, Minnesota's Red Lake Senior High School, West \nNickel Mines School in Pennsylvania, Virginia Tech, and so many others.\n  The shooting at Sandy Hook is another reminder that we have failed \nour children. I do not know how to put it another way. I am so sad \nabout it. This topic is so heavy in my heart because I know we can do \nsome things to change it. I believe we are on the brink of doing some \nthings--not enough in my view but some things to change it.\n  I could tell you, Madam President--because the Presiding Officer was \nthere today--we had quite a caucus today. Our colleagues who stood up, \nwho have seen these tragedies in their States, were beyond eloquent. \nOur colleagues--who are trying to do something that, yes, may be \npolitically difficult--are showing courage.\n  It is one of those moments when you say: I am blessed to be here, and \nI can do something about this. I think more and more of our colleagues \nare beginning to realize this, as they meet with the parents and they \nmeet with colleagues and they sit down one-on-one.\n  We have to keep our children safe.\n  One of the pieces of legislation that is less controversial that is \nincluded in the base bill before us is the School and Campus Safety \nEnhancements Act that I have authored with Senator Collins, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Kirk to help secure our Nation's schools.\n  For years, we had the very successful Secure Our Schools program. \nBasically, we build from that program and we make some changes to it \nthat I think will make it better.\n  I want to explain the way it would work. What we say is, if a local \nentity--and this could be a police department; it could be school \ndistricts--if they feel they want to secure their schools, they will \nhave to put some funds on the line, about 50 percent of the funding. \nBut we would supplement that funding by 50 percent. We would help to \npay for security-related capital improvements at the school plant.\n  A lot of our schools are old. When they were built, no one thought 5 \nseconds about some of these issues. Classroom locks, lighting, fencing, \nreinforced doors, security assessments, training for students and \nteachers and administrators, coordination with local law enforcement--\nthere are so many things we can do. But we know our school districts \nand our local police departments are stretched right now.\n  We want to help them pay for some of these things--perimeter fencing, \nfor example, and cameras. You could see someone coming onto the campus \nand take action to either alert your school officers who may be there \nor your local police department to prepare.\n  We have had a similar program in place since 2002, but the \nauthorization\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\nexpired in 2009. In the past, 5,500 schools have received these funds, \nbut the funds were not even sufficient. Fifty-four percent of the \nentities that applied for these grants were turned away. So we know \nthis is a program the schools like because they took advantage of it. \nBut we ran out of funds. We want to make sure we reauthorize this. In \nthe past, programs such as the one in the bill passed with a 307-to-1 \nvote in the House and the Senate 95 to 0.\n  What we do is reauthorize the Safety in Schools Program for 10 years. \nWe increase the authorization to $40 million a year. We allow more \nflexibility. We do not say what they have to use it for. By the way, \nthey do not use it for more cops in schools. That is another issue. It \nis not in this particular piece. It is something I care about and want \nto work on. It is not in this bill.\n  What is in this bill is making capital improvements to the \nfacilities. It is not a one-size-fits-all. Some people do not need a \nfence or a camera or a door. We leave it up to the schools. \nFlexibility. We also do something Senator Warner truly wanted. We \ncreate a Department of Justice and Department of Education task force \nto develop advisory school safety guidelines. We include language from \nSenator Grassley to ensure adequate grant accountability. Senator \nWarner and Senator Kirk also wanted to create a National Center for \nCampus Public Safety, which will serve as a clearinghouse for \neducation, training, and best practices. Here is the thing. Some of our \ncampuses know how to do this and others do not. So we want to make sure \nthere is a central place one can find out the best practices.\n  I was going to go through, in closing, some of the ways these funds \nwere actually used on the ground before this program expired. In \nSulphur Springs, TX, which is a school district made up of nine \nschools, they wanted to do a safety assessment. They were able to make \nthat safety assessment so they knew what they had to do to make their \nschools safer.\n  When they did their study, they found they needed to replace older \nsecurity equipment and technology, expand restricted access keyway \nsystems, and placed classroom security levers on all doors, which \nallowed teachers to lock doors from the inside. Simple point. You may \nsay: Oh, that is not expensive. Why do you need to spend money? It sure \nadds up when you truly want to secure a door and want to do it right. \nSo if you have many doors, we can help them do these things. If they \nwanted to make sure they hardened their facility, that is what the \nmoney is for.\n  There is a township in New Jersey that used funds to secure perimeter \nand playground areas by installing security gates at elementary and \nintermediate schools to create a safer learning environment. The new \nexterior fences defined school boundaries, making the school grounds \nsafer for students. Interior gates were placed at schools, providing \nthe ability to lock off specific areas of the schools during \nemergencies.\n  Again, it is common sense. But when these schools were built, no one \nthought about this. Everything was open. It is similar to the Capitol \nwhen I came here. I am dating myself. A long time ago, you could go \nanywhere--no metal detectors, no fences, walk up the steps to the \nCapitol. We have lost a lot of that freedom. Our world is now to \nbalance our freedom in the greatest country in the world with security. \nThat is what we are trying to do with this.\n  In Minnesota, we saw grants used to conduct security assessments and \ninstitute safety training classes. In Palmer High School in Colorado, \nthey implemented a new surveillance, lockdown, and evacuation \nprocedure. They doubled the number of doors that are operated by \nsecurity cards, so it reduced the number of outside individuals able to \ngain building entry. It makes it harder for people to get in. It might \nbe annoying for some parents, but I think right now people realize this \nis what is needed. It is this balance.\n  In Florida, in Leon County, which is responsible for 50 schools, they \nhad no central point of contact to coordinate communication across all \nschool facilities. So they set up, with the funds from this program, a \n24-hour emergency operations center which has significantly reduced \nemergency response time. There is one point of contact.\n  So what we have done in this bill is not a one-size-fits-all. We do \nnot say in here: You have to do 10 things. We say: You come up with the \nplan. You send it to the Department of Justice. They look at the plan. \nThey work with you to make it good. If they think it is worthwhile, we \nwill fund it 50 percent.\n  My final point. I want to show who supports school safety provisions \nin the bill: Fraternal Order of Police, Security Industry Association, \nNational Sheriff's Association, National Association of School Resource \nOfficers, International Association of Campus Law Enforcement \nAdministrators.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n              Law Enforcement and Security Industry Groups\n\n       Fraternal Order of Police, National Sheriffs Association, \n     National Association of School Resource Officers, \n     International Association of Campus Law Enforcement \n     Administrators, International Union of Police Associations, \n     Security Industry Association, Texas State University's \n     Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center \n     (ALERRT).\n\n\n                 Parents, Teachers, and Administrators\n\n       National Parent Teacher Association, National School Board \n     Association, National Education Association, American \n     Association of School Administrators, National Association of \n     Elementary School Principals, National Association of \n     Secondary School Principals, National Rural Education \n     Advocacy Coalition, Association of Educational Service \n     Agencies, National Rural Education Association, Virginia Tech \n     Victims Family Outreach Foundation, American Association of \n     University Women.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have left out PTAs, National School Board Association, \nthe NEA, and so on. We have a long list.\n  Look, we will never be able to stand here and say we have solved \nevery problem. We cannot. But we have to be able to say, we have to be \nable to know we did everything we could to reduce these tragedies. As I \nstand here I think, what will people say who do not vote for this and \nthe next tragedy comes? What will they say? How can they look at their \nkids and their grandkids and say: I did not think it was right.\n  We need to do commonsense things around here, not put ideology ahead \nof practicality. The slaughter of innocents must stop. I am going to \nsupport the Toomey-Manchin amendment. It closes the gun show and \nInternet loophole. It is not the perfect background check I would \nwrite. We know that. But it is good. It is solid. It moves forward. I \nam going to support Senator Leahy--his amendment which will outlaw the \nabusive practice of straw purchasing and gun trafficking. I will \nsupport Senator Feinstein's important amendment on assault weapons, to \nban those weapons. She has worked so hard to make it fair and just and \nright. It would also take high-capacity clips off our streets.\n  Senator Feinstein will have much more to say on assault weapons. I \nwill withhold my remarks on that until that debate. Clearly, we have \nwork to do. Clearly, we all carry from our State and in our hearts \nstories of this violence. Now we have a moment in time where we can \nactually act. I truly appreciate this opportunity.\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 6 p.m. be for debate only; that at 6 p.m. the Senate recess \nsubject to the call of the chair; that when the Senate reconvenes the \nmajority leader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Margaret Thatcher\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise to honor the memory of Margaret\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\nThatcher. When she passed, the United States lost a great ally and the \nworld lost one of the greatest champions of liberty who has ever lived. \nI commend our colleague Senator Mitch McConnell for today offering a \nresolution that was approved by unanimous consent praising Thatcher's \nleadership. I commend all 100 Senators for consenting to and adopting \nthat resolution.\n  I would like to spend a brief amount of time talking about the \nincredible import of Margaret Thatcher's legacy. Margaret Thatcher \nbecame familiar to so many of us in the United States after she started \nwinning elections. We think of her as the scourge of the Socialist \npolicies that threatened to ruin Britain, as the resolute victor of the \nFalklands War, and, of course, as the ideological soulmate of President \nRonald Reagan, who battled the Soviets.\n  I have always been fond of her admonition that conservatives need to \nfirst ``win the argument,'' then we will win the vote; in other words, \nthat we need to effectively communicate our ideas in order to prevail \nin elections, and elections will naturally follow as the consequence of \ndoing so.\n  I would like to talk about her days winning the argument, in \nparticular, her seminal speech on January 19, 1976, entitled ``Britain \nAwake.'' At the time, it seemed to many that the conservative movement \nhad failed. As James Callaghan succeeded Harold Wilson as the Labor \nPrime Minister, the Tories were in apparent disarray.\n  Thatcher had wrested control of the party from former Prime Minister \nEdward Heath. Few gave her a chance at broader electoral success. \nIndeed, she said at the time she did not anticipate a female Prime \nMinister in her lifetime. I would be remiss if I did not note Margaret \nThatcher was Britain's first and, to date, only female Prime Minister.\n  Thatcher was a trailblazer, and her ascension wasn't simply a matter \nof breaking the glass ceiling as much as it was refusing to acknowledge \nits existence.\n  Thatcher made the argument in that 1976 speech. She began by \nobserving:\n\n       The first duty of any Government is to safeguard its people \n     against external aggression. To guarantee the survival of our \n     way of life.\n\n  She then addressed the Soviet menace, noting: ``They put guns before \nbutter, while we put just about everything before guns.'' She bluntly \nand truthfully said the Soviets were ``a failure in human and economic \nterms.''\n  She went on to tell the nation: ``The advance of Communist power \nthreatens our whole way of life.''\n  However, she stated:\n\n       That advance is not irreversible, providing that we take \n     the necessary measures now. But the longer that we go on \n     running down our means of survival, the harder it will be to \n     catch up.\n\n  These comments strikingly were echoed not long after by President \nRonald Reagan, when he spoke so clearly and addressed the Soviet Union \nas an evil empire. He went on to observe that Marxism would end up \ndiscarded on the ash heap of history.\n  At the time Margaret Thatcher's comments and Ronald Reagan's comments \nwere derided by much of the intelligentsia, the media, the academy, and \nby many observers who knew far better than these seemingly naive souls. \nThey were derided when President Reagan was asked: What is your \nphilosophy of the Cold War? He responded: It is very simple. ``We win, \nthey lose.'' This was seen as a simple Manichean view of the world and \nnot realistic. Yet I would suggest their vision ushered in a far safer \nday for humanity.\n  Margaret Thatcher laid out the stark decision before the nation.\n\n       There are moments in our history when we have to make a \n     fundamental choice. This is one such moment--a moment where \n     our choice will determine the life or death of our kind of \n     society--and the future of our children. Let's ensure that \n     our children will have cause to rejoice that we did not \n     forsake their freedom.\n\n  Margaret Thatcher won the argument. She took office during Britain's \n``winter of discontent'' when Britain had double-digit inflation, a top \nincome tax rate of 83 percent, and rising unemployment. She \nrevolutionized the economy with free market ideas in her 10 years of \nservice which ushered in a new decade of prosperity.\n  When she took office, the top income tax rate was 83 percent. It was \ncut to 60 percent and then to 40 percent. The middle tax rate was cut \nto 30 percent, and the lowest tax rate was eliminated altogether.\n  When she took office, the top corporate tax rate was 53 percent. She \ncut it to 35 percent. The top capital gains tax rate was a stifling 75 \npercent. Thatcher cut it to 30 percent. As a result of progrowth \npolicies, unemployment fell from a high of 12 percent early in her \ntenure to 7.5 percent near the end. Public spending as a percentage of \nGDP fell from 45.1 percent of GDP to 39.4 percent of GDP. Inflation \nfell from almost 22 percent in 1979 to a low rate of 2.4 percent in \n1986.\n  Perhaps the most telling tribute to Margaret Thatcher's leadership is \n3 days after she gave her ``Britain Awake'' speech, the heroic fearless \nspeech, she was dubbed ``The Iron Lady'' in the Communist news outlet, \nthe Red Star.\n  When your military enemies are describing you as formidable as ``The \nIron Lady,'' it indicates you are winning the argument, that your \nmessage is being heard.\n  Margaret Thatcher wasn't great just because she gave a good speech. \nShe became great because she explained what was at stake. She \narticulated the meaning of economic freedom, freedom which allowed \nsomeone such as she, a shopkeeper's daughter, to rise to prosperity and \nleadership.\n  She articulated the value of national pride and convinced the public \nof the virtue of standing for freedom and against tyranny and \noppression.\n  As Baroness Margaret Thatcher lays down the tortured freedom she \nspoke of in 1976, we can pay no higher tribute to her than to heed her \narguments which are as valid today as they were then.\n  It is unfortunate news accounts have indicated the U.S. Government \nwill not be sending a member of the current administration to her \nfuneral tomorrow. I hope those news accounts are mistaken.\n  I hope President Obama, Vice President Biden or senior Members of the \nCabinet make the decision to travel to Britain and to honor the \nincredible legacy of Baroness Margaret Thatcher. It was truly a \nprovidential blessing Margaret Thatcher served alongside President \nRonald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. Together, the three of them did \nsomething which previously had been unimaginable.\n  So many had opined the Cold War was unwinnable. We had to accept \ndetente. We had to accept a condition in which the United States would \nconstantly be in military conflict with the Soviet Union and our \nchildren would constantly be in fear of potential catastrophic nuclear \nwar.\n  Yet when Reagan, Thatcher, and Pope John Paul all ascended to \nleadership together, they had the vision to do something very few \nimagined was possible, to win the Cold War without firing a shot.\n  Had that been suggested in the 1970s, this would have been diminished \nas crazy talk. Yet this is precisely what they did. Indeed, I would \nsuggest in modern times there are few, if any, more deserving of the \nNobel Peace Prize than those three leaders whose vision, courage, and \ncollective leadership transformed the global debate and ended the Cold \nWar which jeopardized the very fate of humanity. There have been no \nother leaders in modern time more deserving of recognition of a prize \nsuch as the Nobel Peace Prize than the three leaders who avoided war \nwithout firing a shot.\n  Today, many of us are the children of the generation which fought and \nwon the Cold War. We can gratefully rejoice that Margaret Thatcher and \nRonald Reagan and Pope John Paul II did not forsake our freedom.\n  As the children of those great leaders, it is now incumbent upon us, \nthe next generation, to ensure freedom remains every bit as vital and \nreal, not just for this generation but for our children and their \nchildren's children.\n  Baroness Margaret Thatcher was an extraordinary leader and courageous \nleader, a woman of vision, a woman of principle, and a hero--a hero to \nthe United States and to the world. All of us, in my judgment, are in \nher debt.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me begin by offering my deepest \ncondolences on behalf of all the people of Maryland for the 20 students \nand 6 adults who lost their lives at the hands of a single shooter at \nSandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, on December 14, 2012. Some \nof the victims put themselves in harm's way in order to save the lives \nof children, true heroes.\n  We have an obligation to the Sandy Hook families to seize this \nmoment, set our political fears aside, and act responsibly. America has \nmore than 3,300 victims of gun violence nationwide since the shooting \nat Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT. Each heartbreaking event is \nshocking in its own right but also tears us apart, wondering what could \nwe have done to prevent this from happening.\n  I am proud the Senate has come together to engage in a real debate on \nwhat steps should be taken to minimize the risk of future shootings.\n  The safety of our children and communities should never be put at \nrisk by partisan gridlock. I agree with President Obama. We cannot wait \nfor another tragedy to enact commonsense, reasonable gun safety \nmeasures, especially on weapons of war which have no legitimate \ncivilian use.\n  I am sympathetic to the interests of legitimate hunters and \ncollectors, but we should reinstate the Federal ban on assault weapons. \nWe should also prohibit high-capacity ammunition clips which hold more \nthan 10 rounds at a time. We must take steps together to strengthen our \nmental health system, make our schools safer, crack down on gun \ntraffickers, straw purchasers, and reduce the glorification of violence \nin our culture.\n  The elimination of assault weapons in our community would have \nminimal or no impact on legitimate hunters or legitimate gun owners, \nbut it could save lives. Listen to what law enforcement says. They \ndon't think it is a fair fight when they have to go up against a \ncriminal who has an assault weapon. The criminal has the advantage. We \nshould support law enforcement and get assault weapons off the street.\n  Listen to the accounts of the massacres we have seen when the \nperpetrators had these clips with so many rounds of ammunition. At \nSandy Hook, they went into a classroom and used the number of bullets \nwhich were in that round to massacre children. This was tragic. The \nconsequences could have been different if these large ammunition clips \nwere not available. It could save lives.\n  Dealing with mental health issues, dealing with school safety issues, \ndealing with straw purchase purchases, all that could keep these \nweapons out of the hands of those who should not have these weapons, \nthe types of weapons which caused these massive killings.\n  I support universal background checks for all firearms buyers as \nproposed by Senator Schumer. I congratulate my colleagues, Senators \nManchin and Toomey, for coming to a bipartisan consensus on \nstrengthening the current background check system.\n  The background check proposals for the first time would require \nbackground checks for all gun sales in commercial settings, including \nat gun shows, Internet, and in classified ads. I believe this \nlegislation will keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons, \ndomestic abusers, and seriously mentally ill who have no business \nbuying a gun. Studies have shown nearly half of all current gun sales \nare made by private sellers who are exempt from conducting background \nchecks.\n  It makes no sense that felons, fugitives, and others who are legally \nprohibited from having a gun can so easily use a loophole to buy a gun. \nOnce again, the use of a universal background check will have no impact \non the legitimate needs of people who are entitled to have weapons, but \nit could and would help us keep our communities safe by keeping weapons \nout of the hands of our criminals who have serious mental illness, \ndomestic abusers. We need to stop their ability to easily obtain \nweapons as they do today.\n  This legislation strengthens the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System by incentivizing States to improve their reporting system \nand removing certain barriers to the submission of critical mental \nhealth records.\n  This legislation also makes it easier for Active-Duty military \npersonnel to buy guns in States where they live and are stationed for \nduty. It clarifies people traveling across State lines may carry guns \nwhich are locked and unloaded.\n  It is heartbreaking to listen to stories of innocent lives cut \ncruelly short. The pain and grief of families and friends of these \nstudents and teachers is unimaginable. We know that teachers and the \naides put their lives on the line to try to save children, and that \nfirst responders coming to the scene had the unbelievable task of not \nknowing what they would find. We send our prayers to all, but we have \nto do more than just say words. We are going to be judged by our deeds, \nand we have a chance to take action that will be helpful.\n\n  This is a tragedy beyond words. I think President Obama said it best \nwhen he said that our hearts are broken. Congress needs to come \ntogether and take action to protect the safety of our children. We must \ndo better. There have been too many episodes in which children's lives \nand others have been lost. We must figure out a way to prevent these \ntypes of tragedies.\n  I am pleased the State of Maryland has recently taken action in the \ngeneral assembly session that concluded last week. Governor O'Malley \nrecommended legislation adopted by the Maryland General Assembly that \nbans assault weapons, limits the capacity of magazine clips from 20 to \n10, and increases restrictions on the possession of firearms and \nammunition by convicted criminals and those with mental health \ndisqualifications.\n  The President was correct to take executive action to strengthen and \nenhance our gun safety laws, but now it is time for Congress to act. \nThe victims of gun violence deserve to have Congress take an up-or-down \nvote on these issues.\n  To my colleagues who have reservations about this legislation, let me \ncite the Heller decision. In June 2008 the Supreme Court decided the \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller. The Court held that the Second \nAmendment protects individuals rather than a collective right to \npossess a firearm. The Court also held the Second Amendment right is \nnot unlimited, and it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon \nwhatsoever in any manner and for any purpose. Justice Scalia wrote for \nthe Court in that case, and I am going to quote Justice Scalia:\n\n       . . . nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt \n     on the longstanding prohibitions on the possession of \n     firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding \n     the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools \n     and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and \n     qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n\n  Justice Scalia recognized Congress's right, and I would say \nobligation, to make sure those who are not qualified to own a firearm \ndo not get that firearm. We have an obligation to make sure that \nbackground checks are effective so as to keep out of the hands of \ncriminals and those who have serious mental health issues the \nopportunity to easily obtain a firearm, as they can in many States \ntoday.\n  The legislation pending before the Senate is in full consistency with \nthe Heller decision and the language of Justice Scalia's opinion for \nthe Court. I know we can protect children while still protecting the \nconstitutional rights of legitimate hunters and existing gun owners. We \nshould take that action on behalf of the safety of our communities. It \nis our obligation to act.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are gathered in the Senate in the \nsomber shadow of the events in Boston at the marathon, and I guess I \nwill start by conveying my sympathies to the individuals and their \nfamilies who were killed or hurt in that terrible act. I share the \ndetermination of so many people that our law enforcement folks will \nindeed get to the bottom of this; that they will get the resources they \nneed, and we will have answers\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nand justice for the families who are affected.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  I rise today, though, on the subject I come to the floor every week \nwe are in session to discuss, which is the need for this body to wake \nup to the reality of the clear scientific consensus that human activity \nis driving serious changes in our climate and oceans.\n  For more than two decades the fossil fuel companies and certain \nrightwing extremists have cooked up a well-organized campaign to call \ninto question the scientific evidence of climate change. The paid-for \ndeniers then manufacture an interesting product--they manufacture \nuncertainty--so the polluters who are doing the paying can also keep \npolluting because a sufficient atmosphere of uncertainty has been \ncreated to inhibit progress.\n  This is not a new strategy. We have seen this played before. \nIndustries eager to drown out scientific evidence to maximize profit is \nnot a new story. They questioned the merits of requiring seatbelts in \nautomobiles, they questioned the toxic effects of lead exposure, and \nthey questioned whether tobacco was really bad for people. Well, they \nwere wrong then and they are wrong now about climate.\n  Interestingly, they do not actually care. It is not their purpose to \nbe accurate; they just want to create doubt, to sow enough of a \nquestion to stop progress. So these sophisticated campaigns are \nlaunched to give the public the false impression there actually is a \nreal scientific debate over climate change. In the Senate, regrettably, \nsome of my colleagues even promote this view.\n  But let's be practical. Which is the more likely case: Are a handful \nof nonprofit environmental groups using their limited funding to pay \noff literally hundreds and hundreds of climate scientists in an \ninternationally coordinated hoax to falsify complicated climate \nresearch? Really? Or is it more likely that fossil fuel corporations \nare using a slice of their immense profits to float front groups to \nprotect their immense profits? Well, I think the answer to that \nquestion is obvious just from the logic, but we don't have to apply \nlogic. We can follow the money and look at evidence.\n  According to an analysis by the Checks and Balances Project, a self-\ndescribed pro-clean-energy government and industry watchdog group, from \n2006 to 2010, four sources of fossil fuel money--just four of them--\ncontributed more than $16 million to a group of conservative think \ntanks that go about the business of being publicly critical of climate \nscience and of clean energy. Those four sources are the Charles G. Koch \nFoundation, the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, the Earhart \nFoundation, and oil giant ExxonMobil.\n  On the receiving end is a lengthy roster of well-known and often-\ncited right-ward leaning outfits. We will just talk about the top 10 in \nthis set of remarks. They are the American Enterprise Institute, the \nCato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Heartland \nInstitute, the Heritage Foundation, the Hudson Institute, the Institute \nfor Energy Research, the George C. Marshall Institute, the Manhattan \nInstitute, and the Mercatus Center.\n\n  Who is giving? Well, Charles Koch is the chairman and CEO of Koch \nIndustries and the sixth richest person on the planet. Koch Industries \nis the second largest privately held company in the United States of \nAmerica. Koch companies include the Koch Pipeline Company and Flint \nHills Resources, which operates refineries with a combined crude oil \nprocessing capacity of more than 292 million barrels per year. That \nmuch oil accounts for 126 million metric tons of carbon pollution each \nyear--as much as 35 coal-fired powerplants produce or 26 million cars.\n  So to put it mildly, this fellow has some skin in the game. Between \n2006 and 2010, the Charles G. Koch Foundation gave almost $8 million to \nthink tanks and institutes, including $7.6 million to the Mercatus \nCenter, and $100,000 to the American Enterprise Institute.\n  Charles Koch, along with his brother David, also established the \nClaude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation--those two have the same source--\nand they direct that foundation's giving as well. This foundation \nprovided almost $5 million to climate-denying think tanks and \ninstitutes, including over $1 million to the Cato Institute and more \nthan $2 million to the Heritage Foundation.\n  The Earhart Foundation was started by Henry Boyd Earhart, using funds \nfrom his oil business, White Star Refining Company--now a part of, you \nguessed it, ExxonMobil. The Earhart Foundation has donated almost $1.5 \nmillion to climate denier groups, $370,000 to the American Enterprise \nInstitute, $330,000 to the Cato Institute, and another $195,000 to the \nGeorge C. Marshall Institute.\n  That leaves us, of course, ExxonMobil itself, which is the second \nlargest corporation in the world and often the most profitable. Ranked \nNo. 1 among Fortune 500 companies, its total revenues reached nearly \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in 2012, and their profits were nearly $45 billion. \nExxonMobil produces over 6 million barrels of oil per day at its 36 \nrefineries in 20 countries. So it is the world's largest oil producer. \nFrom 2006 to 2010, the petroleum giant gave institutes more than $2.3 \nmillion: $1.2 million to the American Enterprise Institute, $220,000 to \nthe Heritage Foundation, $160,000 for the Institute for Energy \nResearch, and $115,000 for the Heartland Institute.\n  So what did the Charles G. Koch Foundation and the Claude R. Lambe \nCharitable Foundation and the Earhart Foundation and ExxonMobil get for \nall of that so-called charitable giving? Well, the Checks and Balances \nProject found from 2007 to 2011 the 10 organizations I cited--the top \n10--were quoted or cited or had articles published over 1,000 times--\nover 1,000 times--in 60 mainstream newspapers and print publications, \nand invariably they were promoting fossil fuels, undermining renewable \nenergy, or attacking environmental policies.\n  That is good investing--spend millions of dollars on a handful of \nthink tanks to protect billions of dollars in profits. Really, it is a \n1,000-to-1 return. But here is the problem. The public is unaware of \nthe connection usually. Only a handful of these attacks were \naccompanied by any explanation by the media the fossil fuel industry \nwas involved in them.\n  Here is one prime example: Last summer, when the Navy displayed its \ngreat green fleet, a carrier strike group that runs on a 50-50 blend of \nbiodiesel and petroleum, Institute for Energy Research president Thomas \nKyl wrote a column for U.S. News and World Report calling that \ninitiative ``ridiculous'' and ``a costly and pointless exercise.'' \nNever mind for a moment our defense and intelligence communities have \nrepeatedly warned of the threats posed by climate change to national \nsecurity and international stability and of their own need to secure a \nreliable and secure fuel supply.\n  What is misleading is that the U.S. News and World Report in \npublishing that article attributed the column simply thus, ``Thomas \nPyle is the president of the Institute for Energy Research,'' with no \nmention the Institute for Energy Research is a front for big donors \nsuch as the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation and ExxonMobil.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The problem is that this is one example of a \nmisleading practice that is the norm in the media. More than half of \nthe time, media outlets do nothing more than state the name of the \npublishing organization, such as ``Thomas Pyle and the Institute for \nEnergy Research,'' or they may add a functional description such as \n``think tank'' or ``nonpartisan group.''\n  The instances where the publication described the basic ideology of \nthe group--for example, as a ``free market'' or ``conservative'' think \ntank--amount to less than one-third. In all of the media outlets \nreviewed between 2007 and 2011, the financial ties between the authors \nand the fossil fuel industry were mentioned a mere 6 percent of the \ntime. Ninety-four percent of the time, the fossil fuel industry funders \ngot away with it.\n  This chart shows some of the examples. The Washington Post ignored \nthe financial connection 88 percent of the time, Politico ignored the \nfinancial\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nconnection 95 percent of the time, the Christian Science Monitor \nignored it every time, USA TODAY ignored it 98 percent of the time, and \nthe New York Times ignored it 90 percent of the time. So the scam of \nlaundering money through independent-sounding organizations works. The \nmedia lets it work. The vast majority of scientists agree that global \nwarming is occurring, but a recent Gallup Poll revealed that only 62 \npercent of Americans believe that the vast majority of scientists agree \nthat global warming is occurring.\n  Well over 90 percent of scientists agree that climate change is \nhappening and that humans are the main cause. The only uncertainty is \nabout how bad it is going to be, and the leading research predicts \nwarmer air and seas, rising sea levels, stronger storms, and more \nacidic oceans.\n  Most major players in the private sector actually get it. While the \nbig fossil fuel polluters try to confuse the public in order to boost \ntheir bottom line and prolong their pollution, hundreds of leading \ncorporations understand that climate change ultimately undermines our \nentire economy. Let me mention some of the examples: the Ford Motor \nCompany; Coca-Cola; GE; Walmart; the insurance giant Munich Re; Alcoa, \nthe great aluminum maker; Maersk; Proctor & Gamble; FedEx; and the so-\ncalled BICEP group, which includes eBay, Intel, Starbucks, Adidas, and \nNike.\n  This notion that this is a hoax, that there is doubt, is belied by \nsome of the most respected names in the private sector. Those companies \njoin the National Academies, they join NASA, they join the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense, the Government Accountability Office, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, and, yes, the United States \nConference of Catholic Bishops, as well as a majority of Americans in \nunderstanding that it is time to wake up, to end this faux controversy \nthat has been cooked up by the fossil fuel industry, and to do the work \nin Congress that needs to be done to protect Americans from the harms \nof carbon pollution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2676-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I want to start off by saying I am deeply \nsaddened by the tragedy in Boston. Franni's and my thoughts and prayers \nare with everyone who has been affected.\n  Franni and I went to school in Boston. In fact, we met more than 43 \nyears ago at a freshman mixer in Copley Square, so we know Boston. We \nhave witnessed firsthand the kind of compassion and resilience we have \nseen from Bostonians, and I have faith we will find whoever did this \nand bring that person or those persons to justice.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor today to speak in support of the \ngun violence legislation we are considering. Since the tragedy in \nNewtown, we have been asking ourselves what we should do to address \nthis problem of gun violence in our country.\n  My primary focus in the wake of Newtown has been on mental health. \nImproving the access to mental health care has been one of my top \npriorities since I came to the Senate, and I am glad people are \nbeginning to focus more on the issue. If we are going to make mental \nhealth a part of this, let's make it more than just a talking point. \nLet's make it a true national priority. Let's really do something to \nimprove access to treatment for folks who need it.\n  Since the first day I got here, I have been pushing the \nadministration to issue the final regulations for the Wellstone-\nDomenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which requires \ninsurance plans to cover mental health and addiction services and to do \nso to the same extent they cover medical and surgical services. Five \nyears after that bill was signed into law, at long last the \nadministration has promised to implement it, and to do so by the end of \nthe year. I expect the administration to follow through on that \ncommitment.\n  I have also introduced the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration \nAct to help law enforcement officers respond to mental health crises in \ntheir communities and improve access to mental health treatment for \npeople who end up in the criminal justice system. This is a bipartisan, \nbicameral bill that I have been working on since last year, well before \nthe tragedy in Newtown.\n  In January I introduced the Mental Health in Schools Act which will \nimprove children's access to mental health services. Catching these \nissues at an early age is very important. I met with some mothers from \nthe Mounds View School District in Minnesota about this matter. Their \nchildren's lives, their own lives, and their families' lives were \nchanged for the better because the kids got access to the mental health \ncare they needed at an early age.\n  My bill has 17 cosponsors and key provisions have been included in a \npackage which was recently reported out of the HELP Committee. I look \nforward to considering that legislation on the Senate floor soon. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  These are important measures, but let me be absolutely clear: The \nlast thing we need to do is stigmatize mental illness. I said this many \ntimes before, and I will say it again because it bears repeating, and \nit is very important to me: The vast majority of people with mental \nillness are no more violent than the general population. In fact, they \nare more frequently the victims of violence than others are.\n  There is a very small subset of those with serious mental illnesses \nwho may become more violent if they are not diagnosed and treated, and \nthat is the one place where this issue of mental health intersects with \nthe issue of violence. Improving access to mental health care is all \nabout improving people's lives. It is about helping people with mental \nillness and their families by making them happier and more productive \npeople. However, today we are talking about gun violence prevention \nlegislation.\n  People have strongly held views on both sides--or all sides--of this \nissue. Not only is that true in Minnesota, it is true throughout the \ncountry. Minnesota has a proud tradition, like Indiana, of responsible \ngun ownership.\n  We are home to many sportsmen and sportswomen. Generations of \nMinnesotans have learned to hunt pheasants, deer, and ducks from their \nparents, their grandparents, their aunts and uncles, friends and \nneighbors. We cherish our traditions and our Second Amendment right to \nbear arms for collection, protection, and sport.\n  Minnesota has both urban and rural areas. It is home to moms, dads, \nteachers, law enforcement officers, and health care providers too. We \nhave members of the National Rifle Association and members of the Brady \nCampaign Against Gun Violence.\n  After the shooting at Sandy Hook, I reached out to my constituents. I \ngot on the phone, I traveled across the State, I convened roundtables, \nI talked to hunters, school officials, law enforcement officers, and \nmental health experts. I wanted to hear Minnesotans' ideas, their \nhopes, their concerns, and their thoughts because it was and is \nimportant to me to approach this in a deliberative way.\n  Here is what I took away from these conversations: Minnesotans want \nus to take action to reduce gun violence and make our communities \nsafer, but they want us to do it in a way that honors the Second \nAmendment and respects Minnesota's culture of responsible gun \nownership. There is a balance to be struck there.\n  The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens who \nresponsibly use their guns for recreation and self-protection. Their \nconcern should not be dismissed or trivialized. Their rights should not \nbe undermined because of the horrible acts of just a few. So I suggest \nthat our goal should be to take whatever steps we can to reduce \ngun violence and improve public safety without unduly burdening law-\nabiding, responsible gun owners. I believe that is what the Safe \nCommunities, Safe Schools Act, the Manchin-\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nToomey amendment, and the assault weapons ban do.\n\n  First, we need to improve the Nation's background check system, and \nwe need to strengthen our laws to combat straw purchases and gun \ntrafficking. This was one of the key recommendations I have taken away \nfrom my meeting with law enforcement leaders in Minnesota. I think \nbackground checks are the single most important thing we can do to save \nlives.\n  Today background checks are required only when a gun is sold by a \nfederally licensed dealer. Background checks are used to determine \nwhether a perspective buyer has a felony conviction, is a fugitive from \nthe law, has a restraining order against him, or has a serious mental \nillness. The problem is that people who cannot pass a background check \nsimply go to a gun show or go on the Internet or to the classified ads \nto get a gun instead, and that is exactly what they do.\n  By some estimates about 40 percent of all gun transactions are \nprocessed without a background check. This is like having two lines at \nthe airport: one where people go through the security screening and one \nwhere they don't, and those passengers are the ones who choose which \nline they stand in. Would anyone feel comfortable on a plane if they \nknew that 40 percent of the passengers didn't go through the security \ncheck and they were the ones who chose not to go through the security \ncheck?\n  The Manchin-Toomey amendment will expand background checks to gun \nshows and other congressional transactions. These checks are not an \nundue burden. They can typically be conducted in a matter of minutes \nthrough NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. \nThe amendment excludes certain exchanges, such as when a Minnesotan \nhands his gun down to his son or to her daughter.\n  The Manchin-Toomey amendment fixes another problem. We all know \nbackground checks are only as good as the database they use. The \nproblem is that a lot of States are not submitting court documents and \nother records to NICS. The amendment will provide new incentives and \npenalties to make sure the States do a better job.\n  This law will work. Since we started administering instant background \nchecks more than 1.7 million felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, and \npeople with serious mental illnesses have been denied access to \nfirearms--and that is under the system that exists today with all of \nits loopholes and flaws.\n  We have seen that women are less likely to be killed by an intimate \npartner in States that have expanded their own background check \nsystems. And, look, about 90 percent of Americans want us to pass this \nmeasure--90 percent. This is not a Republican idea, it is not a \nDemocratic idea, it is just a good idea.\n  I think it would be a remarkable failure of our democracy if we \ncannot get this done. If we cannot get this done, I am afraid it is \nbecause we have relied on fears and falsehoods instead of on facts.\n  For instance, some have argued that an expanded background check \nsystem will result in a Federal gun registry, but Federal gun \nregistries are banned under existing law and the legislation we are \nconsidering would not repeal or weaken that. In fact, the Manchin-\nToomey amendment would strengthen the current prohibition on Federal \ngun registries.\n  The other argument we have heard is that we should not bother \nimproving the background check system until we do a better job \nprosecuting those who cheat the background check system under current \nlaw. There is really no reason we cannot do both, enforce and improve \nthe law. In fact, that is exactly what the legislation does.\n  This legislation expands the background check system and strengthens \nthe penalties for straw purchasers and gun traffickers. So I strongly \nsupport these proposed improvements to the background check system and \nto our gun trafficking laws.\n  The Judiciary Committee also reported Senator Feinstein's assault \nweapons ban to the Senate floor. The bill would ban the future \nmanufacture of large-capacity magazines and certain weapons with \nmilitary-style characteristics. This bill will not require anyone to \nforfeit a gun he or she already has.\n\n  We saw the damage assault weapons or large-capacity magazines can do \nat Newtown, Tucson, Aurora, and elsewhere. Here is what Milwaukee \nPolice Chief Edward Flynn said about assault weapons at a recent \nJudiciary Committee hearing:\n\n       Assault weapons are built to inflict violence against \n     humans. Their military characteristics are not merely \n     cosmetic in nature. These weapons are designed for combat. \n     They are designed to quickly, easily, and efficiently cause \n     lethal wounds to humans.\n\n  We are not talking about just mass shootings. For instance, studies \nsuggest that large-capacity magazines may be used in up to a quarter of \nall gun crimes and 41 percent of police murders.\n  I believe the assault weapons ban will make our communities safer \nwithout unduly interfering with the rights of responsible gun owners. I \nthink the bill strikes an appropriate balance. Others disagree, and I \nrespect their views, but there are a few arguments that have been \nadvanced against the assault weapons ban that I wish to address.\n  The first argument we have heard against Senator Feinstein's bill is \nthat Justice Department studies have proved the assault weapons ban was \nineffective. During our first hearing, a witness said: ``Independent \nstudies, including a study from the Clinton Justice Department, proved \nthat ban had no impact on lowering crime.'' And others, including my \ncolleagues, repeated this claim.\n  Well, I went back and looked at the studies. What they actually say--\nand they say it over and over--is that it was premature to draw \ndefinitive conclusions about the ban's effectiveness. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       It is premature to make definitive assessments on the ban's \n     impact on gun violence.\n       The effects of the [assault weapon and large-capacity \n     magazine] ban have yet to be fully realized; therefore, we \n     recommend continued study.\n       The ban's reauthorization or expiration could affect \n     gunshot victimizations, but predictions are tenuous.\n\n  I could go on and on. The reports repeat this point time and time \nagain. If anything, the Justice Department report suggests a ban would \nbe effective. For example, they said: ``It could conceivably prevent \nhundreds of gunshot victimizations annually and produce notable cost \nsavings in medical care.''\n  It is simply not possible to read those studies and honestly say they \nprove an assault weapons ban is ineffective.\n  Another argument we have heard against Senator Feinstein's bill is it \nwill undermine one's ability to defend oneself. But here is the thing: \nThe record contains no evidence of a real case in which someone \nactually needed a large-capacity magazine or assault weapon for self-\ndefense.\n  During our first hearing, a witness submitted many examples where \nguns were used in self-defense, but I have not seen any evidence that \nany one of those cases actually involved a weapon that would be banned \nunder Senator Feinstein's bill. At our last markup, one of my \ncolleagues submitted some additional cases for the record, but, again, \nafter reviewing that list, I am not persuaded an assault weapon or \nlarge-capacity magazine was needed for self-defense in any of those \ninstances.\n  Rather than presenting real cases in which someone actually needed an \nassault weapon or a large-capacity magazine to defend oneself, \nopponents of Senator Feinstein's bill instead asked us repeatedly to \nimagine hypothetical situations where these weapons were needed for \nself-defense.\n  Sure, I can imagine hypothetical cases, but I am not sure what value \nthat holds, because I can also imagine someone using a large-capacity \nmagazine or an assault weapon to massacre people at an elementary \nschool or a movie theater or a supermarket parking lot. I can imagine \nthese things because they really happened. That is the reality. And it \nis reality we should be talking about.\n  I asked Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, the president of the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, about this and he said: ``This idea that these \nweapons are for self-defense is, based on our experience, completely \nabsurd.''\n  The final argument I wish to address is one of the most important. \nSome have argued a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines \nis unconstitutional. The problem with the argument is it typically \nrests on the premise that the Second Amendment is absolute or \nunlimited.\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\n  For example, during our committee markup, one of my colleagues asked \nSenator Feinstein whether she would ``consider it constitutional for \nCongress to specify that the First Amendment shall apply only to the \nfollowing books and shall not apply to the books that Congress has \ndeemed outside the protection of the Bill of Rights?''\n  The point my colleague was trying to make, I think, is that banning \ncertain guns is like banning certain speech, and that this ban would \nviolate the Constitution. This line of argument assumes the Second \nAmendment is absolute and unlimited--that any new gun law necessarily \nis unconstitutional.\n  But one doesn't have to be a constitutional scholar to know that \nrights are not unlimited. In fact, my colleague's question actually \nmakes that very point. There are books that are not protected by the \nFirst Amendment. The Bill of Rights does not protect libel. The Bill of \nRights does not protect child pornography. One cannot yell ``fire'' in \na crowded movie theater where there is no fire.\n  And, likewise, the Second Amendment does not protect the rights of \neveryone to carry whatever weapon he likes in anyplace he wishes for \nwhatever purpose he desires. The Second Amendment does not entitle \nfelons or fugitives or domestic abusers or people with serious mental \nillnesses to carry guns. It does not entitle Americans to own a fully \nautomatic machine gun or a bazooka or to bear nuclear arms.\n  Here is what Justice Antonin Scalia said in the Heller decision:\n\n       Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment \n     is not unlimited. . . . The right is not a right to keep and \n     carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for \n     whatever purpose.\n\n  Senator Durbin chaired a hearing on this issue in February. I was \npersuaded by Professor Lawrence Tribe's testimony. He examined the \nlegislation and said: ``I'm convinced that nothing under discussion in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee represents a threat to the Constitution \nor even comes close to violating the second amendment.'' Remember, \nProfessor Tribe has supported gun rights. He argued for an individual's \nright to bear arms many years before the Heller decision.\n  I was also persuaded by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals' analysis in \nHeller II. There, the Court examined the District of Columbia's assault \nweapons ban by asking a series of questions. First, to what extent does \nthis law burden an individual's right to bear arms for lawful purposes? \nSecond, how does that burden compare with the public's interest in \nimplementing the ban? Finally, is the ban sufficiently well tailored to \nthat public interest?\n  This is the sort of inquiry that is typical in constitutional cases, \nand I think it is appropriate in the Second Amendment context too. It \nis nuanced and principled, not absolutist. The constitutional question \nis not whether a law touches upon Second Amendment interests at all. \nThe question is whether the law unduly burdens those interests--whether \nit strikes an appropriate balance between the Second Amendment \ninterests at stake and the public's interest in its safety. We don't \nhave to choose between the Second Amendment and saving lives. That is a \nfalse choice.\n  The Heller II Court correctly concluded that the District of \nColumbia's law--their assault ban--struck an acceptable balance and \nupheld DC's ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. In \nfact, every court that considered laws banning assault weapons and \nlarge-capacity magazines has upheld those laws as constitutional. I am \nconfident Senator Feinstein's bill will be upheld in the courts as \nwell.\n  When my colleague began drawing comparisons to the First Amendment, I \nwas reminded of what Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity: \n``I know it when I see it.'' The debate on this issue changed the day \nthat gunman massacred 20 little children and 6 educators with an \nassault weapon and large-capacity magazines at an elementary school in \nNewtown. That was an obscenity. Americans knew it when they saw it.\n  I hope we will continue to debate these issues in the days ahead. \nDebate is important, especially when people feel so strongly on both \nsides of this issue. I respect those who hold different views, and I \nhope they respect mine.\n  As we debate this issue, I hope we keep in mind what Gabby Giffords, \nMiya and Sam Rahamin, and Neil Heslin told us during our committee \nhearings. Gabby Giffords was shot in the head during the massacre in \nTucson in 2011. Six people died that day. The youngest among them was \nChristina-Taylor Green, the 9-year-old girl who loved to dance and who \nvery well may have followed in Gabby's footsteps.\n  Christina-Taylor had just been elected to the student council at her \nelementary school and she had taken an interest in public service at a \nyoung age. That is why she was visiting her Congresswoman. Christina-\nTaylor was killed with the 13th bullet fired that day. Christina-Taylor \nGreen is not with us anymore, but by some miracle Gabby is, and Gabby \nhas used this second lease on life to be a voice for people such as \nChristina. Gabby mustered every bit of energy she could to appear \nbefore the Judiciary Committee in January. Let's not forget what she \nsaid, which was this:\n\n       Speaking is difficult, but I must say something important. \n     Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too. \n     Many. Children. We must do something. It will be hard. But \n     the time is now. You. Must. Act. Be bold. Be courageous. \n     Americans are counting on you.\n\n  Miya and Sam Rahamim asked us to take action too. They lost their \nfather Reuven when a gunman opened fire at a sign factory in \nMinneapolis in September. Reuven is an immigrant from Israel and lived \nthe American dream. He started a company that employed dozens of people \nover the years and exported products to the rest of the world, even to \nChina--something Reuven was always eager to tell people. And Reuven was \nespecially proud of his patented method for making Braille signs which, \nobviously, helped the blind. That was Reuven's thing--helping people. \nHe was active in my synagogue and in his community, and he will always \nbe remembered for his generous spirit.\n  Miya and Sam gave me a letter in January just a few weeks after Sandy \nHook and a few months after the mass shooting that took their father's \nlife, and others. This is what the letter said:\n\n       While Congress cannot prevent every death from gun \n     violence, it has a moral obligation to attempt to save as \n     many lives as possible. By passing this legislation, Congress \n     can prevent some Americans from receiving the call that is \n     dreaded most--that their father or mother, brother or sister, \n     spouse or child will not be coming home. . . . I want my \n     story told so that other families will not have to go through \n     the devastation that mine has been through.\n\n  And then there is Neil Heslin. He came to Washington to testify at a \nJudiciary Committee hearing a few weeks ago. Neil told us about the \nmorning of the shooting at Sandy Hook when his son Jesse was killed. On \nthe way to school that morning, Neil and Jesse stopped at the deli to \nget breakfast. Neil got coffee. Jesse got what he called coffee, which \nwas really hot chocolate. That is the part of the story that has really \nstayed with me. It is a small detail but it is a pure detail. It says \nsomething about how an innocent child looks up to his dad.\n  Neil was in a good mood. Christmas was around the corner and he had \nplans to make gingerbread houses with Jesse and Jesse's classmates that \nafternoon. Talking to Neil, you kind of got the sense that he was just \nas excited about this as the kids were--maybe more so. He really \ncherished this time together.\n\n  After they had their ``coffees,'' Neil dropped Jesse off at school. \nIt was 9:04 a.m. Neil told us this:\n\n       Jesse gave me a hug and a kiss. And he said, ``Goodbye, I \n     love you.'' Then he stopped, and he said, ``I love mom, \n     too.'' That was the last I saw of Jesse.\n\n  Neil is not a political guy. In fact, he told us:\n\n       Half the time, I think it doesn't matter which group of you \n     guys runs things out there, no offense.\n\n  But he continued:\n\n       Let me tell you, when you're sitting at a firehouse and \n     it's one in the morning and you're hoping against hope that \n     your son is still hiding somewhere in that school, you want \n     any change that makes it one bit more likely that you'll see \n     your boy again.\n\n  For me, that is what this is about, to make any change that will make \nit one bit more likely that the next Jesse will live to make \ngingerbread houses at Christmas. To see so many innocent lives lost on \nthat December morning,\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nso many hopes and dreams dashed, so many families grieving, the country \nwas heartbroken, my wife and I were heartbroken, and we are still. I \nwish we could offer more than our thoughts and our prayers and the \nthoughts and prayers of our fellow Minnesotans.\n  We cannot turn back time. We cannot bring back the lives we have \nlost. But if there is something we can do today in this Chamber--this \nweek in this Chamber--to save lives in our communities tomorrow, to \nmake it more likely that boy will be coming out of the school, then I \nthink we should do it.\n  Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate only be extended \nuntil 8:30 p.m. and that at 8:30 p.m. the majority leader be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Vermont is known for many of its great \nbusinesses and products. Among those successful companies is Darn Tough \nVermont, whose brand represents the commitment to quality and \nexcellence that defines Vermont. For nearly a decade, Darn Tough \nVermont has been making the type of quality products our Nation has \ngrown to expect from Vermonters.\n  Darn Tough was launched in 2004 by Ric Cabot, whose family founded \nDarn Tough's parent company in Vermont 35 years ago. For three \ngenerations, the Cabot family has stayed true to their roots and \ncommitted to the Northfield community. While other clothing \nmanufacturers have outsourced their labor, the Cabots carry on where \nthey began--manufacturing in New England, keeping faith with their \ncustomers and their 120 employees.\n  Darn Tough has a local feel to those who visit its factory and know \nits operators, but the company's name brand is known across the country \nand around the world wherever people appreciate a high-quality wool \nhiking and athletic sock, and its products are even worn overseas by \nour troops in combat. And as with other Vermont companies that equip \nand outfit our military, taxpayers can rest assured our troops are in \ngood hands when their feet are in quality goods made by Darn Tough.\n  The Burlington Free Press recently paid tribute to Ric Cabot and all \nof the employees at Darn Tough for their hard work that continues to \nbenefit our troops and the Vermont economy. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the recent Free Press article entitled ``Rebuilding \nAmerican textiles, one sock at a time: Darn Tough measures success,'' \nbe printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From Burlington Free Press, Apr. 4, 2012]\n\n Rebuilding American Textiles, One Sock at a Time: Darn Tough Measures \n                                Success\n\n                          (By Dan D'Ambrosio)\n\n       In Northfield, about 50 miles north of White River Junction \n     where Ibex makes its home, Cabot Hosiery Mills, Inc. has been \n     making private label socks not only in America, but in \n     Vermont, since 1978. Third generation owner Ric Cabot, who \n     launched the company's own label--Darn Tough Vermont--in \n     2004, says one of the secrets to Darn Tough's success is the \n     deceptive difficulty of making a good sock.\n       ``People think socks are easy to do, it's just a pair of \n     socks, how hard could it be?'' Cabot said. ``I guess that \n     allows people to come into the market, but the staying power \n     of companies that don't produce their own product is very \n     short. There are so many people that are doing it well, it's \n     hard to maintain a presence.''\n       Perhaps the best symbol of Cabot's fastidiousness when it \n     comes to socks is the 18-inch ruler projecting incongruously \n     out of his back pocket when he greets visitors at the front \n     door of the plain metal building that houses Darn Tough.\n       Cabot sat on the ruler and broke it about 20 years ago. He \n     had one of Cabot's maintenance workers glue it back together, \n     giving it the look of a broken bone that has healed well. \n     There are certain things, Cabot says, you don't want to \n     replace.\n       Cabot is never without his ruler as he roams the knitting \n     floor and quality control departments of Darn Tough, handling \n     socks, and measuring them.\n       ``I sweat quarter-inches,'' Cabot says. ``The first thing I \n     do when I pick up a sock, is it the right length? If a sock \n     is the right length, that means a lot of people are doing \n     their jobs.''\n       Later, at a quality audit station, Cabot picks up a sock, a \n     men's large.\n       ``Socks that made it this far, there's not going to be a \n     huge hole, or wrong color, but the sizing should be right,'' \n     he says. ``This should be at or on 10\\3/4\\ inches.''\n       It's dead on. Socks, Cabot explains, are a math problem, \n     ``like most things in life.'' Among the numbers you have to \n     work out are the size and gauge of the needles used to knit \n     the socks. The gauge of the needle is basically how many \n     needles you can fit in a circumference, because socks are \n     knit in a circle.\n       ``Those needles are in a cylinder,'' Cabot says. ``You have \n     to take into account needle size, cylinder size, what's the \n     right weight of wool, nylon and Lycra? How are you going to \n     reinforce it? How many stitches per inch? Where are you going \n     to put the terry, the cushioning?''\n       Once you answer all of these many mathematical questions, \n     Cabot says, you have the ``DNA'' of a Darn Tough sock. Then \n     that DNA has to be expanded to hiking socks, running socks, \n     cycling socks. Every sock has more in common, mathematically, \n     than they don't have in common with other Darn Tough socks.\n       ``That's the math of it, the durability story, the comfort \n     story, the fit story,'' Cabot said.\n       But all those stories, he said, are trumped by another \n     story when it comes to marketing Darn Tough socks: The \n     Vermont story. Darn Tough employs about 120 people in \n     Northfield, maintaining the New England tradition of textiles \n     that once included hundreds of towns.\n       ``You got to remind people, they know it, but you tell them \n     nobody ever outsourced anything for quality,'' Cabot said. \n     ``That's the key.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2679-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2679-S2680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO RAMBLERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Monday, college basketball fans \ncrowned their newest champion, the Louisville Cardinals. I wish to take \na\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\nmoment to congratulate another historic college hoops team.\n  The NCAA recently announced that the 1963 NCAA Men's Basketball \nChampions, the Loyola University Chicago Ramblers, would become the \nfirst team ever enshrined into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall \nof Fame.\n  In an era when racism gripped the game, Loyola Coach George Ireland \nassembled the first predominately black team to win an NCAA \nChampionship. Loyola's starting lineup featured four African Americans. \nThis was unheard of in those days.\n  Despite hateful comments from the public and threatening letters from \nthe Ku Klux Klan, Loyola lost only two games all season and marched \nthrough the Final Four. In the championship game they faced Cincinnati, \na team which had been ranked No. 1 all season and had won the \ntournament the 2 previous years. If this wasn't pressure enough, the \n1963 NCAA championship was also the first nationally televised NCAA \ntitle game.\n  Les Hunter, starting center for Loyola, remembered it as an \nopportunity to show ``that the brand of black basketball was exciting \nand it provided for more exposure and recruiting for future players.''\n  The championship game was an uphill battle for Loyola. After missing \n13 of its first 14 shots, they trailed by 15 points with less than 15 \nminutes to play. Then, with only 9 seconds left and the score tied, \nWalter Vic Rouse tipped in a missed shot to put the Loyola Ramblers \nahead by 2 points. When the final buzzer sounded, the Loyola University \nChicago Ramblers were national champions.\n  To this day, Loyola remains the only school from Illinois to have won \nthe NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship.\n  To most players, winning the NCAA championship would be \nunquestionably the highlight of the season.\n  As Ramblers point guard and All-American Jerry Harkness says, now \nthat he has gotten older he is even more proud of a game Loyola played \nearlier in that championship season.\n  On March 15, 1963, Loyola and Mississippi State played a game the \nNCAA calls The Game of Change. It was a game which changed college \nbasketball forever--and helped change race relations in America.\n  Mississippi State had won their conference for the past 3 years, but \nit appeared they would be unable to compete in the 1963 NCAA tournament \nbecause of an unwritten State law barring the team from competing \nagainst teams with black players. Rather than forfeit their place, \nMississippi State's president and coach decided to defy Governor Ross \nBarnett's vow of ``segregation now and forever.'' They snuck their team \nout of town under the cover of darkness to avoid being served an \ninjunction barring them from leaving the State.\n  Loyola won The Game of Change, but both teams, together, made \nhistory. The Game of Change altered college basketball and became a \nwatershed event in the civil rights era. Three years later, for the \nfirst time in NCAA history, Texas Western, with an all-black starting \nlineup, won the championship. The 1963 Loyola University Chicago \nRamblers helped make this possible.\n  Loyola's basketball team was led by Coach Ireland and Assistant Coach \nJerry Lyne, and featured starters John Egan, Jerry Harkness, Les \nHunter, Ron Miller, and Vic Rouse, as well as reserves Dan Connaughton, \nJim Reardon, Rich Rochelle, and Chuck Wood. All of those individuals \nare members of the Loyola Athletics Hall of Fame, and each of the five \nstarters has also had his jersey number retired.\n  I congratulate the 1963 Loyola University Chicago Ramblers on their \naccomplishments and look forward to their induction ceremony in the \nNational Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame on November 24, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2680-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MILDRED MANNING\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I honor the legacy of Mildred \nManning, the last surviving American female WWII POW, who died March 8 \nat age 98. Mrs. Manning's heroics in Bataan and Corregidor are an \nenduring example of the bravery of American servicemembers and of \nnurses' dedication to caring for patients. I wish to share her amazing \nstory.\n  Mrs. Manning, born in 1914 on a poor Georgia farm, aspired to escape \nthe poverty which surrounded her. She attended nursing school during \nthe Depression, and in 1939 she joined the Army Nurse Corps. Wishing to \nsee the world, she requested assignment in the Philippines.\n  Weeks after Mrs. Manning arrived in Manila, Japanese forces attacked \nPearl Harbor in Hawaii and a U.S. air base near Manila. During the \nmonths-long Battle of the Philippines which forced an American retreat \nto the peninsula of Bataan and the island of Corregidor, Mrs. Manning \nwas one of a handful of Army and Navy nurses who braved the relentless \nattacks to treat wounded and dying soldiers. When Americans surrendered \nin May, 1942, Mrs. Manning was one of 77 Army and Navy nurses who were \ncaptured and spent the rest of the war in harrowing imprisonment.\n  The prison, built on the grounds of Manila's Santo Tomas University, \nheld nearly 4,000 people in squalid conditions. There were no showers, \nbeds, or kitchens. Hundreds of people were forced to share a single \ntoilet. Food was so scarce prisoners suffered severely from \nmalnutrition.\n  Despite these trials, Lieutenant Manning and her fellow nurses \nremained fiercely dedicated to providing medical care to those around \nthem. For 2\\1/2\\ years, they maintained strict order, wore uniforms, \nand cared for their fellow prisoners. For their efforts, she and her \nfellow nurses earned the moniker, ``Angels of the Pacific.'' Upon their \nreturn to the U.S. in 1945, Mrs. Manning and her fellow nurses were \nhonored by President Roosevelt with the Bronze Star Medal and a \nPresidential Unit Citation.\n  We are all so grateful for Mildred Manning's service. Her legacy will \nlive on in our Nation's history, reminding us of the horrors of war and \nof the bravery of the special people who persevere by helping others. \nMrs. Manning's unwavering dedication to serving our Nation in the midst \nof hardship continues to inspire me, and I am honored to commemorate \nher today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2680-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2680-S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ISRAEL'S 65TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to express my congratulations \nto Israel on the 65th anniversary of its independence.\n  Today, America's closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, \ncommemorates its Independence Day, Yom Ha'atzmaut--one day after its \nMemorial Day, Yom Hazikaron, and one week after Holocaust Remembrance \nDay, Yom HaShoah.\n  While Independence Day is a celebration for the people of Israel, \nthis Memorial Day was marked by somber ceremonies and national grief \nover the loss of their soldiers. Nationwide sirens and moments of \nsilence emphasize the sacrifices Israelis have made to protect their \nthriving, free and democratic state. These intensely personal losses in \nsuch a small country underscore the continuing threats faced by \nIsraelis, the scale of their efforts and the importance of a Jewish \nhomeland. And Yom HaShoah reminds Israelis of the terrible devastation \nof the Holocaust that happened to the Jewish people in a time before \nthey could celebrate the existence of the modern State of Israel.\n  As we celebrate Israel's Independence Day, we must continue to reduce \nthe key threats to Israel's security. We must focus on opportunities \nfor peace in the Middle East. Israel has always been prepared to pursue \nthose opportunities and make peace with its neighbors. Over the past \nsix decades, despite diplomatic gestures, multiple Arab countries have \nrepeatedly attacked Israel. We should not forget that it was \nPalestinian, not Israeli, leaders who walked away from the negotiation \ntable at Camp David in 2000, on the eve of what would have been a \nhistoric breakthrough for peace.\n  Today, it is Israel who continues to acknowledge the necessary \nframework for any peace agreement--a two state solution. While Israel \nhas shown willingness for direct negotiations, the Palestinians \ncontinue to be an unreliable partner in moving toward peace. It is \nvitally important to stress the importance of the Palestinian \nAuthority's close security cooperation with Israel. If peace is to be \npossible, the Palestinian Authority also needs to confront the recent \nsurge in violence in the\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nWest Bank, cease all anti-Israel incitement and renounce Hamas until it \nunequivocally meets the three Quartet requirements.\n  I am proud to have joined with 78 of my colleagues in reminding \nPresident Obama in a letter on the eve of his visit to Israel that the \nU.S. and Israel share common values and interests, and that Israel \nstands ready for peace. Top among these interests is restarting the \npeace process and preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear state.\n  This is precisely why the role of the United States in this process \nmust be one of an honest broker. President Obama must make clear that \nthe pathway for peace is through unconditional direct negotiations \nbetween both the Israelis and Palestinians and that the United States \nvigorously opposes any Palestinian efforts to circumvent direct \nnegotiations. I commend President Obama for pursuing peace during his \nrecent trip to the Middle East, and for working on policy solutions to \naddress the urgent and important threats facing Israel and the United \nStates today.\n  Since Israel's founding 65 years ago, every American administration \nhas worked to strengthen the bonds between our two nations. This \nsupport has been vital for Israel, as the nation is under the constant \nthreat of military and terrorist attacks, economic boycotts and \ndiplomatic hostility--often merely due to the fact of its very \nexistence. At this critical moment, when Iran is moving forward with \nits nuclear program and simultaneously strengthening Hezbollah's \ncapacity to attack Israel, it is imperative that the Obama \nadministration say in clear and unambiguous language that we stand with \nthe people of Israel and will do all in our power to protect our shared \nvalues and national bonds.\n  As Israel celebrates its 65th anniversary, let us all proclaim that \nthe U.S. continues to value its unbreakable alliance with our closest \nally in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2681-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DECISIONS DAY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize that today, April 16, \n2013, is National Healthcare Decisions Day.\n  National Healthcare Decisions Day exists to inspire, educate and \nempower the public and providers about the importance of advance care \nplanning. It began as a local, grassroots effort 7 years ago in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, started by a Virginia Attorney, and it became \nan annual event in 2008.\n  It now is recognized across all 50 States as an annual imitative to \nprovide clear, concise and consistent information on health care \ndecision making to the public and providers. This year over 100 \nnational organizations, including groups like the AARP, Volunteers of \nAmerica, government groups like the Veterans Health Administration, \nproviders like the hospital company HCA, American College of Nursing, \nand American Academy of Nursing, along with faith-based groups like \nB'nai B'rith International have all pledged to participate today to \nspread the word on the value of conversations about our goals and \nvalues and preferences about medical treatment.\n  I know how important this is, not just from my time serving both as a \nGovernor and as a Senator, but also through the eyes of a loved one who \nstruggled with these issues. My mother suffered from Alzheimer's \ndisease for 10 years, and for 9 of those years, she could not speak. My \nfather, sister and I found grappling with the challenges of caring for \nher difficult. The difficulty was greater because, when she was first \ndiagnosed, my family did not take the opportunity to talk in a frank \nand fully informed way with her and her health care providers about the \nfull array of health care options available or about what her \npriorities would be during the final years of her life.\n  It is so frustrating that some have labeled advance care planning as \nefforts to take away choice from patients. This is ignorant and is \ndisrespectful to those struggling will illness and caregiving. In fact, \nwhat we are trying to do is the opposite, give patients and their \nfamilies the ability to make decisions when they can and provide enough \nsupport and information so that they can make informed choices based \nupon their own values and goals.\n  It is not easy, this is a subject that most people do their best to \navoid: who will decide how we will live when we are unable to make our \nown decisions. But it is critical.\n  Most of us, more than 80 percent, will be unable to make decisions \nabout what medical treatments we will receive for some period in our \nlives. The lucky will regain decision-making ability, but most of us \nwill lose it for good.\n  Family or friends are then asked to step in. Sometimes they are asked \nto make routine decisions, like using antibiotics to treat an \ninfection. Sometimes it is more significant. Would a hip replacement \nimprove quality of life when you are physically pretty healthy, but \nsubstantially impaired by Alzheimer's or another dementia? Or would it \ncause more harm than good?\n  Often proxies are forced to choose between terrible options. Should \nthey consent to an amputation of a gangrenous leg of a loved one who \ncan no longer get out of bed, communicate, or recognize family for the \nremote chance that doing so will slow, but not cure, the progression of \nvascular disease?\n  State laws and Supreme Court decisions direct proxies to make the \ndecision that a now-incapacitated loved one would have made.\n  But research says this often does not work. It might not work, for \nexample, because a widow never told her adult children what she would \nwant.\n  Maybe she assumed that her children knew.\n  Maybe she feared that they would disagree with her preferences.\n  Whatever the reason, those who make decisions for her do so blind-\nfolded with their hands tied behind their backs.\n  Too often, proxies are left with guilt, anxiety, and depression.\n  But some are at peace because they know what the person wants. They \nknow because they talk about how decisions should be made and who \nshould make them. They talk about when a decision best honors the \nperson by pulling back on treatments designed to treat the disease and \ninstead forge ahead with aggressive symptom control. They talk about \nwhen a hospital bed at home is the right choice over tubes and needles \nand monitors in the ICU, or vice versa.\n  After talking, they write it down in an advance directive.\n  Each of us has an obligation to our families and friends to think \nabout what we want, to talk to them about what we want, and to document \nour choices.\n  In the last two sessions of Congress, I have introduced a bill to \nhelp patients, providers, and caregivers get the support and education \nthey need. Among other things, it will make advance directives more \naccessible, and it will make it easier for providers to follow them. I \nam planning on introducing a bill, the Senior Navigation and Planning \nAct, in the coming weeks.\n  However, today, I urge you all, on this National Decisions Day, to \ndiscuss your preferences and goals with your family and friends. Fill \nout an advance directive. Think of it as a gift.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2681-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2681-S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DECISIONS DAY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss a very \nimportant issue--living well at the end of life.\n  Today is National Healthcare Decisions Day. It is a day dedicated to \nreminding people to plan for the future, to encourage discussions--no \nmatter how difficult--to let families, friends, and caregivers know \nyour wishes, whatever they may be.\n  This is an incredibly important and pressing issue, but it is one \nthat no one likes to talk about. No one likes to face their own \nmortality. But we must because we know that more often than not, \npatients' preferences are not known or adhered to near the end of life.\n  In the absence of clearly defined expectations and wishes, death can \nbe an incredibly scary and confusing time for a patient and their \nfamily. Misunderstanding among physicians and family members about a \nloved one's final wishes can cause significant psychological and \nemotional hardship. Families may disagree about treatment options and \nargue about whether their loved one should get more or less treatment, \naggressive intervention or palliative care.\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n  These disagreements can often result in the patient receiving a \ndifferent course of treatment than they might have preferred--an \nundesirable yet easily avoidable outcome. We need to empower patients \nto express their wishes, to exert their choice, and to clearly define \ntheir preferences and expectations, whatever they may be, to those who \nwill be along their side at that difficult time.\n  People often think, ``I'm too young to worry about that.'' Or, ``I \nhave plenty of time to deal with that later.'' But these conversations \naren't just important for people who have been diagnosed with terminal \nillness or individuals approaching old age. In fact, if you wait too \nlong, you may not get the chance.\n  Most diseases don't discriminate and accidents can happen to anyone. \nThe time for us to think about what our wishes might be is before we \nare in a crisis--when we can think clearly about the consequences of \nthe course we select, consult with our spiritual and moral leaders, and \ndiscuss these difficult issues with family and friends. There are many \nphysical, emotional, and spiritual components to these issues, and it \ntakes careful reflection to determine which are most important to you.\n  I am very proud to say that my State has been a leader on this issue. \nWe have a great organization called Honoring Choices Minnesota that \nprovides resources and tools to help people start these difficult \nconversations with their families.\n  There will be several events in my State today and all across the \ncountry highlighting the importance of not only making your preferences \nknown, but ensuring that people who want to can document their wishes \nthrough an advanced care directive, physicians order for life \nsustaining treatment, or other legal mechanism.\n  I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to take time today to \nthink about their families, their wishes, and to begin planning for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2682-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL DELANEY\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate an excellent lawyer and a dedicated public servant--New \nHampshire Attorney General Michael Delaney. As Mike completes more than \n14 years of service to the people of New Hampshire I would like to \nacknowledge his significant record of accomplishments.\n  Long before Mike rose to the position of attorney general, he served \nas a prosecutor in the homicide unit. I was privileged to work with him \non several murder trials, including the case involving two murdered \nDartmouth professors. And I was proud to continue serving with him when \nI was the attorney general and he was the deputy attorney general, \nworking together to provide leadership for the office.\n  Having had the privilege of working side by side with Mike, I can \nattest to his passion for seeking justice in all prosecutions, his \noutstanding advocacy on behalf of victims, and his commitment to \nproviding the State with legal representation and counsel of the \nhighest quality.\n  After serving as legal counsel to the governor, Mike was appointed to \nserve as New Hampshire's attorney general in 2009. Throughout his \nservice as attorney general, Mike served the people of New Hampshire \nwith diligence, independence and integrity, leading by example as he \nand his staff performed the constitutional, statutory and common law \nduties of the attorney general as the State's chief legal officer and \nchief law enforcement officer.\n  As Mike leaves public service to return to private practice, I \ncommend him on a job well done. He has successfully carried forward the \nhighest traditions of excellence and independence of the office of \nattorney general and leaves a legacy of improvements to all aspects of \nthe work of the New Hampshire Department of Justice. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in thanking him for his service and wishing him, \nhis wife Caroline, and their children Will, Maggie and Katie, well in \nall their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2682-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 882.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nbenefits and assistance provided to surviving spouses of veterans under \nlaws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, one of my top priorities is to honor the promise that we \nmade, as a nation, to care for veterans and their survivors. The Senate \nrecently passed a resolution, which I was proud to co-sponsor, \ndesignating April 5 as ``Gold Star Wives Day,'' in honor of the Gold \nStar Wives of America, a nonprofit organization that provides services, \nsupport, and representation for widows and widowers whose spouses died \non active duty in the military or as a result of a service-connected \ndisability. We recently celebrated ``Gold Star Wives Day,'' by \nrecognizing the sacrifices of the families of fallen servicemembers and \nveterans.\n  In addition to honoring surviving spouses and families, we must take \nsteps forward to provide the comprehensive care and benefits they need. \nWithout a doubt, a decade of war has had a major impact on our military \nfamilies. Over 6,600 U.S. servicemembers have died in Operations Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom. They leave behind spouses, who must now \nface a variety of issues such as financial difficulties, preserving the \nfamily home, maintaining the family business, and caring for their \nchildren.\n  Earlier this year, the Veterans' Affairs Committee heard from the \nGold Star Wives of America about the significant challenges that \nsurvivors continue to face. Among the issues the organization advocated \nfor were improved Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits and \nqualification requirements. These are some of the challenges that this \nlegislation would address.\n  This legislation would improve existing survivor benefits and \nestablish a new pilot program to help address the grief counseling \nneeds of surviving spouses. It would also expand health care and other \nsupportive services to children who suffer from spina bifida as a \nresult of their parent's exposure to certain herbicide agents during \nservice in Thailand during the Vietnam War. This legislation would make \na real and positive impact in the lives of the approximately 350,000 \nsurviving spouses and children, currently receiving benefits, who have \nlost a loved one as a result of service to this country.\n  The Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2013 would extend the \ntimeframe for increased DIC benefits for surviving spouses with \nchildren from 2 years to 5 years. A 2001 evaluation of benefits for \nsurvivors of veterans with service-connected disabilities revealed that \nsurvivors with dependents perceived an approximate $6,000 annual gap \nbetween DIC received and DIC needed. The study also found that the \naverage total household income decreased over $20,000 on average during \nthe transition period after the veteran's death. As a result of this \nstudy, it was recommended that the $250 monthly increase in DIC payment \nbe extended from two years to five years for surviving spouses with \ndependent children. It has now been over a decade since the 2001 report \nand we still have not provided this increase.\n  Furthermore, a recent survey from the Department of Veterans Affairs \nindicated that approximately 44 percent of surviving spouse respondents \nhad incomes below $20,000. It is clear that this legislation is \nnecessary to provide much needed additional support to survivors during \nthe period following a veteran's death, especially for low-income \nfamilies. We must act to remedy this shortfall immediately.\n  This legislation would also expand eligibility for DIC to surviving \nspouses who remarry at or after age 55. The lower remarriage age would \nensure that surviving spouses receive benefits at a requirement level \ncomparable to other federal survivor programs. For example, under the \nMilitary Survivor Benefit Plan and for federal employees generally, the \nremarriage age is 55 for retaining benefits.\n  At present, VA presumes that spina bifida in biological children of \ncertain Vietnam-era and certain Korea service veterans was caused by \nthe veterans' exposure to Agent Orange during military service. As a \nresult, VA provides health care, vocational rehabilitation and \nemployment services, and a monthly monetary allowance to qualifying \nchildren. Although Agent Orange was primarily used in Vietnam, it was \nalso used at military installations and other facilities, such as those \nin Korea and Thailand. Veterans who served in certain occupations at \ncertain bases in Thailand are eligible to receive service-connected \ndisability compensation. Therefore, it is only logical that VA should \nalso be required to provide benefits to the children of veterans with \nqualifying service in Thailand, who are suffering from spina bifida.\n  The loss of a loved one is a devastating and life changing event. \nThis legislation would strengthen our dedication to the overall well-\nbeing of surviving spouses by providing a pilot program on grief \ncounseling in retreat settings. The program would enable surviving \nspouses, and dependents in certain instances, to receive the \ncounseling, support, and sense of community necessary to heal from \nlosing a loved one.\n  We have made a steadfast and unwavering commitment not only to our \nveterans, but to their surviving spouses and children. This legislation \nwould strengthen, develop, and expand essential programs and benefits \nfor survivors. Veterans and their families, who have both sacrificed so \nmuch for this country, deserve these benefits. We must deliver.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire drug manufacturers to provide drug rebates for drugs dispensed \nto low-income individuals under the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare Drug Savings Act of 2013. I am proud to be joined by my long-\ntime partner in this effort, Senator Bill Nelson, as well as my \ncolleagues Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Senator Richard \nBlumenthal of Connecticut, Senate Barbara Boxer of California, Senator \nSherrod Brown of Ohio, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, Senator Al \nFranken of Minnesota, Senator Angus King of Maine, Senator Amy \nKlobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Senator Jeff \nMerkley of Oregon, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Bernie \nSanders of Vermont, Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Senator Jeanne \nShaheen of New Hampshire, Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Senator \nTom Udall of New Mexico and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, \nin introducing this important piece of legislation.\n  We need to responsibly reduce our deficit, but taking away health \ncare for seniors and other vulnerable people should be off the table. \nRather than dismantling Medicare and Medicaid, we can save billions of \ndollars by holding drug companies accountable and using the purchasing \npower of the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices, just \nthe way any private insurance plan would use its purchasing power to \nlower prices.\n  That is why we are introducing the Medicare Drug Savings Act. The \nbill will eliminate a special deal from the 2003 Medicare prescription \ndrug law that allows drug companies to charge Medicare higher prices \nfor some seniors' prescription drugs. It would require prescription \ndrug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare for dually eligible \nbeneficiaries in Medicare and Medicaid as well as other low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries. This proposal would reduce the deficit, saving \ntaxpayers an estimated $141.2 billion over the next 10 years, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office. Similar proposals were also \nincluded in the recommendations from the President's Commission on \nFiscal Responsibility and Reform, the President's framework for deficit \nreduction and the President's budget for fiscal year 2014.\n  Prior to the creation of the Medicare prescription drug program, \nbrand-name drug manufacturers paid a drug rebate for dually eligible \nbeneficiaries in Medicare and Medicaid. However, when the new Medicare \ndrug program was established, drug companies no longer had to provide \nthese rebates, resulting in windfall profits for prescription drug \nmanufacturers, at taxpayers' expense.\n  The Medicare Drug Savings Act would require prescription drug \nmanufacturers to pay the difference between the lowest current rebates \nthey are paying to private Part D drug plans, and the percentage of \nAverage Manufacture Price, AMP, they currently pay under Medicaid, plus \nan additional rebate if their prices grow faster than inflation.

Bottom \nline, a lot of work went into this bill, and I want to thank all of the \nstaffs who have been up until now allowing us to introduce this bill as \nwe promised in this legislative day. We are undergirded by the fact \nthat Americans will be fair, balanced, and filled with common sense for \nlegal immigrants and the 11 million here living in the shadows, as long \nas they believe we will not have future waves of illegal immigration. I \nbelieve our bill meets that test.\n  So I would like to thank everybody, including the great floor staff \nwho waited very late tonight. I would like to thank my friend, \ncolleague, and roommate, Senator Durbin, for staying up this late, and \nLeon Fresco, Stephanie Martz and all of our staffs who worked so hard \non this great legislation whose voyage begins now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/16/senate-section/article/S2696-6", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17, 2013\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.
