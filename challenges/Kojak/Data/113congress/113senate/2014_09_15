Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 409, S. \n2432.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 409, S. 2432, a bill to \n     amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide for the \n     refinancing of certain Federal student loans, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                   Remembering Thomas Hale Boggs, Jr.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn just a few minutes \nago of the passing of--I know the President pro tempore's friend and a \nfriend to so many people in Washington--Tommy Boggs.\n  Tom Boggs was an institution in this city. I had the good fortune to \nhear about the Boggs family when I worked here as a policeman for a \nnumber of years and going to law school. Then for a short period I went \nto the post office, and it was there where his cousin Gabe worked. That \nis when I first started hearing about the Boggs family.\n  During that period of time Hale Boggs was the House whip, and, of \ncourse, he and Congressman Begich were in Alaska. He was campaigning \nfor Congressman Begich when the plane went down, and after many decades \nthe plane has never been recovered.\n  I also had the good fortune of serving with his mom in the House of \nRepresentatives. She was a sweet and very accomplished woman. She \nbecame the Ambassador to the Vatican. Then, of course, his sister Cokie \nRoberts is a famous journalist here.\n  Without belaboring the point, I extend my sympathy to the entire \nfamily, and I want them to know that our country and Washington, DC, in \nparticular, is a much better place because of Tommy Boggs' passing \nthrough here.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the Republican \nleader the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 5:30 \np.m. this afternoon, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  At 5:30 p.m. there will be three rollcall votes: cloture on S. 2199, \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act and cloture on the Baran and Burns \nnominations to be members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  The filing deadline for first-degree amendments to the Paycheck \nFairness Act is 3 p.m., and the filing deadline for second-degree \namendments is 4:30 p.m.\n\n\n                         PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. President, all one needs to do is pick up any newspaper or watch \na television show or listen to the radio and you will know that we have \nmany miles to travel before women in America are treated fairly.\n  Unfortunately, there are some in our Nation who don't see a problem. \nBut when women continue to make less than men for performing the exact \nsame work, it is clear we still have a problem. I see it, and the \nSenate Democrats see it. The Democrats in the Senate stand for women's \nequality because when women are empowered, we are all empowered.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on one important aspect of the unfair \ntreatment of American women. Senator Barbara Mikulski's Paycheck \nFairness Act addresses the issue of gender-based discrimination.\n  In America today more than 50 years after passage of the Equal Pay \nAct, women who are doing the exact same work as a man make 77 cents for \nevery dollar that a man makes. This is not just a woman's issue, it is \na family issue and it is an economic issue.\n  For most Americans the answer is very simple. A woman who performs \nthe same work as a man should be paid the same as that man. Women and \nmen support equal pay for equal work regardless of gender because it is \nfair; that is, everyone except the Senate Republicans.\n  Senate Republicans simply cannot accept that simple notion that they \nshould be paid the same for doing the exact same work. Senate \nRepublicans believe it is fair for men to be paid more than women for \ndoing the exact same thing. It is hard to comprehend, but that is \nobviously what they believe. On three separate occasions over the last \n4 years, Senate Republicans\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\nhave filibustered the Paycheck Fairness Act. They prevented a vote on \nthis issue--this issue of basic fairness.\n  Today is a new opportunity for Senate Republicans to do what is right \nfor America's working women and families. The Paycheck Fairness Act \nwould help close a wage disparity by empowering women to negotiate for \nequal pay.\n  Shouldn't a woman be able to negotiate for equal pay?\n  This bill would also give workers stronger tools to combat wage \ndiscrimination and bar retaliation against employees for discussing \nsalary information. Shouldn't a woman be able to talk about wage \ndisparity without fear of reprisal?\n  One of the first things we passed in the Obama administration was the \nLilly Ledbetter legislation, and that is one reason we are doing this \ntoday. Lilly Ledbetter worked for many years doing the same work as men \nin her position. She learned she was being paid a lot less, but the \nU.S. Supreme Court said: Too bad--you should have discovered this a lot \nearlier. If she had discovered it earlier, she would have been fired. \nThis bill would give workers stronger tools to combat wage \ndiscrimination and bar retaliation against employees for discussing \nsalary information. That is why we passed the Lilly Ledbetter \nlegislation.\n  I repeat: Shouldn't a woman be able to talk about wage disparity \nwithout fear of reprisal?\n  This legislation would help secure adequate compensation for victims \nof gender-based pay discrimination. Shouldn't a woman be able to recoup \nwages that are illegally withheld? The answer, of course, is yes.\n  These are commonsense proposals that are supported by the vast \nmajority of Americans. Why is there even a debate on the issue of equal \npay? It is because Senate Republicans continue to stifle debate on this \nissue. They are filibustering yet another piece of important \nlegislation.\n\n  Instead of doing what is right for working women and families and our \neconomy, Republicans are saying: We will not even let the Senate vote \non this issue.\n  Republicans say there really is no issue and the pay gap between men \nand women is exaggerated, and if there is one, it is OK. Republicans \nsay that there are already strong Federal laws that prevent gender-\nbased pay discrimination. I wish it were so. Some Republicans say--as \none did here in the Senate last week--that equal pay for women is \nnothing more than a political show vote. But when all their excuses and \nexplanations have been exhausted, their wives, their daughters, and \ntheir granddaughters are still making 77 cents for every dollar their \nmale counterparts make for doing the exact same work--and that is not \nfair.\n  If Republicans will not stand up for the women in their homes and \ncommunities and all across this Nation, we Senate Democrats will.\n  American women deserve better. They deserve fair wages. They deserve \na fair shot at providing for their families. American women deserve \nequality.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh).

Mr. President, I appreciate the kind, heartfelt words of \nthe distinguished majority leader when speaking about Tommy Boggs--\nThomas Hale Boggs, Jr. Many of us knew him well.\n  I was at Georgetown law school with Tommy, and we often talked about \nthose days and the friendships we had, and so many people who we knew \nare still in this town. I think of him walking down the hall, and we \nwould see each other and start grinning or laughing. Whoever his client \nwas would wonder what we were laughing about. It was usually something \nthat happened in our law school class from 30, 40 or 50 years ago.\n  He was very, very effective. He was very good. He had an easygoing \nattitude that somehow cloaked the fact that he had a first-class mind. \nHe had an encyclopedia knowledge for facts.\n  As someone who deals with Members of Congress, he had one unfailing \nattribute that made him successful. He always told the truth even if it \nwas something one didn't want to hear, and he always kept his word. He \nwas a good friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5574-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5574-S5575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JUSTICE FOR ALL REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as one who had the privilege of being a \nprosecutor, I have great faith in our criminal justice system and the \nmen and women who have dedicated their lives to making it work. \nSometimes mistakes are made, and those mistakes have catastrophic \nconsequences. They can mean an innocent person spends his or her life \nin prison, or worse, is executed. They mean a guilty person remains \nfree--able to victimize again. When mistakes are made, lives are \ndestroyed.\n  We would like to think these kinds of mistakes are few and far \nbetween, but they happen all the time. Just this month we saw that two \ninnocent men in North Carolina were exonerated. They had served 30 \nyears behind bars for a crime they did not commit. One of those men had \nbeen sentenced to death.\n  Can you imagine being in a prison and having those steel doors close \nevery day all the while knowing you are there--perhaps never to leave \nuntil you die--for a crime you never committed? But even worse, you \nknow that the person who committed the crime is out free.\n  Can you imagine that? I know some of these people. I have talked with \nthem. I know it and can just begin to understand what gnaws at them \nwhen they are behind bars for a crime they didn't commit, knowing that \nthe person who committed the crime is out free to do it again.\n  Henry Lee McCollum and his half brother Leon Brown were teenagers. \nThey were arrested in 1983 for a heinous crime--the rape and murder of \nan 11-year-old girl. They were interrogated for hours, and then these \ntwo mentally disabled teens gave false confessions. They were \nultimately convicted of a crime they did not commit. While these \ninnocent men sat behind bars, the unthinkable happened--the real \noffender went on to rape and murder another young girl.\n  These men have lost so much. They were not there when their mother or \ngrandmother died. They have never married or had children. Mr. McCollum \nhad to be placed in isolation every time another inmate was taken to \nthe execution chamber to keep him from harming himself in his distress. \nIt was only this year when a cigarette butt left at the crime scene was \nfinally tested for DNA that their names were cleared and the real \nperpetrator identified.\n  That critical DNA test was made possible by the Kirk Bloodsworth \nPost-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program, which is part of the \nInnocence Protection Act that I wrote more than 14 years ago. I was \nproud to be there with President Bush when he signed it into law as \npart of the Justice for All Act of 2004. The program was named for a \nman whom I consider my friend, Kirk Bloodsworth. Kirk was a young man \njust out of the Marines when he was arrested, convicted, and sentenced \nto death for a heinous crime he did not commit. He was the first person \non death row to be exonerated by DNA evidence. He had been convicted on \neye witness identification, even though he made it very clear he wasn't \nanywhere near where this happened. Do my colleagues know that when they \nfinally exonerated him and identified who the real person was, there \nwas someone at the prison who said, Oh, yeah, we have that guy locked \nup for another crime. Boy, they do look alike, don't they?\n  Unfortunately, hundreds of others have gone through the same hell \nKirk lived through. Well over 300 Americans have been exonerated using \nDNA testing. But then I wonder how many others are going to have to \nsuffer before\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\nwe act. The U.S. attorney in Washington, DC, announced last Thursday he \nwill launch a conviction integrity unit following five recent \nexonerations. Similar programs exist in Dallas, Chicago, Philadelphia, \nSan Jose, and Detroit.\n  This underscores the fact that mistakes can happen all too often. Any \ngood prosecutor fears the possibility of a mistake happening because \nusually prosecutors are going to get convictions. They want to make \nsure they prosecute the right person. Unfortunately, though, there are \nsome who have been willing to accept less than adequate evidence or \nignore the fact that no real effort was made to find all of the \nadequate evidence.\n  For example, we are just beginning to understand the scope of the \nsystemic errors committed by hair and fiber analysts at the FBI crime \nlab in the 1980s and the 1990s. I know as a young prosecutor I relied \non that FBI crime lab. Now we find there were errors and they were \nhidden and covered up--errors involving the question of the convictions \nof 2,600 defendants, including 45 on death row.\n  In a separate inquiry involving the same FBI unit, more than 60 death \nrow convictions were potentially tainted by agent misconduct.\n  Those statistics are bad enough, but according to the Justice \nDepartment's inspector general, three of those defendants were executed \nbefore their attorneys were notified of the misconduct. One of them \nwould not have been eligible for the death penalty without the FBI's \nflawed work. Whether someone is for or against the death penalty, it \nshould shock our conscience. It is unacceptable. We may have executed \nan innocent man. I will hold the FBI accountable. I will demand they \ntake the necessary steps to ensure that such a systemic failure never \noccurs again. I know the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, shares my outrage about this situation.\n  So it is against this backdrop of these shocking cases that I come to \nthe floor and urge the Senate to take swift action. Let us reauthorize \nthe Justice for All Act, which includes the post-conviction DNA testing \nprogram that is a lifeline to the wrongfully convicted.\n  There is nothing partisan or political about ensuring we have the \nright person behind bars and we are not locking up an innocent person. \nThat is an issue both Republicans and Democrats agree on, and that is \nwhy the Justice for All Act has the support of the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, and the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell, and as I said cosponsored by me and Senator Cornyn.\n  Justice is the bedrock of our great country. Our Founders understood \nthat a government's legitimacy is eroded every time an innocent person \nis sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. They sought to protect \nagainst this erosion by enshrining fundamental protections for the \naccused in our Bill of Rights. While those protections are critical, \nthey are not fail-safe. We have to do more. Lives are in the balance. \nLives are in the balance.\n  The dozens of exonerations made possible by the Justice for All Act \nare testament enough to its value. Henry Lee McCollum and Leon Brown \nare just the latest examples. The injustice they survived--and the fact \nthat North Carolina nearly executed an innocent man--should dispel any \ndoubt this legislation is needed. It is time for the Senate to pass \nthis bipartisan Justice for All Reauthorization Act. First giving \nappropriate notice to both leaders, I will be asking unanimous consent \nthat we take it up and pass it.\n  I see my distinguished colleague and friend on the floor, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the distinguished President pro tempore.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5575-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5575-S5576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few moments speaking \nabout national defense.\n  As we all know, last week, in a much anticipated address to the \nNation, President Obama outlined a plan to defeat the Islamic State in \nIraq and Syria. I want my colleagues to know I intend to do my part to \nmake this plan a success.\n  I am not alone in hoping this goal to defeat--not contain--ISIS will \nreplace the half measures and disengagement that has defined the \nPresident's foreign policy to date. The President's previous comment \nthat ``we don't have a strategy yet'' sent the wrong signal to our \nallies and to our adversaries.\n  In response to the President's address last week, Congress and the \nAmerican people are now seeking specifics about the new strategy. I am \nhopeful the new plan is strong enough and broad enough to be successful \nlong term. U.S. leadership and the projection of military might are \ncritical to defeating the ISIS extremists.\n  Thirteen years after September 11, 2001, Americans need to send a \nunified message that we remain resolved to fight the scourge of global \nterrorism. ISIS is part of that scourge, reeking havoc in Iraq and \nSyria, with torture, mass executions, crucifixions, and plans for a \nseventh century-style Islamic caliphate. As we all know, ISIS \nbroadcasts its savagery through gruesome propaganda online, including \nthe horrific murders of two Americans and a British aid worker.\n  It is clear our efforts to date have been insufficient to overthrow \nthis well-funded, well-equipped, and sophisticated army. It will take \nmore than limited air strikes and the modest deployment of military \nadvisers to curb the rapid spread of ISIS across northern Iraq and \nSyria. The United States must be committed to building a coalition that \nfosters regional cooperation, dismantles the group's considerable \nfinancial network, and assists the Iraqi, Kurdish, and Free Syrian \nforces. I wish to help the President in his request for authorization \nto train and equip these forces.\n  This coalition needs to include Muslim-majority nations that are all \nin with a demonstrated resolve to defeat the Islamic terrorists in \ntheir own neighborhood.\n  The cost of inaction is already high. The rise of ISIS in northern \nIraq and its operations in Syria have threatened regional stability and \nthe security of our allies in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, and Kuwait. The \ninvolvement of foreign fighters raises fears of potential terrorist \nplots here at home. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel \nsaid there are more than 100 U.S. citizens with passports fighting for \nthe terrorist group. He went on to say, ``There may be more. We don't \nknow.''\n  Secretary of Defense Hagel, who will testify tomorrow before the \nArmed Services Committee, has called ISIS, ``An imminent threat to \nevery interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else.'' \nSecretary of State John Kerry has expressed similar alarm, saying, \n``The wickedness it represents must be destroyed.'' I agree. But if \nthese statements are true, then we should respond to them aggressively.\n  Similar to Secretary Hagel and Secretary Kerry, the American public \nis concerned about the threat of ISIS to the United States. A new \nreport by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News says nearly 7 in 10 \nAmericans believe military action against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is in \nour national interest.\n  Americans are ready for a bold international strategy to confront \nthese extremists whose ruthless campaign of terror and ethnic cleansing \nhas survived for too long. These radicals have driven tens of thousands \nof Iraq's Yazidi and Christian minorities from their homes in fear. \nAccording to news reports, thousands of civilians have been slaughtered \nacross northwestern Iraq.\n  GEN Jack Keane, former Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, and \nDanielle Pletka, a senior vice president at the American Enterprise \nInstitute, put it this way in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed:\n\n       A U.S.-led international coalition can provide the military \n     capability, including air interdiction to deny ISIS freedom \n     of movement, take away its initiative to attack at will in \n     Iraq, and dramatically reduce its sanctuary in Syria.\n\n  In other words, with U.S. leadership and international cooperation, \nwe can defeat this enemy, and we ought to get about the business of \ndoing it.\n  I believe Congress should support our Commander in Chief in the fight \nagainst ISIS, a fight that can result in a victory and a peace that can \nbe sustained. I look forward to hearing more\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\ndetails about the President's plans when Secretary Hagel and GEN Martin \nDempsey testify before the Armed Services Committee tomorrow.\n  There are still questions to be answered. For example, if public \nopinion turns, will the administration lose its resolve? How long will \nit take to win? How long will it take to crush ISIS? What is the \ndefinition of success? What is the definition of victory in this case? \nIf we accomplish our objectives, will we once again abandon our gains, \nas we did after the surge in Iraq? What is the plan to eliminate the \nterrorist group's financial network? Are the President and \ncongressional leaders willing to find a solution to defense \nsequestration in order to fulfill the mission if more resources are \nrequired? And more resources will be required.\n  Addressing these questions is important to understanding the specific \ngoals and aims of the President's strategy, which are yet to be fleshed \nout. Americans and Congress deserve this clarity.\n  Congress has the responsibility to provide for the resources our U.S. \nmilitary needs for its missions. We do this through appropriations, \nthrough the power of the purse, and the National Defense Authorization \nAct, which has garnered bipartisan support for the past 52 years.\n  Under the capable leadership of Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nInhofe, the Armed Services Committee approved a bill more than 3 months \nago. So has the full House of Representatives. It has passed its \nauthorization act. I hope that even at this late date, Majority Leader \nReid will allow our country's major defense policy bill to come to the \nSenate floor for consideration soon. An annual blueprint of the \nmilitary priorities is vital to making sure that our troops have what \nthey need to protect our national security interests at home and \nabroad.\n\n  This year's bill, for example, includes a provision to stave off \ndrastic cuts to the U.S. Army which would put troop strength at levels \nnot seen before World War II. Well-trained units such as the 155th \nHeavy Brigade Combat Team in my home State of Mississippi should not be \njeopardized by shortsighted and ill-considered proposals by the Obama \nadministration. Instead, under the committee bill, an independent \ncommission would have the opportunity to make recommendations on force \nstructure and size before the National Guard personnel could be cut or \nthe Apache attack helicopters could be transferred.\n  Another provision of the bill would allow for the U.S. Navy and \nMarine Corps to modernize their amphibious warships. These incredibly \nversatile ships signal to the world that America's fighting forces can \nrespond to threats rapidly. Currently our fleet is significantly \nsmaller than the number needed to perform required missions, and many \nof the ships are near the end of their service lives. The Defense \nauthorization bill as passed on a bipartisan basis by the committee \nwould authorize the construction of a 12th LPD 17 warship ensuring that \nthe men and women who defend us in perilous corners of the globe have \nworld-class hardware for their missions.\n  I believe it would be a fitting tribute to Senator Levin, who is \nretiring at the end of this year after decades of distinguished service \nin the Senate, to take up this bill in regular order and pass it as a \ntribute to our retiring chair.\n  In conclusion, we have work to do. The Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the House of Representatives have passed the Defense \nauthorization bill. It is time for the Senate to follow suit. America \nhas the most formidable fighting force in the world and this presence \nmust remain resilient as dangerous groups such as ISIS put our \ninterests at risk. The rapid rise of the barbaric terrorists is a wake-\nup call for U.S. leadership. Now that the President has declared his \nintention to degrade and destroy ISIS militants, we must ensure that \nthe mission is fulfilled.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today for the 78th time in my \n``Time to Wake Up'' series to urge my Republican colleagues that it is \nlong past time to wake up to the growing threat of global climate \nchange.\n  For those who still deny the science--and believe it or not, that is \nwhere some of our colleagues still are--I remind them that virtually \nevery credible scientific authority--and, no, the ones funded by the \nbig carbon polluters don't count--virtually every credible scientific \nauthority has moved beyond the question of whether our climate is \nchanging or whether human carbon pollution drives these changes to now \nhow it is happening and where it is happening.\n  Climate change is no longer a forecast; it is happening before our \neyes, all around us. The latest reports from the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change--made up of the world's top climate \nscientists--call the fact that our Earth is warming ``unequivocal.'' \nJust last week the Secretary General of the World Meteorological \nOrganization said: ``We know without any doubt that our climate is \nchanging and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human \nactivities such as the burning of fossil fuels.'' I repeat--he said \n``without any doubt.''\n  It is actually evident to our own eyes now from observations and \nmeasurements--not projections or predictions--of increases in global \nwarming air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, \nand a rising global average sea level--a phenomenon that means a lot to \nmy coastal State of Rhode Island and to the Presiding Officer's State \nof Maine. Back home our constituents, our neighbors, get it. On our \ncoasts they brace against the unrelenting rise of the seas and watch \nmystifying changes in fisheries they have been familiar with for \ngenerations. On the Plains they toil to raise crops under unprecedented \ndrought. In the mountains they watch as ancient acres of forest are \nkilled by the spread of invasive pests. Yet here in Washington we do \nnothing.\n  In Rhode Island the waters of Narragansett Bay are getting warmer--3 \nto 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter just since the 1960s. \nLong-term data from the tide gauges in Newport, RI, just off Naval \nStation Newport, show an increase in average sea level of nearly 10 \ninches since 1930 and accelerating. Sea level rise is contributing to \nerosion and brings storm surges and waves farther inland.\n  While Washington fiddles, Rhode Islanders act. Early this month more \nthan 200 Rhode Islanders came together in Providence for my annual \nRhode Island Energy and Environmental Leaders Day. The event brings \ntogether Rhode Islanders in renewable energy and sustainable \ndevelopment businesses, in community development nonprofits; it brings \ntogether State and local officials, advocates, and academics to share \nideas with each other and with national leaders and Federal agencies on \npromoting green energy, improving resiliency, and combating climate \nchange.\n  The innovation taking place in my Ocean State was on full display \nthis year. Rhode Islanders are leading the effort to improve our \nenvironment and develop clean technology and energy and prepare for the \nchanges carbon pollution has looming over us. Sheila Dormody, the \ndirector of sustainability of Providence was there to discuss the \nrecently released Sustainable Providence plan for making our comparable \ncity cleaner and greener. The plan covers everything from reducing food \nwaste to improving energy efficiency to increasing alternative \ntransportation options. These actions benefit public health and the \nenvironment, and they create economic opportunity. These aren't job \nkillers. These are job builders. You cannot send efficiency upgrades or \nsolar panel installation jobs overseas. Those are Rhode Island jobs, \nAmerican jobs.\n\n  Grover Fugate, executive director of Rhode Island's Coastal Resources \nManagement Council, was there to discuss the collaboration they have \nwith the Rhode Island Realtors Association to create a Rhode Island \ncoastal property guide. We need a Rhode Island coastal\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nproperty guide because climate change loads the dice for more frequent \nand more severe storms and hurricanes that put businesses and \nhomeowners along the shore at risk from flooding, erosion, and wind \ndamage.\n  Superstorm Sandy was a harsh warning. This property guide helps \nresidents and business owners understand the risks and the costs they \nnow face both today and in the future because of the carbon pollution \nwe are doing nothing about. Extreme precipitation, rain bursts, heavy \nrains or snows have increased 74 percent in the Northeast between 1958 \nand 2010.\n  Rhode Islanders have always cared a lot about our Narragansett Bay. \nWe love our bay. We want to protect it. These heavy rains, these sudden \nrains, these rain bursts, what they do is they drive polluted and \nnutrient-rich runoff that might otherwise be filtered or captured \nstraight into the bay where it can close beaches and harm the bay's \nmarine life.\n  Climate change and the carbon pollution mean we will have to work \nharder in Rhode Island and invest more dollars in a storm water and \nwastewater infrastructure, and it is not cheap. Our Rhode Island \nNarragansett Bay Commission, our wastewater utility, is overhauling its \nsewer and storm water collection to address that overflow during big \nstorms. When big storms hit now, the underground storage tunnel that \nwas completed in 2008 stores up the sewer and storm water until the \nextra water can be processed and until the capacity in the treatment \nplant is there to pump it out and process it.\n  As a result of the first phase of what is called the combined sewer \noverflow project, the commission estimates that through 2012, 4.6 \nbillion gallons of mixed storm and wastewater that would have been \ndumped directly into Narragansett Bay untreated were instead processed \nat the Field's Point Wastewater Treatment Facility at one of our small \ntowns. The town of Tiverton, RI, received funding through the USDA to \nhelp pay for upgrades to the town's water system, connecting thousands \nof residents on inefficient old septic tank systems to a town sewer. \nLeroy Kendricks, the chair of the Tiverton Wastewater District, told \nour group that these improvements will protect the Sakonnet River and \nMount Hope Bay from mounting levels of pollution.\n  Julia Gold is the climate change program manager at the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Health. Julia explained how the department of health has \nteamed up with the division of elderly affairs to focus on the effects \nof climate change on the elderly, collaborating with the departments of \nenvironmental management and transportation to pilot a Lyme disease \nprevention training program for outdoor workers--those ticks spread \nmore widely in warmer weather--and partnered with the Brown School of \nPublic Health to examine correlations between rising temperatures and \nrising hospital admissions.\n  You may have seen a segment in the documentary series ``Years Of \nLiving Dangerously'' on the deaths in Los Angeles from heat-related \nconditions worsened by climate change. This work with Brown University \nis similar and showing similar results.\n  These were just a few of the many stories told in Rhode Island at the \nEnergy and Environmental Leaders Day. Not only do Rhode Islanders \nconnect with one another there, but we also have the chance to share \nour important work with national leaders and hear their perspective on \nregional and national leaders, as well as get their perspective on \nregional and national trends.\n  The first of three keynote addresses came from renowned marine \nscientist and National Geographic Explorer-in-residence Sylvia Earle. \nSylvia is truly a remarkable woman and a legend in oceanography \ncircles. Her passion for our living oceans is just about as deep as \nthose oceans. She reminded us that the oceans are the cornerstone of \nour human life support system, that indeed the oceans are the life \nsupport system for all creatures on our planet, not just the aquatic \nones, and that our oceans bear witness to the unprecedented changes \ncarbon pollution is causing. Her bad news was that these threats are \ngrave. Her good news was that never before have we, as humans, been as \nwell equipped with knowledge about our earth and our climate. The \noceans indeed are sick but we have the power simply by changing our \nbehavior to help them heal.\n  In a happy coincidence Sylvia's new documentary called ``Mission \nBlue,'' which lays out the perilous condition of earth's oceans, was \nplaying the night before at the Newport Film Festival. Sylvia went \nthere and said:\n\n       Think of a film about oceans 50 years from now. It will be \n     based on what we do now.\n\n  Our possibilities are terrific. Here is another thing that she said. \nI will quote her.\n\n       The good news sounds like bad news but the good news is \n     that we know that it is happening. We are the only creatures \n     on earth with the capacity to dive back into time, put \n     ourselves into perspective and plan a future based on \n     evidence, based on knowledge.\n\n  So what are we doing now? While Congress snoozes in the snug embrace \nof the big polluted interests, President Obama has stepped into the \nvacuum. His chief lieutenant in this effort is EPA Administrator Gina \nMcCarthy. She delivered our second keynote.\n\n  Climate change, she told our assembled group, is perhaps the most \ndifficult, complex, and necessary issue for us to face. She reminded us \nthat EPA is at its heart a public health agency. So when it comes to \nthe carbon pollution that increases smog and asthma or increases the \nstorms and floods that batter our communities, she says this: ``EPA's \njob is to protect those that are most vulnerable from this pollution, \nso it is our job to take action on climate. Period. Full stop.''\n  Administrator McCarthy led an extraordinary effort to put out the \nEPA's proposed rule, for the first time limiting carbon pollution from \nour country's largest source--our powerplants. The rule is \nrevolutionary in many ways, particularly in its adaptability, allowing \nStates and regions to reach their own goals their own way. It is the \nproduct of an intensely collaborative process and an enormous amount of \ngive and take. The rollout has been viewed by those outside fossil fuel \nboard rooms as a real achievement.\n  I commend Administrator McCarthy on moving that rule forward with so \nmuch energy. I wish her and that rule Godspeed.\n  The road ahead offers many obstacles as our third and final keynote \nspeaker reminded us. Jeff Goodell has reported on the energy industry \nand the changing climate for Rolling Stone magazine, where he is a \ncontributing editor. His many books have explored the inner workings of \nthe fossil fuel industry and the most far-reaching proposals for \navoiding catastrophic global warming, among other topics.\n  Jeff has firsthand knowledge of the complex apparatus of denial \nsupported by the big polluters. The fossil fuel producers are \nbankrolling entire political campaigns and phony front organizations \npeddling scientific misinformation.\n  As Jeff pointed out, these misinformation efforts even involve not \njust the same strategies but the very same scientists who were involved \nworking for the tobacco industry--the scientists-for-hire who worked \nfor the tobacco industry in its decades-long venture to hide the \ndangers of tobacco from regulators and the public. They are still at \nit, but now it is denying climate change, not denying that tobacco is \nharmful.\n  Not only do these polluters stall tactics stand in the way of \nresponsible action to cure climate change, Jeff reported they also hold \nback progress in our energy sector and in our economy, particularly in \nStates and regions that have long relied on fossil fuel jobs. He called \non us--he called on his home country--to finally take steps to move \nthese communities into the 21st century economy.\n  The environmental and energy challenges facing our Nation can seem \ndaunting. When we join together to share ideas and experiences, as we \ndo each year in the Rhode Island Energy and Environment Leaders Day, it \nis clear that there is a path forward.\n  Rhode Islanders understand this. They see the challenge, and we are \nup to it. We are all up to it as Americans. One thing Rhode Islanders \nwill be doing is later this month hundreds of us will board buses and \nhead down to New York City for what will be known as the People's \nClimate March. Organizers expect as many as a half million people will \ntake part in the historic\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\ncitizen action to call attention to the global crisis of climate \nchange. Marchers from Rhode Island, from California, from all across \nour country, from different organizations, from different industries--a \npatchwork of America--will be there to demand responsible leadership in \nthe fight against carbon pollution. I will be among them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the current business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5578-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5578-S5579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in just a few minutes we are going to have \na procedural vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act. If we truly believe \nwomen and men are equal and should be paid equally, this ought to be an \noverwhelming vote.\n  The Senate women held a press conference after the last vote. The \nRepublicans gave the first procedural vote so we were able to get to \nthis point, but now we have to have 60 votes in order to move forward \nwith an actual vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  We all know what this vote is about. It is very simple. It is about \nwomen in America having the same opportunity for success as their male \ncounterparts. No one should be paid less just for being a woman.\n  This issue was brought to us front and center by Lilly Ledbetter, who \nwas a manager at a Goodyear tire plant in the South and who discovered \njust by happenstance that although there were five managers doing the \nsame job--she and four men--she was getting considerably less money.\n  To make a long story short, the courts were stacked against her. At \nthe end of the day, Lilly Ledbetter was told by the Supreme Court that \nshe was too late--she didn't know about this; it took her a long time \nto know about it--therefore she had no case. We fixed that problem, and \nwe said: No more. We are not going to put a statute of limitations \nbecause someone may never find out about this unfair situation for many \nyears and they shouldn't be disqualified from justice.\n  But now we have more problems. We have testimony of people being \nharassed simply because they want to know whether they are getting paid \nfairly. I am so grateful to our colleague Senator Mikulski from \nMaryland for introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act which will help \nclose the wage gap.\n  We may say: Is there truly a wage gap? Yes, there is. Women get paid \n77 cents for every dollar made by a man for the same work. That is not \nevery woman. But when we average it all, that is what she gets. In \nterms of a yearly pay, it is $11,000. I think we ought to look at this \n$11,000 less a year. What could we buy for $11,000? One year of \ngroceries, in many places a year of rent, in many places a year of \ndaycare or a used car or community college.\n  What does this mean? It means that because the woman is not getting \npaid fairly, her family suffers, whether in the quality of housing or \ntheir food or the quality of daycare, the quality of their car, and \ncertainly the ability of that woman to get an education and move up the \nscale.\n  Looking at it from a yearly standpoint I think is important, but I \nasked my staff: Let's look at it over a lifetime and what is the loss \nto this woman and her family in a lifetime. Almost one-half million \ndollars--$443,000--in a woman's lifetime if she gets 77 cents instead \nof a full dollar. What could she do with that? She could pay off one or \ntwo mortgages for that, send three kids to the University of California \nor buy 8,000 tanks of gas. What we don't say here is you need more \nsecurity, and economic security today, which is so critical. Thanks to \nscience, we are living longer and we know it gets more expensive to \nlive.\n\n  If I were to tell one of my Republican friends on the other side that \nsomebody came up to a woman, knocked her on the head and took half a \nmillion dollars from her and stole it, they would be horrified and they \nwould remedy it. They would bring in the law. Well, I am asking them to \nsimply vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act. Just vote for it. Make sure \nwomen in this country earn what they deserve to earn.\n  The wage gap not only hurts our families, it hurts our economy. If \nyou add it all up, it is $200 billion a year in income that would be \nspent at the grocery, that would be spent at the gas station, that \nwould be spent on vacation, that would be spent on local restaurants or \nin better housing.\n  In the history of our Nation we have had a lot of fights before over \nthe issue of discrimination. We know you cannot discriminate on pay \nbecause of race, disability, or age. What we are saying is you \nshouldn't be able to discriminate based on your gender. It is wrong. I \nwould say if it were reversed, I would be standing here fighting for \nthe men. It is not right. People have to be paid based on the work they \ndo, and if the work they do is similar to the work of a man, as in the \ncase of Lilly Ledbetter, they should be paid the same.\n  What the Mikulski legislation does is it prohibits employers from \nretaliating against an employee who shares information with their \ncoworkers. Right now if you are around the cooler of your corporation \nand somebody says: Oh, my God, I cannot afford to get a babysitter for \nmy child, I need a raise, and somebody says: Well, what do you make? \nAnd they say: I make X. Believe me, you can be fired for asking those \nquestions. It is wrong. We have seen it happen. We want to make sure if \nthere is a disparity in pay that it is warranted. Sure, if a woman is \ndoing less than a man in a different job, of course that is not the \nsame. We are saying if you do the same work, you have got to get paid \nthe same.\n  We have hundreds of personal stories from all over this great Nation \nfrom people who have faced pay discrimination. I have many of these \nstories from California. One of them is a woman from my State who had \nan identical advanced degree as her husband, and she landed the exact \njob as her husband, but they were at different worksites. Her husband \nwas offered $5,000 more in starting salary for the same job with the \nexact same resume--same job, the woman gets paid $5,000 less.\n  Then there is a health care worker in Long Island. She discovered she \nhad been earning $10 an hour less than her colleagues with the exact \nexperience. When she brought this up to her superiors, which you would \nexpect her to do--you have got to fight for yourself. Don't we tell \npeople that? Stand up, have respect, but ask the right questions. So \nshe brought it up to her superiors. She was reprimanded. She was \nreprimanded and told not to discuss any type of wage gap.\n  Then there is a female employee from a major corporation in Florida. \nShe was told when she was hired that if she disclosed her salary to \nother workers, that was grounds for dismissal. So you have somebody who \nis well trained. She is great. Then you are talking to your friends in \nthe workplace, you mention your salary. She was told in advance that \nthis is grounds for dismissal.\n  This bill is a major step in the right direction. I call on my \nRepublican friends--we don't need many of you--five, is that right--\nsix, if everyone is here. We need a handful. Stand with women, stand \nwith families, stand for children, stand for equality, stand for \njustice, stand for what is right. Don't play games with this. Don't \ntake the side of a boss who is exerting all kinds of pressure on a \nwoman to tamp down her salary. I think clearly if we do this together \ntonight--and I always remain hopeful--if we do this together tonight, \nwhat we are going to see is an America that is fair, an America that is \njust when it comes to our women.\n  I am really glad one of our colleagues is here to discuss this from \nher perspective. You know, my kids would say to me, ``Mom, this is a \nno-brainer.''\n  This is not complicated, equal pay for equal work. We stand for that \nas Democrats, and we are going to keep on fighting for it. Tonight is \nthat moment in time when we will see whether our Republican friends \nstand with us to give a fair shot to the women in this country--a fair \nshot--or they will block us as they have done before. I\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\nhope maybe they will see the light tonight. I don't think anything I \nhave said will influence them, but I hope it might, because I do think \nit is in their interests as well as the interests of the women in this \nNation to stand united with the Democrats on this: equal pay for equal \nwork, fairness and justice to the women in this Nation. They deserve \nit.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nimportance of closing the pay gap for women, and I thank my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, who has been working on this issue on \nthe front line for so long as a leader on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct to help us get that done and as a leader again.\n  I am a cosponsor on this bill and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of the Paycheck Fairness Act. People deserve a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream. People deserve a fair working wage. That is why we need \nto raise the minimum wage. Equal work should get equal pay, and that is \nwhy we need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I wish to thank the dean of the Senate women, Senator Barbara \nMikulski, for leading this effort for equal pay for equal work in the \npassage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and keeping the focus on \nthe need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  In 2009, we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to make sure that \nworkers who face pay discrimination based on gender, race, age, \ndisability, religion, or national origin have access to the courts. In \ndoing so we restored the original intent of the Civil Rights Act and \nthe Equal Pay Act. Now it is time to prevent that pay discrimination \nfrom happening in the first place.\n  Women have made big strides in this economy. Women are getting \nadvanced degrees. They are starting new businesses. They are leading \nmajor corporations. The Fortune 500 now has 24 women CEOs. Twenty-four \nout of five hundred there is still a lot of work to do, but that is so \nmuch better than where we were decades ago. Now we have a record 20 \nwomen in the Senate. Yet despite the progress we have made and all the \ngaps we have closed, women still make less money than men do.\n  The pay gap has real consequences for American families in our entire \neconomy. Two-thirds of today's families rely on the mother's income \nentirely or in part, and in more than one-third of families the mother \nis the main breadwinner. But women only earn more than men in exactly 7 \nof the 534 occupations listed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That \nis only seven occupations, and I know there is disagreement about what \nthe pay disparity is, if it is just based on other factors. But the \ntruth is when you look at the list of the occupations, in only seven do \nwomen make more than men.\n  As Senate Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I released a report \nshowing how this pay disparity affects women's financial security, \nbecause I think a lot of times people are very focused on the here and \nnow, what that means the wage differential, and what that means in the \nworkplace. This report shows that lower wages impact women all \nthroughout their working lives, and these lower lifetime earnings \ntranslate into less security and retirement.\n  You have the fact that women live longer but yet they have less money \nto begin with. Women live longer than men on average and are more \nlikely to spend part of their retirement on their own because they live \nlonger. So women actually need to have more money for their years in \nretirement. According to our report, the average annual income--this is \naverage annual income for women aged 65 and older--is about $11,000 \nless than it is for men. That is $11,000 less each year to buy \ngroceries, to pay heating bills, to be able to see grandchildren.\n  Lower lifetime earnings result in lower retirement benefits. \nRetirement security is often described as the three-legged stool--\nSocial Security, pension benefits, and personal savings. A woman's \nSocial Security check is 78 percent of a man's check on average. Those \nare the facts. Again, it is about 80 percent of that of a man. The \nmedian income from company or union pension for women is 53 percent \nlower than for men. Finally, lower earnings also affect the ability of \nwomen to contribute to their own retirement plan. Women have less \nincome to put aside and are less able to save money for their own \nretirement. They have smaller paychecks, they have smaller Social \nSecurity checks, smaller pension checks, and less savings in their \nretirement plans. They live longer and they worry all the time that \nthey are going to outlive their savings. All this contributes to less \nretirement security.\n  The pay gap is an especially large burden on women in the sandwich \ngeneration, juggling jobs, juggling their kids, and looking out for \ntheir aging parents at the same time. When two-thirds of the caregivers \nfor aging parents are women, we need to make sure they have financial \nsecurity.\n  So make no mistake, the pay gap impacts women. But my point today is \nthat it impacts women through the entire arc of their lives, and, if \nanything, it impacts older women who for now decades have been making \nless money in an even greater way than it impacts them when they are \nyounger.\n  Around 70 percent of our economy is consumer-based. If we don't have \nfair pay, if we don't have enough pay for middle-income families, then \nthey are not going to buy things whether they are younger or older. \nThat is yet another argument for not only having adequate minimum wages \nbut also for addressing this pay gap. This legislation builds on the \npromises of the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and \ngives women new tools and protections they need to guard against pay \ndiscrimination.\n  I want to get this done, but I also want to work on the issue of \nlong-term savings and how we can make it easier for women and men to \nsave their money when they are working at jobs so they can help \nthemselves. As we move forward, as we are living longer--which is \ngreat--we know it is going to get harder and harder.\n  It was the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota who famously \nsaid, ``We all do better when we all do better.'' I still believe that \nis true, and so do my colleagues who have joined me today. We need to \nbe focused on how we can help more women share in the economic dream \nbecause if we do, we will all be doing better.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Paycheck Fairness \nAct.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BURNS TO BE A MEMBER OF THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY \n                               COMMISSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Stephen G. Burns, of \nMaryland, to be a Member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the \nterm of five years expiring June 30, 2019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. May I ask a question? Has the Senate returned to \nlegislative session?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in executive session postcloture on the \nBurns nomination.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Paycheck Fairness\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, there is the Senate. There they go again. \nWhenever we women fight for fair pay, we are either sidelined, \nredlined, or pushed aside.\n  We, moving for paycheck fairness, feel the way women feel every \nsingle day in the workplace. When they are trying to get equal pay for \nequal work, they are either not listened to or there is some kind of \nreason to make sure the discussion never comes up. Once again, because \nof eight votes separating, we could not debate paycheck fairness.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act is a bill that would finish the job we \nstarted with Lilly Ledbetter.\n  This is not right. When women are out there trying to earn equal pay \nfor equal work, they should have the opportunity to do so. Now they \nfeel stymied. In Lilly Ledbetter, we took the first step to right this \nwrong, but it was not the only step.\n  Paycheck fairness closes the innumerable loopholes that prevent women \nfrom being able to get equal pay for equal work. All we wanted to do \nwas bring up the bill to debate it, to amend it, and then vote on final \npassage. We could not get cloture on the filibuster. Those are wonky \nparliamentary words that said we could have unlimited debate.\n  If we had gotten cloture under our rules, that would have been 30 \nhours of debate. I think that is enough time. There could have been \namendments but, guess what, they had to be germane; that is, pertinent \nto the bill, or they had to be relevant or pertinent to the bill. What \nis wrong with that? That is not a gag rule. That is not muzzling \nanybody.\n  No, no, it wasn't good enough. Do you know why we didn't get cloture? \nThey didn't want to bring up this bill for a final vote or amendments. \nThey are hiding behind parliamentary procedure.\n  Do you know what. Our paycheck fairness bill was so simple and stayed \nstraightforward. Do you know what it would have done? It would have \nprevented retaliation against workers for sharing information about \ntheir wages. Right now, the most secret thing in our country is not \nonly our national security, but what you make. You can't discuss your \nwages with the person next to you. So if a woman was trying to figure \nout what the guy next to her was making, and he wanted to tell her--men \nof quality always support us women as we seek equality. If he wanted to \ntell her, both could have been fired--her for asking and him for \ntelling. We wanted to close that loophole.\n  The other thing the bill would do, it would prevent employers from \nbeing able to use almost any reason to justify paying a woman less. For \nyears, employers have exploited loopholes in the Equal Pay Act, \ninventing any number of reasons why a woman should be paid less. It \nwould also prevent women from being limited to just back pay when they \nare discriminated against. Those are the three major issues.\n  In the United States of America, when we said all men and women were \ncreated equal, we have to be able to be equal, and one of the most \nimportant places you are equal is in the workplace. So if women are \ndoing the same job, we ought to get the same pay. That is the American \nway. But once again we were stymied. Once again they tried to push us \nback.\n  I am going to say this today on behalf of myself, the majority of the \nwomen in the Senate, and many of the great guys in the Senate: They \nwant to make sure that today's vote doesn't say we are stopping this \nfight. Once again, we are going to reach out to the grassroots, \nparticularly to the women of America, to join in the fight to change \nthe Federal law books so women can get change in the family checkbooks. \nThey can try to stop us on the floor, but they cannot stop our \nmovement.\n  Once again, as I have said before, when we have had a setback, we are \ngoing to fight. We are going to fight on the Senate floor, we are going \nto take this to the people in the country, we are going to fight it \nthrough the elections, and we are going to fight it through the \ncommunity. I am going to say to every single person in the United \nStates of America: Be part of this movement.\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\n  A special message to the women: Let's suit up. Let's square our \nshoulders. Let's put our lipstick on and fight for equal pay that won't \nbe stopped. We are going to do it. We are going to fight today, and we \nare going to fight tomorrow, and I am combat ready.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 TESLA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a week ago last Thursday, Tesla, a major \ncompany in America, announced that Nevada would be the new home to its \ngigafactory, which would produce lithium batteries for Tesla's electric \ncars. Just a few days later, Nevada's State legislature unanimously \napproved the incentive package to finalize a new economic boost for \nNevada.\n  Tesla's gigafactory will spur economic development in Nevada. All \ntold, the state-of-the-art manufacturing center is expected to pump \n$100 billion into Nevada's economy and create up to 22,000 jobs.\n  This development is good news for Nevada, but it didn't happen by \naccident. It is the direct result of public-private partnerships and \nsmart Federal and State policies. It is the result of Nevada being seen \nas a hub for renewable energy and innovative technologies. This \nproject, as big as it is, will be powered with solar and geothermal. \nNothing else will power this big project.\n  I have worked here in the Senate to promote legislation that \nencourages investment in clean energy and transportation innovation at \nall levels. In 2007, we passed the Energy Independence and Security \nAct, which created the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing \nProgram. Under this program, the Department of Energy awarded a $465 \nmillion loan guarantee to Tesla for the construction of a manufacturing \nfacility in California. The question everyone has is: Was that loan a \nsuccessful investment in Tesla?\n  The facts speak for themselves. Tesla repaid the loan in full 9 years \nearly. Tesla is the company it is today because of this loan.\n  The availability of lithium, which ultimately helped attract Tesla to \nNevada, also has its roots in Federal legislation. In 2009, with the \neconomy in a deep recession and thousands of Nevadans losing their \njobs, we passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--better \nknown as the stimulus. There were many good things for Nevada and the \ncountry in that stimulus legislation. For example, millions for \neducation, millions for renewable energy development, and tax breaks \nfor the middle class.\n  Also in the stimulus was a program to incentivize advanced battery \nmanufacturing. Through this program, a $28.4 million grant was awarded \nto Rockwood Lithium of Nevada, which would help to expand and improve \nthe only operating domestic lithium facility in the country. It is \nlocated near the historic mining town of Goldfield, a place called \nSilver Peak. Nevada only has 17 counties. Esmeralda County, where this \nis located, has less than 1,000 people. So this mine is really \nimportant for our country. We are the only lithium mining facility in \nAmerica.\n  Because of the stimulus, Tesla will have access to lithium mined in \nNevada, as I indicated, for production of these batteries. But in order \nto truly promote innovation, we must as a Congress create opportunities \nfor consumers to invest in new, advanced technologies, and we haven't \ndone that. We need more tax incentives for that.\n  In 2008, we encouraged Americans to invest in the growth of the \nelectric car industry through a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the \npurchase of qualified electric vehicles. We expanded that credit in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to ensure that while \nAmericans recovered from the recession, we did so by investing in new \ntechnology that would produce lasting economic growth.\n  Tesla's investment in Nevada shows what is possible when public-\nprivate partnerships and smart Federal and State policies are \nencouraged. In the 21st century, this is how public-private \npartnerships should work, and it is so important to realize that \nthrough these grants, loans, and the private sector, working with \nStates such as Nevada and California and the Federal Government, we \nwere able to accomplish this.\n  This is a blueprint for success. Federal, State, and local leaders \nmust clear obstacles that stymie innovation and incentivize cleaner \ntechnologies. We must make it easier for industry to invest in our \ncommunities, not just in Nevada but all across America.\n  As Elon Musk, the genius who has done SpaceX, PayPal, Tesla, and so \nmany other things, said just the other day:\n\n       What the people of Nevada created is a state where you can; \n     where you are very agile, where you can do things quickly and \n     get things done. It's a real get-things-done state.\n\n  I want the Record to be spread with my public appreciation on behalf \nof all Nevadans to Governor Sandoval. His patience and diligence made \nthis possible. I congratulate him because the work he did here was \nterrific.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 21st annual \nTake Back the Night event at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV.\n  The event is one of UNLV's oldest traditions. Hosted by the wonderful \nJean Nidetch Women's Center, this event has done an amazing job of \nraising awareness about sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal \nviolence including dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. \nTake Back the Night is a worldwide event, and UNLV's branch has \nreceived numerous awards over the years. For instance, 2 years ago, as \nwell as this year, the UNLV branch won the ``Outstanding Collaborative \nProgram'' award; and in 2008, it won the ``Outstanding Annual Program/\nTradition'' award.\n  Research has shown that college age women are at the highest risk for \nall forms of violence. According to the recent report released by the \nWhite House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, the \nrisk of sexual assault is 4 times higher for women ages 16 to 24 than \nany other population group. One assessment showed that more than one-\nhalf of the campus population knows at least two people who have been \nvictims of sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, or stalking. \nPrograms and events such as Take Back the Night importantly help \nprovide survivors and victims with information about the services and \noptions available to them.\n   The Jean Nidetch Women's Center has made Take Back the Night a \ncapstone annual event at UNLV to give victims and survivors a place to \nseek advocacy and assistance. The center hosts public events in hopes \nof engaging students who may not otherwise seek help. It is an \nexceptional resource for a crucial issue that harms our society and \ncampuses not only in Nevada, but around the country.\n  I commend the Jean Nidetch Women's Center and the entire UNLV campus \nfor their commitment and dedication, and I look forward to learning \nabout their future contributions to this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5582-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5582-S5583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPRENTICESHIP AND JOBS TRAINING ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the \nApprenticeship and Jobs Training Act, legislation\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nthat I have introduced with my colleague Senator Cantwell. Few issues \nare as important to the American people as the availability of good \njobs in our communities. Unemployment in Maine and across the country \nremains unacceptably high. We must continue working together to \nidentify ways to improve job training initiatives to help people find \njobs in fields where jobs exist.\n  I have met with many business owners in Maine who have jobs available \nbut cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill these vacant \npositions. One way for employees to acquire the skills needed to thrive \nin in-demand fields is through apprenticeship programs. Apprentices get \nhands-on experience that is invaluable to employers and can help \nworkers secure a good-paying job.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, approximately 44,000 \nindividuals graduated from apprenticeship programs in 2013 nearly 1,000 \nof those individuals were from Maine. However, that number is likely \ninsufficient to meet tomorrow's needs. One manufacturer in Maine \nestimates that nearly 2.7 million manufacturing employees are expected \nto retire in the next decade. We must do all we can to ensure that an \nadequate pool of skilled workers is available to fill these good-paying \njobs.\n  Our bill helps achieve this goal by giving tax credits to businesses \nthat hire apprentices. To ensure that workers are given adequate time \nto prove their value, the apprentice must be employed for 7 months in \norder for a business to claim the credit. Our bill also provides \nincentives for experienced workers who spend at least 20 percent of \ntheir time passing their hard-earned knowledge on to the next \ngeneration. These workers would be allowed to receive some retirement \nincome early, without facing tax penalties. Finally, our bill ensures \nthat the brave men and women who defend our country are given credit \nfor the skills they learn while serving. Training received while \nserving in the Armed Forces would count toward an apprentice's training \nrequirement.\n  This bill would help better align the needs of our Nation's employers \nwith potential employees to promote hiring and the creation of new \njobs. I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill, and I am \npleased to join Senator Cantwell in introducing it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5583-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FRANKIE MUSE FREEMAN\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr President, I wish to recognize a noble Missourian, \nthe spirited and courageous Mrs. Frankie Muse Freeman. Fifty years ago \ntoday, this body confirmed Mrs. Freeman as President Lyndon B. \nJohnson's choice to be the first female Commissioner to serve on the \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She served honorably in this capacity \nfor 16 years, having been reappointed by Presidents Richard Nixon, \nGerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.\n  By the time President Johnson first nominated Mrs. Freeman to the \nCivil Rights Commission, she had worked tirelessly to end racial \ndiscrimination and secure equality, justice and fairness for every \ncitizen. Born Marie Frankie Muse on November 24, 1916 in Danville, VA \nto parents who experienced the benefits of formal education and who in \nturn supported their daughter's educational pursuits, Frankie was \neducated in Virginia and attended college at the distinguished and \nwell-known historically black college Hampton University. Almost 10 \nyears after she started college, Frankie began her law school career at \nHoward University School of Law, where she graduated second in her \nclass. Soon afterward, Frankie settled in St. Louis, MO, and began her \nsuccessful career as a civil rights attorney. She worked on a variety \nof important civil rights issues ranging from education to hiring \npractices. Most notably in 1954, Frankie argued and won the fight \nagainst racial discrimination in public housing in the landmark NAACP \ncase Davis et al. v. St. Louis Housing Authority. The following year, \nFrankie became the first associate general counsel of the St. Louis \nHousing Authority and Land Clearance Authority. Three years later in \n1958, she joined the Missouri advisory committee to the U.S. Commission \non Civil Rights. The quality and breadth of her work combined with her \npassion for advocacy eventually led to her selection as a U.S. Civil \nRights commissioner.\n  In the five decades since her historic appointment, Frankie's energy \nand devotion to justice has not diminished. She has received \nappointments from former Presidents to serve on other service-related \ncommissions. In addition, she worked as a municipal court judge for \nmany years and was instrumental in the formation of the Citizens \nCommission on Civil Rights, an organization that seeks to ensure the \nFederal Government's vigilance in its enforcement of anti-\ndiscrimination laws. In addition to this public service, Frankie wrote \na book about her storied life and career. Just 6 years ago at the age \nof 92, she retired after spending the latter part of her career in \nprivate practice. Not surprisingly, even retirement has not slowed \nFrankie down. She remains active on a number of urban and community \nservice-based social welfare boards.\n  To countless residents of my State and across the country, Frankie \nMuse Freeman is a hero. She is a woman who grew up in Jim Crow-era \nSouth when racial segregation was legal. Growing up, if Frankie wanted \nto go somewhere, her options were to either walk or take the segregated \nstreetcar. She witnessed first hand the harsh consequences of racial \ninequality and she chose to devote her entire career to ending that \ninjustice. Frankie is an inspiration to so many Americans, across all \nracial lines, and to me personally. She is a public servant whom my \nchildren and grandchildren can look up to. Because of leaders like her, \nwho fought and sacrificed but ultimately believed in our country's \nability to empathize and change, we are all better off and our lives \nmore enriched.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mrs. Frankie \nMuse Freeman on the 50th anniversary of her Senate confirmation to the \nUnited States Commission on Civil Rights. In addition, I ask my \ncolleagues to recognize Frankie's distinguished service to the people \nof this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5583-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      NEAL'S CAFE 70TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. I wish to celebrate 70 years of down-home cooking \nat Neal's CAFE in Springdale, AR.\n  Opened in 1944 by Toy and Bertha Neal, the restaurant is currently \nrun by the family's fourth generation. Over the last 70 years, Neal's \nCafe has been one of the most popular dining spots in northwest \nArkansas.\n  Neal's is not just known for its menu of delicious comfort food. It \nis also a popular gathering spot for locals to catch-up and discuss \nfamily life, politics and the Razorbacks chances on the football field \nthis week.\n  It is hard to miss the pink exterior of Neal's Cafe as you drive down \nN. Thompson Street. When you park your vehicle and step inside Neal's, \nthe unique decor of the restaurant and the aroma of fried chicken \nimmediately hit you. While fried chicken is among the most popular \ndishes at Neal's Cafe, visitors come from far and wide for the homemade \npies as well.\n  Neal's Cafe is so much more than a restaurant. It is an integral part \nof the Springdale community. The Neal family has worked relentlessly to \nmake it that way.\n  As someone who has experience starting a family business, I know how \nchallenging of an endeavor it is to get off the ground, much less be \nsuccessful to the level that the Neal family has been for the past 70 \nyears. It is a testament to the family's commitment to quality, service \nand dedication to the community.\n  As the Neal family celebrates 70 years of operating Neal's Cafe, I \nwould like to extend my wishes for many more years of serving food and \nfellowship at their Springdale institution.\n  I look forward to stopping by for some fried chicken and a slice of \ncoconut cream pie very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5583-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5583-S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JAY AND MARY SAUNDERS\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, each year, I have the honor of \nrecognizing outstanding parents who have chosen to adopt as Angels in \nAdoption. I am\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\ncontinually inspired by the number of families in Nebraska who have \nselflessly and lovingly opened their hearts to children without a \npermanent place to call home. Selecting just one family is always a \ndifficult task, but this year Jay and Mary Saunders of Bellevue stood \nout from the others. I am pleased to announce Jay and Mary Saunders of \nBellevue as 2014 ``Angels in Adoption.''\n  The Saunders have one biological son and have adopted six children: \nNick, Ian, Nathan, Haylee, Mara, Christian, and Kevin. Nick, the \neldest, is their biological child and born with special needs. \nProviding his specialized care moved the Saunders to open their home \nand hearts to adopting other children with disabilities.\n  Mary always knew she was meant to adopt and have a big family. When \nNick was 4, 2-year-old Ian entered their lives. He suffered from \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD. But the moment they \nlaid eyes on Ian, the Saunders knew he was meant to be part of their \ngrowing family.\n  Mara was adopted soon afterward. When she came to the Saunders \nthrough a private adoption, she required special needs that resulted \nfrom abuse she previously suffered. Today, Mary calls Mara her ``lifes \nwork'' and ``little guru.''\n  It wasn't long before siblings Nathan, Haylee, Christian and Kevin \nwere adopted together in March 2013, and were welcomed into the \nSaunders' growing family.\n  Throughout the past 15 years, the Saunders have worked to integrate \nimmediate and extended families. This includes the birth families of \nsome of the children. Mary often tells her children you can never have \ntoo many people ``loving you.''\n  Through hard work, compassion and a lot of love, Nick continues to \ndefy his learning disabilities--excelling in high school and planning \nto enroll in college. Ian no longer has attachment issues or suffers \nfrom ADHD. Mara has learned to deal with her emotions without \nmedication. Nathan recently won a best athlete award for the Omaha-\narea. Haylee and Christian's education has improved leaps and bounds \nsince becoming part of the Saunders family. The youngest, Kevin, \ncontinues to relish in the footsteps of his older siblings. Together, \nthe seven children continue to thrive and grow, thanks to Mary and Jay.\n  Each of the Saunders has been an inspiration to me. It is my hope and \ntheirs that their family will serve as an inspiration to others who may \nbe interested in pursuing foster care and adoption.\n  I want to again thank Mary and Jay for their work to improve the \nlives of their children and congratulate them once again on being \nselected as 2014 Angels in Adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5584-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE CANYON LAKE ALL STARS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

Mr. President, Rhode Islanders have opinions. \nLife in Rhode Island is a conversation, and in Rhode Island's ongoing \npublic conversation about who we are as a community and as a nation, a \nthoughtful voice is suddenly missing. Bob Kerr, the long time metro \ncolumnist for the Providence Journal, has been let go from the paper.\n  Bob wrote for Rhode Island's largest paper for 43 years. He spent \nthat time seeking out the people and the stories that made up the \nfabric of our State and told those stories with empathy, humor, and \nblunt honesty. One of his fellow ProJo alumni described him as ``the \nProvidence Journal's eloquent everyman.''\n  When then-executive editor Joel Rawson first asked Bob to write a \ncolumn, he had one simple instruction: ``I want to hear Rhode Island \ntalking.'' And that is just what Bob gave us, 3 mornings a week for \nmore than 20 years.\n  Bob Kerr told the story of Rhode Island through the eyes of Rhode \nIslanders. He found people whose voices were not heard and gave them a \ngiant microphone. He wrote about neighbors. He wrote about poor people. \nHe wrote about musicians. He wrote about people looking for jobs and \nthe people helping them find jobs. He even wrote about politicians. He \nwrote a lot about veterans. Bob served his country as a marine in \nVietnam, and he paid close attention to the way we treat our \nservicemembers He reminded us to keep fighting for those who fought for \nus.\n  Like an adopted conscience, Bob also kept us honest. One of his most \npopular features was the ``Clemency Coach,'' an imaginary broken-down \nbus with duct-taped seats and stuck windows that Bob cooked up to, as \nhe put it, ``give people who have done publicly embarrassing things the \ntime to get away and consider ways to make everything OK again.''\n  ``It is a bus bound for nowhere in particular.''\n  Once a season, Bob would roll out the latest Clemency Coach passenger \nlist, a who's-who of people whose behavior warranted a slap on the \nwrist or worse. Bob called out public figures and private citizens \nalike, local notables and national celebrities. I myself was dispatched \non the summer run of the Clemency Coach a year or two ago for putting \nmy foot in my mouth here in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\n  Bob's columns were a mirror that sometimes reflected our shortcomings \nbut also our shared values--our decency, integrity and compassion for \none another.\n  Like his thousands of loyal readers, I am grateful for Bob Kerr's \ncontribution to our Rhode Island community, and I wish him great luck \nand success in whatever is to come. For years, I have enjoyed, been \ninformed by, been moved by, and learned from Bob's columns. They have \nhelped make Rhode Island a better State and reminded us how good a \nState we are and can be. I hope he finds some way to keep doing them. \nHe will have at least one reader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5585-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5585-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5585-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 276.

A bill to amend the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 \nand the Educational Technical Assistance Act of 2002 to strengthen \nresearch in adult education; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Strengthening \nResearch in Adult Education Act. The recently enacted Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act recognized that the adult education \nfield has evolved from a literacy skills program to a more \ncomprehensive college and career readiness initiative to ensure that \nadult learners have the foundational skills to fully participate in the \ncommunity and compete for jobs that provide family sustaining wages. We \nneed to ensure that there is a strong research base to support this \nvital transition.\n  For 2012, data from the Program for the International Assessment of \nAdult Competencies show that an estimated 52 percent of adults ages 16-\n65 in the United States lack the literacy skills necessary to identify, \ninterpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information. These are \nessential skills for postsecondary education and the workplace. Beyond \ntheir value in the labor market, these skills are also correlated with \nhealth and civic participation. Clearly, improving adult education is \ncritically important to the health and well-being of our people, our \neconomy, and our democracy.\n  In Rhode Island, it is estimated that nearly 130,000 adults have less \nthan a high school education. Over 45,000 have limited English \nproficiency. Yet, we are reaching less than 6,000 through the current \nadult education program.\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\nClearly, we need more resources and innovative, research-based ways to \nreach more people.\n  The Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act will support the \nkey reforms to adult education in the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act by ensuring that adult education is included in our \nnational education research priorities. Specifically, the Strengthening \nResearch in Adult Education Act will amend the Education Sciences \nReform Act to require the Institute for Education Sciences and the \nNational Center for Education Statistics to collect data and carry out \nresearch on: successful state and local adult education and literacy \nactivities, the characteristics and academic achievement of adult \nlearners, and access to and opportunity for adult education in \ncommunities across the country. It will also ensure that the Institute \nof Education Sciences draws on the expertise of adult educators when \ndeveloping policies and priorities. Finally, the legislation would \nrequire that at least one research center would focus on adult \neducation.\n  These straightforward amendments to the Education Sciences Reform Act \nwill go a long way to strengthening the research base that will support \nthe improvement of adult education across the country. I was pleased to \nwork with the adult education community, and particularly, the National \nCouncil of State Directors of Adult Education in developing this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support the Strengthening Research \nin Adult Education Act and to work with me to ensure that its \nprovisions are included in the reauthorization of the Education \nSciences Reform Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/15/senate-section/article/S5590-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 544--DESIGNATING THE YEAR OF 2014 AS THE \n                ``INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF FAMILY FARMING''\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Crapo, Ms. \nHeitkamp, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Moran, and Mr. \nDonnelly) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.
