Mr. President, our great country has many friends in the \nworld. We are proud of all the alliances we have, but certainly our \ndeepest attachment is that which we have with Israel. The United States \nand Israel have stood by each other in good times, in bad times, in \ntimes of peace, and in times of war.\n  Right now our friends in the State of Israel are under attack. Hamas \ncontinues to indiscriminately fire thousands of rockets into Israel \nwith the sole objective of inflicting casualties on somebody--anybody.\n  I was watching ``NewsHour.'' Every Friday they have a commentary, \nusually by Shields and Brooks. Shields is supposedly the Democrat and \nBrooks the Republican. David Brooks said so descriptively that he had \nnever seen a conflict or read about a conflict in the past where one of \nthe participants said: Kill some more of my people.\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\n  That is what Hamas is saying. When Hamas fires these rockets, Hamas \nhas no idea whether they will land at a military installation--they \nhope; a daycare center; they don't care or an empty parking lot; they \ndon't care. They are firing these rockets indiscriminately.\n  Israel doesn't have the luxury of not worrying about where these \nrockets land. It must respond swiftly in shooting down all rockets or \nelse risk serious harm to its people. In thwarting these rocket \nattacks, Israel depends on what is termed and named the ``Iron Dome.'' \nIt is a missile defense system. But as the number of rockets being \nlaunched from Gaza continues to surge, Israel's Iron Dome resources are \nnecessarily being depleted.\n  Last week U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel requested that \nCongress allocate $225 million of emergency funding to help Israel \nreinforce its defense system. After 3 weeks of fighting Israel needs \nthese funds to replace the weaponry it has used to destroy Hamas's \nincoming rockets. But there is no guarantee that Israel won't need our \nhelp again if this conflict continues for weeks or months. What this \nfunding does do for the time being is it provides Israel with the \nresources to continue defending its people against these terrorist \nattacks.\n\n  Last Thursday the Republican leader urged the Senate to act quickly \nin approving the Defense Secretary's request. I agree with my friend \nthe Republican leader. We must pass legislation providing Israel with \nthis critical aid, but in my opinion the $225 million being requested \nis only temporary. If Hamas continues to escalate this conflict, \nIsrael's resources--including the funding requested by the Secretary of \nDefense--will quickly be depleted.\n  With its current number of batteries, Israel has to prioritize \npopulated areas and strategically important locations. The Iron Dome is \na mobile system. They have to move it around. That means, \nunfortunately, there are some Israelis still susceptible to Hamas's \nrocket attacks.\n  We should not give the Israeli people the minimum amount of aid and \nthen cross our fingers and hope it all works out in the future. Each \nmissile battery costs Israel about $50 million. Each missile Israel \nshoots to knock down one of those rockets from the Gaza Strip costs \nabout $62,000. Hamas has already fired 2,500 of those rockets in just 3 \nweeks. As we speak, they are going out and continuing to fire them. As \nwe know, they are located in schools, in neighborhoods. They are hidden \nall over--in mosques.\n  Taking into account what Israel actually needs to adequately protect \nits people, the United States and other allies should consider \nproviding more aid to do more for the Iron Dome. Our Israeli friends \nshouldn't be in the position of picking and choosing which parts of the \ncountry to defend.\n  The United States of America should live up to its commitments, \nparticularly with our friend Israel, which happens to be the only true \ndemocracy in the Middle East. We can do better and we need to go \nfurther in protecting Israel.\n  That being said, it is critical that we approve the money requested \nby Secretary Hagel now. Coming to the defense of Israel is not a \npartisan issue; it is an American principle. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans should agree on this measure.\n  Another issue we can all agree on is the emergency funding requested \nby the White House for what is going on in the western part of the \nUnited States. We should pass this immediately.\n  Over the past month or 6 weeks the State of Oregon has been on fire. \nHundreds of thousands of acres have burned. In one of the sparsely \npopulated parts of the State of Washington, more than 500 homes have \nbeen destroyed. Wildfires are all over. They are in Nevada. They are in \nCalifornia. The base of the Sierras has a big fire going in California, \nand about 1,500 acres have burned already. There is a fire now going on \nin Idaho. Oregon is on fire. There are numerous fires in Oregon. Every \nday there are reports of more and more wildfires--lightning, negligence \nof somebody who threw out a cigarette. These fires are very oppressive. \nIn the State of Nevada wide areas have been burned. The sad part is \nthat once these fires are over, we will have many native species that \nwill have been wiped out, and what will come back are invasive species, \nwhich is really not what nature intended.\n  We should work in the Senate on quickly putting together this \nfunding. We have the request. It is certainly a good request, and we \nshould get this emergency funding to the States so they can be \nprotected. When I say ``to the States,'' right now we have more than \n4,000 firefighters out there. There is an army out there fighting \nfires. It is very dangerous, as we know. Every year people are killed. \nWe know what happened in Arizona just 1\\1/2\\ years ago where 21 people \nwho were fighting fires were burned in a devastating fire. They were \ndead in a matter of a few minutes.\n  Americans living in these areas are in dire need of the Federal \nGovernment's help. There is no reason to delay getting aid to our own \npeople.\n  So as we begin this week, I am hopeful the Senate will also move \nquickly to pass legislation to aid Israel, emergency funding for \nwildfires, and the border supplemental.\n  The truth is, if the House of Representatives would vote on the \nSenate-passed comprehensive immigration reform bill, it would give \nBorder Patrol the resources it needs to address this humanitarian \ncrisis that is now on the border. That is true. But my Republican \nfriends are slow-walking this, to say the least. The senior Senator \nfrom Texas proposed a solution to this crisis. Once again, the \nlegislation is a short-term fix and does nothing to address the crisis \nat the border, while putting vulnerable children in harm's way.\n  We should approve funding for these three very important measures, \nand we should do it immediately. We should do them--separately, \ntogether, we have to get this done. Leaving here with Israel being \nnaked, as they are, with these wildfires raging, and the crisis at the \nborder--it would be a shame if we did nothing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4976-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am here to talk about some complex \nlitigation on Chinese drywall. But before I do, this week seems to be \nthe week if we are going to get anything done to assist the \nadministration with regard to all of these children showing up at the \nborder. It has diminished over the last few weeks. Nevertheless, there \nhas still been an influx that we have all read about. Senator Mikulski, \nthe chairman of Appropriations, has roughly a $2.7 million supplemental \nappropriations bill. It would be this Senator's intention--and I think \nI can speak for several other Senators who feel very strongly--that we \nhave not addressed the very root cause of the problem, which is that \nthe drugs in huge shipments on boats coming from South America into \nthose three Central American countries with boatloads of cocaine, \ncarrying 1 to 3 tons of cocaine apiece, have not been interdicted. It \nwas riveting testimony that our four-star Marine commander General \nKelly of the U.S. Southern Command pointed out that he, his staff, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force that is headquartered in Key West have to \nwatch 75 percent of those boats coming in from the Caribbean in the \neast into Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador and the Pacific on the \nwest--they have to watch 75 percent of them get through. They cannot do \nanything about it because they don't have the Navy ships or the Coast \nGuard cutters with the helicopters that can interdict them. If we did \nthat we would diminish a lot of the flow of those drugs. And you wonder \nwhy are all the children showing up. A number of us have made several \nspeeches about this and I will not go back into all of that. Suffice it \nto say that the drug lords basically control the countries because they \nare in cahoots with the criminal networks that have taken over and \nviolence has erupted.\n\n  Remember, Honduras is the No. 1 murder capital of the world. What is \na parent going to do? Their child has to join the drug gang or they are \ngoing to go to their child's funeral because they will kill him if he \ndoesn't.\n  No. 3, they are seduced by these coyotes who have this network to get \nimmigrants to the north into Texas, and they are telling them they can \nget in--just send your child. You pay me $1,500, $5,000 a child; we \nwill get them in. Now that is going back to the root cause of the \nproblem. If we stop all the drugs going in, maybe governments such as \nthat of President Hernandez of Honduras will have a chance of stopping \nsome of the corruption that is so rife in that government and the local \ngovernments and the local police forces.\n  We have gone over and over this before, and I just want to say that \nthis Senator and others--particularly Senator Kaine who knows this \nissue well. He was a missionary when he was in law school. He took a \nyear off from law school. Senator Kaine of Virginia lived in Honduras. \nHe speaks fluent Spanish. He knows this problem as well. If we could \nhave a greater percentage of those drugs interdicted, then we would \nseriously start to diminish all of this migration to the north through \nthe rest of Central America and through Mexico to the Texas border.\n  In closing, why are the children not coming from the other three \ncountries right there--Belize, Nicaragua, Panama; Costa Rica, a fourth \ncountry--in Central America? The children are not coming from those \nareas. They are coming from the three where all the drugs are and where \nthe drug lords have taken over. I hope the Senate will react with some \nrationality, and as difficult as it is going to be to pass a \nsupplemental appropriations bill down at the other end of this hall in \nthe House of Representatives, putting money in there to activate Coast \nGuard cutters--there are a number of them out in San Diego that are \ninactive--activate them and give the U.S. Navy the ability to \nreposition ships--it might actually help us pass this supplemental \nappropriations bill down there at the other end of the hallway in the \nHouse of Representatives. We have just a few days to pass this. I am \nhoping we are going to be able to do so.\n\n\n                            Chinese Drywall\n\n  I came to the floor to tell you about Chinese drywall. You cannot see \nit. This is a normal piece of drywall. It is cut off here. It is very \nfaint on this picture I have in the chamber where you can see the \nmarking that this is from China. This photograph doesn't tell us much, \nbut let me tell you what Chinese drywall has done to the people of this \ncountry, making them unable to live in their houses because there is \nsome kind of sulfuric content in this Chinese drywall that emits a gas \nand the occupants of a house such as this get sick. I can tell you what \nit smells like. It smells like rotten eggs. I have such sensitive air \npassages that when I walked in, all of a sudden my eyes were watering, \nmy nose was stopping up, and I was starting to cough. That was just a \nfew minutes in a house with Chinese drywall.\n  If you can imagine, what if somebody cannot sell the house because \nthe mortgage company will not cooperate. They are stuck. They cannot \nsell their house because who is going to buy a house with defective \nChinese drywall. They cannot get a loan for their house. What would \nhave happened if back at the severe time in the 2004-2005 timeframe--\nand then they got hit with a big recession coming in 2007, 2008--what \nwould have happened if they didn't have a job and were stuck with the \nhouse and everybody was getting sick in the house?\n  The Chinese Government has had continued and repeated failure to \nparticipate in the legal process of this country to help the homeowners \nwho were severely impacted by this problem with Chinese drywall.\n  Here is how it started. We had a few hurricanes in 2004 and 2005. The \nbig one everybody remembers is Katrina in 2005, but there was one year \nbefore Katrina when four hurricanes hit the Florida Peninsula all \nwithin the span of a month and a half. Therefore, there was a lot of \ncleanup and a lot of rebuilding because of the damage the hurricanes \nhad done. Normal drywall manufacturers and distributors and suppliers \nran out, so they asked for extra drywall coming from China. It was \ncoming from a Chinese company, but it was basically owned by the \nChinese Government. So we had a housing boom to recover from the \nhurricanes, and as a result we had in the gulf coast area these \nrebuilding efforts to recover.\n  A number of builders and contractors imported this defective and \nsickly drywall. It started causing problems the minute people walked \ninto the repaired home. They reported that it smelled like sulfur, \nrotten eggs. They would have metal corrosion. Let me show you a picture \nof an air-conditioner. This photograph doesn't do it justice, but these \nare all the coils on the air-conditioner, and on close inspection we \ncan see that every one of these coils--these metal parts--are corroded.\n  I went into a home that had their silverware--the silverware--totally \ncorroded. Any metal parts in the house were totally corroded. People \nstarted reporting the health effects, and following all these reports \nseveral Federal agencies, including the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, started looking into the problem.\n  I must say there were a number of Senators who had to start kicking \ndown the door to get them to pay attention. This Senator from a State \nthat was severely affected was one of them, and the Senator from \nLouisiana who sits right here. After she had all the problems of \nHurricane Katrina, the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, started \nraising Cain, and they found that this sulfur emission from this \ndefective drywall was causing the corrosion and the property damage as \nwell as the health effects. But these agencies, once they did that--and \nI must say we had to urge and urge and urge the agencies, but they \nweren't able to offer any kind of financial assistance.\n  As I laid out in my opening comments, what was a homeowner to do. \nThey couldn't get the bank to go along. They couldn't get the insurance \ncompany to go along. By the way, the insurance company said: We are not \ncovering this as a defect in the house. So the homeowners didn't have \nany other recourse than to join a lawsuit against the responsible \nChinese parties. Much of this litigation was consolidated in Federal \ndistrict court in New Orleans in a multidistrict litigation. After an \nextensive period of discovery, the judge ordered it was determined that \ntwo Chinese manufacturers and their affiliates were responsible for \nmost of the problem drywall: Knauf Plasterboard Tainjin and its \nassociated affiliates, Knauf Industries. Knauf was a German company \nthat imported and distributed this drywall. The other one was Taishan \nGypsum Company and its affiliates.\n  The Knauf entities agreed to appear in court on this litigation. \nKnauf reached a global settlement that allowed many of the homeowners \nwith Knauf drywall to remediate their homes, get the plasterboard torn \nout. They often had to redo anything that was metal, such as pipes, \nair-conditioners, and so forth, and be able to get on with their lives.\n  Taishan has refused to participate in the multidistrict litigation, \ndespite the fact that several of the plaintiffs in this litigation \nserved Taishan officials in China. This Senator went to China and \ntalked to their equivalent of our Consumer Product Safety Commission. \nEarly on I talked to them, and in essence they blew me off. They were \nserved legal process in the lawsuit\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\nunder an international agreement called the Hague Convention on the \nService Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and \nCommercial Matters. It is the Hague Convention, of which the United \nStates and China are both signatories. Taishan thumbed its nose at \neverybody and failed to appear in court in cases where they had been \nproperly served under the Hague Convention. The judge in this \nlitigation then entered default judgments against Taishan for damages \nresulting from the defective drywall.\n\n  Listen to this. Rather than pay these claims under court order, \nTaishan then retained counsel. They refused to do anything up to that \npoint. When they were docked by the judge, they retained counsel in the \nUnited States for the sole purpose of contesting the district court's \njurisdiction and they appealed the case to the court of appeals.\n  In January of this year a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit \nunanimously upheld that the U.S. courts had proper jurisdiction over \nTaishan and could enforce the default judgment. In addition, Taishan \nlet the time limit to file an appeal with the Supreme Court expire. You \nwould have thought this would have spurred this Chinese company and its \naffiliates to do the right thing and finally reach a settlement, but, \nunfortunately, they thumbed their noses again.\n  Instead, Taishan told the district court's Federal judge that it was \nwalking away and would no longer make any appearances in the court.\n  Well, there is a judge down in New Orleans named Judge Fallon, and \nneedless to say that didn't go over too well with him. In July--earlier \nthis month--Judge Fallon issued an order holding Taishan in both civil \nand criminal contempt. He enjoined Taishan and any of its affiliates \nfrom conducting business in the United States until it participates in \nthe judicial process. He also took the unusual step--because he wanted \neverybody in the U.S. Government to understand the gravity of his \norder--to send the contempt order to the U.S. Attorney General, the \nSecretary of State, and Members of Congress to express his frustration \non how Taishan--and therefore the Chinese Government--was flouting \ninternational and U.S. law. I am very grateful to Judge Fallon. He has \ntaken this action to ensure that this rogue company and its rogue \ngovernment are prohibited from conducting any business in the United \nStates until they participate in this judicial process and take \nresponsibility for their actions.\n  We can't issue that against the Chinese Government. It is against \nthis company and its affiliates. But make no mistake. This company is \nowned by the Chinese Government.\n  What does this say about our policy of letting Chinese manufacturers \nimport pretty much any kind of consumer product they want into this \ncountry without mandating any legal recourse if something goes wrong? \nWe thought that was covered under the Hague Convention. What does this \nsay about Chinese companies that routinely ignore service of process \nunder ratified international conventions?\n  The reason for this speech is to call on Taishan and the Chinese \nGovernment to do the right thing: Stop hiding and finally help the \nhomeowners who have had their lives turned upside down at great \nfinancial and personal health loss by your defective product. If they \ndon't, then I think it is time for the Senate to take action to make \nsure the Chinese and other foreign manufacturers are held financially \naccountable for defective products.\n  As I close I wish to reiterate why this case is so important. My \nconstituents are certainly aggrieved, as are Senator Landrieu's \nconstituents and a number of constituents in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, by this defective drywall.\n  Why is this case so important? Its implications are far broader than \nthe issues presented in this litigation. It poses a defining moment for \nthe Chinese Government and its companies, which raises grave questions \nas to the risk of doing business with the Chinese.\n  Will the Chinese Government and its companies honor their moral and \nlegal obligations under this or any other commercial contract? Will the \nChinese Government and its companies which have profited from the sale \nof defective products to consumers here in the United States continue \nto flee court jurisdiction when sued or will they honor moral and legal \nobligations to appear in court, defend themselves, and satisfy an \nadverse judgment?\n  If the Chinese Government and its companies will flee jurisdiction in \nthis case, when they fear or are faced with an adverse judgment, can \nany company or any individual or any party afford the risk of doing \nbusiness with the Chinese Government or its companies?\n  If China will run from the law here in the United States, will it not \nrun from the law everywhere else?\n  I rest my case, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are entering a momentous week. \nCongress must face the reality that President Obama is moving towards a \ndecision whereby he would issue Executive orders in direct \ncontravention of long-established American law that would grant \nadministrative amnesty and work permits to 5 to 6 million persons who \nare unlawfully in this country. This is after Congress has explicitly \nrefused demands to change the law to suit his desire.\n  The current law is plain. Those who enter this great Nation by \nunlawful means, or who overstay their visa, are subject to removal and \nare ineligible to work. Indeed, I will read one portion of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, section 274, which makes employment of \nunauthorized aliens unlawful. ``In general, it is unlawful for any \nperson or other entity to hire or to recruit or refer for a fee for \nemployment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an \nunauthorized alien.'' That is the law of the United States.\n  It is plain. Those who enter by unlawful entry are subject to removal \nand ineligible to work. That is just one of the provisions, and it is \nour law. Our law is right and just, and it comports with the laws of \ncivilized nations the world over, and if followed, will serve the \nhonorable and legitimate interests of this Nation and her people.\n  The National Journal, Time magazine, The Hill, and others, are \nreporting that by the end of summer President Obama--sore at Congress, \nand by implication at the American people--plans, by the stroke of a \npen, to do what the law expressly forbids: to provide amnesty and work \npermits for millions. This would be in the contravention of his duty \nand his oath to see that the laws of the United States are faithfully \nenforced, and it would be a direct challenge to the clear powers of \nCongress to make laws.\n  Congress makes law and the executive branch executes those laws. It \nis that simple. The President's actions are astonishing and are taking \nour Nation into exceedingly dangerous waters. Such calculated action \nstrains the constitutional structure of our Republic. Such unlawful and \nunconstitutional action, if taken, cannot stand. No Congress--with \nRepublicans or Democrats in the majority--can allow such action to \noccur or to be maintained. The people will not stand for it. They must \nnot stand for it.\n  Mr. President: My petition is that you pull back. It is utterly \nunacceptable for you to meet with special interest groups, such as the \nNational Council of La Raza and others, and then promise an action to \nthem that is contrary to law. Such actions would be wrong. It would be \nan affront to the people of this country which they will never forget. \nIt would be a permanent stain on your Presidency. I urge you to make \nclear you will not do this.\n  I am not suggesting negotiations or any parley or any compromise. \nThere is no middle ground on nullifying immigration law by the \nPresident. Some of your people--maybe bright, young staffers--think the \nPresident can intimidate Congress, that the Chief Executive can make \nsuch a threat and the lawmakers will just cower under their desks. That \nis wrong, sir. You cannot intimidate Congress--or the American people \nwho sent them here, for that matter. Simply put, that which you desire \nis beyond your lawful reach. This is the time for administration \nofficials to urge restraint within the White House. It is critical that \nthe Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the White \nHouse legal counsel do their duty and give the only advice they can \ngive: ``Do not do this, Mr. President.'' ``You cannot do this, Mr. \nPresident.'' That is what they need\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\nto say. They know that is the right answer, and they should stand up \nand say no.\n  Some of the best work advisers can do is to head off a disaster \nbefore it happens. CEOs, business types, politicians, Governors, and \nmayors get headstrong sometimes. In those instances, to avoid disaster, \ntheir advisers need to stand up and be counted.\n  Just as the unlawful DACA amnesty for young people created an \nunprecedented and unlawful flow of more young people, that initiative \nhas now, it seems, encouraged the President to take even more unlawful \naction for millions of adults this time, the papers say, by a 10-fold \nincrease. If millions are given amnesty by Executive order, we can be \nsure that the result will be that even more adults--by the millions--\nwill be coming here unlawfully in the future.\n  It will collapse any remaining moral authority of our immigration law \nand undermine the sovereignty of our Nation. If you don't have a \nlegitimate, lawful system of immigration that you can enforce and abide \nby, then you have undermined the very sovereignty of your Nation. It \namounts, in effect, to an open borders policy that has never been the \npolicy of any developed Nation that I am aware of and has been rejected \nby Congress and the American people repeatedly.\n  In effect, the President is preparing to assume for himself the \nabsolute power to set immigration law in America: Well, I'll just \nenforce what I wish to enforce, with the absolute power to determine \nwho may enter and who may work, no matter what the law says--by the \nmillions.\n  Our response now is of great import. It will define the scope of \nexecutive and congressional powers for years to come. If President \nObama is not stopped in this action and exceeds his powers by \nattempting to execute such a massive amnesty contrary to law, the moral \nauthority for any immigration enforcement henceforth will be \neviscerated. Anyone the world over will get the message: Get into \nAmerica by any method you can and you will never have to leave.\n\n  We are almost there, but it is not too late. I have studied this \nissue. It is absolutely not too late for us to restore a lawful system \nthat treats applicants who come to America fairly and serves the \nnational interest. This can be done; we just need a Chief Executive who \nleads.\n  Let me state a warning.\n  For the more purely political in Washington, the results of the \nrecent primary elections show that the American people are being roused \nto action and, once activated, their power will be felt. They will not \nbe mocked. They have begged and pleaded for our Nation's immigration \nlaws to be enforced for 30 or 40 years. The politicians have refused--\nrefused, refused, refused. They have defeated amnesty after amnesty \nafter amnesty, and they will not sit back and allow the President to \nimplement through unlawful fiat what they have defeated through the \ndemocratic process. They must not yield to this.\n  There is one thing that powers in Washington fear, and that is being \nvoted out of office. Before a Member of Congress acquiesces to any \naction of this kind, they should consider their responsibility to their \nconstituents.\n  No Member in either party--Republican or Democrat--should support any \nborder legislation that moves through this Senate that does not \nexpressly prohibit these planned executive actions by the President, \nand that prohibits any expenditure of funds to implement them. There \ncan be no retreat on this point. We simply need to say the Chief \nExecutive of these United States cannot expend any money to execute a \nplan of amnesty. Surely that would end it.\n  All of this is grim talk, but the situation is stark. Congressional \naction this week to bar unilateral, imperial action by the President is \nsurely the best course to head off what could be a constitutional \ncrisis. It will be good for the President because it will stop him from \ntaking a step that will permanently mar his Presidency and the office \nof the President. It will avoid a major governmental disruption at a \ntime when the Nation faces many threats. It will protect the rule of \nlaw and the constitutional order whereby Congress makes laws and the \nPresident executes them, whether he likes them or not.\n  We have heard it said the President must act because Congress refused \nto act. Well, that is not so. Congress considered his proposal, they \nlooked at existing law today, and Congress made a decision. They did \nnot pass what the President proposed. They decided to stay with current \nlaw. So I would say that is a decision and a clear action by Congress. \nAnd his statement that Congress doesn't act; therefore, I can use my \npen to act--it is not correct. It is absolutely false and contrary to \nour constitutional traditions.\n  Pulling back at this time will avoid a major governmental disruption \nat a time when we are facing threats all over the world. There is much \ninstability. As someone said, the wheels seem to be coming off in every \narea of the globe and at home. The last thing we need is a major, \nintense, internal battle with the President over illegal actions he \nwould like to take.\n  It will also help reestablish the constitutional power of Congress to \nmake laws and perhaps mark the end of this Congress's acquiescence to \nexecutive overreach.\n  Professor Jonathan Turley has expressed amazement that Congress has \nbeen silent in the face of some of the most imperial Presidential \nactions ever, and he explicitly considers President Obama's actions on \nimmigration to be one of those. But there are a host of others.\n  It will stop millions of work authorizations for those who would then \nbe able to take any job in America at a time of high unemployment and \nfalling wages. In this way, standing up to the President's action would \nprotect American workers. We have the largest percentage of working-age \nAmericans who are unemployed since the 1970s, and people need to know \nthat a lot of the recent job numbers that are cited with such positive \nspin include unprecedented numbers of individuals on part-time work. \nThese are not full-time jobs, many of them. An unprecedentedly high \nnumber of those jobs are part-time jobs. We are not doing well. This \ncountry does not have a shortage of labor. It just does not. It has a \nshortage of jobs. And recent immigrants--Hispanics and others who are \ncoming to America--are having a hard time getting jobs too. Would it \nhelp them to have millions more competing for the limited number of \njobs out there? Would it help poor working people all over America? \nWould it help African Americans? The experts tell us absolutely not. In \nfact, the Congressional Budget Office has told us that if this kind of \nmass amnesty were to be adopted, wages in America would fall for a \ndecade.\n  So let this clearly be known: The Congress of the United States and \nthe President of the United States are given only limited powers by our \nConstitution. They are not unlimited. Neither the President nor \nCongress can do anything it wants to do. It was set up that way from \nthe very beginning.\n  Mr. President: You work for the American people. They don't work for \nyou, and they will not accept nullification of their law passed by \ntheir elected representatives. The American people are not going to \naccept it. They are going to fight this. I am confident they will. They \nwill resist.\n  Every Member of this Congress--Republican or Democrat--will face a \ntime of choosing this week. Directly or indirectly, every Member will \nbe asked to support and cosponsor legislation that would stop these \nactions by the President. It is not hard to do. It will be a simple \nchoice that people will remember: Do you support and approve the \nPresident's proposed actions? For those who cosponsor legislation to \nstop this illegality, their answer will be clear. For those who refuse \nto take simple action to stop it, they will have voted to enable what \nthe National Journal has rightly called ``explosive action'' by the \nPresident. ``Explosive action.'' And, indeed it is. This immigration \ndebate is important. People have invested time and energy and heart and \nsoul into it, on both sides. Good people have debated it. Congress has \nmade a decision. The President is not now entitled unilaterally to \nassert his position. Indeed, he told some of these activist groups not \nlong ago that he did not have the power to do what they were asking him \nto do. Now he suggests he does before the end of the summer.\n\n  So I am calling on all Members of Congress today to stand up to these\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\nlawless actions and sponsor legislation that will block them. I am \ncalling on all Members of Congress today to oppose any border \nsupplemental that does not include such language. I am calling on every \nperson in this body, and in the House of Representatives, to stand and \nbe counted at this perilous hour.\n  I am calling on the American people to ask their representatives: \nWhere do you stand on this, Senator? Where do you stand on this, \nCongressman? All of us were elected by American citizens to serve them \nand to serve and honor their Constitution that is our birthright. Will \nwe answer that call? Where will history record that each of us stood at \nthis important time? I believe the answer should be clear: We stand for \nlaw. We stand for the Constitution. We stand for an honorable, lawful \nimmigration system that treats everyone fairly and serves the national \ninterests of the people of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here because in the next week we \nare going to, it looks, vote on a House-passed bill to prevent an \nimpending highway funding gap. We must pass this bill to avoid funding \ndisruptions and to avoid all the job losses that would follow from \nfunding disruptions, all of which could begin literally in weeks if we \ndid not pass the bill.\n  But I have to say the House highway bill is woefully inadequate. It \nis, frankly, a pathetic measure. It fails at virtually every measure, \nmost particularly failing to provide the leadership and the certainty \nall of our States need so badly as they seek to implement their highway \nprograms.\n  The only positive thing that can be said about this bill is it is \nbetter than no bill at all and a collapse of the highway fund. But that \nis not much of a commendation. The American Society of Civil Engineers \ngives America's roads a letter grade of D, our bridges only a C-plus.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, we have been around a long time. We were \none of the founding Colonies. We have a lot of old roads, a lot of old \ninfrastructure. We have a lot of stuff that dates a long way back. Our \ninfrastructure, for that reason, is among the worst in the Nation, with \n41 percent of our roads in poor condition, 57 percent of our bridges \nrated deficient or obsolete.\n  Last Friday I visited one of our bridges, the Great Island Bridge in \nNarragansett, RI. This bridge is the sole access to an island community \nof 350 homes. It has been rated functionally obsolete and it must be \nreplaced. If that bridge fails, the island's residents have no way to \nget to or from their homes.\n  I will vote for this House bill to avoid that kind of catastrophe. \nBut we are wasting an opportunity to do more, to do a responsible \nhighway bill. We actually have a pretty good model. The Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, on which I serve, actually \npassed a bipartisan, multiyear infrastructure investment plan. That is \nwhat we need. A 6-year bill is what EPW passed. That is the kind of \ncertainty our highway departments need so they can sign contracts for \nlong-term projects.\n  Sadly, the Republicans in the House could not manage that. The House-\npassed bill will extend the authorization for a mere 8 months. The EPW \nbill, the 6-year bill written by Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member \nVitter, in bipartisan fashion would reauthorize our Nation's highway \nprograms for 6 years, through 2020.\n  Our committee has done its part to move a 6-year bill in the regular \norder, in a bipartisan fashion. The House, once again, has failed. \nStates need budget certainty to plan multiyear construction projects. \nThat should be obvious enough even for the House to understand. To the \nmillions of Americans who depend on Federal highway funding, either \ndirectly or indirectly, for their paychecks, for their livelihoods, the \npaltry 8-month extension says to them and their families: You have work \nuntil next May. That is not what these workers need and that is not \nwhat our 50 States need. They need long-term certainty, and this bill \nfails them.\n  I plan to support the Carper-Corker-Boxer amendment which would force \nthat debate this year so we do not go home at the end of this Congress \nwithout having passed a serious highway bill. There is no reason the \nAmerican people should have to wait until 2015 for the certainty and \nsecurity of a long-term highway bill, plus no guarantee we will do it \neven in 2015. If the House cannot do a long-term bill now, what makes \nthem think they can do a long-term bill later? Let's roll up our \nsleeves and pass a long-term highway bill this year.\n  The House bill also fails to provide any real solution to highway \nfunding, to the widening revenue gap in the highway trust fund. The \nFederal gas tax of 18.4 cents a gallon is not indexed to inflation and \nCongress has not touched it in 20 years. So it should be no surprise \nthat it is no longer providing the revenue support it used to.\n  Plus, thankfully, cars are more fuel efficient, which is great for \ndrivers--it lowers their fuel expenses--but it lowers highway revenues \nfurther. The House bill completely ignores that larger problem of how \nwe pay for our highways in favor of a short-term funding patch with \ngimmicky one-time budget offsets that have nothing to do with highway \nuse.\n\n  We had the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee say: Sure, raise the highway tax a little bit. Let's \nget built the infrastructure this country needs. But instead of \ncrafting a responsible long-term highway plan, the House Republicans \nare running scared from tea party groups, tea party groups that do not \nthink the Federal Government should invest in infrastructure at all.\n  The Club for Growth, so called, went so far last week as to say the \nhighway trust fund--and I am quoting them here--``should not even \nexist.'' Funny how Republican Presidents--Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, \nFord, Bush, and Bush--all managed to accept the idea of a Federal \nhighway system, not thinking that there was anything unusual or \nimproper about that.\n  Well, today's far-right extremists have gone way beyond them. They \nhave gone way beyond the American people. The American people \noverwhelmingly support Federal infrastructure investments. According to \na recent poll commissioned by the American Automobile Association, more \nthan two-thirds of Americans believe the Federal Government should \ninvest more in roads, bridges, and mass transit systems.\n  We may as Americans have differing views on many issues, but when it \ncomes to investing in the roads and bridges we all use, there is, \nunsurprisingly, broad agreement except, of course, at the far-right \nfringe where people hate the government so much they want the rest of \nus to drive on bad roads and obsolete bridges. But that kind of extreme \nideology hits Americans in the pocketbook.\n  Rhode Islanders, for example, pay an estimated $467 extra each year \nfor car repairs due to bad roads and potholes. So if you are looking \nout for the ordinary American, if you are looking out for the ordinary \nAmerican consumer, if you are looking out for the ordinary American \nconsumer's pocketbook, you will invest in infrastructure so our cars \nare not being banged up and beaten up on bad roads, obsolete bridges, \nand unfilled potholes.\n  I am going to hold my nose and vote for this House-passed bill, \nbecause at this point the only alternative is a shutdown of the highway \nprogram. But let's be clear: This bill is a joke that does nothing on \nlong-term investments in our infrastructure, nothing in a sustainable \nway to pay for them. We should not procrastinate until next May. We \nshould start right now by building off of the bipartisan 6-year bill \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee passed to give our \nconstituents the infrastructure investments they are counting on us \nfor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Manufacturing Jobs\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \njobs, about manufacturing jobs in particular.\n  As we in the Senate get ready to leave Washington and return home to \nour States for August, it has become popular in the media to say our \nlegislative work is done; that it is mostly about campaigning from here \non out, for the weeks, the months remaining until the election in \nNovember. After all, we hear reported this is a body so divided, so \nriven by gridlock and partisanship that we haven't gotten a lot done, \nand the prospect for getting more done is even less.\n  Although I have certainly been frustrated by the pace of progress at \ntimes, this story not only gets a lot of things wrong, it is \ncounterproductive and at times even self-fulfilling.\n  Let me start with the fact that we can, and we have, gotten important \nthings done for manufacturing and for our economy and for our States as \na whole.\n  Last year 26 of my Democratic colleagues, including the Presiding \nOfficer, joined an initiative called Manufacturing Jobs for America, or \nMJA. The goal of Manufacturing Jobs for America has been simple: put \ntogether a collection of our best ideas--our best ideas--to spur \nmanufacturing, job creation, to work with Republicans to find common \nground, and to get these bills passed. We are focusing on manufacturing \nas a group of Senators because it is the foundation of our economy. It \nis the foundation of the pathway toward a middle class. Manufacturing \njobs pay more in benefits and contribute more to the local economy than \nany other sector, fueling growth in other sectors.\n  Manufacturing is also incredibly innovative. Manufacturers invest the \nmost in research and development of any industrial sector.\n  We have focused on four different broad areas in the MJA initiative: \ntraining a 20th century workforce; expanding access to capital for \nbusinesses looking to expand and invest in growth; leveling the global \ntrade playing field and opening markets abroad; and focusing our \ngovernment behind a national manufacturing strategy.\n  These are the four main areas of focus for Manufacturing Jobs for \nAmerica, and together we have introduced over 30 bills, nearly half of \nwhich are bipartisan bills, with Republicans joining us in advancing \nthese ideas. Together, we have made real progress in moving the ball \nforward. Already, five of these bills have passed out of committee. \nThree of them would take further steps to give startups and small \nbusinesses access to the research and development tax credit which came \nout of the Finance Committee. Two others passed as part of a single \npackage to create a national manufacturing strategy and improve STEM \neducation in our high schools and colleges that came out of the \ncommerce committee. There is no reason that, working together, we can't \nget these bipartisan bills passed through the full Senate before the \nend of this Congress.\n  This isn't just wishful thinking. We have already seen seven \nprovisions from Manufacturing Jobs for America bills enacted into law \nas well. In last year's Defense Authorization Act we included an MJA \namendment that streamlines regulations and makes it easier for small \nbusinesses to do work with the Federal Government. Recently, as a \nresult of our work to ensure innovative small businesses and startups \ncan access the research and development tax credit, the administration \ntook executive action to implement another MJA provision, and just last \nweek the House and Senate came together to pass the broad bipartisan \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to reform and streamline our \nNation's job training programs--a bill that ultimately included five \nseparate MJA provisions within it, and a bill that has now been signed \ninto law by our President.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act was years in the making, \nand its success is in no small part due to the relentless efforts of my \ncolleagues Senators Murray and Isakson--Democrat and Republican--as \nwell as Senators Harkin and Alexander, who have worked for years to get \nthis over the finish line. Their success in crafting this bill and in \nbuilding bipartisan support for it is a lesson for all of us, and it is \na large example of what we have tried to do, bit by bit, for other \nmanufacturing bills.\n  To me, it is really about determination. We have shown it is possible \nto get things done if we relentlessly seek common ground, if we engage \noutside groups, if we strengthen the quality of the ideas, and if we \nbuild bipartisan paths toward success.\n  One of our country's biggest challenges is the rapid pace of change \nin our globally interconnected economy. The middle-class jobs of today \nand tomorrow require higher skill levels than ever before as the \neconomy continues to evolve. America needs a system that emphasizes \nlifelong learning, learning on the job, and constant adjustment. This \nis a challenge that Members of both parties are well aware of and are \ndedicated to stepping up and meeting. That is what the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act is all about.\n  To put it in some context, by 2022 we are projected to have 11 \nmillion fewer workers with postsecondary education than our economy \nwill need. But by consolidating 15 outdated or redundant Federal job \ntraining programs, by creating new board accountability standards, and \nby giving cities and States the flexibility to meet their economy's \nunique local needs, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will \nhelp us make up that shortfall.\n\n  I was at the bill signing last week at the White House, along with \nthe Senators whom I cited who led the charge on this, and it was \nuplifting to see the positive impact that came out of uniting in such a \nbroadly bipartisan way on such an important issue as job skills for the \nmodern manufacturing workforce for America.\n  On a week when Congress came together to improve our investment in \nAmerica's workers, Vice President Biden also released a critical report \nthat had great contributions from the Secretaries of Commerce, \nEducation, and Labor--a critical report that details a number of other \nsteps the administration is taking as a complement to that new law, the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, to equip our workers for the \n21st century economy.\n  As we get ready this week to return to our home States and to hear \nfrom our constituents in August, there is no reason to stop legislating \nthis week and when we return in September. That is why I am introducing \nanother bill as part of Manufacturing Jobs for America, a bill called \nManufacturing Universities Act of 2014.\n  This bill will take on a simple but important challenge. Because \ntoday's manufacturing jobs require higher skill levels than ever--\nhigher skill levels than yesterday's assembly line jobs, our schools \nand in particular universities need to be equipping students with those \nskills. Since innovation and research and development keep leading to \nnew materials and new technologies that are critical to keeping \nAmerican manufacturing at the cutting edge of the global economy, we \nalso need to connect our universities with our manufacturers.\n  The manufacturing universities bill would create a competitive grant \nprogram that would ultimately designate 25 American universities as \nmanufacturing universities. The competition would incentivize schools \nto build engineering programs that are targeted, that are focused on \n21st century manufacturing and the skills our workers need to thrive. \nThis would allow the cycle of innovation that can begin in the \nlaboratory, that can mature in a factory, and that can produce more \ncompetitive products of the market to be fully harnessed around the \nchallenge of meeting the 21st century manufacturing environment. That \nwould build on important work that is already being done to link \nuniversities all the way to the shop floor but where we are not doing \nas much as we can and should with Federal grant funds that go to \nuniversities for research, to make them relevant and to make them \ncurrent and to make them competitive.\n  For example, in my home State of Delaware, this bill, if enacted into \nlaw, could help the University of Delaware bolster its work with the \nprivate sector, focus its work with the Delaware Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership,\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\nfocus the partnership between Delaware Technical and Community College, \nDelaware State University, and our manufacturing community in Delaware, \nto ensure that manufacturing becomes a larger part of the University of \nDelaware's engineering curriculum and the training and research and \noutreach conducted by Del State and Del Tech.\n  The competitive challenges of the 21st century are big, but we have \nevery reason to be united around meeting them. Manufacturing Jobs for \nAmerica, like the Manufacturing Universities Act, take simple steps to \ninvest in America's workers so they can drive our innovation and growth \ntoday and tomorrow, and take simple steps to make sure we are being as \ncompetitive as possible, that we are growing the best jobs possible for \nour home States and for our whole country.\n  Let's come together in a bipartisan way. Let's build on the success \nwe have already seen across the different skills initiatives I have \ndiscussed. Just because elections are coming up this fall doesn't mean \nwe can't continue to get behind great ideas--whether Democrat or \nRepublican, whether from the House or the Senate--to move our Nation \nforward, and to create great jobs for all our States and all our \ncommunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, last week I explained why I oppose the \nnomination of Pamela Harris to the Fourth Circuit. I wish to raise \nseveral other aspects of her record that I find troubling, but before I \naddress the specifics of this nominee, I need to place this nomination \nin context.\n  Last November, when the distinguished majority leader decided to toss \naside an institution almost as old as the Senate itself, he claimed \nthat breaking the rules was necessary because of an imminent crisis in \nthe DC Circuit--not a judicial emergency; the numbers made it plain \nthere was no judicial emergency, but a crisis that required radical \naction. That was after we had already confirmed the President's first \nnominee to the DC Circuit by a unanimous vote of 97 to 0. As I said in \nNovember, there was no crisis.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, as of \nSeptember 2013, the DC Circuit had 149 pending appeals for each active \njudge, by far the lightest caseload of any of the Nation's 13 circuit \ncourts of appeals. The number of cases filed in that circuit decreased \nby almost 5 percent during the year 2013. So the only crisis the \ndistinguished majority leader was responding to was one he and the \nObama White House had manufactured. Instead, in an exercise of raw \npolitical power he decided to stack the DC Circuit by ramming through \nthree of the President's nominees simultaneously. It turns out that the \ncrisis was just an excuse for a political power grab, plain and simple, \nand everyone knew it. Despite the denials from the other side, all the \nsigns were there for anyone and anybody who cared to see those signs.\n\n  In May of last year the distinguished majority leader said the DC \nCircuit was ``wreaking havoc with the country'' and that he was going \n``to do something about it.'' I am not going to recount how many of my \nDemocratic colleagues repeatedly blocked President Bush's nominees to \nthat court when they were in the minority. Those were and remain \nnominees of the highest quality who deserved a vote but never got such \na vote. Suffice it to say then that during the Bush administration, \nwhen the parliamentary shoe was on the other foot, the distinguished \nDemocratic leader claimed the filibuster was a sacred institution. \nTimes surely have changed.\n  So now after the other side has succeeded in stacking the DC Circuit, \nDemocratic appointees outnumber Republican appointees by a 7-to-4 \nmajority among active judges. The distinguished majority leader wasn't \ngoing to leave anything to fortune and he rammed those three nominees \nthrough.\n  I am recounting how the majority leader took the Senate nuclear \nbecause it all came to another head last week. You see, on Tuesday the \nthree-judge panel of the DC Circuit decided the Halbig v. Burwell case, \nthe most significant ObamaCare ruling since the Supreme Court upheld \nthe constitutionality of the law in 2012. Halbig is a straightforward \ncase of statutory interpretation under the Administrative Procedures \nAct and the DC Circuit panel got it right. As the panel held, the text \nof the Affordable Care Act states on its face that tax credits are \navailable only to individuals--individuals--who purchase their \ninsurance plans through an exchange established by a State. So the IRS \ncannot make the tax credits available as the law clearly says to those \nwho bought plans through the Federal exchange. You don't have to take \nmy word for it. Putting aside the ample evidence mustered by the DC \nCircuit's opinion, as early as 2009, the former Democratic chair of our \nFinance Committee suggested that tax credits were aimed to cover only \nState exchanges. Additionally, economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the \nkey architects of ObamaCare, has been very clear on this question.\n  According to the New York Times, Mr. Gruber's role in designing \nObamaCare was so crucial that ``the White House lent him to Capitol \nHill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the \nlegislation.''\n  What did the administration's own expert economist have to say about \nthe availability of tax credits under ObamaCare? Here is his quote from \n2012 explaining how credits were intended as a political pressure \ntactic on our 50 States:\n\n       I think what's important to remember politically about \n     this, is if you are a state and you don't set up an Exchange, \n     that means your citizens don't get their tax credits. But \n     your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. So \n     you're essentially saying to your citizens, you're going to \n     pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the \n     country. I hope that's a blatant enough political reality \n     that states will get their act together and realize that \n     there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up \n     these Exchanges, and that they'll do it. But you know, once \n     again, the politics can get ugly around this.\n\n  Mr. Gruber is right. The politics have gotten very ugly around this.\n  After the panel ruled against the HHS Secretary in Halbig last week, \nit only took the administration about an hour to announce that it would \nseek en banc review by the full DC Circuit. That is where the \nmajority's power grab is paying off. Breaking the Senate's longstanding \nrules and stacking the DC Circuit was a premeditated political \ncalculation from the very beginning. So last week when asked whether \nhis decision to stack the courts was vindicated by the Halbig decision, \nthe distinguished majority leader told the press: ``I think if you look \nat simple math, it does. Simple math, you bet.''\n  Simple math was the other side's calculation. The simple math is \nstacking the DC Circuit with leftwing judges who will do in a court \nwhat the President and the other side have been unable to do through \nthe legislative process. It is what they have been unable to do through \nthe proper channels of government designated by the Constitution to \nresolve these issues through the Congress. But the President has been \ncomplaining for years that he cannot accomplish his legislative agenda \nthat way, so he went looking for alternatives to that constitutional \nprocess, where the Constitution says the legislative branch shall \nlegislate, and the Constitution says that the executive branch should \nonly execute. Faithfully executing the laws is not something this \nPresident concerns himself with. By now everybody has heard the \nPresident's boast about his pen and his phone. As of July 18 of this \nyear, the President wielding that pen and dialing that phone has \nunconstitutionally amended ObamaCare by executive or administrative \nfiat a grand total of 24 times, and that could be a very conservative \nestimate of everything he has done. The President's unilateral \nExecutive actions were not minor. They unconstitutionally altered basic \naspects of the law's design and operation. Things as fundamental as \ndelaying the individual mandate, ordering the IRS to make subsidies \navailable through Federal exchanges in direct contravention of the law, \nextending noncompliant plans, delaying the employer mandate--not once \nbut twice--and exempting unions from reinsurance fees which will create \ncosts that will be passed on to consumers who aren't fortunate enough \nto be employed by the President's political allies--all of these and \nmore in violation of law. By his own admission the President has used \nthese aggressive and lawless tactics because he cannot prevail in the \nlegislative process. But time has shown that Executive action has been \ninsufficient to realize a failed legislative agenda. So the\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\nPresident turned to the courts to do what he couldn't otherwise do \nlegislatively, what he couldn't do within constitutional constraints, \nbecause it is all about just ``simple math.''\n\n  That is not the way the Constitution works. High school students know \notherwise. The President isn't entitled to a rubberstamp from a \nCongress on unpopular legislation, and he is not entitled to stack the \ncourts with radically liberal judges when his political initiatives \nfail legislatively.\n  So I want the other side to remember how politics works when they \ninevitably find themselves in the minority once again. I want them to \nremember the new realities of the so-called simple math that they \nresorted to in order to accomplish legislative projects through \njudicial proxies instead of through the democratic process.\n  The DC Circuit wasn't the only appeals court to rule on the ObamaCare \nsubsidies issue last week, and that brings me back to Professor \nHarris's nomination that we will be voting on today. The Fourth Circuit \nhas ruled, but in contrast to the DC Circuit, it upheld the \nadministration's subsidies regime in a case called the King case, and \nthat is where this nominee comes in. As I explained to my colleagues \nlast week, the timing of the vote on this nomination is not \ncoincidence. Professor Harris is being fast-tracked to the Fourth \nCircuit just in time for another en banc appeal, should one \nmaterialize.\n  The professor, one of the President's most stridently liberal \nnominees to date, is jumping ahead of other circuit nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar. Why? For one simple reason: The administration is \nbetting on more simple math to defend ObamaCare in the Fourth Circuit, \njust like they are betting on simple math to save them in the DC \nCircuit.\n  My colleagues need to face the facts. Professor Harris is a rock-\nsolid vote for saving ObamaCare's unlawful subsidy regime which many \ncommentators have described as the economic linchpin of the entire law. \nAll we need to do is look at the nominee's record, which shows time and \nagain how this nominee confuses politics with the law.\n  For years prior to her confirmation hearing she advocated a legal \nphilosophy in which leftwing politics actively guides and actively \nshapes judicial decisionmaking. She has explained in detail that she \nbelieves the Constitution is made and remade over and over again by \npolitical movements at the so-called constitutionally critical \njunctures. So do we even need to ask whether Professor Harris thinks \nthat passage of ObamaCare was one such critical juncture and that the \nlaw is worth preserving at all costs? The question answers itself.\n  Just look at Professor Harris's record. Before my colleagues vote I \nwant them to have a clear picture of what this nominee stands for, so I \nam going to mention a few truly remarkable positions she has taken in \naddition to the many I discussed with my colleagues last week. \nProfessor Harris is on record that extralegal considerations should \ninfluence how a judge rules. She also expressed her belief that the \npersonal characteristics of the judge should matter as well.\n  I think it is fair to say that she is acutely concerned with the \npersonal characteristics of the judge. In 2010 she even told the Los \nAngeles Times that the President should consider a judicial nominee's \nreligious beliefs when filling Supreme Court vacancies, even though our \nConstitution says there can be no religious test for any office. She \nsaid:\n\n       It is hard for me to see religion as especially different \n     than all other things that presidents take into account.\n\n  I don't even know where to start with that, and perhaps the less said \nabout it the better. But I would be interested to know which religions \nthe nominee thinks are suitable or unsuitable for representation on the \nFederal bench.\n  I will leave you with another example of how out of mainstream this \nnominee is. Professor Harris is an outspoken advocate for abortion \nrights. Over the years she has made a number of controversial \nstatements about abortion and the Supreme Court's abortion precedent. \nShockingly, on one occasion last year she described partial-birth \nabortion as merely a ``late-ish'' kind of abortion. The nominee also \nsuggested that States ``gin up medical controversies'' intentionally \nand in bad faith in order to justify restrictions on late-term \nabortions.\n\n  She denigrated restrictions on partial-birth abortion because, in her \nview, ``you could find one guy to say `I don't know it's safe to create \nmedical uncertainty that will allow state regulation.' ''\n  Those are definitely not the views of mainstream nominees.\n  My colleagues need to understand this nominee's views fully before \nthey cast their votes. This is a nominee who describes herself as a \n``profoundly liberal person'' and who thinks the Constitution is a \n``profoundly progressive document.'' This is a nominee who actually \nthinks the Constitution embodies her personal leftwing philosophy and \nhas said it is ``pretty close to where I am.'' This is a nominee who \nsuggested that a judicial nominee's religious faith is a valid \nconsideration for service on the Federal bench. This is a nominee who \nthinks partial-birth abortion is just a ``late-ish'' kind of abortion \nand criticizes State partial-birth abortion laws ginned up by fake \ncontroversies and bogus data.\n  I explained earlier, a vote for this nominee is a vote in favor of \nObamaCare, and that is why she is being hurried onto the Fourth Circuit \nahead of nominees to other courts of appeal. It is the distinguished \nmajority leader's simple math.\n  This is perhaps the most liberal judicial nominee we have seen from \nthis President so far, which is why I am going to vote no on this \nnominee and urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          State of the Senate\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to speak about a subject that \ntroubles me greatly: the state of affairs in this body, the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I spoke on the floor last week about how the Senate has historically \nlived up to its unique and essential role in our constitutional order. \nToday, I am compelled to offer an account of this institution as it \noperates today. I believe this message is important both for the \nAmerican people, whom we all serve, and for my colleagues in this body.\n  When I spoke on the floor last week, I noted the widespread \nperception that the Senate has fallen into dysfunction. The \npervasiveness of this view is striking among the public, in the media, \nand even among current and former Senators of all political and \nideological stripes. And it is true. The Senate is in worse shape now \nthan ever before in my 38 years of service here.\n  We must properly locate the source of the problem if we are to have \nany hope of correcting it. Political discourse about the state of the \nSenate is so often dominated by those who call for the Senate to be \nmore productive, more efficient. To these critics, the Senate's rules \nare anachronisms, historical accidents, relics of a bygone era that \nmust be swept away for the Senate to race through more legislation and \nnominations, not the least of which we just heard Senator Grassley \nspeak about.\n  As I laid out on the floor last week, the purpose of the Senate is \nnot to duplicate the work of the majoritarian House of Representatives. \nOur work is of a different sort. The Senate was designed to refine the \nunbridled passions of popular will, to apply considered judgment to \nproduce thoughtful legislation aimed at the common good.\n  Structuring a body of such a unique character occupied much of the \nFramers' time during that hot summer in Philadelphia in 1787. Beyond \nthe Senate's constitutional architecture, the body's rules, traditions, \nand precedents have developed over more than two centuries, not as \nflukes but as means of reinforcing and facilitating its purpose.\n  During the past 227 years, the right to debate and the right to amend \nhave become the twin pillars that upheld the Senate's lofty purpose as \na body of considered judgment. As Senator Robert C. Byrd wisely \nobserved, ``As long as the Senate retains the power to amend and the \npower of unlimited debate, the liberties of the people will remain \nsecure.''\n  Many of the greatest legislative achievements of this body during my \n38 years as a Senator were only possible because of our open methods of \ndeliberation and amendment. I think of my many partnerships with the \nlate Ted\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\nKennedy, and others--Senator Harkin, Senator Dodd, Henry Waxman. I can \nname quite a few. Senator Kennedy and I fought like brothers but became \nthe best of friends. This unique environment of the Senate allowed us \nto find areas of mutual interest and ultimate agreement for the public \ngood. Last week I named just a few of these landmark accomplishments: \nthe 1981 budget, the blueprint of how we turned the economy around in \nthe Reagan years; the 1997 budget deal in which we cut taxes, balanced \nthe budget for the first time in decades, and created the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program; the Antiterrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act, a vital criminal law that curtailed the abuse of our \ncourts; and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a landmark piece of \nlegislation sadly attacked by many of my Democratic colleagues to gin \nup a phantom war on women to save their lagging electoral fortunes, but \nin reality a bipartisan agreement that Teddy Kennedy and I championed \nand that passed almost unanimously. These are just a handful of our \nlegislative achievements throughout the past four decades.\n  Like so many others, the roots of these successes lay in the Senate's \ncharacteristic deliberation, including unlimited debate and an open \namendment process. Guaranteeing each individual Senator the full right \nof participation enhanced the quality of the final product and \ncrowdsourcing good ideas rather than limiting input to a small \ngathering in backroom Capitol offices.\n  Giving each Senator the opportunity to have his ideas discussed and \ndebated gave us all confidence that the final product represented the \nbest, most considered judgment of the whole body, encouraging Senators \nto support sometimes imperfect but decisively beneficial legislation. \nAllowing modifications to the initial iteration of a bill--while often \nfrustrating for partisans and purists--often created a broad base of \nsupport for lasting reforms. Emphasizing an open and inclusive process \nencouraged partnerships even among ideological opposites, such as Ted \nKennedy and myself, to find areas of mutual agreement and reach broad \nconsensus. And respecting the limits of the majority party's power \nestablished confidence that when the positions of the parties switched, \nthe rights of the minority would remain protected.\n\n  The atmosphere facilitated by our longstanding rules and traditions \nrepresents the Senate at its best. The Senate, functioning as it \nshould, and so often has over much of my time here, demonstrates that \nthese procedures and traditions are not flukes of history meant to be \nswept away as soon as they are politically inconvenient or frustrate a \nmajority party. Rather, they are vital to the Senate's ability to serve \nthe American people.\n  This is why the first Adlai Stevenson in his farewell address to the \nSenate as Vice President warned:\n\n       It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this body \n     are founded deep in human experience; that they are the \n     result of centuries of tireless effort in legislative halls, \n     to conserve, to render stable and secure, the rights and \n     liberties which have been achieved by conflict. By its rules \n     the Senate wisely fixes the limits to its own power. Of those \n     who clamor against the Senate, and its methods of procedure, \n     it may be truly said: They know not what they do.\n\n  Sadly, these critical and defining practices are under attack. Some \nwho once defended the right to amend when in the minority have acted \nconsistently to deny that right now that they are in the majority.\n  On February 28, 2006, the senior Senator from Nevada, then serving as \nminority leader, condemned a procedural maneuver that denied the \nminority the opportunity to offer amendments. He stated unequivocally: \nThis is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic nature of the \nSenate.\n  That maneuver, referred to as filling the amendment tree, allows the \nmajority leader to use his right to be recognized before any other \nMembers as a means to block any and all other amendments by filling all \namendment slots with his own amendments and thus prohibiting anybody \nelse from having any rights of amendment.\n  Less than a year after condemning the maneuver of filling the \namendment tree as a very bad practice, inconsistent with the very \nnature of the Senate, the senior Senator from Nevada became the \nmajority leader. Rather than take his own wise counsel from months \nbefore, he instead began a consistent pattern of procedural abuse by \nusing that very same destructive practice. The majority leader employed \nthat tactic 21 times during the 110th Congress and 23 times during the \n111th Congress. As the 112th Congress opened, the majority leader \npledged to use this tactic only ``infrequently,'' but went on to employ \nit a record 26 times in the following 2 years.\n  The Congressional Research Service confirms that the current majority \nleader has used his position to deny amendments to the minority more \nthan twice as often as the previous six majority leaders combined. He \nhas used his position to deny amendments to the minority more than \ntwice as often as the previous six majority leaders combined.\n  Six Senators led this body as majority leader between the 99th and \n109th Congresses, three Republicans and three Democrats. I served here \nunder all of them. Together they denied amendments to the minority 40 \ntimes in those 22 years. No individual leader used this tactic more \nthan 15 times. As of this month, in less than 8 years, the current \nmajority leader has denied amendments to the minority a staggering 87 \ntimes.\n  The right to amend is indeed a part of the basic nature of the \nSenate, a defining feature of this body that allows us to conduct \nlegislative business differently than in the majoritarian House. The \nright to amend allows different voices to be heard, different issues to \nbe raised, and different decisions to be made. Denying that right \nchanges the basic nature of the Senate and prefers power over liberty.\n  Hardly a day goes by without the current majority confirming my \npoint. Earlier this month the majority leader discussed the possibility \nof allowing amendments to a bill. The minority, he said, want \namendments ``because they want to kill the bill.'' But he pledged to \nconsider amendments that, in his view, would ``lead to passage of the \nbill.''\n  In other words, the minority has only those opportunities to \nparticipate in the legislative process that the majority leader says \nthey do. He was right back in 2006: This is a very bad practice, and he \nis only making it worse.\n  Consider another way of looking at this problem. Recently, almost a \nyear went by during which the majority leader allowed votes on only 11 \nRepublican amendments. Think about that--only 11 amendments in nearly a \nyear. All 45 Republican Senators together got fewer votes on amendments \nthan, for example, one House Democrat, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson \nLee. Indeed, the Republican House majority allowed votes on 174 \nDemocratic amendments during the same period that the majority leader \nhere allowed votes on only 11 Republican amendments. There are Senators \nwho have been here 6 years and have never had an amendment of theirs \nvoted upon--that is pathetic--on both sides.\n  The other defining feature of the Senate, the right to debate, is \nalso fast becoming a thing of the past. This practice has been a \ncentral characteristic of the Senate for more than 200 years and, like \nthe right to amend, allows voices to be part of the legislative process \nwho would otherwise be shut out.\n  When I was first elected, this body included only 38 of us \nRepublicans, even fewer than the threshold in our Senate rules to \nprevent cutting off debate. I know from long experience that the right \nto debate can often annoy the majority by empowering the minority. But \nfulsome debate and thorough deliberation far more than expediency or \nefficiency is essential to the nature of the Senate. Both sides have \nbeen annoyed from time to time, but nothing like this.\n  Senate practice and rules have, for more than two centuries, required \na supermajority of Senators to end debate before the Senate can vote on \na pending legislative matter or a nomination. The current majority \nleader has compromised the minority's ability to debate in both areas.\n  Under the rule adopted in 1917, ending debate begins with a motion to \ninvoke cloture to end debate. The current majority leader often files a \ncloture motion on a bill at the very same time he brings it up for \nconsideration. He has used this tactic far more often\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\nthan previous majority leaders, and its effect is not to end debate on \nlegislation but to prevent it altogether. Whenever those of us in the \nminority have resisted his demand that we end debate as soon as we \nbegin consideration, the majority leader wrongly labels it a \nfilibuster.\n  Last November the majority leader claimed there had been 168 \nfilibusters on executive and judicial nominations. The majority leader \nused this supposedly unprecedented level of confirmation obstruction to \ntake the drastic step of abolishing extended debate altogether using \nthe so-called nuclear option. But the majority leader was counting \ncloture motions, not filibusters. A cloture motion is simply a request \nto end debate. A filibuster occurs when the debate cannot be ended \nbecause the cloture vote fails. In fact, most of those were not \nfilibusters; they were falsely called that. There have been only 14 \nfilibusters of President Obama's nominees, and that practice was on a \ndecline. The Senate, in fact, confirmed 98 percent of President Obama's \nnominees. There was never a problem there.\n  The majority leader's current opposition to filibustering Democratic \nnominees is simply impossible to reconcile with the 26 times he voted \nto filibuster Republican nominees.\n  But even as destructive as the nuclear option has been, some of the \nless visible changes to the management of this Chamber have proven just \nas damaging to the functioning of the Senate. Take the committee \nprocess--the primary forum for both deliberation and amendment. The \nmajority leader has set a record for completely bypassing the committee \nprocess, bringing most of the bills we have considered lately up in \nessentially final form, shielding them from deliberation and amendment \non both the floor and in committee. In each Congress since he became \nmajority leader, the senior Senator from Nevada has set a record for \nbypassing the committee process. In fact, with 6 months remaining in \nthis Congress, he has already used this tactic more in one Congress \nthan any other majority leader.\n  What are these matters the majority leader brings to the floor? An \nunschooled observer might imagine that after the negotiation of the \nRyan-Murray budget agreement--an imperfect bargain but a breakthrough \nfor cooperation nonetheless--we would join the House in pursuing the \nappropriations process through the regular order; that we would use the \nopportunity to exert our influence as legislators on how our \nconstituents' hard-earned dollars are spent. Instead, the majority \nleader brings up bills that have no chance of becoming law in order to \nscore political points to reinforce disingenuous narratives about a \nsupposed war on women or so-called economic patriotism.\n  The current majority leader's abuse of the Senate amounts to a \nnational travesty. He has broken down so much of what makes this \ninstitution serve the Nation's interests in order to advance his own \nparty's temporary political gain. Such a betrayal of trust is nothing \nshort of tragic.\n  To my 56 colleagues who have never served in the Senate when this \nbody lived up to its potential greatness, we can indeed restore the \nSenate's rightful place in our constitutional order. This body can \nagain be a source of great legislative achievement borne out of \nthoughtful deliberation and inclusive consideration. But this majority \nleader's slash-and-burn tactics are not the path to achieve these \nworthy ends. They are a dead end, leading only to the destruction of \nthis institution that has served our Nation so well for so long. \nInstead, restoring the Senate will require us all--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--to stand for the institution's rules, traditions, \nprecedents, and for our individual prerogatives as Senators.\n  The majority leader is my friend, but I have to say these criticisms \nare valid, they are honorable, and it is about time that people on both \nsides of the floor start to realize we can't keep going this way and \nstill call this the greatest deliberative body in the world. It is \npathetic. I think people on both sides know it is pathetic, and it is \ntime for it to stop.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, it is hard to imagine a more pressing \nneed for our people, for our economy, and for our quality of life than \nreauthorizing the highway trust fund.\n  The Senate has previously entered into a unanimous consent agreement \nto have votes on four transportation funding amendments. The reality, \nhowever, is that time is running out to hold those votes before they \nwould become what amounts to a meaningless exercise.\n  We all know that this week the Senate still has to vote on veterans \nhealth care, emergency funding to deal with wildfires raging in the \nWest, and the challenge of those child immigrants coming across the \nborder from Mexico. That is all the more reason why the critical issue, \nthe urgent issue of transportation funding should not be left to the \nlast minute. Left to the last minute, in effect, this body would simply \nbe surrendering its ability to have a genuine impact on an urgent \nnational issue--an issue critical for our people, for our economy, and \nfor our country in the days ahead.\n  Now, if the Senate were to vote tomorrow on transportation funding--\nand the majority leader, Senator Reid, has assured me that would be \nacceptable to him--there would still be time to work out any \ndifferences between the Senate and the other body before the Congress \nrecesses at the end of this week.\n  However, if the votes are delayed until later in the week, my \njudgment, as chairman of the Finance Committee, where Senator Hatch and \nI have put together a bipartisan bill is that if the votes are delayed, \nfor example, on the bipartisan Wyden-Hatch amendment, it would become \nalmost impossible for the Senate to have any input into the final \ntransportation bill that goes to the President.\n  Just from my own standpoint, I think it would be legislative \nmalpractice for the Senate not to have a role to play in this premier \neconomic issue now before the Congress. The highway trust fund, \ncolleagues, is going to be reauthorized this week. That is \nnonnegotiable. The reason it is going to be reauthorized this week and \nwe will not accept anything else is that the stakes are just too great. \nIf our country was to have the transportation equivalent of a \ngovernment shutdown, more than 700,000 jobs could be affected, coming \non the heels of a slowdown in home construction which we have just seen \nin the last few days. It would be a devastating blow for the \nconstruction industry and our whole economy.\n  Beyond the short-term impact and the threat to the already shaky \nrecovery, my view is that every Senator, every Democrat and every \nRepublican, understands transportation funding and improving our \ninfrastructure is critical to our country's future. The reality is that \nit is just not possible to have a big league quality of life with \nlittle league infrastructure.\n  Now as I wrap up, I would like to talk about a couple of other points \nthat are relevant to how the Senate conducts its business. I am \nespecially grateful to Senator Hatch, who has consistently met me \nhalfway. As we know, our distinguished colleague, the former chairman, \nSenator Baucus, is now Ambassador to China. I took up that position in \nFebruary. From the very day I became chairman of the committee, Senator \nHatch has been willing to work with me, meet me halfway and, in \nparticular, has talked about the importance of the Senate functioning \nin its regular order.\n  I would point out that a number of colleagues have been saying just \nthat, and that the Senate has not had a chance to vote on amendments to \nlegislation this year. That is not how this great body is supposed to \noperate. We know, with respect to this transportation bill, if we can \nget it brought to the floor tomorrow so we can have a real debate, we \ncould have two bipartisan amendments and two from the minority that \nwill shape not only transportation policy but also policies in vital \nother areas, including taxes, pensions, and trade.\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\n  If the votes on these amendments, bipartisan amendments, are fairly \nstructured so that both sides would have a chance to weigh in and if \nthe votes on these amendments are going to be given full and fair \nconsideration and not become some kind of exercise in futility, they \nhave to be held tomorrow. So I hope we will be able to work this out. I \nhad thought about coming here and advancing a procedural motion. My \nhope is we can work this out so we can really debate these critical \nissues.\n  I do think the other body goes too far on the issue of pensions \nsmoothing. Given that position, the country is likely to have two big \nchallenges in the future. First, how do we fund transportation? And \nsecond, what are we going to do about the hopes and aspirations of all \nof those workers relying on pensions and the future of the Pension \nBenefit Guarantee Corporation?\n  So I do think the bipartisan Senate proposal that Senator Hatch and I \nhave authored--and there are other bipartisan proposals--gives us a \nchance to, in effect, have the Senate weigh in in a meaningful fashion \non this critical issue.\n  I know we are going to have a vote in a little bit, and there will be \na discussion between the leaders and colleagues. I may come back later \ntonight to discuss this further. I simply come this afternoon--more \nthan anything else, what I have sought to do is to try to advance \nexactly what Senator Hatch has been talking about: Regular order and \nthe chance for both sides to be heard on critical issues and to try to \nget beyond some of the polarizing, divisive kind of rhetoric that \ncertainly you hear outside the Capitol.\n  I was home this weekend marching in parades, getting out across the \nState. That is what I heard continually, people coming up and saying: \nRon, can't the Senate and the Congress find a way to come together? \nSenator Hatch and I did that on a bipartisan proposal. There are other \nbipartisan proposals, proposals that ensure the minority has a chance \nto be heard. I just hope we can work it out this evening so both sides \nwill have a chance to have a fair debate on this issue at a time when \nit is still meaningful.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time in quorum calls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, in a few moments we are going to have \nthe opportunity to vote on the confirmation of Pamela Harris for the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am very proud to have joined Senator \nMikulski in recommending to President Obama the appointment of Pamela \nHarris to the Fourth Circuit.\n  I have interviewed many candidates for judicial appointments. I can \ntell you Pamela Harris is at the top, as far as her qualifications for \nthis appellate court position. She is an extraordinarily talented \nperson who has devoted the prime part of her life to public service and \nseeks this appointment for the right reasons--to continue her public \nservice.\n  I mentioned that Senator Mikulski and I both recommended her \nappointment. Senator Mikulski has set up, as the senior Senator in our \nState, a process by which we solicit the strongest possible candidates \nof interest to fill judicial vacancies. We understand these are \nlifetime appointments. We understand the importance of these \nappointments. We have a screening process and an interview process in \naddition to the White House and Justice Department vetting process, \nwhich we think will give us the highest quality person to fill these \nlifetime appointments. In Pamela Harris's case, I am extremely proud. I \nthank Senator Mikulski for her commitment to a process that gives us \nthe very best people for these positions.\n  Pamela Harris is the granddaughter of Polish-Jewish immigrants who \ncame to this country to seek a better life for their children. Pamela's \nmother worked her way through law school. Pamela herself went to Yale \nCollege and then Yale Law School. She was helped in the process with \nPell grants. She is a product of the Montgomery County public schools. \nWe are very proud of the fact that she has really lived the American \ndream and has been able to accomplish so much in her career through \nhard work and believing in this country.\n  When we take a look at her professional accomplishments, I don't know \nwhat else we could ask. She has the highest rating from the American \nBar Association, which gives us that information on the candidates who \nare nominated for judgeships.\n  She clerked for Judge Harry T. Edwards in the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia, and she clerked for Justice John Paul \nStevens in the Supreme Court of the United States. She has been an \nassociate professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, \ncodirector of Harvard Law School's Supreme Court and appellate \nlitigation clinic, a visiting professor at Georgetown University Law \nCenter, and she was in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy. \nAt Georgetown University Law Center, her clinic prepares lawyers for \ntheir arguments before the Supreme Court of the United States. In other \nwords, she is basically the person who teaches and gives practical \nexperience for those who have to appear before the highest Court in \nthis land.\n  It is interesting that she has dedicated about half of her time to \ncivil cases and about half to criminal cases, so she is well versed on \nthe responsibilities of our appellate court. I don't think we could \nhave found a more qualified person to fill this extremely important \nposition on the Fourth Circuit.\n  I also want my colleagues to know that she understands the \nresponsibilities of a lawyer and a judge to provide access to all. She \nwill take an oath if she is confirmed--and I am hopeful she will be in \na few moments, literally--to serve justice regardless of a person's \nwealth or poverty. As a private attorney, she helped develop a \nrelationship with the public defender of Maryland to provide help to \nindigent individuals who needed additional services. She is committed \nto pro bono service and she is committed to equal access to justice in \naddition to everything else she has done in her career. She really \nunderstands. She has the talent, she has the commitment to all in our \ncommunities, and she understands what the appropriate role is for a \nmember of the bench, for a judge.\n  I know Senator Grassley has mentioned his concerns, but Senator \nGrassley asked a lot of questions for the record, which is the right of \nany Senator to do. These are lifetime appointments, and I fully support \nthat. But I wish to state Pamela Harris's own words in response as to \nunderstanding the difference between an advocate and a judge, between a \nlawyer representing a client and a judge. I know when I practiced law, \nI gave everything I could to help the clients I represented. I didn't \nalways 100 percent agree with their position, but it was my \nresponsibility to advocate for their position. That is how our system \nof justice operates. That is our rule of law.\n  Pamela Harris said:\n\n       I fully recognize that the role of a judge is entirely \n     different from the role of an advocate. If confirmed as a \n     judge, my role would be to apply governing law and precedent \n     impartially to the facts of a particular case.\n\n  She gets it. She understands what the role of a judge is.\n  Quite frankly, I want people who are active in the legal system to \napply and become our judges because they understand the importance of \nthe work a judge does.\n  She continues:\n\n       It is inappropriate for any judge or Justice to base his or \n     her decision on their own personal view or on public opinion. \n     . . . If confirmed as a circuit judge, I would faithfully \n     follow the methodological precedence of the Supreme Court and \n     the Fourth Circuit, applying the interpretive approaches and \n     only the interpretive approaches used by those courts.\n\n  Perhaps that is exactly what we want from our judges. We want them to \nbe worldly. We want them to understand the law. We want them to have \nbeen involved in the law. In Pam Harris's case, she has been a \nprofessor, she has taught the law, and, yes, she has been actively \nengaged. But once they become a judge, they need to apply the\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\nprecedence from that circuit, from the Supreme Court, and that is \nexactly what Pam Harris said she would do. Her reputation for being \nstraightforward and telling it exactly the way she believes has been \nwell documented in the record before the Judiciary Committee.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for the incredible manner in which he operates \nthe Judiciary Committee in the best traditions of the Senate. They had \na full hearing on Pamela Harris's nomination. They had a full record. \nOne of the letters that is part of that record that is also part of the \nrecord of the Senate was a letter--the Judiciary Committee received \nnumerous letters of support for Pamela Harris. I will quote from one \nletter that was signed by more than 80 of her professional peers, which \nincluded individuals appointed by Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents to key positions, including Gregory Garre, the former \nSolicitor General for George W. Bush. In that letter where these 80 \nsignatories to that letter strongly endorsed Pamela Harris's \nconfirmation for judge on the Fourth Circuit, it says:\n\n       We are lawyers from diverse backgrounds and varying \n     affiliations, but we are united in our admiration for Pam's \n     skills as a lawyer and our respect for her integrity, her \n     intellect, her judgment, and her fair-mindedness.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       Many of us have had the opportunity to work with Pam on \n     appellate matters. She has been co-counsel to some of us, \n     opposing counsel to others, and a valuable colleague to all. \n     In her appellate work, Pam has demonstrated extraordinary \n     skill. She is a quick study, careful listener, and acute \n     judge of legal arguments. She knows the value of clarity, \n     candor, vigor, and responsiveness. Of equal importance, she \n     has always conducted herself with consummate professionalism, \n     grace, and congeniality, and has a humble and down-to-earth \n     approach to her work.\n\n  The letter concludes:\n\n       Her well-rounded experience makes her well prepared for the \n     docket of a federal appellate court. Pam's substantive \n     knowledge, intellect, and low-key temperament will be great \n     assets for the position for which she has been nominated.\n\n  I pointed out before and I will again that there are many questions \nthat were posed to Pamela Harris during the confirmation process. I \nwould encourage my colleagues to take a look at those. I did. I read \nher answers to those questions. They were very well documented and very \nprofessional. Her reputation is one of being a straight shooter and \nsaying exactly what is on her mind. Read her responses. She understands \nthe role of a judge. She is well qualified to serve on this circuit.\n  She has the strong endorsement of the two Senators from her home \nState, and I urge my colleagues to vote for her confirmation. We are \nvery proud of her record on the Fourth Circuit.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, all postcloture time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the Harris nomination.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Pamela Harris, of Maryland, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Fourth Circuit?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 524\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of a simple and \nstraightforward resolution cosponsored by 20 of our colleagues that \nwould simply express the sense of the Senate that climate change is \noccurring and that it will continue to pose ongoing risks and \nchallenges to our citizens and to our country. That is all it says. We \nknow we have a problem. We don't pretend to give every solution in this \nresolution; it simply gives us the point of saying we have a problem.\n  I am pleased to be joined by two leaders on this issue, Senator \nSheldon Whitehouse as well as Chairman Barbara Boxer, the chair of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  We have an obligation to our constituents and to this country to \naddress global climate change. We must tackle the challenge head-on. \nThis is an issue facing all Americans--from farmers struggling with \nextreme weather from drought, to floods in seaside communities \nthreatened by rising waters, to habitat changes that are impacting our \nhunting, fishing, and outdoor economy, to businesses trying to mitigate \nthe financial risks posed by the effects of climate change.\n  It is clear climate change poses a grave threat to food security, the \nenvironment, and our national security, as\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\nwell as to our businesses. Yet achieving a commitment to at least admit \nthis problem is going on in the Senate has fallen short. That is the \npoint of our direct resolution that simply states the facts--the \nscience--about climate change and the impact it is having on our \ncountry.\n  The resolution draws from the 2014 National Climate Assessment which \nwas drafted by 300 climate experts and extensively reviewed by a 60-\nmember advisory committee and the National Academy of Sciences. The \nNational Climate Assessment states the science very simply. The most \nrecent decade was the Nation's warmest on record and U.S. temperatures \nare expected to continue to rise. The Department of Defense of this \ncountry, of the United States of America, our own Department of Defense \n2014 Quadrennial Defense Review reiterates climate change has a \ndestabilizing effect, stating: ``The pressures caused by climate change \nwill influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on \neconomies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.'' \nAnd the Defense Science Board report concluded: ``Climate change will \nonly grow in concern for the United States and its security \ninterests.''\n  All the resolution says is that it is the sense of the Senate that \nglobal climate change is occurring and will continue to cause ongoing \nrisks and challenges to the people and the Government of the United \nStates.\n  We know the costs. The 2012 drought was the worst drought since 1956 \nand caused over $30 billion in damage nationwide. The current drought \nin the Western and Southwestern States is estimated to cost billions \nand it remains ongoing. Last week there was a newspaper map showing \nthat about 34 percent of the contiguous United States was in at least a \nmoderate drought as of July 22. Those are the numbers. Those are the \nfacts.\n  We have seen heavy downpours increasing nationally. We have seen \nhurricanes increasing in intensity. If we continue on our current path, \nby the year 2050, between $66 billion and $106 billion worth of \nexisting coastal properties will likely be below sea level nationwide, \nand $238 billion to $507 billion worth of property will be below sea \nlevel by the year 2100.\n  So what are we hearing from the business community? We have \nconservative businesspeople such as former U.S. Secretary of the \nTreasury under George Bush, Hank Paulson, speaking out. He, along with \nformer New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and eight other prominent \nbusiness and policy leaders, recently released the first comprehensive \nassessment of the economic risks our Nation faces from the changing \nclimate, including increased coastal storm damage, reduced productivity \nin some areas of the United States because they have become too hot for \noutdoor work, strained energy networks, and expanding public health \nimpacts. This report represents an important first step toward a true \naccounting of the risks of climate change so the American business \ncommunity can begin to work toward effective climate risk management.\n  Just this past Thursday, former Clinton Treasury Secretary and \ncochair of the Foreign Relations Council Bob Rubin wrote an article in \nthe Washington Post advocating that although it is clear that the U.S. \neconomy faces enormous risks from unmitigated climate change, policy \nand business leaders are not taking into account the cost of inaction, \nwhich means decisions are being made based on the broad picture posed \nby climate change on our economy.\n  So now we have scientists, business leaders, church groups, and \noutdoor groups all out in front of this issue. In fact, a recent poll \nfound that 63 percent of Americans believe this is occurring. Sixty-\nthree percent of Americans believe it is occurring. Yet where is the \nSenate? Where are we?\n  We have an opportunity today, to pass this simple resolution saying \nit is the sense of the Senate that global climate change is occurring \nand will continue to pose ongoing challenges to the people and the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  It should not be that hard for this Congress to simply say that. \nThink of what the Senate has done in the past. When we saw what was \ngoing on in South Africa, it was the Senate that overcame a \nPresidential veto to approve the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. It \nwas the Senate that took the lead on civil rights legislation. It was \nthe Senate that was willing to put partisan issues aside and take on \nthe Watergate hearings. It was the Senate that took on consumer issues. \nIt was the Senate that passed the Clean Air Act approved by 43 \nDemocrats and 30 Republicans.\n  We just have to take one step today; that is, to simply tell the \nworld we know there is a problem. We are not here trying to give all \nthe solutions. We know colleagues disagree with this in terms of what \nwe should do, depending on where they are from or what States they \nrepresent. But to even start having those discussions, we have to admit \nthere is a problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this simple, straightforward \nresolution. I urge them to support it because it is so important to our \ncountry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof S. Res. 524, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding global \nclimate change which was submitted earlier today; that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have to say this. The resolution by \nSenator Klobuchar clearly demonstrates the vast political influence of \nthe President's global warming advocates and what they have been doing \nover time.\n  This is not new. This started in this Chamber--let's see, 15 years \nago--at the time the Clinton-Gore effort took place in South America \nand they signed on to the treaty down there. Of course, it never came \nup to be ratified.\n  This resolution cites 13 different government agencies that are \ncolluding together to merge their policies to promote global warming, \nwhich underscores how effective the environmental activists such as Tom \nSteyer have been at getting their agenda into the Obama administration.\n  While some Democrats may be convinced global warming is continuing to \noccur, the scientific record does not agree. In fact, for the past 15 \nyears temperatures across the globe have not increased. Let's think \nabout that. Is anyone listening here? Temperatures have not increased \nover the last 15 years. This isn't just--a major magazine had an \narticle on it, ``The Economist'' did, and even the scientists at the \nIPCC.\n  Let's keep in mind that the whole thing was started by the United \nNations. They started this group called the IPCC--the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change--and they have been promoting it ever since. \nEven the IPCC says we have had no warming for the last 15 years. \nSenator Wicker from Mississippi, at a hearing last week, pointed out \nthat some 31,000 American scientists, 9,000 of whom have Ph.D.s, have \nsigned a petition noting there is a lack of scientific evidence that \ngreenhouse gases are causing global warming.\n  Looking at the political side of things, the Senate has been debating \nthis issue for nearly 15 years. I can remember standing right here at \nthis podium, the first bill that came down was the McCain-Lieberman \nbill. It was to legislatively do a cap-and-trade bill. It would have \nset up an economywide cap-and-trade program. It failed by a vote of 43 \nto 55. This is in the Senate. A short while after that they had another \nbill, which was in 2005, and it failed by a larger margin. In 2008, the \nWarner-Lieberman bill came up. It failed also. Each time it fails, it \nfails by a larger plurality, which leads me to question how people can \npossibly say the majority in this Senate has an interest in this \nlegislation because they fail every time. The last time the bill was \nconsidered in Congress was in 2009. That was the Waxman-Markey bill. It \npassed the House but never got a vote in the Senate because they knew \nit was going to fail.\n  One might ask, Why is that? What changed from the time the polling \nshowed Americans were interested in this issue? I will tell my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nwhen it was. I happened to be at that time chairman of the air \nsubcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee. They had at \nthat time a study that came out. It was by the scientists from the \nWharton School of Economics talking about what the cost would be if we \nwere to pass cap and trade. That figure was between $300 billion and \n$400 billion a year. Let's keep in mind that would constitute the \nlargest tax increase in the history of America.\n  It is not as if it is just one group. MIT, Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, came out and agreed with those figures. They said $300 \nbillion to $400 billion. Then Charles Rivers came out and said the same \nthing, about $300 billion to $400 billion a year.\n  Since that time there has been a wake-up call for the American \npeople. I don't know what my good friend from Minnesota--maybe she will \nelaborate a little bit on these polls. But I can remember back when the \nGallup polls used to say, some 15 years ago, that global warming was \neither the first or the second major concern people had. A Gallup poll \nthat came out just 2 weeks ago said it was No. 14 out of 15. In other \nwords, they said: Name the 15 greatest concerns we have, and No. 14 out \nof 15 was global warming.\n  The Pew Research Center came out just the other day saying that 53 \npercent of Americans who believe in global warming--these are the ones \nwho truly believe the globe is warming and we are all going to die--\nwhen they asked about the cause of global warming, either they said \nthey don't believe there is enough evidence to blame manmade gases--\nthat is anthropogenic gases--or they believe it is caused by natural \nvariation.\n  This probably explains why it has been difficult for Tom Steyer to \nreengender a lot of interest in this issue. He has committed to raising \n$100 million. He promised to help Democrats win elections this fall. He \nput $50 million of his own money--this is Tom Steyer talking; he admits \nhe is doing this--and he is going to raise the other $50 million. We \nfound out from an article in Politico 2 weeks ago that the most he has \nbeen able to raise of the second $50 million is $1.2 million from \noutside donors so far. Maybe over the weekend he had a good weekend; I \ndon't know. That is a possibility.\n  What we should be doing is learning from the international community. \nJust last week Australia repealed its much hated carbon tax--the same \nthing that is being promoted right now. Either cap and trade or a tax \non carbon is what they passed in Australia, and they did it \noverwhelmingly. Then they realized the real cost. Tony Abbott, the \nPrime Minister, should be heralded as a hero for his courageous \nleadership to help the poor and those on fixed incomes who suffer when \nenergy prices needlessly rise.\n  Upon passage of the bill to repeal the tax, he told the Australian \npeople--this is his quote; listen very carefully: ``Today the tax that \nyou voted to get rid of is finally gone. A useless destructive tax \nwhich damaged jobs, which hurt families' cost of living and which \ndidn't actually help the environment is finally gone.'' He is talking \nabout the tax they passed in the country of Australia and just recently \nrescinded that.\n  By the way, there is a guy, Senator Cory Bernardi, who came out--I \nhappened to see him 3 or 4 days ago in Washington. He was here. He was \none of the senators who actually had promoted this to start with and \nthen changed his mind and realized this is something that is worth \nrepealing. And they did it.\n  So the Australian people are thanking their Prime Minister. I believe \nwe will be able to protect the American people from the senseless \nglobal warming policies here in the United States. It is something they \nhave tried for 15 years here. Every time they stand up and say, oh, the \nscience is settled, the science is settled, then we come up with more \ngroups. I can remember the first time they said the science is settled. \nThat was 12 years ago. Look at my Web site. I named a handful of \nscientists who had been intimidated by the IPCC--that is the United \nNations--into saying: Yes, we want you to participate. But to do this, \nyou have to believe this stuff on global warming. Of course, it did not \nhappen.\n  So we started listing, and we got several hundred, then several \nthousand scientists who we still have on the Web site. You can access \nit. So it is not just recently that scientists have changed their mind \non this, because they started a long time ago. By the way, I know this \nis a fine person, Tom Steyer, and we are reading from Politico. Later \non he made the statement:\n\n       It is true that we expect to be heavily involved in the \n     mid-term elections. We are looking at a bunch of races. My \n     guess is that we will end up involved in eight or more races.\n\n  This is a guy talking about what he is going to do with $100 million. \nSo it is something that is not going to happen. It sounds real good, \nstanding up and talking about the world coming to an end, but that was \nnot sellable back in 2003 when they had the first bill. It is not \nsellable today.\n  It always bothers me when we have a President who tries his best to \nget things done legislatively, and then cannot do it that way so he is \ntrying to do it through regulations. So having said all of that, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much having had the \nopportunity to hear those words from what I can only describe as an \nalternate reality from the one I inhabit, any way. First, let me say \nthe very first paragraph of the resolution is this: Whereas, the 2014 \nNational Climate Assessment stated the most recent decade was the \nNation's warmest on record--U.S. Temperatures are expected to continue \nto rise.\n  There is some evidence that certain temperatures have been flat for a \nfew years--atmospheric temperatures. What that little rhetorical device \nomits to consider is two things: One, 93 percent of the heat that comes \nonto the Earth from global warming goes into the oceans. Maybe 3 or 4 \npercent actually goes into the atmosphere--93 to 3. So if there is any \nchange in the ocean, which regulates the temperature of the Earth, then \nit is going to have a pronounced effect on atmospheric temperature. And \nthe ocean continues to warm.\n  People will say: No, the Earth stopped warming. It has not warmed for \n12 or 15 years--whatever they say. No, if you actually look at it, the \noceans are continuing to warm. There has been this step in atmospheric \ntemperature at a certain level. The other thing that gets left out when \nour friends say that is this is not the first step. If you look at the \nhistory of how this got to be the hottest decade on record, over and \nover you can look at the graphs and you see these steps. To pretend \nthat each step is the last one runs completely against the science. So \nto say we have no warming is just not factual. To say that the \ngovernment--he used the word colluding--is colluding together, that is \na fairly tough word to use. Let me tell you some of the government \nagencies that are so-called colluding together and believe climate \nchange is real and carbon pollution is causing it.\n  How about NASA? We trust them to send our astronauts into space. We \ntrust them to deliver a rover the size of an SUV to the surface of Mars \nsafely and drive it around, sending data and pictures back from Mars to \nus. You think these people know what they are talking about?\n  We trust NOAA with our weather predicting. That is what they tell us. \nNobody is saying they are incompetent at weather predicting. Do not \nlisten when people are warning you about storms. But somehow when they \ntalk about climate change, that is colluding.\n  How about the U.S. Navy? The Commander in Chief of our Pacific \nCommand, Admiral Locklear, has said the No. 1 threat we face in the \nPacific theatre comes from climate change. Is he colluding when he says \nthat? This is a career Navy man whom the people of America have trusted \nwith the security of our Pacific theater. It is exactly consistent with \nwhat the Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense Review said both \nlast time--4 years ago--and most recently.\n  If you want to ignore the Federal Government, if you live in a world \nin which you think the Federal Government colludes with itself to make \nup things that are not true--OK, but look at the property casualty \ninsurance and reinsurance industry. They are the people with the \nbiggest bet on this. They\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\nhave billions of dollars riding on getting it right. They say climate \nchange is real. Carbon pollution is causing it. We have to do something \nabout it.\n  So does the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, because they care \nabout the poor and the effect this will have on the people who have the \nleast. So does every major U.S. scientific society--every single one. \nSo you can take a poll or a petition and say it has 30,000 names on it. \nI am told that among the names on that petition are the Spice Girls and \npeople from MASH such as Dr. Frank Burns. It is almost a comedic \neffort.\n  When you say there are 9,000 who have degrees, that is--what--.00003 \npercent of our population of 300 million? Maybe I got a zero wrong \nthere. The idea that you cannot find 9,000 people who think the Earth \nis flat is a bit of a stretch. The idea that we should base our \npolicies on a petition that imaginary people are on rather than on what \nNASA, NOAA, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nevery major scientific society, and the entire property casualty \ninsurance and reinsurance industry are telling us is just \nextraordinary.\n  If you want to go into the private sector, you have to look no \nfurther than Coke and Pepsi. Look no further than Walmart. Look no \nfurther than Mars. You can go over there to the candy drawer and you \ncan get wonderful Mars products. It is a huge company. They are going \ncarbon neutral. They are desperately concerned about climate change. \nLook at Nike, look at Google, look at Apple--American company after \nAmerican company.\n  The only place, other than, of course, the 9,000 people who joined \nthe Spice Girls and MAJ Frank Burns on this petition, where denial is \nanything credible any longer is here in Congress where the money from \nthe fossil fuel industry still has such a pernicious effect. But even \namong the Republicans--I will close by saying this and yield to my \ndistinguished chairman. Even among the Republicans, they are losing \ntheir young voters on this issue. People know better. You poll \nRepublicans who are under the age of 35 and a majority of them will say \nthat somebody who believes in climate denial is ignorant, out of touch \nor crazy. That is what the young Republicans think about that position. \nSo time is on our side. The day will come when the Senate can face the \nfact that climate change is real. I want to thank Senator Klobuchar and \nsalute her effort to bring such a noncontroversial proposition to the \nfloor in the form of a resolution--such a noncontroversial and factual \nproposition. It is a measure of our times and a measure of this body \nand a measure of the influence on it that it was not adopted by \nunanimous consent but was objected to by the Republicans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Klobuchar from the bottom \nof my heart for writing such a sensible resolution. People who do not \nknow Amy Klobuchar, as I know her, may not know that she is terrific at \nbringing both sides together. She does it every day of the week. I \ncould list all of the issues, but I will not take the time to do that. \nThe record speaks for itself.\n  But on this one, on this simple statement of fact, our Republican \nfriends will not even let that go. This is amazing. This is not a \ndocument that says this is how we should fix climate change or this is \nhow we should address it. She does not get into that. She stays away \nfrom that because there are legitimate differences.\n  Some people say: Let's keep on making more electric cars. Some people \nsay: Let's focus on energy efficiency in our homes. Some people say: \nShut down the old coal powerplants. It is dangerous to breathe that \nair. They are adding to the problem.\n  She does not get into that. All she does in this beautifully elegant \nand simple resolution is state the facts. First, the resolution \nacknowledges that the National Climate Assessment report, which is \ncongressionally required--the Congress set it up--states that serious \nimpacts are happening all around us. That report was drafted by more \nthan 300 experts. Guess what it shows? This is what she points out. \nThere are more frequent heat waves, wildfires, and droughts. Coming \nfrom California, I can tell you, we are in a terrible fire season. We \ngo to bed at night not knowing what we are going to hear in the morning \nwhen we wake up about the raging wildfires in our great State.\n  We see them in all of our neighboring States as well, whether it is \nWashington, or Oregon or Arizona. The least we can do is acknowledge we \nhave more frequent fires, that we have a terrible drought in the West, \nand that this is a fact in evidence. It is not a fact not in evidence.\n  Second, the resolution acknowledges that our top military leaders at \nthe Pentagon have concluded the impacts of climate change are a growing \nconcern. Sometimes when the military makes a statement it is hard to \nunderstand it. This one is really clear. Do you know what they say? \nThey say that climate change is moving from a threat multiplier to a \ncatalyst for conflict. Let me say that again. They used to think it was \na threat multiplier. So if there was a problem, say, in Syria, where \nthere is a horrific drought--and some people think that whole conflict \nhas a lot of roots in that drought--where it used to be a multiplier, \nnow they are saying it could actually be the reason why there are \nconflicts.\n  Now, I cannot believe my Republican friends would cast away the words \nof our military leaders and stand up here and object to this \nresolution. All it says is: Climate change is happening. These are the \npeople who say it is happening. It is a risk to the American people if \nwe do not address it.\n  Now, I will close with this. In our committee Senator Whitehouse had \nan incredible hearing he organized. It was amazing. I sat through the \nentire hearing. He invited four former Republican EPA Administrators \nwho served under the last four Republican Presidents: Richard Nixon, \nRonald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and George W. Bush. Now, \nlisten to this. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker \nBush, and George W. Bush--all of these former administrators said: \nClimate change requires action now, and it should not be a partisan \nissue. I ask rhetorically: When did the environment become a partisan \nissue? When I first got into politics--it was a while ago--but it was \ncompletely bipartisan.\n  We addressed this issue together because the health of the American \npeople, the ability to go to work and breathe clean air and not have an \nasthma attack or a heart attack, the desire to make sure our kids are \nswimming in safe, clean water and drinking clean water. This wasn't \npartisan.\n  The latest thing we know--and this is critical to put in the Record \nat this time--is that when we clean up dirty, filthy carbon pollution, \nwe also make sure the air is cleaner to breathe. This is critical. That \nis why the administration's plan is going to lead to healthier \ncommunities. We can't afford to sit around here debating whether \nclimate change is real. We can't afford that.\n  All we wanted to say in this resolution and all Senator Klobuchar \nsays is that climate change is happening. The experts are telling us. \nThe peer review scientists are telling us. The military is telling us. \nEverybody is telling us.\n  Yes, as Senator Whitehouse said, there is a small group of people--\nthere always has been and there always will be--but we didn't wait \nbefore we protected our people from tobacco smoke because 10 percent of \nthe scientists said: No, no, no, it doesn't cause cancer.\n  I would love to be able to bring back the lives of those lost when \nthe tobacco companies put their dirty money all around the Capitol and \nstopped us from acting.\n  I am proud to stand with my friends.\n  When history is written--trust me on this one--they are going to look \nat us and say: What did they do? What did they do to step to the plate?\n  President Obama did, and we are protecting his rules here. But we \nhave a job to do. It all starts with acknowledging that there is a \nproblem. If you don't acknowledge that there is a problem, you will \nnever fix it.\n  I thank my friend Senator Klobuchar for her leadership, and I hope \nshe will not be deterred because I want to be back on this floor with \nher, Senator Whitehouse, and others as many times as she is willing to \nput this forward because it is that important.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank Senator Boxer.\n  We now have 21 cosponsors. We are adding daily. We have cosponsors, \nof course, from coastal States. States such as Hawaii and Maine see the \neffect of the water all around them. Independent Senator Angus King is \na cosponsor of this resolution. We have Colorado, with Senator Udall \nand Senator Bennet, who are cosponsors, who understand the risk of \nwildfire and what they see in their State with climate change. We have \nStates in the Midwest, such as Iowa, with Senator Harkin; Michigan, \nwith Senator Stabenow, the chair of the Agriculture Committee. They \nunderstand what drought means to farmers.\n  This is not just a coastal problem; this is a problem across the \nUnited States as we are seeing the disruptions of climate change.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a link to a \nJune 14 report called ``Risky Business, The Economic Risks of Climate \nChange in the United States.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       http://riskybusiness.org/uploads/files/Risk Business \n     _Report_WEB_7_22_14.pdf\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I wanted to follow up on the good words not only of \nSenator Boxer but my good friend Senator Whitehouse, as he took on some \nof the words we were hearing from our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator \nInhofe, as he talked about collusion of the people in this area--\ncollusion. I guess he meant with the President of the United States.\n  I looked at some of the names on this report--Hank Paulson, former \nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury under George Bush. I am trying to \nimagine him colluding with President Obama, and I just can't picture it \nright now.\n  Gregory Page is someone I know, the former head of Cargill, the CEO \nof Cargill, a multinational company--the biggest company in the United \nStates--based in Minnesota. The executive chairman of Cargill is a part \nof this report warning the business community, looking at what the \nrisks are to the business community. I can tell you he is not colluding \nwith the President of the United States.\n  Olympia Snowe--talk about an independent--the former Senator from the \nState of Maine, is part of this group issuing this report. She is not \ncolluding with the President of the United States.\n  As Senator Whitehouse pointed out, all of these military branches and \npeople from the branches of our military who look at this as a security \nrisk are looking at this and literally following the oath. They are \ndoing what they are supposed to do--their duty, their duty to protect \nour country--and they see this as a threat to national security, to the \nUnited States, a threat to our standing in the world and to the scarce \nresources we are seeing with water not only in the United States but \nall across the world--a threat.\n  This is not collusion. This is science. These are facts. In my State \nwe embrace science. We brought the world everything from the pacemaker \nto the Post-it note. We are the home of the Mayo Clinic. We believe in \nscience.\n  What this resolution does is it simply states the science, drafted by \nover 300 authors, the 2014 National Climate Assessment, extensively \nreviewed by the National Academy of Sciences, with support, with the \nfacts.\n  From the Department of Defense, the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review \nof the Department of Defense states that ``the pressures caused by \nclimate change will influence resource competition while placing \nadditional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions \naround the world.''\n  All this says is let's get the facts straight. It is a sense of the \nSenate that global climate change is occurring and will continue to \npose ongoing risks and challenges to the people and the government of \nthe United States. That is all it says.\n  We are going to have major debate on how to solve this problem. That \ndebate is going on right now. But unless we can at least get a vote and \nsome support in the Senate for this problem that is happening, when 63 \npercent of Americans know it is happening, we look silly. The people \nare in front of us again. The businesses are in front of us. The church \ngroups are in front of us. The scientists are in front of us. The \nhunting groups in my State are in front of us. It is time that we \nacknowledge we have a problem and then move on to fix it.\n  As Senator Boxer posed at the end of her remarks, yes, we will be \nback. I am someone who likes to get things done, and I believe the \nfirst thing we need to do is to get an agreement here on the fact that \nwe have a problem. Once we have done that, we can move on and work on \nthose solutions.\n  Senator Whitehouse has been a leader in the Senate, has been to those \ncoastal communities not only in Rhode Island but up and down the coast \nlooking at that damage, seeing what is happening in Virginia, and \nseeing what is happening in Florida.\n  I yield for the Senator from Rhode Island for closing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senator Klobuchar. It has been a pleasure \nworking with the Senator.\n  This was an important step today. It was the most benign, factual, \nnoncontroversial statement of virtually undisputed facts that one could \nimagine. Yet, here of all places it was unable to achieve consent.\n  Let me close by mentioning that this is not something that happens \noff in some other place; it is happening right in our homes.\n  In Rhode Island, the tide gauge at Naval Station Newport is up 10 \ninches since the 1930s. We have had big storms before. We have had big \nhurricanes before. They do a lot of damage to our State, adding 10 \ninches of more ocean to our shores. That is serious for my State. That \nis deadly serious for my State. You can't argue with a tide gauge. It \nis not complicated; it is a measurement.\n  We can look at the experience of Rhode Island fishermen who are \nhauling up fish such as tarpon and grouper. Fishermen have told me they \nstarted fishing on their granddad's boat and they finished on their \ndad's boat and in their lives they never saw these fish. But because of \nthe warming seas I talked about earlier, these tropical fish are coming \nup into Rhode Island waters. When the seas warm, they get bigger. It is \ncalled the law of thermal expansion. It is not a law we passed; it is a \nlaw of God's Earth. To deny that is to deny the fundamental premises of \nthis planet.\n  If you think the Rhode Island gauge is weird, go down to Fort \nPulaski, GA, where I went on my tour of the southern coast. Tides are \nup there as well, same thing. The ocean is warming, the seas are \nrising, and it creates much more risk for our coastal communities.\n  You can go as far away from Rhode Island as you like. You can go to \nUtah; how about that. The Park City Foundation, which represents the \nskiing community--a lot of people go to Utah to ski--says climate \nchange is serious, carbon pollution is causing it, and we are going to \nlose a lot of business because we are not going to have as much snow. \nIt is going to shorten our season and make life much more difficult.\n\n  It is the same in New Hampshire, back on our coast. I went up to New \nHampshire a little while ago and met with the ski industry. They are \nseeing much more need to make snow because they are not getting the \nsnow they used to. If you want to go cross-country skiing or if you \nwant to go on a ski mobile tour, they can't make snow on those trails, \nso they are getting clobbered.\n  What is really getting clobbered from the lack of snow is that iconic \nNew Hampshire animal--the moose. Evidently, the way ticks breed, snow \nkills them off, and when the moose are walking around on snow they are \nprotected from ticks, but when the snow is not there the ticks come at \nthem.\n  I was told in New Hampshire about young moose calves that had not 1 \ntick on them, not 100 ticks on them, not 1,000 ticks on them--10,000 \nticks on them. Adult moose have been found with 100,000 ticks on them. \nThey are sucking so much blood out of these animals that they can't \ncome up, they sicken, and they die. That is from the New Hampshire \nscientists, including people at the University of New Hampshire, State \nuniversities.\n  Utah Senators can deny this is real and refuse to talk about it, but \nUtah State universities both have climate change programs, and they \nboth have\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\npeople studying climate change. How can their State universities have \nprograms and people studying climate change in their home States and \nthen they come to Washington and pretend it is not real? It doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  How can a New Hampshire Senator not come here and admit it is real \nwhen the University of New Hampshire is so active in all of this?\n  Florida--I will stop with Florida because Florida is probably the \nworst of all. Florida is getting hugely hurt by sea level rise. One of \nour great cities floods at high tide in Florida.\n  I went down on my visit, and I stopped at the Army Corps of \nEngineers. People may think that the Army Corps of Engineers is some \nliberal organization colluding with somebody to do improper stuff and \nthat they can't be trusted, but that is not the way people behave \naround here on any other subject. When the Army Corps wants to build \nlakes or dam rivers or build levees or anything else, we have 100 \npercent confidence in them. We have confidence in the Army Corps of \nEngineers. So you have to take with a grain of salt some of this \nskepticism about the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers expert in Florida says that as the sea \nlevel rises it shoves saltwater by pressure into the limestone southern \nFlorida is made of. You can actually measure the infiltration of \nsaltwater into what used to be freshwater wells, and the line moves \nback from the coast as the sea level rises and creates hydraulic \npressure. As they try to create counterhydraulic pressure, which they \ndo with freshwater to push back in this hard limestone sponge, they \nraise the water level for freshwater. They said Florida is in a box. \nThere is no way out. It is either going to flood with sea level or \nflood with freshwater. There is no way out. This is the Army Corps of \nEngineers expert in Jacksonville, FL. Why won't our colleague from \nFlorida listen to the Army Corps of Engineers expert from his own \nState?\n  We have to get through this, and we will, but it is going take \npressure, it is going to take leadership, and it is going to take the \nkind of leadership Senator Klobuchar showed this evening on the floor. \nI am immensely grateful to her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, at a ceremony at the White House, \nPresident Obama awarded the National Medal of Arts to a distinguished \nauthor who calls the Green Mountains of Vermont home: Julia Alvarez.\n  Born in the United States but raised in the Dominican Republic, Julia \nAlvarez grew up under the brutal dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo. \nFearing for their lives after her father became involved in the \nrevolution to overthrow Trujillo, Ms. Alvarez and her family fled to \nthe United States. Just months later, three of the leaders of that \nunderground movement--Patria Mirabal Reyes, Minerva Mirabel Reyes, and \nMaria Mirabal Reyes--were brutally murdered. It was this series of \nevents that compelled Ms. Alvarez to author, ``In the Time of the \nButterflies.'' The fiction novel based on real-life events is a story \nincorporated into the curriculum of schools around the world, including \nmany Vermont schools. Ms. Alvarez's novel explains the complexities of \nfamily and cultural divide, while celebrating strength in the face of \noppression.\n  Julia Alvarez has been a trailblazer in Latino literature. When Julia \nstarted writing, Latino literature was only considered an ``ethnic \ninterest.'' Today, her work is well known in America and around the \nworld, thanks to her passion and creativity.\n  Ms. Alvarez first came to Vermont as a student at Middlebury College. \nShe graduated with a bachelor of arts, summa cum laude. Years later, \nshe has returned to Middlebury College as the author-in-residence. She \ncontinues to mentor students and gives back to the institution that \nnurtured her soul as a writer.\n  Julia has now spent more time in Vermont than anywhere else in the \nworld, and she calls our great State ``the mother of [her] soul.'' I \ncan think of no more fitting recipient of the National Medal of Arts \nthan Julia Alvarez. Vermonters are proud of the courage that her works \ndisplay, and the passion with which she weaves her own personal history \ninto compelling novels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4993-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNITED STATES-ISRAEL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last year, I cosponsored the United \nStates-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2013. The sponsor of the \nbill is reintroducing the bill with some modifications. While I am \nagain cosponsoring this new bill, I wanted to remind my colleagues of \nmy concerns related to the visa waiver section of the bill. The Visa \nWaiver Program is a benefit to other countries, and they are allowed to \nparticipate after meeting certain conditions, which are laid out in \nstatute. A section in the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership \nAct provides authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive \nthe requirements and allow Israel to participate in the program. \nSpecifically, under the legislation, Israel would not have to abide by \nthe low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate standard. As I stated \npreviously, I am concerned about this section of the bill because it \nsets a precedent for other countries not to have to abide by all the \nterms of the program. Neither Congress or the executive branch should \nbe making exceptions to the rules. I support the bill because it \nreaffirms the United States' partnership with Israel, however, we need \nto be cautious in relaxing the rules regarding the Visa Waiver Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4993-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4993-S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BRING JOBS HOME ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bring Jobs Home \nAct.\n  I am a blue-collar Senator. I grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood \nin Baltimore during World War II where my father had a small \nneighborhood grocery store.\n  We were the neighborhood of mom-and-pop businesses and factories. We \nmade liberty ships. We put out turbo steel to make the tanks. Glenn L. \nMartin made the seaplanes that helped win the battle of the Pacific. We \nwere in the manufacturing business. But the blue-collar Baltimore of \nWorld War II, Korea, and Vietnam just isn't what it used to be.\n  In the last decade, 2.4 million American jobs were shipped overseas. \nWhere did those jobs go? Those jobs are on a slow boat to China and a \nfast track to Mexico. And why did they go?\n  In some cases, they went because of tax breaks that rewarded \ncorporations for moving manufacturing overseas. It is wrong to give \ncompanies incentives to send jobs to other countries, especially when \nmillions of Americans are looking for work.\n  The current Tax Code is putting companies that keep their business \nhere, hire their workers at home, pay their share of taxes, and provide \nhealth care to their employees, at a disadvantage.\n  We should be rewarding these companies with ``good guy'' tax breaks \nfor hiring and building their businesses right here in the United \nStates.\n  I have been on a jobs tour of Maryland. I visited bakeries, \nmicrobreweries, and factories of small machine tool companies. I \nvisited Main Street, small streets, and rural communities.\n  I talked with business owners and their employees. These are ``good \nguy'' businesses. They work hard and play by the rules. They have jobs \nright here in the United States. They want to expand. They want to \nhire. They need a government on their side and at their side.\n  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Bring Jobs Home Act. This \nbill ends the loophole that gives companies a tax break for sending \njobs overseas.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act tells companies: If you want to export jobs \nout of America, you can't file a deduction\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\nfor doing it. And it ensures the Tax Code can't be used to boost \ncorporate rewards at the expense of American workers.\n  Economic patriotism means bringing our jobs back home, bringing our \nmoney back home, and standing up for America. So let's pass the Bring \nJobs Home Act and take an important step toward economic patriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4994-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this past Friday, July 25, marked the 40th \nanniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, LSC. In 1974, Congress \nenacted legislation with the signature of President Nixon that \nestablished LSC with bipartisan support. LSC is a private, nonprofit \ncorporation, funded by Congress, with the mission to ensure equal \naccess to justice under law for all Americans by providing civil legal \nassistance to those who otherwise would be unable to afford it. LSC \ndistributes almost all of its annual Federal appropriations to 134 \nlocal legal aid programs, serving communities in every State.\n  In Maryland, according to the Maryland Legal Services Corporation, \nMLSC, services to clients in fiscal year 2013 increased 5 percent from \nthe prior year, with MLSC grantees opening nearly 168,000 new cases, a \nrecord high, and benefiting almost 252,000 individuals and families. \nFamily cases, about one-third of all cases, involved domestic violence, \nchild custody, child support, and other matters and benefited nearly \n80,000 people. Foreclosures, evictions, and other housing cases, also \nalmost one-third of cases, benefited approximately 94,000 individuals \nand families. Debt collection, bankruptcy, and other consumer cases, \nwhich are one-fifth of all cases, directly benefited 23,000 individuals \nand families. The private bar handled almost 8,000 cases through MLSC-\nfunded organizations. Pro bono attorneys gave nearly 69,000 hours, \nrepresenting almost $19 million in donated legal services.\n  And finally, helping to leverage pro bono, the judicare project \nreferred about 1,000 judicare cases to nearly 500 reduced-fee attorneys \nthat provided 22,000 hours of services, including at least 2,000 pro \nbono hours, which benefited 2,700 individuals and families.\n  Let me just give a few examples of the excellent work done by MLSC \ngrantees over the last year as a result of the grants given by LSC. \n``Shirley'' was thrilled to move into her new house in Baltimore County \nafter nearly 3 years in a nursing facility with help from the Maryland \nDisability Law Center, MDLC. Shirley had a special voucher for non \nelderly persons with disabilities who are transitioning from nursing \nhomes to the community, but ran into obstacles finding the right place \nand location to meet her needs. MDLC's Sun shine Folk, a group of \nadvocates with disabilities who were formerly institutionalized, and \nMDLC's housing lawyers helped Shirley get an extension of her voucher \nand a professional housing transition team, ensuring that her rights to \nreasonable accommodations were protected.\n  Several years ago, Kenneth Brown's mother learned that her landlord \nwas in foreclosure and that Fannie Mae wanted to evict her from her \nlong-time Baltimore home. But through the Brown family's persistence, \nPublic Justice Center's, PJC legal advocacy, and the support of \ncommunity organizing partners, Kenneth and his brother Berveyn were \nable to buy the home this year. Together, PJC and the Browns challenged \nmultiple eviction attempts in court and demanded needed repairs. PJC \ncommunity organizing partners also secured a meeting with Fannie Mae \nexecutives. The Browns avoided eviction and ultimately bought the house \nfrom Fannie Mae.\n  After visiting Baltimore Catholic Charities Immigration Legal \nServices years ago for getting help obtaining her legal permanent \nresidence green card, ``Jeannette'' returned to apply for \nnaturalization with the help of a volunteer attorney during one of \nILS's regular naturalization clinics, and was sworn in as a U.S. \ncitizen.\n  I remain concerned about the access to justice gap that still exists \ntoday. We must do better than turn away more than 50 percent of \neligible clients who seek assistance because of the lack of LSC program \nresources. I support full funding of LSC's budget request for fiscal \nyear 2015. I strongly support lifting unnecessary, burdensome, and \ncounterproductive congressional restrictions, such as restrictions on \nfiling class action lawsuits and recovering attorneys' fees. Congress \nshould also remove restrictions on the use of non-LSC funds by LSC \ngrantees.\n  I commend the LSC, MLSC, and the many LSC-funded attorneys and \nprivate sector lawyers who have donated pro bono hours and who strive \nto live up to the commitment of our legal system to provide equal \njustice under law. Last week I attended a Federal judicial investiture \nceremony in Maryland, and the judge swore to ``administer justice \nwithout respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the \nrich.'' Congress needs to live up to the same commitment that we \nrequire our Federal judges to make before sitting on the bench and \ndeciding cases. Let us make sure that millions of Americans who need \naccess to legal assistance are provided that critical help in cases \nthat will have a profound impact on their lives, their family, and \ntheir community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4994-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4994-S4995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT GENERAL MARC REYNOLDS, RETIRED\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am saddened to report to my Senate \ncolleagues the passing of a true American hero and defender of our \ngreat Nation, Lt. Gen. Marc C. Reynolds, Retired, who passed away with \nhis family by his side on Monday, July 21, 2014.\n  Marc was born in Chamberlain, a small town in south central South \nDakota, to the late Morris and Ione Reynolds, in 1928, and graduated \nfrom Chamberlain High School in 1946. After high school, he moved on to \nColorado where he worked at Estes Park, Montgomery Wards, and attended \nthe University of Denver before entering the Air Force as an aviation \ncadet in January 1951. He was commissioned upon graduation from pilot \ntraining in February 1952.\n  Marc flew F-94B, F-94C, and F-101B air defense assignments between \n1952 and 1961 that included rotations to Air Force bases in California, \nWashington, Okinawa, and Massachusetts. He transitioned to \nreconnaissance missions in 1961 with an assignment to the Royal Air \nForce Station in Bruntingthorpe, England, flying RB-66s. After \ncompleting Air Command and Staff College in 1966, Marc moved to the \n460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Republic \nof Vietnam, and flew 230 combat missions in RF-4C's over North Vietnam \nand the Republic of Vietnam.\n  Following his Southeast Asia tour of duty, Marc continued with air \nreconnaissance assignments in Japan and South Carolina. He graduated \nfrom the Naval War College in August 1973 and transitioned out of \nflying assignments and into logistics, where he was assigned to the \nOgden Air Logistics Center, UT, initially as the director of \ndistribution and later as director of maintenance.\n  In July 1976, he transferred to McClellan Air Force Base, CA, as the \ndirector of materiel management, Sacramento Air Logistics Center. In \nMarch 1978, he became the center's vice commander. Marc moved to \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH, in May 1980 as vice commander of \nthe Air Force Acquisition Logistics Division and took command of the \ndivision in October 1981. In July 1983, he was appointed commander of \nthe Ogden Air Logistics Center, UT.\n  In Marc's last assignment, he served as the vice commander, Air Force \nLogistics Command, with headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase, OH. In this assignment, he provided worldwide technical logistics \nsupport to all Air Force active and reserve force activities, military \nassistance program countries and designated U.S. government agencies.\n  Marc was a command pilot with more than 5,200 flying hours, including \n475 combat hours. His military decorations and awards include the \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished \nFlying Cross, the Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the \nAir Medal with 15 oak leaf clusters and the Air Force Commendation \nMedal with two oak leaf clusters.\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n  Marc's passion for aviation continued after his Air Force retirement \nwhen he accepted a position on the Utah Aerospace Heritage Foundation \nboard, which helped fund projects for the Hill Aerospace Museum located \nnear Hill Air Force Base. He eventually became its chairman and served \na total of 26 years on the board. Marc worked tirelessly in the \ncommunity to raise funds and searched around the world to obtain \naircraft displays to enhance Utah's great Air Force museum. Through \nMarc's efforts, the museum added two additional hangars and it \ncontinued as one of Utah's top visitor attractions. Marc was also a \nregular fixture at the local Ogden Airport where he kept his airplanes \nand loved swapping flying stories with his fellow ``airport bums.'' He \nenjoyed flying friends and family around the local area and never \nmissed the annual flight back to Oshkosh, WI for the aviation \ncelebration at Oshkosh.\n  Marc was the consummate gentleman and servant/leader who was loved by \neveryone who knew and worked with him. His gift was his extraordinary \ngenerosity and natural ability to make people feel important.\n  Marc is survived by his loving wife of 30 years, Ellie, six children: \nPam Chatelain, Barbara Reynolds, Scott Reynolds, Lisa Oelke, Kristan \nIngebretsen, and Karine Kucej, 15 grandchildren, and 12 great \ngrandchildren. The family wishes to pass on a hearty thanks to the \ncaregivers at Gentiva Hospice Health Care, McKay-Dee Hospital, and the \nGeorge E. Wahlen Ogden Veterans Home, who took very good care of Marc \nin his time of need.\n  I wanted to personally highlight this great man's achievements, his \nservice to our country and our freedoms, and his devotion to his family \nand his community.\n  It was my honor to have known Marc and to make tribute to yet another \nremarkable patriot that we are so proud of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4995-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MERL PAAVERUD\n\n Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I wish to honor Merl Paaverud, \nwho is retiring later this year after serving the State of North Dakota \nfor the past 31 years. Merl has dedicated his life and career to \ndocumenting and preserving our State's history, and it is only fitting \nthat his retirement culminates as North Dakota celebrates its 125th \nanniversary.\n  In 1983, Merl began his career with the State of North Dakota as \nsupervisor for the Fort Totten State Historic Site where he had the \nchallenge of managing the upkeep of the 1867 military post. After his \nservice at Fort Totten, Merl was the grants administrator in the Office \nof Intergovernmental Assistance. From 1993 to 2001, he served as \ndirector of the North Dakota Archaeology and Historic Preservation \nDivision.\n  Merl understands the importance of documenting and preserving the \nlives and stories of our State and its people for future generations. \nFor the past 13 years, Merl has served as the director of the North \nDakota State Historical Society. In this position, he led a significant \nexpansion and renovation of the North Dakota Heritage Center and State \nMuseum. Under his leadership, the center has become the ``Smithsonian \nof the Plains.'' In addition, he has played a pivotal role in the \npurchase of the boyhood home of Lawrence Welk, which will highlight the \nregion's strong German-Russian heritage along with the important role \nof agriculture in our State.\n  Merl's passion and commitment to public service has been demonstrated \nthrough his service to our country during his time in the U.S. Air \nForce and in every position he has held throughout his years with the \nState of North Dakota. This dedication has not gone unnoticed by his \npeers or the public. His ever present smile and steady leadership will \nbe missed. I want to thank Merl for his years of public service to the \npeople of North Dakota, current and past, and wish him a happy and full \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4995-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4995-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  In executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4995-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3212) to ensure \ncompliance with the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of \nInternational Child Abduction by countries with which the United States \nenjoys reciprocal obligations, to establish procedures for the prompt \nreturn of children abducted to other countries, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House passed the following bills, \nwithout amendment:\n\n       S. 517.

Rept. 113-12)\n\n  The text of the committee-recommended resolution of advice and \nconsent to ratification is as follows:\n\n       As reported by the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein),\n       Section 1. Senate Advice and Consent Subject to \n     Reservations, Understandings, and Declarations.\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, \n     adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December \n     13, 2006, and signed by the United States of America on June \n     30, 2009 (``the Convention'') (Treaty Doc. 112-7), subject to \n     the reservations of section 2, the understandings of section \n     3, and the declarations of section 4.\n       Sec. 2. Reservations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of \n     the Convention is subject to the following reservations, \n     which shall be included in the instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The Convention shall be implemented by the Federal \n     Government of the United States of America to the extent that \n     it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the \n     matters covered therein, and otherwise by the State and local \n     governments. To the extent that State and local governments \n     exercise jurisdiction over such matters, the obligations of \n     the United States of America under the Convention are limited \n     to the Federal Government's taking measures appropriate to \n     the Federal system, which may include enforcement action \n     against State and local actions that are inconsistent with \n     the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), or other Federal laws, with the \n     ultimate objective of fully implementing the Convention.\n       (2) The Constitution and laws of the United States of \n     America establish extensive protections against \n     discrimination, reaching all forms of governmental activity \n     as well as significant areas of non-governmental activity. \n     Individual privacy and freedom from governmental interference \n     in certain private conduct are also recognized as among the \n     fundamental values of our free and democratic society. The \n     United States of America understands that by its terms the \n     Convention can be read to require broad regulation of private \n     conduct. To the extent it does, the United States of America \n     does not accept any obligation under the Convention to enact \n     legislation or take other measures with respect to private \n     conduct except as mandated by the Constitution and laws of \n     the United States of America.\n       (3) Article 15 of the Convention memorializes existing \n     prohibitions on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment contained in Articles 2 and \n     16 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other \n     Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted \n     by the United Nations General Assembly December 10, 1984, and \n     entered into force June 26, 1987 (the ``CAT'') and in Article \n     7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly \n     December 16, 1966, and entered into force March 23, 1976 (the \n     ``ICCPR''), and further provides that such protections shall \n     be extended on an equal basis with respect to persons with \n     disabilities. To ensure consistency of application, the \n     obligations of the United States of America under Article 15 \n     of the Convention shall be subject to the same reservations \n     and understandings that apply for the United States of \n     America with respect to Articles 1 and 16 of the CAT and \n     Article 7 of the ICCPR.\n       Sec. 3. Understandings.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of \n     the Convention is subject to the following understandings, \n     which shall be included in the instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America understands that this \n     Convention, including Article 8 thereof, does not authorize \n     or require legislation or other action that would restrict \n     the right of free speech, expression, and association \n     protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States \n     of America.\n       (2) Given that under Article 1 of the Convention ``[tithe \n     purpose of the present Convention is to promote, protect, and \n     ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities,'' with \n     respect to the application of the Convention to matters \n     related to economic, social, and cultural rights, including \n     in Articles 4(2), 24, 25, 27, 28, and 30, the United States \n     of America understands that its obligations in this respect \n     are to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in \n     the provision of any such rights insofar as they are \n     recognized and implemented under United States law.\n       (3) Current United States law provides strong protections \n     for persons with disabilities against unequal pay, including \n     the right to equal pay for equal work. The United States of \n     America understands the Convention to require the protection \n     of rights of individuals with disabilities on an equal basis \n     with others, including individuals in other protected groups, \n     and does not require adoption of a comparable worth framework \n     for persons with disabilities.\n       (4) Article 27 of the Convention provides that States \n     Parties shall take appropriate steps to afford to individuals \n     with disabilities the right to equal access to equal work, \n     including nondiscrimination in hiring and promotion of \n     employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector. \n     Current interpretation of Section 501 of the Rehabilitation \n     Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791) exempts\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\n     United States military departments charged with defense of \n     the national security from liability with regard to members \n     of the uniformed services. The United States of America \n     understands the obligations of Article 27 to take appropriate \n     steps as not affecting hiring, promotion, or other terms or \n     conditions of employment of uniformed employees in the United \n     States military departments, and that Article 27 does not \n     recognize rights in this regard that exceed those rights \n     available under United States law.\n       (5) The United States of America understands that the terms \n     ``disability'', ``persons with disabilities'', and ``undue \n     burden'' (terms that are not defined in the Convention), \n     ``discrimination on the basis of disability'', and \n     ``reasonable accommodation'' are defined for the United \n     States of America coextensively with the definitions of such \n     terms pursuant to relevant United States law.\n       (6) The United States understands that the Committee on the \n     Rights of Persons with Disabilities, established under \n     Article 34 of the Convention, has an important, but limited \n     and advisory role. The United States understands that the \n     Committee has no authority to compel actions by the United \n     States, and the United States does not consider conclusions, \n     recommendations, or general comments issued by the Committee \n     as constituting customary international law or to be legally \n     binding on the United States in any manner. The United States \n     further understands that the Committee's interpretations of \n     the Convention are not legally binding on the United States.\n       (7) The United States of America understands that the \n     Convention is a nondiscrimination instrument. Therefore, \n     nothing in the Convention, including Article 25, addresses \n     the provision of any particular health program or procedure. \n     Rather, the Convention requires that health programs and \n     procedures are provided to individuals with disabilities on a \n     nondiscriminatory basis.\n       (8) The United States of America understands that, for the \n     United States of America, the term or principle of the ``best \n     interests of the child'' as used in Article 7(2), will be \n     applied and interpreted to be coextensive with its \n     application and interpretation under United States law. \n     Consistent with this understanding, nothing in Article 7 \n     requires a change to existing United States Federal, State, \n     or local law.\n       (9) Nothing in the Convention limits the rights of parents \n     to homeschool their children.\n       Sec. 4. Declarations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of \n     the Convention is subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) The United States of America declares that the \n     provisions of the Convention are not self-executing.\n       (2) The Senate declares that, in view of the reservations \n     to be included in the instrument of ratification, current \n     United States law fulfills or exceeds the obligations of the \n     Convention for the United States of America\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/28/senate-section/article/S4997-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Flake):\n       S. 2670.
