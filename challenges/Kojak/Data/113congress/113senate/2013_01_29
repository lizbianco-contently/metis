Mr. President, today women make up nearly half of the \nAmerican workforce. More women graduate from college today than do men, \nmore women were sworn in to the 113th Congress than any Congress before \nthat, and there are more women in the Democratic caucus than ever \nbefore--and that is an understatement. Millions of women in the United \nStates are the primary wage earners for their families, and women are \nnow free to fight for this county on the front lines of battle. Yet, \nfor millions of American women, no amount of valor, talent, or \ndedication will bring pay equality with their male peers. Women still \nbring home 77 cents for every $1 their male colleagues earn for doing \nexactly the same work.\n  I have five children. My oldest child is a girl, my daughter Lana. I \nmean, it is hard to comprehend that she is worth less than one of my \nboys who does the same work. It is unfair. And that is true regardless \nof whether a woman has a college degree, regardless of what job she \nholds, and regardless of how many hours she spends at the office or \nfactory each week. They get paid 77 cents on average for every $1 a man \nmakes.\n  Four years ago President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct. I have gotten to know this dynamic, courageous woman, Lilly \nLedbetter. She has campaigned around the country for people she likes \nand believe in her. I am so impressed with her and what she has been \nable to accomplish. This one woman has accomplished a great deal.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter legislation--the first bill President Obama \nsigned as President of the United States--was the single greatest \nlegislative step to ensure women have every chance to be full, equal \nparticipants in the workplace since the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was \npassed. But while this landmark legislation built on the legacy of the \nEqual Pay Act and narrowed the pay gap, it has not closed the pay gap, \nas I have just indicated. So the senior Senator from Maryland, Barbara \nMikulski, introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act last Congress. The \nPaycheck Fairness Act is a logical extension of protections under the \nEqual Pay Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It would help close \nthe wage disparity by empowering women to negotiate for equal pay and \ncreating strong incentives for employers to obey the laws already in \nplace. It would give workers stronger tools to combat wage \ndiscrimination and bar retaliation against\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\nworkers for discussing salary information. And it would help secure \nadequate compensation for victims of gender-based pay discrimination. \nIt is simply not fair that any woman working the same hours in the same \njob should make less money than her male coworker.\n  Unfortunately, this commonsense legislation was blocked by a \nRepublican filibuster last Congress. But Senator Mikulski, who has done \nso much to advance the pay equity issue, reintroduced the measure last \nweek, for which I am grateful.\n  As we mark the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Lilly \nLedbetter Act, I applaud Senator Mikulski and the women of the \nDemocratic caucus for their dedication to American women and families--\nand to the principle of equality.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  Oh, I am sorry, I did not see the Republican leader here, so my \napology, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S336-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Mr. President, over the past several days, I have \nspoken of the need for the two parties to come together to address the \nFederal debt. We need to act quickly if we are going to avert a \nEuropean-style debt crisis and avoid the harsh austerity that would \nbring.\n  But this is about more than just avoiding a calamity, as serious as \nthat prospect has become. What this debate offers is a once-in-a-\ngeneration opportunity to update government for the 21st century, to \nmodernize programs that work, and to reform ones that do not. Many \nFederal bureaucracies have not been reformed in any real way since the \nage of black-and-white television. Even if we did not have a debt \ncrisis, we should want to reform them. This debate is an opportunity to \ndo so.\n  By making government leaner and more efficient, we can sweep away \noutdated and heavyhanded regulations that have impeded private sector \ngrowth and the job creation we so desperately need. And by reducing the \ndebt, we can eliminate an additional drag on our economy.\n  So this is not a conversation about austerity; it is a conversation \nabout growth and opportunity. That does not mean we are all going to \nagree on the path forward. Americans certainly expect a serious policy \ndebate. They expect both parties to offer competing plans to preserve \nand protect long-term entitlement programs, and they expect both sides \nto propose different plans to get our fiscal house in order and our \ncountry back to economic health.\n  Republicans have done their part. The budgets passed by House \nRepublicans over the past couple of years contain fresh ideas that \nwould help solve our fiscal crisis. Policymakers from both Chambers and \nfrom statehouses across the country have put forward a number of their \nown ideas and proposals as well. But from the Democrats? So far, not \nmuch. Four years on, President Obama and congressional Democrats still \nhave yet to offer a serious plan to address the economic challenges we \nface. They have been content to wage political war instead.\n  It is my hope, however, that the debate over the debt ceiling will \nfinally move our friends on the other side beyond their preoccupation \nwith the horse race. Already, Senate Democrats have committed to \ndeveloping a budget this year, after years of ducking their \nresponsibility to do so. Hopefully, this will be a serious exercise and \nnot simply an excuse for them to try to raise taxes, which, as we all \nknow, is just another way to avoid solving core problems. Last week I \ncame to the floor with a chart which showed that even if the President \ngot every single tax increase he asked for, every one of them, we would \nstill not even come close to solving the problem--not even close.\n  So let's not waste time with more pointless arguments about tax \nincreases. We had that debated already. It is done. It is over. \nInstead, I call on Democrats to approach the spending debate with the \nseriousness it demands and to do it through regular order. We have to \nbreak this penchant among Democrats for putting off all important work \nuntil the final hour. We need to get back to regular order, and that \ntakes time, and that is why we need to get started right now. Let the \ntough work of developing a budget and putting together long-term \npolicies to control government spending begin today--not 1 minute or 1 \nhour before we come up against a deadline but today.\n  Americans deserve better than what they have been getting from \nWashington the past few years. Democrats were reelected, and I \ncongratulate them. It is time now to get serious about actually \ngoverning.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we consider the serious issue of \nimmigration reform, it is important for us to understand where we are \nas a country with regard to the laws we have and how they are being \nenforced. I will share some thoughts about that today because the \nAmerican people and Members of Congress need to fully understand what \nis happening. It is well documented that the Obama administration has \neither unilaterally weakened or outright waived the enforcement of \nexisting immigration law at the border, in the interior, at the \nworksite and at the welfare office. That is just a fact.\n  Last year, I joined with my colleagues at a press conference with the \ntop representatives of the Nation's rank-and-file immigration law \nenforcement officers--the presidents of the ICE--Immigration, Customs \nand Enforcement--and Border Patrol unions. Those men, who are elected \nto serve as the voice of their fellow officers, gave a chilling report \nat that press conference--right over in the Senate building, with \nseveral other Senators--they gave a chilling report about the \nadministration's systematic effort to dismantle the enforcement of our \nNation's immigration laws. It is not just an effort, it is an effective \nplan and action to do so.\n  At the center of this misconduct is John Morton, the Director of ICE. \nThe evidence I am about to share with you leads me to the unfortunate \nconclusion that Mr. Morton can no longer effectively serve at this post \nand, perhaps more importantly, there can be no comprehensive \nimmigration reform as long as he is the person charged with enforcing \nit. What purpose is served to pass new laws if the ones we have are \nignored by the officials charged with enforcing them?\n  This timeline shows how Mr. Morton and the administration have \nundermined enforcement. Most Americans do not fully understand the real \neffect of these immigration policies. In reality, right now, if a State \nlaw enforcement officer apprehends someone for\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\nspeeding and discovers, for example, that he is illegally in the \ncountry, the result is that nothing happens. They do not even bother to \ncall the Federal law enforcement officers to report they have \napprehended someone who is in violation of our immigration law. And the \nreason they do not call is because nobody will come and get them.\n  This is something I have discovered over a number of years. When I \nwas attorney general of Alabama, and for 12 years, the top Federal \nprosecutor in the Southern District of Alabama, the U.S. attorney, and \nI discovered how the system works--and it is not working. What happens \nis they release them. At townhall meetings I would ask the people who \nshowed up, citizens: What happens if your local police officer \napprehends someone who is illegally in the country? They say they call \nthe Federal people or they arrest them and take them to jail. The \nanswer is, no, they do not; they release them. That is what they do \nbecause the system is utterly broken and not working.\n  Let me run through a series of events that have occurred in the last \nseveral years that further undermine the ability of America to enforce \nits laws. Let me just say, parenthetically, the only way to have a real \neffective law enforcement system is to welcome support and affirm the \nwillingness of local law enforcement to participate and assist. There \nare, for example, some 600,000 State and local law officers out there \nevery day enforcing our laws, protecting their communities. There are \nfar fewer, maybe 15,000 or 30,000 Federal officers, dealing with \nimmigration. The real eyes and ears in law enforcement in America are \nthose State and local people. States have been sued by this \nadministration for even attempting to assist. This administration is \ndenying and refusing to renew the cooperative agreements that are \nnecessary for Federal and State and local authorities to work together \nto effectively enforce the laws of our country, and this is what is \ncausing our problem.\n\n  Let me run through some of these areas and problems that have \noccurred recently. I may not be able to finish, and I will make the \nrest of my remarks available in the Record. In a 2010 interview with \nthe Chicago Tribune, Director Morton announced ICE may not even process \nor accept illegal aliens transferred to the agency's custody by Arizona \nofficials. They were not happy with Arizona, presumably, so they would \nnot even accept people local law enforcement turned over.\n  On May 27, 2010, an ICE e-mail revealed that low-risk, short-term \ndetainees would be able to have visitors stay for an unlimited amount \nof time during a 12-hour window, would be given access to unmonitored \nphone lines, e-mails, and free internet calling. They would also be \nentertained with movie nights, bingo, arts and crafts, dance and \ncooking classes, tutoring and computer training.\n  On June 25, 2010, the National ICE Council, the union that represents \nmore than 7,000 detention and removal agents within ICE, cast a \nunanimous vote of no confidence in Director Morton. According to the \nofficers, their vote reflects ``the growing dissatisfaction among ICE \nemployees and union leaders that Director Morton . . . has abandoned \nthe agency's core mission of enforcing United States immigration laws \nand enforcing public safety and have, instead, directed [his] attention \nto campaigning for programs and policies leading to amnesty. . . .''\n  That is not a good thing for the chief immigration law enforcement \nofficer of the country, for his people, the rank and file, putting \ntheir necks on the line every day, issuing such a report--and it is \ntrue. Unfortunately, it is. In August of 2010, ICE began circulating a \ndraft policy that would significantly limit the circumstances under \nwhich ICE agents would take custody of illegal aliens. The memo \nprovides that immigration officers shall issue detainers or official \nnotification to law enforcement agencies that ICE intends to assume \ncustody of the alien only after a law enforcement agency has \nindependently arrested the alien for a criminal violation.\n  A detainer is a big deal. A detainer, if anyone understands how law \nenforcement works, is a critical component of modern law enforcement. \nIf a State has a charge against an individual, or if the Federal \nGovernment has a claim against an individual being held by a different \nlaw enforcement agency, they place a detainer on that person and when \nthe arresting jurisdiction completes its work with the person, they are \nnot released on the streets; they are detained until they are turned \nover to the other legitimate law enforcement agency that has pending \ncharges. If we do not have that, dangerous criminals are released, and \nit is really an improvement in law enforcement over the last 50 years.\n  This is a diminishment of that, significantly. In effect, no longer \nwill ICE pick up an illegal alien for illegally entering the country or \nhaving false identification, or false immigration documents, if they \nare being held by State and local people for some local crime.\n  On October 8, 2010--according to ICE deportation statistics, from \nOctober 2009 through September 2010, the agency deported 390,000 \naliens. But most, half of those at least, were people who were \nconvicted of serious criminal offenses, independent of the immigration \nviolations.\n  On December 6, 2010, interviews and internal communications cited in \nthe Washington Post indicated that number, 390,000, was a padded \nnumber. First, the article charged that ICE included almost 20,000 \nremovals in fiscal year 2010 that were for the previous year and should \nnot have been counted. It also described how ICE extended a Mexican \nrepatriation program beyond its normal operating dates, which, in \neffect, added 6,500 removals to the numbers that were not properly \nadded.\n  On March 2, 2011, in a departmental memorandum, Director Morton \noutlined new enforcement priorities that encouraged ICE agents not to \nenforce the law against most illegal aliens but only to take action \nagainst those who meet his priorities. Director Morton issued a second \nmemorandum on June 17, 2011, further directing ICE agents to refrain \nfrom enforcing U.S. immigration laws against certain segments of the \nillegal population, criteria similar to that under the DREAM Act, \ndespite having no legal or congressional authority to do so and despite \nthe fact that the DREAM Act was three times defeated in Congress.\n  What they did was they altered the enforcement policies of the \nFederal immigration officers to effect the DREAM Act that had been \nexplicitly offered and rejected in Congress on three different \noccasions.\n  On June 17, 2011, Director Morton issued a third memorandum, \ninstructing ICE personnel to consider refraining from enforcing the law \nagainst individuals engaged in a protected activity----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair--related to civil or other rights, \nfor example union organizing, complaining about employment \ndiscrimination or housing conditions, and who may be in some \nnonfrivolous dispute with an employer, landlord or contractor. ICE \nagents were directed not to take action against someone who doesn't pay \ntheir rent and has a dispute with their landlord, apparently. They get \nspecial exemption.\n  On June 23, 2011, leaders of the national ICE union express outrage \nover the June 17 administrative amnesty memoranda authored by Director \nMorton. The law officers say that since the administration was ``unable \nto pass its immigration agenda through legislation, [it] is now \nimplementing it through agency policy.'' It also accuses top ICE \nofficials of working ``hand-in-hand'' with the open-borders lobby, \nwhile excluding its own officers from the policy development process. \nIn plain words, they are saying the political appointees of ICE are \nadvancing the agenda of those here illegally and maneuvering against \ntheir own law officers trying to do their duty.\n  On June 27, 2011, internal memoranda confirm that once the Houston \nChronicle on August 24, 2010--exposed DHS' directive to review and \ndismiss valid deportation cases then in process, ICE officials \nattempted to publicly distance themselves from such lenient policies \nand deny that they ever existed.\n  On October 12, 2011, In testimony before the House Judiciary \nCommittee, Director Morton admits that White House Director of \nIntergovernmental Affairs and former National Council of La Raza \nemployee now--White House Domestic Policy Director--Cecilia\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\nMunoz, assisted in preparation of the administrative amnesty memoranda.\n  On October 18, 2011, ICE refuses to take any action after the Santa \nClara County, California, Board of Supervisors votes 3-1 to stop using \ncounty funds to honor ICE detainers, except in limited circumstances.\n  On October 19, 2011, ICE refuses to act after District of Columbia \nMayor Vincent C. Gray issues an executive order to prevent D.C. police \nfrom enforcing U.S. immigration law. Among other things, the order \nprohibits all public safety agencies from inquiring about an \nindividual's immigration status or from contacting ICE if there is no \nnexus to a criminal investigation.\n  On November 22, 2011, ICE refuses to act after Mayor Michael \nBloomberg signs a measure ordering all city jails to ignore certain ICE \ndetainers issued to deport illegal aliens from those jails. As a \nresult, New York City jails now release many illegal aliens back into \nthe community instead of handing them over to ICE for removal.\n  On December 15, 2011, without an opportunity to defend itself, and \nlittle regard for the maintenance of public safety or the rule of law, \nDHS rescinds Maricopa County, Arizona's 287(g) agreement--a cooperative \nagreement whereby local law enforcement receive training in identifying \nand apprehending illegal aliens. Director Morton tells the Maricopa \nCounty Attorney that ICE will no longer respond to calls from the \nMaricopa County Sheriff's Office involving traffic stops, civil \ninfractions or ``other minor offenses.'' However, it is unclear how ICE \ncan refuse to respond to inquiries from the deputies and not directly \nviolate federal law, which requires the federal government to respond \nto inquiries by law enforcement agencies to verify immigration status.\n  On December 29, 2011, ICE creates a 24-hour hotline for illegal alien \ndetainees to be staffed by the Law Enforcement Support Center--the same \norganization that ICE says is too understaffed to keep up with \nimmigration status check requests from state and local law enforcement. \nICE then revises its detainer form to include a new provision that says \nICE should ``consider this request for a detainer operative only upon \nthe subject's conviction.'' This shift in policy to a discretionary \n``post-conviction'' model ignores the fact that being in the country \nillegally is a violation of federal law while simultaneously welcoming \ncriminal aliens back onto the streets.\n  On January 19, 2012, ICE attorneys in Denver and Baltimore recommend \nthat the agency voluntarily close 1,667 removal cases, resulting in the \nrelease of illegal aliens already in proceedings without consequence \nfor violating U.S. immigration laws.\n  On February 7, 2012, ICE announces the creation of the ICE Public \nAdvocate, who is to serve as a point of contact for aliens in removal \nproceedings, community and advocacy groups, and others who have \nconcerns, questions, recommendations, or other issues they would like \nto raise about the administration's executive enforcement and amnesty \nefforts.\n  On April 25, 2012, ICE officials announce it has offered to \nvoluntarily close over 16,500 illegal alien deportation cases pending \nbackground checks in connection with the administration's review of \n300,000 pending immigration cases. The administration also announces \nthat the number of illegal aliens whose cases it has already dismissed \nis up to 2,700 from just over 1,500 the previous month.\n  On April 27, 2012, ICE shifts its policy on Secure Communities, where \nlocal officers report arrests of persons who are here illegally, to \nstop the enforcement of immigration law against illegal aliens \napprehended for ``minor traffic offenses.'' When Secure Communities \nidentifies illegal aliens pursuant to a traffic offense, ICE will no \nlonger ask the local jails to detain the illegal aliens so that ICE may \nbegin deportation proceedings; rather, ICE will only consider detaining \nan alien if the alien is ultimately convicted of the offense. Moreover, \ndespite claims of limited resources, ICE also announced it plans to \ntake action against jurisdictions with arrest rates the agency deems \ntoo high.\n  On June 5, 2012, ICE releases its latest statistics in its case-by-\ncase review of pending deportation cases and states the Agency's \nattorneys have reviewed over 288,000 cases. Of those reviewed, ICE says \nit plans to voluntarily dismiss 20,648; it states over 4,300 of these \ncases have already been processed and the remaining will be closed \npending background checks.\n  As I noted earlier, last year, I joined several of my colleagues in a \npress conference with the President of the ICE Officers Association, \nChris Crane. What he said corroborated our worst fears--it was a \nchilling report about the administration's systematic effort to \ndismantle our nation's immigration laws. Here is just some of what he \nhad to say:\n\n       As one example, prosecutorial discretion for [those \n     qualifying for DREAM Act amnesty] is solely based on the \n     individuals' claims. Our orders are, if an alien says they \n     went to high school, then let them go. If they say they have \n     a GED, then let them go. Officers have been told that there \n     is no burden for the alien to prove anything. Even with the \n     greatly relaxed new policies, the alien isn't even required \n     to prove that they meet any of the new criteria.\n       There is no requirement, or burden to prove anything, on \n     the part of the alien. We believe that significant numbers of \n     people, who [do not meet DREAM Act criteria], are taking \n     advantage of this practice to avoid arrest.\n       The administration's new policies do not provide officers \n     with new options or increased flexibility, but instead order \n     officers not to enforce laws and not to take enforcement \n     actions against specific groups, with officers under threat \n     of losing their jobs if they do so.\n       We were the only safety net between the community and these \n     [criminal alien] predators, until now. Now, those folks, more \n     and more, are walking out the back doors of these jails. \n     We're walking away from them out in the field, we're \n     encountering them in houses, and we're not allowed to talk to \n     them. We're not allowed to do basic investigative work. And \n     because of that, we're walking away from a lot of bad guys. \n     This is not about individuals who are here to work, or \n     whatever the case may be, there is a much larger problem and \n     everybody is getting wrapped up in the same situation. When \n     you take an officer's ability in the field to distinguish \n     between those types of things, you place the public at risk.\n\n  The situation is so dire that these brave men and women saw no choice \nbut to file suit against their leadership, including Director Morton. \nLast Friday, a federal judge ruled that ICE agents and officers have \nthe right to challenge the administrative amnesty policies instituted \nby Director Morton and President Obama, which command the agents to \nviolate federal law and refrain from detaining most all illegal aliens, \nor face disciplinary action or worse--losing their jobs.\n  According to the complaint, even violent offenders are eligible for \nautomatic release under these non-enforcement policies. For example, \nICE agent Samuel Martin, along with another ICE agent, picked up an \nillegal alien from the El Paso County, Texas jail on July 17, 2012. \nWhile the agents were trying to place the individual in the vehicle, he \nattempted to escape and physically assaulted the agents. Although the \nagents regained custody of the alien and transported him to the El Paso \nCriminal Alien Program office for processing, the agents' supervisors \nordered them to release the alien without charges and specifically to \nnot issue a Notice to Appear, as required by federal law. The agents \nprotested the release of the alien but were told ``it was a management \ndecision, based on the President's new immigration policies.'' Anyone \nwith the slightest experience in law enforcement can see that these \nactions are devastating to law enforcement personnel.\n  Let's take a minute and put ourselves in the position of these \nagents. Let's say you stop a 34-year old man for speeding. He speaks \nlittle English, has no identification, and has no proof that he meets \nany of the criteria of the President's DREAM Act amnesty. But he knows \nenough to say he has been in the country since he was a child. You have \nno way of confirming this or whether he has a criminal record in this \nor any other country, but you have to let him go. This is what is \nhappening every day. What a devastating indictment of this \nadministration's willful and reckless dismantling of enforcement.\n  On August 3, 2012, I wrote to Director Morton regarding reports that \nICE suspended an agent in the Philadelphia field office for arresting a \n35-year old Mexican citizen unlawfully present in the U.S. with ten \nmisdemeanor traffic\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\nviolations, no driver's license, and apparent ties to a fugitive. The \nalien arrived in the U.S. at the age of 25, meaning that he should not \nqualify for ``deferred action,'' even under the administration's \nunlawfully imposed DREAM Act directive. Yet, according to reports, the \nacting field director, a supervisor, advised the criminal alien that he \nwould be let go because he was not a ``presidential priority.''\n  On August 15, 2012, Director Morton responded to my letter, stating \nthat the agent was in trouble for failing to obey ``chain of command.''\n  On September 11, 2012, I responded that the issue was not ``chain of \ncommand'' but rather the agent's sworn duties under the law and the \nadministration's ``priorities'' that contradict that sworn obligation. \nThe supervisors' actions in this matter, and Director Morton's support \nfor them, disastrously undermine the effectiveness of our immigration \nlaw enforcement officers in the field and their ability to enforce our \nnation's laws. I stated that his apparent failure to support his \nofficers in these incidents and his evident lack of concern for the \nadministration's decision to nullify the very laws they were sworn to \nenforce, raised serious questions about his ability to lead the agency.\n  Director Morton never responded to that letter.\n  There is much more that I could say about this, and I have many more \nexamples of actions taken by Mr. Morton that have been demoralizing to \nour agents. It is just not good as a Federal law officer, and it is not \nhealthy.\n  As I noted earlier, this is what ICE agents are telling us they have \nessentially been told: If an individual claims DREAM Act status--even \nthough it never passed into law--they are directed to let them go on \nthe spot. It is an evisceration of the law of the United States. Mr. \nMorton has no authority to do so, and he should not be doing that. A \nhuge percentage of the people who are arrested are in their thirties or \nbelow. How are you going to tell? They make the assertion, they make \nthe claim, and--according to the testimony and statements of these \nofficers--they are told to accept that statement, accept that claim, \nand not detain or deport the person they have apprehended.\n  The ICE union vote of no confidence and the detailed charges against \nICE's leadership are corroborated by those inside the administration \nwho are afraid to speak out because they fear retaliation by the Obama \nadministration. That is a sad state of affairs.\n  In the coming days, these facts and more will come to light. The \nadministration has to realize there can be no comprehensive immigration \nreform as long as it is the policy of the Director of ICE, John Morton, \nto refuse to enforce existing law. We can't have an agreement. That is \nwhy, given everything that we have learned, Director Morton cannot \ncontinue in office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We cannot make progress on immigration reform as long \nas the man in charge of enforcing our laws continues to undermine those \nvery laws and the efforts and work of his own agents, and refuses to \nact to protect them even when they have been assaulted by people. \nAliens who have been released have assaulted agents. As I noted, ICE \nagents have filed a lawsuit against Director Morton for undermining \ntheir ability to do their sworn duty, and the court has just recently \nupheld the validity of that lawsuit to go forward, and it is now going \nforward. These officers are suing Mr. Morton.\n  So the Federal Government is abdicating its responsibility. It is \nviolating the laws of the United States. It is punishing officers who \ntry to do their duty. They are creating a larger illegal population in \nthis country. They are encouraging more people to come to the country \nby not enforcing our laws, and at a time of high unemployment, the \nresult is we are lowering wages and creating more unemployment.\n  They are suing States who try to cooperate. They are explicitly \neviscerating the 287(g) program--a program I worked hard on a decade \nago and was expanded--to train State law enforcement officers who can \nhelp the Federal agents to do their jobs.\n  Now the President is making a speech today in Las Vegas, taking 9 \nhours to get out there, I understand, to make a speech. He is saying \nagain, I guess: Trust me. We need to change the law, and then I will \nenforce it. Then we will have our people follow the rules that you \npassed.\n  Well, this failure to deal in good faith and to actually follow the \nlaws that Congress has passed is one of the biggest obstacles we face. \nWe just have to say it. It is one of the biggest obstacles we face in \nbeing able to craft some sort of reform of our immigration laws and \nmake it worthy of a great nation. We are a nation of immigrants. We \nbelieve in immigration. But we believe in the law. We believe that \npeople should wait their turn and people should be able to be accepted \nhere--over 1 million a year--in an orderly process, not a disorderly \nprocess, and that we shouldn't be rewarding those who violate the law \nand making it even harder for those who comply with the law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S339-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S339-S341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CRISIS\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have been coming to the Senate floor just \nabout every day that we have been in session so far this year, and I am \ngoing to continue to do so to talk about what I believe is our most \npressing crisis that this body faces and that our country faces; that \nis, the uncontrolled runaway Federal spending and accumulated debt and \nhow it is dragging our economy down and how it threatens to provoke a \nmajor economic disaster if it is not addressed.\n  In previous remarks I have made on this floor, I tried to make the \npoint that if we fail to get Federal spending under control in the \nshort term, our economy will continue to remain in the doldrums because \nof this cloud of economic uncertainty that hangs over investors, \nbusinesspeople, and consumers. But I don't want my colleagues to just \ntake my word for it. A host of experts, commentators, businesspeople, \nand investors around the country--and, frankly, around the world--\npeople from both sides of the political spectrum have been and will \ncontinue to make this same point.\n  The message is this: Unless Washington stops punting this problem and \nbegins to demonstrate the will to cut spending in serious ways to \nreduce our long-term debt, the economy will continue to limp along; \ninvestors will continue to remain on the sidelines; business owners \nwill continue not to hire new employees; and, we will hasten the day \nwhen investors lose confidence in the United States as a worthy credit \nrisk.\n  I know the market has responded in a favorable way recently. I hope \nthat continues. But the fundamentals underlying our current economy \ndon't justify that continuing far into the future.\n  So today I would like to quote from what others are saying, not just \nwhat a Senator from Indiana believes and has been saying on this floor. \nI want to talk about what they are saying about our debt and spending \ncrisis.\n  First, I believe we can all--or most of us can--agree with this fact: \nthat the first and the most essential function of the U.S. Government \nis to defend and protect its citizens from threats to their national \nsecurity. As our national debt continues to rise unrestrained, we are \nputting our children's future and our country's future in a very \nvulnerable state.\n  Perhaps the most dire and frightening warning has come from one of \nour Nation's highest ranking officials, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, who said:\n\n       The continually increasing debt is the biggest threat we \n     have to our national security.\n\n  Not al-Qaida, not suicide bombers, not Islamic fundamentalists. \nAccording to the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, someone who has \nmade a career leading our country through tumultuous battles of war, \nthe largest threat to our national security is our very own red ink.\n  Erskine Bowles, former White House Chief of Staff to President Bill \nClinton, also recognizes the imperative need to address our spending \nand debt crisis. As we all know, Bowles was tapped by President Obama \nto lead a bipartisan deficit commission with former Republican Senator \nAlan Simpson. The two\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nmen, along with the commission, proposed recommendations for a big and \nbold plan to reduce our long-term debt. Rather than heed some of these \nrecommendations and build off of this bipartisan momentum several years \nago, the President ignored it completely and since has done nothing and \noffered no plan of his own to fix our dire fiscal plight other than to \npropose new taxes.\n  As I mentioned in previous remarks, the President got his tax \nincreases on millionaires and billionaires, but no one should be fooled \ninto thinking this solves our fiscal crisis. Recently, in an interview, \nformer Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles rightfully criticized the \nadministration and the Congress for not striking a significant budget \ndeal and called that failure, ``The most disappointing thing in my \nlife.'' He went on to say:\n\n       They're bouncing from one crisis to another. . . . It's \n     nuts. We have an enormous fiscal problem in this country. . . \n     . We've got to put our big boy and big girl pants on and go \n     to work.\n\n  He also added:\n\n       . . . the problems are real, the solutions painful, and \n     there's no easy way out.\n\n  Finally, he said:\n\n       We got to do stuff that's real. I mean there's no sense in, \n     you know, just working at the edges. . . . If we don't slow \n     the rate of growth in healthcare programs, it's going to eat \n     up the entire budget and virtually bankrupt the country.\n\n  The warning signs and the calls for action are coming from all \nsectors.\n  From the business sector, Gary Loveman, chairman of the Business \nRoundtable's Health and Retirement Committee, said the following:\n\n       Keeping the U.S. economy from careening over the fiscal \n     cliff was the first step, but our elected leaders must not \n     stop there. Although economic recovery has been stalled, \n     renewed expansion is possible if conditions are set in a \n     comprehensive budget agreement that includes entitlement \n     reform and long-term changes to reduce deficits. In this way \n     we will ensure the viability health and retirement safety net \n     for future generations of Americans.\n\n  John Mauldin, president of Millennium Wave Advisors, an investment \nadvisory firm, publisher of Mauldin Economics, and author of ``End \nGame,'' a book many of us have heard about and read, said this:\n\n       The real issue is the deficit. The leaders of both parties \n     recognize that the current path spelled out on our fiscal \n     balance sheet is unsustainable. The deficit must be brought \n     under control . . . or we will find ourselves all too soon in \n     the situation now facing much of Europe and Japan. The \n     options at that point become far more dire.\n\n  Business owners in my home State of Indiana also recognize these \ndangers. Reflecting the sentiment of virtually every businessperson I \nhave talked to over the past 2 years, Rick Zehr, a business owner in \nFort Wayne, IN, said:\n\n       We all need to manage our income and not borrow beyond what \n     we can afford. I look at our country's deficit spending and \n     it's so far beyond what the rest of us have to live like \n     every day. As a business owner, it makes me nervous. Everyone \n     is paying for deficit spending.\n\n  Economists are sounding the alarm as well. Kenneth Rogoff, a \nrespected Harvard economist, said:\n\n       The idea that one should just ignore all these problems and \n     apply crude Keynesian stimulus is a dangerous one. It matters \n     a great deal how the government taxes and spends, not just \n     how much. The U.S. debt level is a constraint. A growing \n     number of empirical studies, including my own joint work with \n     Carmen Reinhart, suggests that the U.S. has already reached a \n     debt level that has been associated with slower growth in \n     advanced countries.\n\n  Our own Treasury Department and some credit rating agencies have also \nweighed in. These warnings alone should be enough to urge Congress and \nthe administration to act.\n  According to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Report of the \nU.S. Government for Fiscal Year 2012:\n\n       While these projections are subject to considerable \n     uncertainty, the debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to rise \n     unsustainably under current policy.\n\n  Can I state that again? Our own U.S. Treasury report said that while \nthese projections are subject to considerable uncertainty, the debt-to-\nGDP ratio will continue to rise unsustainably under current policy.\n  Does that not suggest to us that current policy is not working when \nthe U.S. Treasury puts out a report saying: What the administration and \nCongress are doing is unsustainable? Unless we grasp the reality of \nwhat is happening with our spending and our debt, we are headed for a \ncrisis if we are not in one already.\n  When Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. Federal Government debt in \nAugust 2011, they said:\n\n       Our lowering of the rating was prompted by our view on the \n     rising public debt and our perception of greater policymaking \n     uncertainty.\n\n  There is that word again, ``uncertainty.'' There is that implication \nagain: failure to take action. The time to act is now. We can no longer \nsit back and hope this problem is going to go away. Too many people \nwant to just think, well, if we just sort of stumble along the way we \nare stumbling along, it is all going to work itself out.\n  We can no longer, and should no longer, accept double-digit \nunemployment. Yes, I said double-digit. While the official number is \nhovering around 8 percent, we all know millions of Americans have given \nup looking for work, and millions of others have dropped out of the \nemployment lines or settled for jobs below their qualifications. The \nreal numbers are far higher, and the distress is far greater than what \nis admitted.\n  This is not a new problem. It has been long recognized even by the \nPresident. In February 2009, 4 years ago, President Obama held a fiscal \nresponsibility summit, and here is what he said:\n\n       And that's why today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we \n     inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. This \n     will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult \n     decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I \n     refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot \n     repay--and that means taking responsibility right now, in \n     this administration, for getting our spending under control.\n\n  Here we are, 4 years from those remarks where the President's own \nbudget and bipartisan deficit commission was dismissed, 4 years from \nthe time when he pledged to the American people that he would cut the \ndeficit in half, 4 years from the time when he said responsibility \nneeds to be taken now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. It has been 4 years since the President made those \nstatements, and here we are where we have added trillions of dollars of \nnew debt--the greatest increase in the history of America, and we have \nignored and pushed spending down the road without a real budget \nproposal or a long-term deficit plan. Experts and economists from both \nsides of the aisle agree that spending reductions must be a part of the \nequation to address our dangerous debt. The President has called for a \nbalanced approach but is showing no signs of leadership on \nrestructuring mandatory runaway spending.\n  Even the Washington Post editorial board, which is not necessarily \nconservative, acknowledged this in a piece just recently on November \n27, and I quote:\n\n       Elections do have consequences, and Mr. Obama ran on a \n     clear platform of increasing taxes on the wealthy. But he was \n     clear on something else, too: Deficit reduction must be \n     ``balanced,'' including spending cuts as well as tax \n     increases. Since 60 percent of the federal budget goes to \n     entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social \n     Security, there's no way to achieve balance without slowing \n     the rate of growth in those programs.\n\n  In conclusion, let me say this: There is a widespread consensus about \nthe seriousness of this problem and the fact that we must take \nsignificant measures to rein in our deficit spending and do it now. We \nneed a bold plan that will reduce spending, reform and simplify our tax \nsystem, and, most of all, restructure Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity to preserve those benefits for future generations. In \nsubsequent remarks, I intend to address how Congress can get with it \nand become part of the solution instead of part of the problem. We need \nto create a long-term deficit reduction plan that begins by fulfilling \nour constitutional obligation to pass a budget, which this body has not \ndone in more than 1,300 days. Let's be honest with ourselves--this will \nonly happen if we, the Senate, summon the political courage and the \nwill to engage in direct, good-faith, bipartisan efforts to deal with \nour Nation's No. 1 challenge.\n  Perhaps Alice Rivlin, budget director under President Bill Clinton, \nsummed it up best:\n\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\n\n       There's no mystery about what we ought to do, we just need \n     to get on with it.\n\n  Mr. President, Senate colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--let's \nget on with it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Judiciary Committee will be \nholding hearings soon--and many times--on responding to mass killings \nsuch as the recent school shooting in Newtown, CT. Admittedly, that was \na terrible tragedy. We are all sympathetic to the families of the \nvictims of that horrendous crime.\n  President Obama has asked Congress to pass legislation in response to \nthat event. I look forward to the hearings the Judiciary Committee will \nhold on this very important subject because we need to know more about \nthe problem and potential legislative action.\n  There will be plenty of occasions to discuss specific gun, mental \nhealth, and other legislative responses to Newtown. Today, I would like \nto address the President's rhetoric when he announced his proposals.\n  I was surprised at a number of the President's statements. For \ninstance, he is directing the Centers for Disease Control to conduct \nresearch into the causes of gun violence. But gun violence is not a \ndisease, and lawful gun ownership is not a disease. It is a \nconstitutionally protected individual right--the famous second \namendment right, not only part of the Constitution for 225 years but \nreinforced by two recent Supreme Court decisions.\n  The President said we suffer from an ``epidemic of violence.'' \nAlthough there is too much violence in America, violent crime rates are \nat their lowest level in 50 years--not at epidemic levels, at least \nepidemic when compared to the last 50 years. There is a reason for \nthat.\n  Police practices and investigative techniques have improved, and we \nin the Congress have helped with grants to assist local law \nenforcement, higher incarceration rates for violent criminals, and an \nend to parole in the Federal system. Notably, crime rates are at their \nlowest level in 50 years at the very same time more guns are in \ncirculation than ever before. But what has not declined is mass \nkillings, such as we had in Newtown, CT. Of course, this should be our \nfocus.\n  But what the President said that most surprised me concerned the \nConstitution and the Declaration of Independence.\n  Let us consider principles first. The Declaration of Independence \nlisted grievances against British Government action that violated \nindividual natural rights of the colonists at that time.\n  Even the declaration did not raise grievances against individuals or \ngrant powers to government. The Constitution exists to create a limited \nfederal government. As Madison wrote in Federalist 51:\n\n       In framing a government which is to be administered by men \n     over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first \n     enable the government to control the governed; and in the \n     next place oblige it to control itself.\n\n  In other words, the Government of the United States under the \nConstitution is a limited government, and the Constitution is to \nprotect the people from the government, not for the government to give \npeople rights and powers that the government then in turn could take \naway. On the other hand, the Constitution does give broad powers to the \nFederal Government, but it separates them among branches and between \nthe State and National Governments.\n  The Framers believed these structures would adequately control the \ngovernment so as to protect individual liberty, but the American people \ndisagreed. They believed the Constitution gave the Federal Government \nso much power that it could be tyrannical and violate individual \nrights. So as a condition of ratification, they demanded, and received, \nassurances that a bill of rights would be added to the Constitution. \nEach of those rights, including the second amendment dealing with guns, \nwas adopted to yet further limit government power and to protect \nindividual rights.\n  In other words, the people who wrote the Constitution in 1787, in the \nspirit that they believed at the time, the Constitution, just the way \nit was originally written, was adequate to protect individual rights. \nBut we were not going to get the Constitution adopted without the \npromise of a bill of rights. So the Bill of Rights went yet further, \nbut the Bill of Rights is not a limiting factor as evidenced by the \nninth amendment, which said none of the previous eight amendments in \nany way disparages the rights of citizens, all of those natural rights \nthat are too big that we cannot even enumerate.\n  Then, of course, the tenth amendment went on to say all powers not \nspecifically given to the Federal Government are reserved to the States \nand the people thereof. Nothing in the Bill of Rights applied to the \nactions of private individuals or granted power to the Federal \nGovernment. So how far were the President's remarks from the intent of \nthe Constitution's Framers?\n  President Obama's remarks turned the Constitution on its head because \nhe said:\n\n       The right to worship freely and safely, that right was \n     denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.\n       The right to assemble peacefully, that right was denied \n     shoppers in Clackamas, Oregon, and moviegoers in Aurora, \n     Colorado.\n       That most fundamental set of rights to life and liberty and \n     the pursuit of happiness--[are] fundamental rights that were \n     denied to college students at Virginia Tech and high school \n     students at Columbine, and elementary school students in \n     Newtown.\n\n  This is incorrect because except for its prohibition on slavery, the \nConstitution limits only the actions of government, not individuals. \nWhen a criminal commits murder, no constitutional right is violated. \nSo, for instance, the right to peacefully assemble is all about \nprotecting individual rights to organize, to protest, or seek to change \ngovernment action. It is violated, for instance, when government \nofficials hose down civil rights protesters on the sidewalk. That right \nis trivialized and mischaracterized as protecting shopping and watching \nmovies. Those constitutional rights are not a source of government \npower to enact legislation, as I think the President has suggested. \nQuite the opposite. They are designed solely to preserve individual \nautonomy as against the government.\n  Protecting individual rights rather than expanding governmental power \nmay be particularly appropriate in addressing mass killings. One of the \nreasons so many people died in some of the tragedies the President \ncited was the failure of the Federal Government, the State government, \nor the local government, but government generally to protect its \ncitizens.\n  Police not on the scene cannot arrive at a mass shooting such as \nNewtown in time to stop it. At Columbine the police employed techniques \nthat are no longer used because they did not stop killings that \noccurred after their arrival. At Virginia Tech, government officials \nmade decisions after the shooting started that some even have argued \nmay well have led to unnecessary deaths.\n  The President cited constitutional protection of individual rights as \na basis for expanding Federal power against private individuals. No \nwonder millions of Americans fear that Congress may enact legislation \nthat could lead to a tyrannical Federal Government.\n  I cannot accept the President's claim that ``there will be \npoliticians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning of a \ntyrannical, all-out assault on liberty[,] not because that's true, but \nbecause they want to gin up fear.''\n  The President reads the Constitution differently than it has ever \nbeen understood: as a source of power against individual rights rather \nthan a check on government power that guarantees those individual \nrights. This necessarily and understandably leads many citizens to fear \nthat their individual rights will be violated, and that extends well \nbeyond the second amendment.\n  It should be a matter of deep concern to all of us when the President \nwants to use the power of government to corral individual rights. For \n225 years the\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\nConstitution has established a government that is a servant of the \npeople, not its master. As the Judiciary Committee and all of us \nconsider and debate legislation arising from the tragedy at Newtown, I \nhope we will proceed with the proper understanding of the relationship \nthat the Constitution establishes between governmental power and \nindividual liberty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S342-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SECRETARY OF STATE CLINTON\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I want to speak about the extraordinary \npublic service that has been rendered by the Secretary of State and \nwhose long record of public service I want to commend. I rise on behalf \nof my friend, our former colleague, our honorable Secretary of State, \nHillary Clinton.\n  She has represented the United States. She is a world figure. She has \nrepresented America to the world, especially with her diligence, her \ngrace, her hard work, and her incredible diplomatic skills. She has \ntraveled to 112 countries. She has racked up 1 million miles, met with \nthousands of foreign dignitaries. She has reached nearly every corner \nof the globe and made history on the way.\n  In each assignment she has left an indelible mark empowering women, \nsupporting sustainable development, supporting the establishment of \ncivil societies, and promoting the tenets of democracy: one man, one \nvote; one woman, one vote; human rights; and the rule of law.\n  I might also note that she particularly has underscored the plight of \nwomen. Of course, we know we see societies that live almost in another \ntime and age centuries before in the way they treat women. The \nSecretary of State has tried to help modernize those societies. She has \ndone so by empowering and appointing one of her personal friends, \nMelanne Verveer, to be the Global Ambassador for Women's Affairs. That \nposition has taken Ambassador Verveer all over the globe.\n  I might say it has been my privilege to have a glimpse of that by \nseeing my wife Grace Nelson work with Melanne on the plight of poor \nwomen in so many different countries across this planet.\n  When our Secretary of State confronts major national security \nchallenges, her support has been pivotal--from the support she gave the \nPresident in the raid that took out bin Laden, to the drawdown of U.S. \ntroops in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has been at the forefront of some \nof the toughest decisions of our time.\n  The Secretary has also been steadfast in persuading the international \ncommunity to enact crippling sanctions on Iran to isolate and to punish \nthe regime for its pursuit of nuclear weapons. I might say on a \npersonal note, a Floridian has been missing for almost 6 years who was \nsuddenly swept up and disappeared on the Iranian tourist island of Kish \nin the Persian Gulf. The Secretary has kept very vigilant in continuing \nto search for any piece of evidence of Bob Levinson and to ultimately \nbring him home. I thank the Secretary not only for Floridians such as \nmyself, but for his wife, Christine Levinson, and seven children who \nwant their father home. That quest continues unrelentingly by many \npeople. I wanted to say thank you to Secretary Clinton for the efforts \nshe has lent to this effort.\n  She has been one of the driving forces behind NATO's no-fly zone over \nLibya in order to prevent Qadhafi from massacring his own people. \nThrough deft diplomacy, she has slowly opened Burma to the outside \nworld. She is encouraging them to free political prisoners, hold \nparliamentary elections, and finally permit foreign investment. It is \nhappening before our eyes.\n  Of course, she has taken special interest in the poorest nation in \nthe Western Hemisphere, an island nation right off of the east coast of \nthe United States, also less than an hour-and-a-half flight from Miami; \nthat is, the island of Haiti.\n  The island nation of Haiti--which is the island that Christopher \nColumbus was expected to have landed on, Hispaniola--now encompasses \nHaiti and the Dominican Republic. She has made Haiti one of the top \nforeign policy priorities, helping the impoverished island build back \nbetter after the devastating earthquake that killed over one-quarter of \na million people. In no small measure has her husband President Clinton \nbeen a part of that attempt at restoration of Haiti from that \ndevastating earthquake.\n  Last week, during Secretary Clinton's final appearance before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, she said:\n\n       Every time that blue and white airplane carrying the words \n     ``United States of America'' touches down in some far-off \n     capital, I feel again the honor it is to represent the \n     world's indispensable nation.\n\n  Madam Secretary, you have truly honored us with your indispensable \nleadership. On behalf of all our Senate colleagues, we thank you for \nyour extraordinary service to this country. I want to say that your \nposition will be in capable hands with our colleague and your former \ncolleague, Senator John Kerry, who will serve, as we confirm him in the \nnext 24 hours, as the 68th Secretary of State.\n  Senator Kerry has served in this Senate in a distinguished amount of \npublic service since 1985. He grew up traveling the world with his \nfather in the Foreign Service. He fought in Vietnam and was awarded the \nBronze and Silver Stars, along with three Purple Hearts. I know he is \ngoing to build upon and continue the legacy and the extraordinary \nrecord of Secretary Clinton and will enhance America's leadership in \nthe world. I look forward to his speedy confirmation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S342-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S342-S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the senior \nSenator from the State of Florida, who a few moments ago made some very \nkind remarks about me, and I appreciate that very much. Let me just say \nhe is the best python hunter in the Senate. For those who don't know \nwhat I am talking about, they can look it up in the newspaper accounts \nof Senator Nelson's endeavors of a few weeks ago in the Everglades. So \nI look forward to working with him, and I thank him for his friendship \nand his kind words.\n  Madam President, I wish to take a few moments. I have heard a lot of \ndiscussion here on the floor today. A moment ago, we were talking about \nthe STEM visas and the need to reform that process. I would like to \ntake a step back and talk a little about the immigration issue in \ngeneral. There has been a lot of conversation about that here in the \nSenate, certainly out in the public. This is a contentious issue, and \nit is clearly important to understand where we stand today, what it is \nthat is happening, what is not happening, and the way forward in that \nregard. I hope I can do that in under 10 minutes here this afternoon.\n  Let me begin by saying something that I think unifies all of us, and \nthat is the belief that legal immigration is good for America. Legal \nimmigration is a good thing for our country. The vast majority of \nAmericans would agree with that. Legal immigration has been a critical \npart of our heritage, and it is a critical part of our future. We just \ndiscussed one aspect of legal immigration that is critical to our \nfuture, and that is in the technology field. I guarantee that if you go \nto the agricultural industry, they will tell you the same thing. Legal \nimmigration is good and important for our country.\n  The second thing people will tell you is that illegal immigration is \nnot good for America. I know both sides of this coin firsthand. I \ndidn't read about this in a book. I didn't watch some movie last week \nabout immigration. I live this issue on a daily basis. I live in a \nfamily of immigrants, married into a family of immigrants, in a \nneighborhood of immigrants, in a community of immigrants.\n  I see all the good things legal immigration has done for America, and \nI see the strain illegal immigration places on our country.\n  We have a fundamental problem in our country today; that is, we have \na broken legal immigration system and we have a very serious illegal \nimmigration problem. That is what we are trying to address in a \ncommonsense way that is good for America.\n  What we saw yesterday was the release of some principles. It is not a \nbill,\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nit is some principles. It is basically the architecture of the work we \nhope to undertake in conjunction with every one of my colleagues here. \nIt is not a secret group who will meet and force some issue upon us to \ntake or leave. It is the beginning of a process we hope will lead to a \nreal solution.\n  Part 1 of that process is that we need a legal immigration system \nthat works. In fact, our broken legal immigration system is a \nsignificant contributor to illegal immigration. It is so expensive, it \nis so complicated sometimes to legally immigrate to the United States \nor to renew a visa that it is encouraging people to do it the wrong \nway. We have a system that doesn't reflect the reality of the 21st \ncentury, and that needs to be addressed. That is one of the top \npriorities of this system.\n  The second priority is this: This is a sovereign country. As a \nsovereign nation, the United States of America has a right to have \nimmigration laws, and it has a right to enforce our immigration laws. \nThat is important to point out. Sometimes we lose sight of this. We \nhave 1 million people a year who immigrate legally to the United States \npermanently. No other country in the world is nearly as generous. There \nisn't even a close second. A million people a year wait in line and pay \nthe fees and come here the right way, and if we don't enforce our \nimmigration laws, we are undermining that effort. In fact, we are \ndiscouraging it, and we are being unfair to it. So we need to have \nimmigration laws that work and that are enforced.\n  But we have a third problem; that is, right now, in this country at \nthis very moment, estimates say that as many as 11 million human beings \nare in the United States without proper immigration documentation. Now, \nlet me be clear: On the one hand, the vast majority of these folks are \nnot victims. They knew what they were doing, and what they did was \nwrong. They do not have a right to illegally immigrate to the United \nStates. There is no such thing as a legal right to illegally immigrate \nto the United States. On the other hand, these are 11 million human \nbeings, 11 million people who, irrespective of how they did it, came \nhere, and the vast majority of them in pursuit of what every one of us \nwould recognize as the American dream.\n  As a policymaker, as someone who passionately loves this country, as \ndo all my colleagues and everyone watching, I realize we have 11 \nmillion people here who are undocumented. What they did was wrong, but \nthey will probably be here--almost all of them--for the rest of their \nlives with or without documents. So I want to deal with this. We need \nto modernize our legal immigration system. We have to deal with the 11 \nmillion people who are here now in a way that makes sense, not in a \ntalking-point way. We have to make sure that this never happens again, \nthat we never find ourselves back where we are now. I hope I never \nagain in the future have to come back here and say: Guess what, folks. \nWe have another 5 million people who are here undocumented. And let me \nbe clear. I will not support--I personally will not support any \nimmigration bill that does not prevent that from happening. But it all \nstarts with dealing with the reality that we have 11 million human \nbeings who will be here for the rest of their lives with or without \ndocuments. We have to deal with that.\n\n  What these principles say is, No. 1, let's modernize our legal \nimmigration system. Let's have an agricultural program that works. \nLet's have a high-tech visa program that works. We have to have a 21st-\ncentury immigration system, which means we can no longer afford to have \nless than 10 percent of the people who come here based on skills. We \nneed to change that, and not by undermining family-based immigration \nbut by reforming the programs we use for skill-based immigration. We \nneed to modernize it.\n  Secondly, we need real enforcement mechanisms. There are three things \nthat work. No. 1 is securing and getting operational control of the \nborder. And by the way, this is not just an immigration issue. The \nborder is not just an immigration issue. I am not in favor of a \nhousekeeper or a landscaper coming across the border illegally. I am \nnot in favor of that. But what keeps me up at night are the terrorists \ncoming across the border, and a porous border at the north or south \nleads to that possibility. So the border is as much about our \nsovereignty and national security as it is about immigration.\n  Third is a workplace enforcement mechanism. In the 21st century, we \ncan't come up with a reliable way to verify whether the people being \nhired are here legally?\n  Fourth is visa tracking. We have all these people coming to the \nUnited States on visas. We track when they come in but not when they \nleave--or not successfully enough. So we don't know where they are or \nwhether they are here. We have no idea. As much as 40 percent of our \nillegal immigrants, 40 percent of our undocumented folks are here on \nvisa overstays. They didn't sneak across the border.\n  We have to deal with those four things as well. Then we have to deal \nwith the 11 million, and the way to deal with it is not blanket \namnesty. What my principles outline, what the group's principles \noutline is a process that works this way: If you are here undocumented, \nyou must come forward. There will be a background check on you. If you \nhave ever committed serious crimes in the United States, you will be \ndeported. If you have not committed serious crimes in the United \nStates, you will then have to pay back taxes and you will have to pay a \nfine. What you will then get is basically the equivalent of a \nnonresident visa that allows you to work here. You do not qualify for \nFederal financial benefits, so you are not a strain.\n  I have heard that concern raised--this is going to place a strain on \nour social services. As nonimmigrant visa holders, they do not qualify, \nunder existing law right now, for Federal benefits.\n  What you get is a work permit, the ability to be here legally. We \nknow where you are, we know where you live, we know where you work, you \npay taxes, you have paid a fine--this is not amnesty--and you have a \nnonimmigrant visa. And there is nothing you can do with that \nnonimmigrant visa but stay here, work, and travel to visit relatives. \nBut you can't turn that into citizenship. It is a nonimmigrant visa.\n  They will have to remain in this probationary phase for a significant \nperiod of time--not an unreasonable period of time but a significant \nperiod of time. After that period of time has elapsed and if they have \ncomplied with all the requirements of that probationary period and if \nit is certified that the enforcement mechanisms are in place and have \nhappened--that is critical--then and only then do we then move to phase \n2.\n  This is what phase 2 is, and it is very simple. Phase 2 is that we go \nto these folks and say: OK, you will now be given the opportunity to \napply for a green card using the same process as anybody else anywhere \nin the world would use to apply--the same process.\n  In essence, all we are going to give them is a chance to do what they \nshould have done in the beginning, to apply the way they should have \napplied in the beginning. Here is what is important: They have to get \nin line. People say: What is the big deal about the line? The big deal \nabout the line is that all those people who have done it the right way, \nit is not fair to them to allow someone who didn't do it the right way \nto leapfrog them. In essence, we can't make it cheaper and faster to \nimmigrate here illegally than it is to immigrate here legally. \nUltimately, they will have to get in line, they will have to qualify \nfor the visa they have applied for, and if all that works out, then \nthey will get a green card. Once they get a green card, depending on \nhow they got it, they will have to wait about 5 years before they can \neven apply for citizenship.\n  This is the process and these are the principles we have outlined. I \nhave heard concerns, and they are all legitimate concerns. Just because \nsomeone raises concerns about our principles, that doesn't mean they \nwill ultimately be against them. It means they have legitimate \nconcerns. People say it is wrong to reward people who have done this \nthe wrong way. We agree, and that is why we can't allow them to \nleapfrog anyone. That is why the line is important and the waiting \nperiod is important.\n  I heard Senator Sessions earlier say that we are not even enforcing \nour current laws. That is true. And one of the reasons they are not \nbeing enforced is\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\nbecause the current system doesn't exist. It doesn't work. What we have \nnow is de facto amnesty. If we do nothing, what we have is de facto \namnesty because we don't know who the undocumented are. We couldn't \nenforce it even if we wanted to. That is why we have to deal with this \nissue.\n  We talk about the cost of social programs. If you are on a \nnonimmigrant visa, you don't qualify for the social programs by current \nlaw.\n  Look, there is a lot of work to be done. What we announced yesterday \nis not a plan, it is a framework. And that framework has to now be \nturned into legislative language. That is a lot of hard work, but I \nhope people will take this as an opportunity to come up with a solution \nto an issue that is solvable, that we can address and bring to a \nconclusion. It will have to be done the right way, and it will not be \neasy.\n  In a few hours the President will give a speech in Nevada, and early \npress accounts concern me. I don't want to turn this into a partisan \nthing, though, so let me just say this: If this endeavor becomes a \nbidding war to see who can come up with the easiest, quickest, and \ncheapest pathway to a green card possible, this will not go well. We \nnow have a commonsense and reasonable set of principles. And I hope \nwhat the President will say today is he hopes that process succeeds. \nBut if his intentions are to trigger a bidding war to see who can come \nup with the easiest process, this is not a good start. But let's give \nhim the benefit of the doubt. I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  I am deeply committed to the rule of law and to having an immigration \nsystem that works. I hope we can work together to accomplish that.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak to the nomination of \nSenator Kerry to be the next Secretary of State.\n  It has been more than 100 years since a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee was directly nominated to be the Secretary of \nState. The last was Senator John Sherman of Ohio, who was selected to \nserve as Secretary of State to President McKinley. It is important to \nnote that this historical fact exists because Senator Kerry's path \nisn't one commonly taken but one that is earned by a select few, and he \nhas earned this opportunity.\n  From the first time John testified before Chairman Fulbright as a \nyoung returning Vietnam war hero in 1971 to the day the President \nannounced his nomination as Secretary of State, he has invested himself \nin all of his endeavors, always looking for the truth, for answers, \nuncovering the facts, hearing all the evidence, and then publicly \nspeaking truth to power based solely on what was best for this Nation. \nI know he will carry those leadership traits with him into his new \nposition, and I can think of no one better prepared to take on the \nchallenges of this position.\n  As a Senator, as a member of this committee, and as a chairman, John \nhas already built strong relationships with leaders across the world, \nwhich will allow him to step seamlessly into the role of Secretary of \nState. Senator Kerry will need no introduction to the world's political \nand military leaders and will begin day one fully conversant not only \nwith the intricacies of U.S. foreign policy but with the understanding \nof the nuanced approach necessary to effectively interact on a \nmultinational stage.\n  When Vice President Biden was chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, he said on more than one occasion that ``good international \nrelationships are always predicated on strong interpersonal \nrelationships.'' John Kerry understands there is no substitute for \nstrong interpersonal relationships, whether in Senate politics or \ninternational diplomacy. Secretary of State is not a desk job. It \nrequires constant personal interactions in the furtherance of American \nforeign policy.\n  During his 30 years in public life and more than 25 years in the \nSenate, Senator Kerry has championed many issues. Earlier today the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee favorably reported his nomination to \nthe Senate unanimously and presented Senator Kerry with an honorary \nresolution highlighting a few of his many accomplishments.\n  Amongst his accomplishments are the partnership he formed with \nSenator John McCain that led to an effort to investigate the fate of \nAmerican soldiers unaccounted for in Vietnam and normalize relations \nwith a former enemy--which is, in essence, Vietnam; his leadership of \ndifficult, sensitive, and comprehensive investigations in the Senate on \neverything from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and \nillegal money laundering, to the Noriega regime in Panama which is well \nknown; advocating for democratic elections in the Philippines and \nserving with Senator Lugar as part of a Senate delegation that \nuncovered the fraud that led to the ouster of President Ferdinand \nMarcos; working with the Cambodian Government and the United Nations to \nfacilitate the creation of the genocide tribunal in Cambodia to \nprosecute key members of the Khmer Rouge; advocating for programs that \nhelp secure nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons stockpiles and \nmaterials so they don't fall into the hands of hostile states or \nterrorists; and leading the Senate to provide its advice and consent to \nratification of the New START treaty with Russia.\n  During the Arab spring, Senator Kerry supported a no-fly zone over \nLibya, which helped to save thousands of civilians from being \nmassacred, and he was a voice of courage and conscience in calling for \nPresident Hosni Mubarak to step aside and begin an orderly and peaceful \ntransition to a democratic political system in Egypt.\n  John has been a tireless advocate for the cause of peace in the Sudan \nand South Sudan and played an instrumental role in the successful \nreferendum in 2011.\n  John is well known for his bipartisan work with former majority \nleader Bill Frist on comprehensive HIV/AIDS legislation that laid the \nfoundation for\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\nthe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a program that provides \nlifesaving treatment for people with HIV/AIDS and supports broad \nprevention efforts that save lives every day.\n  Many of you know that John is a tireless and most convincing advocate \nfor addressing global climate change and supporting the transition to a \nclean energy future. As chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nhe convened eight major hearings and roundtables on climate change and \nenergy security, underscoring their connection to global stability, \neconomic competitiveness, and America's national security.\n  In his new role, his portfolio will be greatly expanded as he \nrepresents the interests of the Nation, from securing our Embassies and \nprotecting our overseas personnel to promoting commerce, enhancing \ncross-cultural ties, and keeping America secure through cooperation \nwhere possible and isolation where necessary, as in the cases of Iran \nand North Korea.\n  Whatever the challenges we will face as a nation, in my view, the \nState Department could not be in better hands. When it comes to \nAmerica's role in world affairs, I know we all agree that it is \ncritical that the United States remain fully engaged, that we project \nnot only the power of our military strength when necessary but the \nwisdom of our democratic ideas. I have no doubt that Senator Kerry will \nrise to meet these challenges as he has so consistently in his many \nyears of service to his State and this country.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member on the committee, Senator \nCorker, whom I look forward to working with as we move forward in the \ndays ahead.\n  I think all Members will say that even when they did not agree with \nChairman Kerry on a given issue, they always felt he had an open ear, \nan open door, an opportunity for full debate, an effort to seek the \ncommon ground, particularly in U.S. foreign policy. I believe those \ntraits are going to serve him extraordinarily well in his role as \nSecretary of State as he deals with the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives as part of promoting U.S. foreign policy in a way that \nbrings us as cohesively together as we can to promote the national \ninterests and securities of the United States.\n  I look forward at the end of this time period to a strong \nconfirmation vote to send a message to the world that this is our \nSecretary of State, and he speaks for America on behalf of the Obama \nadministration and the people of the United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I wish to thank the chairman for holding \nthe business meeting the way he held it today and the hearings last \nweek for this confirmation.\n  I know a lot of people think that because of the way partisan \npolitics are here in Washington, sometimes we can't be happy for \nsomeone on the other side of the aisle when they do well. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  I just want to say that I thought Senator Kerry acquitted himself \nexceptionally well in the hearings we had last week. I thought they \nwere wide-ranging, and I think he had the opportunity to display the \ndepth of knowledge he has on many issues. I don't know of anybody who \nhas lived a life that has been more oriented toward ultimately being \nSecretary of State than John Kerry, and for that I also am happy for \nhim and his family and the fact that very soon he is going to be able \nto express himself on behalf of our Nation in this way.\n  I think most of you know that his dad was a Foreign Service officer. \nI know that you know he certainly made a splash. Some people thought it \nwas negative, some people, positive, but he certainly made a splash \nhere during the Vietnam era and from that point on has been very, very \nactive. So, again, I thought he acquitted himself exceptionally well.\n  There are four points I want to bring out. I know that he knows--and \nmany of us have seen recently just because of some of the things that \nhave happened in Libya--we have a State Department that needs some \noversight, and we haven't provided it. Neither side of the aisle has \nprovided it now for over a decade.\n  I know he sees the need for the Senate, through its authorization \nprocess--and the House doing the same--to be involved and to be \npartners with him as we try to cause this organization, which over the \nyears has just built into a sporadic stovepipe entity, to be assisted. \nA lot of times when a political person comes into an organization, the \nbureaucracy tries to wait it out until the next person comes along. I \ndon't think it can happen any more in any agency than it does in the \nState Department.\n  So I look forward to working with the chairman in whatever way he \nends up deciding we are going to work together on this particular issue \nto really look at the State Department. I know Senator Kerry certainly \nwelcomes that.\n  We most recently had a hearing with Senator Clinton on Benghazi, and \nthere have been Accountability Review Board recommendations that have \nbeen put forth, and I know Senator Kerry has said he is certainly going \nto see those through and make sure they are fully implemented.\n  I know we talked a great deal in the hearing--and certainly we have \ndone so personally--about our nuclear posture and nuclear \nmodernization, which is a big part of what we discussed during the \nStart Treaty--something I supported and worked with him on--and I found \nhis comments about where we need to be in that regard certainly \nreassuring.\n  I also think he is very clear-eyed as it relates to the threat we \nface as a nation, especially in north Africa now but in many places as \nit relates to terrorist groups such as al-Qaida. As a matter of fact, I \nlook at Senator Kerry as a realist. While we have not always agreed on \nevery issue, as the chairman just mentioned, I have always found him to \nbe someone who is open to discussion. I think he wants only the best \nfor our Nation. There is no question that as he moves ahead over the \nnext several years, I am sure he will take positions that in some cases \nI and others--maybe Senator Menendez--may view as not exactly the \ncourse of action that ought to be taken on behalf of our country. But \nmy sense is that he will be open to listening, and I think he will be \nwilling to sit down and talk about that as we move ahead.\n  He came out of the committee today by voice vote unanimously. As the \nchairman mentioned, I think he is going to receive a very strong vote \nof support today here on the Senate floor. As the chairman mentioned, I \nthink that it is good for our Nation, as he goes out across the world \nrepresenting us, for people to understand that this is someone who \nreceived overwhelming support from the Senate.\n  All of us know we live in a dangerous world. We live in a world that \nis changing dramatically. We live in a world in which things come over \nthe transom on a daily and weekly basis that are unexpected. I mean, we \nlook at what is happening right now throughout the country of Egypt, \nwhich we might not have expected to occur a week ago. To have someone \nlike Senator Kerry, who has spent a lifetime on these issues and \nunderstands the history and institutional issues that have bound us or \nseparated us from these countries--having someone like him representing \nus will be a very good thing.\n  I join the chairman in supporting him. I know numbers of people will \nhave comments regarding his service here in the Senate but also his \nfuture service, and I look forward to listening to that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I would like to join with Senator \nMenendez and Senator Corker in urging our colleagues to promptly \nconfirm Senator Kerry as our next Secretary of State.\n  It is a great honor to serve in the Senate. It is a great privilege \nand honor to represent the people of Maryland here in the Senate. Part \nof that special privilege is the people we serve with, the incredible \npublic servants we have had the privilege of serving with in the \nSenate, and I put Senator Kerry at the top of that list.\n  He has devoted his life to public service in the finest manner. He is \nso qualified to assume the responsibilities of Secretary of State. He \nunderstands this complex world in which we live and the\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\ndifferences among countries. Many are strategically important to the \nUnited States. Yet they don't share our values. Senator Kerry \nunderstands that and understands the importance to advance U.S. \ninterests--we need to understand the concerns of other countries and we \nneed to establish relations with other countries.\n  He has made a personal commitment to understand the world in which we \nlive. I do not think there has been a Member of this body who has spent \nmore time, gone to more places, met with more people in order to \nrepresent our Nation on the international stage. Senator Kerry has \nalways done that with the greatest degree of competency and \nrepresenting our country in the finest traditions. He has broad \nexperience: experience as a soldier serving in Vietnam, experience as a \nSenator, 28 years representing the people of Massachusetts in the \nSenate. We know about his service on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I want to talk about two other committees on which he \nserved.\n  One is the Senate Finance Committee on which I had the pleasure of \nserving with him. There is no Senator who has taken the fiscal \nchallenges of our country more seriously or understands the impact our \nfiscal condition has on our national security interests. In fact, \nduring his confirmation hearings he mentioned the need to get our \nfiscal house in order. I think he understands that and understands the \ncommitment he has, once confirmed and once heading the State \nDepartment, to help us bring about fiscal sanity in the United States \nto do what is necessary worldwide, but also to do it in a most cost \neffective way.\n  I also served with Senator Kerry on the Small Business Committee. The \nsmall business community did not have a better advocate when Senator \nKerry was chairman of that committee. I was pleased how many times we \nbrought out initiatives to help America and small businesses grow \nbecause we know the growth engine for jobs has come from small \ncompanies. But, clearly, it has been in the last few years that I had \nthe privilege of serving with Senator Kerry as he chaired the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee that I got to see so up close and personal \nhis extraordinary commitment to our country and his ability to carry \nout so many important responsibilities.\n  Senator Kerry understands our national security, yes, depends upon a \nstrong military, but that also the other key ingredients to national \nsecurity are diplomacy and development assistance.\n  We had Secretary Clinton before our committee. Someone mentioned that \nwas about 1.5 percent of the budget, and she corrected it and said it \nis really less than 1 percent of the budget. Diplomacy and \ninternational assistance is less than 1 percent of the budget. We know \nwhat we spend on our military is a lot larger than that. All three are \nimportant to national security.\n  Senator Kerry understands that. He understands through diplomacy we \ncan avoid unnecessary military action. He understands through diplomacy \nwe can make America safer. He understands through international \ndevelopment assistance we can strengthen countries, make them more \nstable, and be less likely to need to use our military. That is the \ntype of leader we need as Secretary of State. We have a great leader \ntoday, Secretary Clinton. I think Senator Kerry will follow in that \ntradition.\n  Take a look at Senator Kerry's record of advancing America's \ninterests. We have a safer world today through Senator Kerry's efforts. \nAs you know, we approved the New START treaty with Russia, reducing the \namount of nuclear weapons between Russia and the United States. That \nmakes this world safer. His record on human rights is well known. From \nCambodia to Burma to Kosovo and many other places around the world, \nSenator Kerry has been a leader in advancing the cause of human rights.\n  We already heard Senator Menendez point out his efforts in Vietnam. \nHe represented America to get an accounting of our POW/MIAs. It was \nunprecedented in modern times to be able to go to a country with which \nwe are at war and have that kind of accounting. Senator Kerry used his \ntalent in order to bring closure for many American families, and that \nwas an incredible accomplishment. Then he was able to improve the \nrelationship between the United States and Vietnam, recognizing it is \nin America's interests that we are able to communicate with other \ncountries.\n  I particularly appreciate his work on elevating the importance \ninternationally of human trafficking. The United States has taken the \nleadership in saying, whether you are a receiving country or an origin \ncountry or a country of transport, we all have a responsibility to stop \nwhat we call modern slavery: the trafficking, usually of young girls, \nbut also sometimes boys. The United States has taken the leadership \nthere.\n  I like to think Senator Kerry's taking leadership on this started \nwith his position on the Helsinki Commission. He is a former member of \nthe Helsinki Commission. I now have an opportunity of being the Senate \nchair of the Helsinki Commission. We raised the issue of human \ntrafficking and Senator Kerry was one of the great advocates to advance \nAmerica's leadership internationally to stop human trafficking. He has \nprotected people with disabilities.\n  As Senator Menendez mentioned, he has been our leader on energy and \nclimate issues, recognizing the importance of the United States to \ndemonstrate international leadership in order to deal with a global \nproblem, a problem that is important for us to deal with as a citizen \nof the world but also important for us to deal with in regard to \nAmerica's economy and America's energy needs and America's security \nresponsibilities. Senator Kerry has been a great leader on that.\n\n  He has provided U.S. leadership for humanitarian assistance. I \nremember the hearings we had in the committee on Haiti and the personal \ncommitment he made to make sure America was in the leadership for a \ncountry in our own hemisphere that suffered such a horrible disaster, \nand his work there was extremely important.\n  He led our efforts in dealing with HIV/AIDS, in doing the responsible \nthings as far as America's position on that problem. He understands the \nimportance of international development assistance to advance gender \nequality. It is interesting, if you want to take a look at the health \nof a country, look at the way they treat their women. We have a pretty \nstrong commitment as far as international development assistance around \nthe world. We need to make sure countries advance the rights of women. \nIt is not only the right thing to do from what we believe as Americans, \nbut it also provides a more stable country for us to have relations \nwith. Senator Kerry understands that.\n  He has been one of the leaders in fighting corruption in other \ncountries. I will always remember the hearing we had in our committee \nwhen former President Clinton and Bill Gates testified before us. These \nare two individuals who have headed a lot of international development \nassistance. They have a zero policy in dealing with countries that \ncannot control corruption because they want to make sure their \nassistance doesn't go to fuel corruption. Senator Kerry understands we \ndon't want America's international development assistance to be used to \nfuel corruption. That is the type of leadership we have in the \nSecretary of State.\n  The list goes on of what he has been able to do to advance the rights \nand interests of the United States. I am confident that Senator Kerry's \nlegacy of fighting for democracy, human rights, and global peace will \ncontinue as he assumes his new responsibilities as the Secretary of \nState for the United States of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I thank Chairman Menendez for bringing this nomination to the floor \nso quickly and thank Senator Corker for accommodating it. It is \nimportant that President Obama has his security team in place as \nquickly as possible. I am proud the Senate will be doing its share, its \nwork by voting on this nomination later today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--it has been \nagreed to by the Republican side as well--that any time spent during \ndebate time in a quorum call be equally charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Passing a Budget\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise to speak about taxes, debt, and \nspending. It is time for President Obama to show real leadership on the \nbiggest threat America faces to our future prosperity. As my good \nfriend the Republican leader has said: If we don't get a handle on \nspending and debt, not much else matters.\n  It has now been 1,371 days--almost 4 years--since Democrats, who \ncontrol the Senate, have brought a budget to the floor and had a vote \nand passed the budget. Over that time, our national debt has grown by \nmore than $5.2 trillion. Our credit rating has been downgraded because \nof fears we may not be able to pay back our debt when it is ultimately \ndue, and we have experienced the longest period of high unemployment \nsince the Great Depression.\n  Since the end of the official recession in 2009, Americans' median \nhousehold income has fallen by roughly $2,500, while the cost of \nemployer-provided family health insurance has increased by more than \n$2,300--roughly a comparable amount. Not only has income fallen by \n$2,500 but costs have gone up--thanks to ObamaCare--by $2,300 for the \naverage family.\n  Until recently, passing a budget was considered not optional. It was \nconsidered a basic responsibility under the law. In fact, the Budget \nAct requires that Congress pass a budget each year, but this law has \nbeen defied for almost 4 years in the Senate.\n  I realize the Democratic leader--the majority leader--has said he did \nnot want to bring a budget to the floor because he did not want to put \nhis Members through a series of politically tough votes.\n  We cannot get to this problem by dealing with tax increases. This \nseems to be the preferred method of dealing with our deficits and debt \nby raising taxes, which, of course, happened as a result of the fiscal \ncliff negotiations where taxes have gone up on Americans by roughly $60 \nbillion a year, which will amount to almost $600 billion over the next \n10 years. Nevertheless, the President's budgets continue to ask for \nmore revenue, but the message from this side of the aisle has been: The \nPresident has gotten his pound of flesh on taxes. Now it is time to \ndeal with spending.\n  Unfortunately, we no longer have the luxury of delaying our toughest \nfiscal decisions. Our gross national debt is now larger than our entire \neconomy, and we are now facing more than $100 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities for things such as Medicare and Social Security. Those are \npromises we will not be able to keep unless we act now to put them on a \nfiscally sustainable path.\n  I am glad our House colleagues have passed the no budget, no pay \nbill. I think most Americans appreciate the fact that if Congress \ndoesn't do its basic work such as passing a budget--something every \nfamily and every small business in America has to do--then it should \nnot be paid.\n  That has already prompted Senate Democrats to say they are going to \ntake up a budget this year. Senator Murray, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee in the Senate, says she intends to mark up a budget. Senator \nReid and Senator Schumer have said they intend to see that a budget is \npassed by the Chamber. But they have also said they are going to \nattempt to extract more taxes from hard-working, middle-class taxpayers \nin order to double down on Washington's spending binge.\n\n  Our biggest fiscal problem is excessive spending, not insufficient \ntaxation. We can't raise taxes high enough to close the trillion-\ndollar-plus annual deficits or to make up this $16.5 trillion hole we \nhave dug. If we don't reduce spending and save Social Security and \nMedicare, then we will eventually find ourselves in a debt crisis. When \nthat happens is when our creditors--the people who lend us money, \nincluding the Chinese and other governments--demand more interest on \nour loans and, eventually, interest rates go up to historic norms, the \ndebt spirals out of control, and we reach a crisis of monumental \nproportions: It strangles the economy; it destroys jobs; it destroys \nour standard of living.\n  Don't take my word for it. President Obama himself has acknowledged \nthat no amount of tax increases could sustain Medicare in its current \nform. He has also said public officials who are concerned about \npreserving government assistance for the elderly and the vulnerable \nhave an obligation--those are his words--have an obligation to reform \nour entitlement programs and ensure their long-term viability. In other \nwords, the debt is not only the single greatest threat to our national \nsecurity, as former Chief of Staff Mike Mullen has said, it is also a \nthreat to our ability to provide a safety net to the most vulnerable in \nour country.\n  I know Democrats and Republicans alike in this body understand the \nproblem. The President himself understands the problem. In December of \n2010, his bipartisan fiscal commission known as Simpson-Bowles reported \nthe nature of the problem and a proposed beginning of a solution. Three \nof the most conservative Republican Members of the Senate agreed with \nthat commission report. However, rather than embrace it, the President \nwalked away from it, and he has not come back to the table.\n  We also have another bipartisan commission headed by Alice Rivlin, \nwho was the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under Bill \nClinton, and Senator Pete Domenici, longtime chair of the Senate Budget \nCommittee--people who understand these matters better than just about \nanybody. So there are solid, bipartisan proposals on the table. Yet \nhere we are, trillions of dollars later since the Obama administration \nbegan, with no solution in sight.\n  The President had the American people with their back against the \nwall with the expiring tax provisions on December 31 which led to the \nso-called fiscal cliff. If we hadn't acted, taxes would have gone up \nmore than $3 trillion on all Americans. There would have been an \nenormously negative impact on the economy and jobs. So we had to come \nup with some sort of stopgap solution. But the President got his pound \nof flesh. He got his revenue: $600 billion over 10 years.\n  Now is the time to return to what the President himself has called a \nbalanced approach to deficit reduction. Unfortunately, the President \nhas never even proposed a balanced approach, much less a balanced \nbudget. I can only hope that with his final election campaign behind \nhim and with the new term ahead of him, the President can begin to \ngrapple with and join us as we deal with our long-term fiscal \nchallenges.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here to speak first and very \npersonally in support of the nomination of Senator Kerry to be our next \nSecretary of State. There is a time when the man and the moment come \ntogether in a profoundly historic way. Senator Kerry's nomination to be \nSecretary of State of the United States at such a time when his \nleadership can be pivotal in shaping America's role in the world, as a \nleader for human rights, as well as the use of its extraordinary \nstrategic power for peace.\n  There is also a time when the woman and a moment come together and \nthat has been so for Hillary Clinton, who has done such extraordinary \nwork, incomparable in transforming America's role in world history. I \nbelieve that just as she has met the challenges in guiding American \nforeign policy and\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\nleading the dedicated men and women of our Foreign Service, so will \nSenator Kerry rise to the difficult challenges ahead. Senator Kerry's \nwhole life has prepared him for this job, and I have every confidence \nhe will help keep America safe and secure and build our capacity and \nalliances in pursuit of democracy and a more peaceful world.\n  Last week, I met with Senator Kerry to share my experiences from a \nrecent visit to the Middle East and Afghanistan and to urge him to \nimmediately take up the issue of the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe \noccurring within Syria and across its borders in Turkey and Jordan. My \nexperiences came from a trip I took with Senator McCain and Senator \nWhitehouse, and others of my colleagues who share my impression that \ndrastic and dramatic humanitarian aid must be provided for those \nrefugees.\n  I am pleased the President has announced an additional $155 million \nfor the Syrian people today. I believe we must also provide aid and \nassistance to the Syrian Opposition Council. It matters as much how we \nprovide this aid as the total amount we provide. I am very encouraged \nby Senator Kerry's listening and hearing us, and I look forward to \ncontinuing our work with soon-to-be Secretary of State Kerry on this \nissue and many other vital security concerns.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  One of those concerns on which I also rise concerns and affects \nAmerican immigration policy. We are truly at a moment when Secretary \nKerry and the administration can transform this debate and national \nconversation with the leadership of Members of this body, including \nmost prominently my colleagues Senator Schumer, Senator McCain, and the \nother members of their bipartisan group who recently unveiled a \nbipartisan blueprint for comprehensive immigration reform.\n  One of the things I do as a Senator and did when I was attorney \ngeneral of our State is to visit the citizenship and immigration \nceremonies where people become new citizens of our Nation. It is one of \nthe most moving and powerful of experiences I have seen in public life. \nThe tears in the eyes of these new citizens and their families, in \ncelebration and joy and pride of their becoming citizens of the United \nStates and looking forward to contributing, giving back to this \ncountry, reaffirmed my faith not only in this Nation--in its strength \nand decency and generosity--but also in the men and women who want to \ncome here because they see it as a beacon of freedom and democracy. \nThat is the tradition and ethos that should guide us in seeking \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We have a unique opportunity now--and \nI will work to fulfill it, to reform our broken immigration system as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee and most particularly its Immigration \nSubcommittee. I look forward to playing a leading role in achieving \nthis group's working blueprint for comprehensive reform.\n  Establishing a path to citizenship, securing our borders, making \nemployers more accountable, ensuring that the DREAMers--young people \nbrought to this country as infants and young children--can find a way \nto citizenship are all goals that are fulfilled by this blueprint.\n  We have an obligation, an opportunity that is compelling, absolutely \nhistoric, to change the discussion and debate, but also the outcome, \nand we should seize that opportunity, make sure this moment is \nfulfilled, I think, particularly for those DREAMers. For them, this \nmoment and every moment is precious. They are young people who are in \nour schools, in our military, seeking a way to be citizens of the only \ncountry many of them know. They speak English. It is the only language \nmost of them know. They have friends and a life here. It is the only \nlife they have.\n  The administration, rightly and commendably, has provided an \nadministrative route to temporary reprieve from the laws that would \nresult in their deportation. But they need the certainty and security \nof a law that gives them a real path to citizenship, not at some point \nin the indefinite future but now.\n  The DREAM Act that Senator Durbin has fought so hard and valiantly \nover so many years to achieve deserves passage now. I will continue to \ncome to the floor with photographs of the DREAMers, as I have done week \nafter week, to make sure their fate and future is on our minds.\n  Today, I also want to speak about another related immigration issue--\nthe Immigration Innovation Act of 2013, known as the I-squared bill, \nwhich was introduced in the U.S. Senate today.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of it. I know firsthand from \ntalking to employers in the State of Connecticut, and all around not \nonly our State but the country, how significant this measure could be \nto attracting and retaining people with the skills America needs to \nremain the greatest Nation in the history of the world.\n  I thank Senators Klobuchar, Hatch, Coons, and Rubio for their \nleadership on this issue. The I-squared bill has a very simple \nobjective, which is to ensure that America's innovative companies are \nable to access high-skilled workers who would go back to their \ncountries of origin when we need them here.\n  In some areas, such as computer science, the demand for workers \ngreatly exceeds the labor pool available of U.S.-born workers. Senator \nHatch described on the floor of the Senate how in this decade the \nAmerican economy will create a demand for an estimated 120,000 computer \nscience jobs requiring at least a bachelor's degree, but U.S. \nuniversities will generate only an estimated 40,000 graduates in that \nfield.\n  So just to take that one example--just that one example--there is a \ngap we need to fill to keep our companies competitive. I have heard \nabout this issue from Connecticut employers big and small. There are \njobs. They exist. We need the people who have the skills to fill them.\n  The I-squared bill seeks to fill that gap, most importantly, by \nallowing high-skilled workers, who are foreign born but often U.S. \neducated, to fill some of those jobs in high-need areas. The \nlegislation makes sense because it makes it easier for U.S.-educated \nholders of advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and \nmath to obtain green cards.\n  The bill also, importantly, generates new revenue through fees that \nvisas and employment-based green cards will provide, and it directs \nfunds to promote STEM education and worker retraining at the State \nlevel--STEM being science, technology, engineering, and math.\n  This measure is about American competitiveness. We ought to make a \npriority of STEM education for young people in our country who are born \nhere and raised in the United States. But we must be open to creating \njobs for American workers in the most innovative sectors of society and \nmaking it easier for those industries to thrive by attracting people \nfrom throughout the world to the United States as a beacon of \nopportunity, a land of unlimited potential accomplishment.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. We are great because of our diversity. \nWe are strong because we have always attracted people who want freedom \nand the potential to do their best, accomplish the most, and realize \nthe full extent of what they can achieve.\n  I again thank Senators Klobuchar, Hatch, Coons, and Rubio for their \nleadership. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, as well as the \nImmigration Subcommittee, I look forward to working with them on this \nimportant legislation in the months ahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of John Kerry to be our next Secretary of \nState.\n  As a friend and colleague for more than 20 years, I can think of no \none who is more qualified and better prepared to be our Nation's chief \ndiplomat.\n  He has the intelligence, judgment, compassion, determination, and \nabove all, leadership experience to help the administration confront \nand find common sense solutions to the multitude of foreign policy \nchallenges now before us.\n  His story is well known to those of us who have worked side by side \nwith him for so many years.\n  The son of a distinguished foreign service officer, his understanding \nof the\n\n[[Page S349]]\n\nworld and America's critical role in it began at an early age. He \nlearned the value of American diplomacy and the indispensable role \nplayed by our diplomats here in Washington and at our consulates and \nembassies around the world.\n  He served with distinction and honor in Vietnam, earning a Bronze \nStar, a Silver Star, and three Purple Hearts. He saw first hand the \ncosts of war, and he recognized that military force must be used wisely \nand only after all other options have been exhausted.\n  After 2 years as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, he came to the \nSenate in 1985 and took his place on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, rising to the position of chairman in 2009.\n  As a member of that committee and its leader, he demonstrated the \nqualities that will serve him well as Secretary of State.\n  He did his homework, and he asked tough questions. He traveled the \nworld and engaged key leaders, gaining their respect and confidence. He \ndeveloped an admirable track record of listening carefully to both \nsides of an issue and developing the relationships on both sides of the \naisle necessary to forge bipartisan agreements.\n  From re-establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam and organizing \nthe ratification of the New START Agreement to managing our \nrelationship with Pakistan and Afghanistan, fighting the HIV/AIDS \npandemic, and addressing the threat posed by climate change, Senator \nKerry has clearly left his mark on United States foreign policy.\n  As President Obama noted, ``John has played a central role in every \nmajor foreign policy debate for nearly 30 years.''\n  And that experience will serve him well as Secretary of State.\n  Indeed, we live in challenging and constantly evolving times.\n  We have ended the war in Iraq, and our mission in Afghanistan is \nwinding down. But the threat of global terror endures.\n  We have seen the Arab Spring topple autocrats and bring hope for a \nnew future. But the ultimate fate of those countries and their \ncommitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law remains \nuncertain.\n  We have enacted a robust set of bilateral and multilateral sanctions \non Iran and launched a diplomatic initiative through the P5+1 process, \nbut its nuclear program continues.\n  We have built a close and mutually beneficial relationship with \nChina, but there are lingering questions about its human rights record \nand its growing military assertiveness, particularly in the South China \nSea.\n  And we have seen how our humanitarian and development assistance \nprograms can lift people out of poverty in the developing world; yet \nnearly 2.5 billion people still live on less than $2 a day.\n  These are just some of the items that will be on Senator Kerry's \nagenda as Secretary of State.\n  I know he understands that in facing these challenges American \nleadership is essential but we will also need the help and cooperation \nof our friends, allies, and partners in the international community.\n  I know he understands that the strength of this country lies not just \nin our military but in the power of our ideas.\n  And I know he understands that in order for the United States to \nlead, we must maintain a strong and effective international affairs \nbudget.\n  We will certainly miss Senator Kerry's leadership and experience in \nthe Senate. But I am heartened to know that he will continue to serve \nhis country and bring those skills to the State Department, \nrepresenting the United States around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Kerry's nomination to be our \nnext Secretary of State.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand here today to \nsupport President Obama's nomination of my esteemed colleague, Senator \nJohn Kerry, to serve as our Nation's next Secretary of State.\n  Senator Kerry has had a long career of service to the American \npeople. We have served together in the Senate for 26 years and I look \nforward to continuing our relationship. As a Senator he has always \napproached his work with seriousness and dedication. Nowhere can this \nbe seen more than in his work as a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, where he has shown a mastery of the challenges \nthat face our global community.\n  As the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee he has played a \nprominent role in the establishment of U.S. foreign policy. He has \ntraveled the globe and built relationships and coalitions with \ninternational leaders. Most importantly, he has demonstrated an ability \nto balance our Nation's long history of diplomacy with our changing \nnational security needs. The unanimous support given to him by the \nForeign Relations Committee exhibits the respect and confidence he has \nearned from this body.\n  The Department of State faces evolving challenges that reflect our \nincreasingly interconnected world and require a modern approach to \ndiplomacy. Senator Kerry will lead a team that must confront global \nsecurity challenges and ensure the security of our diplomatic corps and \ntheir families. I am confident that Senator Kerry will meet these \nchallenges, and I will work with him to ensure that the State \nDepartment and its employees have the resources they need to serve \ntheir mission.\n  While I am sorry to see Secretary Clinton leave her post after 4 \nsuccessful and productive years, I am pleased to know that Senator \nKerry will take on the role with the same dedication. I call on my \ncolleagues to join me in approving his nomination to Secretary of \nState.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, John Kerry is a valued colleague and a \nloyal friend, and we will miss him in the Senate. But at a time when \nour Nation faces complex and difficult challenges around the globe, he \nis especially well qualified to serve as Secretary of State, and I \nstrongly support his confirmation.\n  Unquestionably, Iran is at the top of the list of challenges the next \nSecretary of State will face. Senator Kerry has supported efforts in \nthe Senate, including sanctions language included in the defense \nauthorization acts for 2012 and 2013, that have helped isolate the \nIranian regime. At his confirmation hearing, Senator Kerry succinctly \nstated the Obama administration's policy on Iran:\n\n       We will do what we must do to prevent Iran from obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon and I repeat here today: Our policy is not \n     containment, it is prevention and the clock is ticking on our \n     efforts to secure responsible compliance.\n\n  Senator Kerry will be an effective and dedicated executor of that \npolicy as we unify the international community in our efforts to \nprevent the Iranian government from developing nuclear weapons.\n  Another significant challenge for our foreign policy is the volatile \nAfghanistan-Pakistan region. Here again, Senator Kerry's unique \nqualifications will serve our Nation well. He strongly supports the \nplan for transitioning the security lead to Afghan forces so they can \nprovide for their own security. He has established a critical \nrelationship with President Karzai that will strengthen our bilateral \nrelations as we define the enduring strategic relationship between the \nUnited States and Afghanistan for post-2014. Senator Kerry understands \nthe importance of negotiating a bilateral security agreement that \nprovides our troops the necessary protections, including legal \nimmunity, for a limited force to continue to train, advise and assist \nthe Afghan forces and conduct counterterrorism operations after 2014. \nSenator Kerry also has significant experience engaging with Pakistan, \nwhich remains key to efforts to establish security and stability in \nSouth Asia. Through the Kerry-Lugar-Berman Act and other efforts, Kerry \nhas led efforts to strengthen civilian institutions in Pakistan and to \nreset our bilateral relations.\n  Senator Kerry also recognizes, as he said during his confirmation \nhearing, that ``[m]ore than ever, foreign policy is economic policy.'' \nThose words will hearten working families in my State and across the \nNation whose well-being is increasingly connected to our economic \ncompetitiveness around the world, our ability to engage with other \nnations to ensure that our companies and workers have the opportunity \nto compete in the global marketplace on an equal footing, and our \nrecognition that economic competition today is\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nnot just among companies, but also among the countries that support \ntheir companies and workers. I look forward to working with Senator \nKerry as we bring all the levers of American policy to bear on this \nissue of paramount importance to American prosperity.\n  Another issue on which I look forward to cooperating with Senator \nKerry is our policy toward Cuba. Senator Kerry and I have similar \nvoting records on United States policy towards Cuba. We also both \nrecognize the need for policy that places maximum pressure on the Cuban \nregime to democratize. However, our voting records maintain that our \nCuba policy is counter-productive in promoting change in Cuba. I look \nforward to working with Senator Kerry to rebalance our approach to Cuba \nas we look forward to a new era in that nation's history and its \nrelations with us.\n  Throughout his public career, John Kerry has proven his dedication \nnot just to America's interests, but to its values. Indeed, he \nrecognizes that our ability to defend our interests around the world \ndepends on adherence to the values that make the United States a beacon \nof freedom and opportunity. He has spoken with eloquence about the need \nto combat violence and extremism around the world not just with our \nmilitary might, but with the power of our ideas. As he said in his \nconfirmation hearing, ``America lives up to her values when we give \nvoice to the voiceless.'' His commitment to aiding those around the \nworld whose lives have been shattered by war, repression or disaster is \nin keeping with those values.\n  Senator Kerry knows personally the cost of war and the value of \npeace. He knows the difficulty of the challenges we face, and the \nimportance of American leadership in facing those challenges--\nleadership important not just to our Nation's security and prosperity, \nbut to the world's. He has been an outstanding servant of the American \npeople, and I am confident he will continue that record of \nextraordinary service as our next Secretary of State.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to support the confirmation \nof our colleague Senator Kerry to be Secretary of State. Senator Kerry \nis one of our Nation's great leaders in foreign affairs, and has been \nsince he arrived in the Senate 28 years ago. His remarkable record \nspeaks for itself, but I would especially like to recognize and thank \nhim for his service as chairman of Foreign Relations Committee over the \npast 4 years.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S350, January 29, 2013, the Record reads: Mr. President. \nI am proud to support . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Ms. \nKLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to support . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  In addition to his hands-on diplomacy in Afghanistan, Pakistan, \nSudan, and elsewhere around the globe, Senator Kerry has fought to \nbring up more treaties for Senate consideration. We of course remember \nhis leadership during the consideration of the New START treaty in \n2010, which has enabled a responsible reduction of our nuclear arsenal \nin concert with Russia. But he also worked to bring forward the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and held hearings \non the Convention on the Law of the Sea, two important international \nagreements that the United States has not ratified. Trying to shepherd \ntreaties through the Senate is a much less glamorous task than \ntraveling to summits overseas, but Senator Kerry approached them with \nthe same level of passion and energy. He fought for these treaties \nbecause he truly believes in the importance of American leadership in \nthe world, and he understands that that leadership does not come solely \nfrom our military strength but our commitment to dialogue and \ndiplomacy.\n  Senator Kerry will undoubtedly serve as Secretary of State with the \nsame honor and integrity that have defined his career. It will be up to \nus to continue his legacy in the Senate, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him as he takes on this new challenge.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe the business before the Senate \nis the confirmation of John Kerry as Secretary of State, to which I \nwould like to speak. I actually rise in support of two Senators, one \nformer and one current, as America's Secretary of State.\n  Last week, both were guests at the Foreign Relations Committee which \nI served on and both did an outstanding job. The Secretary of State, \nformer Senator from New York, Hillary Clinton, has served the U.S. \ninterests with distinction. She championed a diversity of causes that \nstrengthen our security and at the same time improved the lives of so \nmany around the world, particularly women and children.\n  Secretary Clinton leaves an incredible legacy in her diplomatic \nefforts. There is no one more suited or more qualified to take up the \nchallenges and promise than my friend and colleague and our mutual \nfriend Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n  John Kerry came to the Senate almost 30 years ago. From his first \ndays as a freshman, he served with distinction on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. As a Navy patrol boat captain in the Vietnam war, \nhe had notable and lasting exposure to complex foreign policy \nchallenges and the wars that result when diplomacy fails.\n  Certainly one lesson he brought back with him was the heavy and all \ntoo personal knowledge of the consequences of war. But his experience \nin representing the U.S. interests abroad did not begin in this \ninstitution. Rather, the journey to his nomination for Secretary of \nState began when John Kerry was a child, when his own father was a \nForeign Service officer. John tells fond stories about his time as a \nchild living in Berlin while his father was stationed there.\n  During those years, he developed a profound respect for the men and \nwomen of the Foreign Service, their sacrifice, their dedication, and \ntheir ability to demonstrate the values of our democracy. During his \ntenure as a Senator from Massachusetts and from 2009 as the chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Kerry has been a tireless \nleader on behalf of the American people to ensure that our security \nremains strong and our interests well represented around the world.\n  He has been a leading voice on the Iran-Contra investigation, the war \nand fragile peace in Afghanistan, arms control and verification, \nbuilding lasting ties with Pakistan, and perhaps in his most personal \ncontribution, opening diplomatic relations with Vietnam. I would like \nto speak to that for a moment, if I can, because it is a personal story \nI would like to share.\n  It was John Kerry and John McCain, more than any others, who moved us \nfrom that stage in our history where we shunned the people of Vietnam \nto the point where we recognized their country, established normal \nrelations with them, and built a new relationship. There were no better \nSenators to do it than John Kerry and John McCain, both of whom were \ndecorated veterans of the Vietnam war, both of whom gave so much in \nthat conflict, particularly Senator McCain, spending 5 years as a \nprisoner of war in Vietnam. They worked hard to establish normal \nrelations with that country and to put behind the bitterness and the \nwar that had divided the two countries, the United States and Vietnam.\n  It was not easy. One of the issues front and center was the question \nof prisoners of war and missing in action. There were all sorts of \nrumors and speculation that, in fact, there were still Americans being \nheld prisoner in Vietnam. That rumor was very strong across America. \nThere was a lot of criticism of the Vietnamese in not cooperating with \nus in trying to identify anyone still remaining or the remains of \nAmerican soldiers who died in that conflict.\n  John McCain and John Kerry came together and put an incredible \nbipartisan voice to resolving these issues. It came to my attention \nbecause it was about the time when I was elected to the Senate in 1996. \nI served in the House of Representatives with an extraordinary \nindividual, Pete Peterson of Florida.\n  Pete Peterson had been an Air Force pilot in the Vietnam war, shot \ndown, and himself imprisoned in a POW camp for more than 5 years. He \nwas a quiet person and did not talk much about it. But one day, I kind \nof provoked him at lunch, and he started talking about what it meant to \nlive in isolation for 5 years, how they coped, how they survived, and \nthe impact it still had on his life.\n  President Clinton at that moment decided it would be a significant \nsymbol that the first Ambassador of the United States to Vietnam would \nbe Pete Peterson of Florida, a man who\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\nhad been held as a POW by the Vietnamese would return as American's \nvoice in that new country. He was brought before the Senate for \nconfirmation.\n  I remember saying to my staff when I came over here: Be sure and tell \nme when Pete Peterson's nomination comes to the floor. I want to say a \nfew words about my friendship with him and what he means to me and how \nimportant this appointment is. Time passed. I did not hear anything. \nThen there was a ``60 Minutes'' program on that I happened to watch. It \nwas all about Pete Peterson becoming the Ambassador to Vietnam. I came \nback to my staff. I was upset. I said: You were supposed to tell me \nwhen this happened so I could get up and give a speech and say \nsomething nice. They said: It never happened. ``60 Minutes'' is \nspeculating. The fact is, Pete Peterson's nomination has been put on \nhold--a secret hold in the Senate.\n  I could not believe it. I called Pete Peterson. I think he lived in \nJupiter, FL, at the time. I said to him: Pete, what is going on here?\n  He said: Dick, I am about to give up. It has been almost 1 year since \nPresident Clinton named me to the spot and I cannot clear the Senate. \nSomebody is holding me up. I do not know who it is. I have to get on \nwith my life.\n  I said: Let me at least talk to some people. So I came to the floor. \nThe first person I looked for was John Kerry and then John McCain. They \nsaid: Yes; there is a hold, but we are trying to work through it.\n  I said: You know, if you cannot get this done and done quickly, then \nI think there has to be a speech on the floor that says: Holding Pete \nPeterson in a POW camp for 5 years is bad enough, but the Senate \nholding his nomination as Ambassador is unforgivable. We need to vote \non Pete Peterson. He has given so much to this country.\n\n  It is credit to John Kerry and John McCain that they quieted down \nthis new Member of the Senate and said: Let us get this done quietly. \nThey did. Pete Peterson went on to serve as Ambassador in Vietnam. He \nwas a widower at the time. He met a lovely young Vietnamese-Australian \nwoman. They married. They now live in Australia and we keep in touch \nfrom time to time. But I think of that moment in time in our history \nwhen John Kerry and John McCain showed what diplomacy and careful \nconsideration can do.\n  We not only established relations with Vietnam, we sent a great \nindividual to serve as its first Ambassador. They did it quietly and \neffectively. Can he be a great Secretary of State? You bet he can. I \nwill be the first to tell you that I saw his skill firsthand when I \ncame to the Senate. If confirmed, he will bring a breadth of experience \nto global challenges, some new and some which we cannot even anticipate \nas we debate this matter. The list is vast and formidable: Iran, \nSyrian, North Korea, cyber security, failed and fragile states, and \ndemocratic backsliding in Russia, to name a few.\n  One of the issues John Kerry has tackled for many years that will \ndesperately need attention, and the President highlighted in his \ninaugural address, is that of climate change. As was mentioned during \nhis nomination hearing last week, climate change is the one of the most \npressing and consequential issues of our time. It is not just an \nenvironmental issue, it is a moral issue. What kind of planet will our \ngeneration leave for our children and grandchildren? How will history \njudge us if we ignore the evidence and warning signs and do nothing to \nhead off climate catastrophes? Senator Kerry is uniquely qualified to \naddress this great moral challenge. He knows if we are ever going to \nget China and India to take responsibility for their carbon emissions, \nwe have to start from a strong position of legitimacy, having taken \nthese steps ourselves.\n  He knows when the United States tackles climate change, it also \nincreases our diplomatic standing and reputation around the world. He \nknows tackling climate change will help prevent a host of terrible \nglobal problems, from famine, water shortages to political instability, \nany of which can draw the United States into a costly or bloody \nconflict.\n  Addressing climate change is in our vital national, economic, and \nsecurity interests. I know John Kerry will tackle this and many other \nchallenges that await him at the State Department. He has been a \ntrusted and admired colleague of mine and so many others in the Senate. \nI have enjoyed his work on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I \nwish to especially thank him for calling the Convention on Disability \nTreaty for consideration by the Senate. I am sorry it did not pass, but \nit was not for lack of effort by John Kerry.\n  His passionate pursuit of a safe and just Nation and world, his deep \nsense of patriotism and commitment to America's most challenged values \nare well documented. While I am sorry to lose him in the Senate as a \ncolleague, I can think of no better person to serve as our Nation's \nnext Secretary of State. I congratulate John Kerry on his nomination. \nAs a friend and colleague, I urge my fellow Senators to swiftly confirm \nJohn Kerry so he can get about the work of making America a safer \nnation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are coming to \nthe end of the time on this debate--or consideration, I should say. \nThere has really been no debate. I think that speaks to Senator Kerry's \ntremendous standing in the Senate on his nomination as Secretary of \nState.\n  This is a Member of the Senate who has an extraordinary American \nhistory. After volunteering for the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam war, \nSenator Kerry was awarded a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and three \nPurple Hearts. Upon returning home, he continued his efforts to fight \nfor and protect the veterans who served beside him in combat, joining \nwith others to found the Vietnam Veterans for America organization, \nworking tirelessly for veterans' benefits.\n  With over three decades of foreign policy and national security \nexperience under his belt, Senator Kerry is uniquely qualified to serve \nas the next Secretary of State. A decorated Vietnam combat veteran, \ndedicated public servant, with deep experience in international affairs \nand close relationships with Presidents and Prime Ministers throughout \nthe world, he will have an extraordinary beginning to his job as \nSecretary of State.\n  He has demonstrated time and time again his ability to build \ncoalitions and craft compromises. He has amassed a broad record of \nforeign policy accomplishments and has distinguished himself as one of \nthe Nation's most respected voices on national security.\n  I look forward to a very strong bipartisan vote that sends a very \nclear message to the world: This is America's representative. This is \nour Secretary of State. I believe he has earned that vote and that \nrespect through a lifetime of work and the tremendous collegiality he \nhas had among Members on both sides of the aisle, including those who \nmay not agree with him on any given issue but have always respected the \nmanner in which he has approached that issue.\n  Mr. President, understanding there are no other speakers wishing to \ncome before the Senate on this matter, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of John Forbes Kerry to be Secretary of \nState?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, my fellow Members know the issue of \ntransparency is a very favorite topic of mine, and I come to the floor \nto speak about transparency as it relates to a very specific problem \nwithin the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It is no secret \nI have worked to bring greater transparency and accountability to all \nparts of the Federal Government because with transparency I think we \nget more accountability.\n  The voters of Iowa have entrusted me to continue my oversight \nresponsibilities no matter who occupies the White House, and since I am \na Republican, people might think I am doing it because we have a \nDemocratic President. I think I have a reputation for being an equal \nopportunity overseer of the executive branch of government.\n  For several years I have been conducting oversight of the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development; everybody knows this is \ncommonly referred to as HUD, H-U-D. HUD's core mission, according to \nits Web site, is to ``create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities \nand quality, affordable homes for all.'' These responsibilities have \ngrown larger and more complex over the last few years. The mortgage \ncrisis continues to affect the housing market.\n  Secretary Donovan was recently tapped to oversee the Hurricane Sandy \nrecovery in the Northeast. HUD's yearly budget is nearly $38 billion. \nSecretary Donovan should understand the importance of oversight and \ntransparency to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. I have my doubts, \nthough, because while I have sent dozens of letters to HUD, the \nSecretary has not signed a single reply. The responses I do receive are \noften months late and don't answer some of my most pressing concerns.\n  For instance, last August I sent a letter requesting information on \nconference spending and employee bonuses. HUD provided no conference \nspending documents but instead urged me to review a list of inspector \ngeneral audit reports. My staff has reviewed these audit reports, but \nnone of the audit reports provide a comprehensive review of conference \nspending. What is even more frustrating is that the response never \nreferenced bonus spending at all. It seems oversight and transparency \nare not high priorities at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  Every year HUD provides at least $4 billion to public housing \nauthorities across the country--along with nearly $19 billion of \nsection 8 vouchers. In 2009, the Obama administration provided yet \nanother $4 billion in stimulus funding for the housing authorities--all \nwith little or no oversight. Public housing authorities operate in a \ngray area. HUD argues that they are State and local government \nentities, and it is thus--according to HUD--State and local governments \nthat bear the primary responsibility for the housing authority actions. \nUp to 90 percent of their total funding comes from the Federal \nGovernment, thus making it HUD's responsibility to ensure the money is \nspent as intended.\n  My office went to work to determine the compensation packages for a \nhandful of housing authorities spread around the country--mostly in the \nlarger cities. Some authorities would not provide responses, but others \nresponded with some troubling answers. It became apparent many \nexecutive directors were living very high on the hog. The fact is \nexecutive salaries, and other compensation at some public housing \nauthorities, were a major problem and the amounts were then hidden from \nthe taxpayers.\n  Some housing authority executive directors were earning high six-\nfigure salaries and benefits that sometimes included a vehicle, housing \nallowance, and lucrative bonuses. Many of the executive directors were \nmaking more than even the Governor of the State they were located in. \nFrom Los Angeles, CA, to Boston, MA, they were raking in huge salaries. \nUnfortunately, no one at the HUD Headquarters in Washington, DC, was \nwatching or even showed any concern.\n  In Philadelphia, the executive director's salary was $300,000, plus a \n$45,000 bonus. He had a housing authority car and driver, and the \nhousing authority actually paid his mortgage. This money is supposed to \nhelp people with very low incomes afford safe and decent housing, but \ninstead they were concerned about their own salary and their own \nhousing. The taxpayers' money was meant to go to the lower income \npeople for safe and decent housing and all the money was not being used \nfor that. It is not supposed to subsidize the housing costs of a \ngovernment bureaucrat in Philadelphia who already makes $345,000 a \nyear. In Chelsea, MA, the executive director's salary was $360,000. He \ncashed out weeks of unused leave and sick time while only spending \nabout 15 full days per year in the office.\n\n  These executive directors used taxpayers' money to build and protect \ntheir own fiefdoms, usually at the expense of the poor. In \nPhiladelphia, this included spending millions of dollars on an army of \nwell-connected lawyers. Ironically, these lawyers were paid with \ntaxpayers' money to thwart investigations that were aimed at \nsafeguarding taxpayer money. The HUD Office of Inspector General had \ndone battle with these armies of lawyers over and over around the \nentire country, and the taxpayers are funding both sides of the fight.\n  In addition, no-bid contracts and contracts steered toward friends \nseemed to be common at many housing authorities.\n  As early as October 2010, I asked HUD to provide salary and \ncompensation information for executive directors at\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\nthe 25 largest housing authorities. Instead of numbers, I received the \nfollowing statement:\n\n       In response to your questions related to Executive \n     Directors' salaries, currently HUD does not regulate \n     compensation for Housing Authority executive directors. \n     However, in light of what has taken place with the \n     Philadelphia Housing Authority, HUD is working closely with \n     our Office of General Counsel to assess this policy.\n\n  It is pretty obvious that is not an answer to anything I asked. HUD \nneeds to take this issue far more seriously.\n  Last Wednesday, the director of the Chelsea Housing Authority was \ncharged with four felony counts. According to the Boston Globe, he was \nindicted for deliberately concealing his salary from State and Federal \nentities. I hope this is a warning to other housing authorities that \nabuse of taxpayers' dollars is totally unacceptable. I commend HUD \nInspector General David Montoya, the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nMassachusetts, and, of course, the FBI for vigorously investigating the \nproblems in Chelsea. Others around the country need to take note of \nwhat happened in Chelsea. I understand this investigation continues, so \nstay tuned.\n  The No. 1 priority for HUD and these directors should be to provide \nwhat the law intends with the taxpayers' money--to provide safe, \ndecent, and sanitary housing for people in need instead of lining the \npockets of directors. Feathering their own nests seems to have been the \nfocus of some for far too long. Unfortunately, instead of getting \nstraight answers from HUD, I must rely on courageous whistleblowers and \nnewspaper accounts to actually get these facts.\n  Due to mounting pressure, HUD requested the compensation data for the \ntop five highest compensated employees at housing authorities across \nthe country. The results must be really embarrassing because the Obama \nadministration would make only aggregate data available to the public. \nThat way, the administration has made it impossible to tell which \nauthorities are the worst offenders.\n  I asked that HUD make all salary data public in a June 2000 letter I \nwrote to Secretary Donovan. It is one of many letters the Secretary has \nfailed to answer. In fact, no one at HUD responded to the letter at \nall. I have also sent letters to HUD requesting information about \nconference and travel spending, as well as the number and the cost of \ntake-home vehicles for HUD and all public housing authorities. Letters \nwere also sent about problems at New York City, Houston, and Port \nArthur, TX, housing authorities in those cities. I am still waiting for \nresponses from Secretary Donovan.\n  Most recently, I sent letters in October of 2012 to Senate \nappropriators and the Senate Banking Committee with jurisdiction over \nthese issues. There needs to be public hearings into the massive waste \nof taxpayers' money at HUD. My colleagues need to know the extent of \nthe problems and that I am ready to work with Members of this body to \naddress these issues.\n  Mr. President, before I finish, I ask unanimous consent to have the \nreferenced letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2012.\n     Hon.

To sum up, oversight, whether it is about HUD or any \ngovernment bureaucracy, is necessary to protect the taxpayers. I take \nthis duty seriously. I am not going away and will continue to \nvigorously oversee problems at HUD. I urge Secretary Donovan to make \nexecutive compensation and all funding data available to the public. It \nwould shed light in an area that has rarely been seen with the light \nshining in. As some Supreme Court Justice said sometime, sunlight keeps \nmold from happening, or something to that effect.\n  Transparency is not the only solution, though. HUD also needs to put \ncontrols in place to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. But transparency \nmay be the quickest and most effective way to curb the worst abuses. \nThe Obama administration could release that executive compensation data \ntoday if it wanted to, and it should release that data.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Madam President, on what is her final day as Secretary of \nState, I would like to express my admiration and gratitude to Hillary \nRodham Clinton for the extraordinary job she has done over the last 4 \nyears. I agree wholeheartedly with President Obama who said she has \nbeen one of the finest Secretaries of State in our Nation's history.\n  When she took on this responsibility in January 2009, Hillary Clinton \nwas already one of the most celebrated and accomplished women in the \nworld. Certainly her reputation and renown have been tremendous assets \nas she worked to restore America's standing in the world.\n  Over the last 4 years, Hillary Clinton has been the ultimate \nworkhorse public servant as opposed to the showhorse. This comes as no \nsurprise to me and other former colleagues in the Senate. We know she \nis a leader of extraordinary substance and a talent with an amazing \nwork ethic.\n  Secretary of State Clinton has set records as the most traveled \nSecretary for time in office, visiting some 42 countries just in the \nlast year alone. She will be remembered for her tireless efforts to \npromote the empowerment of women worldwide and for her many \ndemonstrations that ``smart power'' and assertive diplomacy can be far \nmore effective than so-called ``hard power'' and military \ninterventions.\n  I am especially grateful to Secretary of State Clinton for insisting \non robust assistance to Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake \nof 2010. In addition, following my visit to Vietnam in 2010, and just \nprior to her own visit, we talked and I had urged her to pledge \nAmerica's commitment to helping Vietnam clean up the sites contaminated \nby Agent Orange. She agreed wholeheartedly, and this is one way she has \nbeen very successful in repairing the breach with our former adversary \nand doing what is right and just for the victims of Agent Orange in \nVietnam.\n  I have many fond memories of Hillary Clinton's 8 years here in the \nSenate. During that entire tenure, we served together on the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. In that role, as in her \nprevious role as First Lady, she was an outspoken advocate for health \ncare reform, fighting tirelessly to secure quality affordable health \ncare for all Americans. Although she was no longer in the Senate when \nthe Affordable Care Act passed and was signed into law, she shares \nenormous credit for laying the groundwork of that historic achievement.\n  Hillary Clinton has been a wonderful friend to my wife Ruth and to \nme, and, of course, from her many campaigns in my State, she has so \nmany friends all across the State of Iowa. So she is retiring from the \nDepartment of State, but we all know that by no means is she a retiring \nperson. There are many vivid chapters yet to be written in the story of \nHillary Rodham Clinton. I wish her a richly deserved rest and much \nsuccess and happiness in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S354-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING JOHN KERRY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as we say goodbye to Secretary Clinton \nin her capacity as Secretary of State, we say welcome aboard and \ncongratulations to my good friend Senator John Kerry on the resounding \nconfirmation of his nomination to serve as our next Secretary of State. \nHis departure will be a tremendous loss to the Senate, but I respect \nPresident Obama's decision to tap him for this absolutely critical \nposition. There is no one in the United States better qualified by \nexperience, knowledge, and temperament to step into this \nextraordinarily demanding job.\n  To repeat what my colleagues already know, but it always bears \nrepeating, after volunteering to serve in the U.S. Navy during the \nVietnam war, John Kerry was awarded the Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and \nthree Purple Hearts. Upon returning home, he became a national leader \nin the fight for justice for veterans who served beside him in Vietnam \nas well as for veterans of wars before and since Vietnam. He joined \nwith others to found the Vietnam Veterans of America organization. He \nhas worked hard here in the Senate over all of these years to secure \nveterans' benefits, for an extension of the GI bill for higher \neducation, and for appropriate treatment for veterans with post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.\n  As we all know, Senator Kerry has played a leading role in shaping \nAmerican foreign policy for many years in his position on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and as chair of that distinguished committee. As \nchair of that committee, he was instrumental in securing passage of the \nNew START treaty, a vital arms accord with Russia that is helping to \nreduce the danger of nuclear proliferation. He has served as a trusted \nspecial envoy to Afghanistan, Sudan, and Pakistan at crucial moments. \nSenator Kerry advocated for democratic elections in the Philippines. He \nwas part of a delegation that uncovered the fraud that ultimately led \nto the removal of President Ferdinand Marcos. He was a strong proponent \nof U.S. action to end ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and to oppose \nsanctions on Burma tied to human rights abuses. Senator Kerry has been \na leader in promoting economic development and recovery in Haiti, \nfighting global HIV/AIDS, supporting democracy and human dignity, \npoverty assistance, and the advancement of women's empowerment \nthroughout the world.\n  In his early days in the Senate, Senator Kerry and I--in fact, we \nwere elected together in 1984; we came to the Senate together. But \nshortly after that, Senator Kerry and I went on a factfinding mission \nto Nicaragua and unearthed information regarding the activities of the \nContra guerillas, which he presented to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations. Based in part on his groundbreaking findings, the committee \nlaunched an investigation into the funding of the Contra guerillas that \nultimately uncovered the Reagan administration's Iran-Contra scandal, a \nscheme to divert profits from illegal arms sales to Iran to support the \nContra guerillas.\n  Senator Kerry and I, as I said, were both Members of the class of \n1984 here in the Senate. We worked together to end illegal support of \nthe Contras in Nicaragua, and we have collaborated on a range of human \nrights issues since then.\n  In particular, I salute his tireless and valiant attempt last year to \npass the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I can't \ntell my colleagues how hard he worked to get it through the committee \nand before that worked with others to make sure we had a good \nconvention to the U.N. that mirrored our own Americans With \nDisabilities Act. John Kerry worked tirelessly on this, and I am deeply \ngrateful for all that work and the passionate commitment he made to \nthis treaty. I know he shares my disappointment that the Senate failed \nto give its consent to this treaty, but I look forward to working with \nhim in his new role as Secretary of State and with Senator Menendez, \nour new chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, not only to \npromote the convention around the world, which I know Senator Kerry \nwill do in his position as Secretary of State, but to once again bring \nthis convention to the floor of the Senate and this time to prevail and \npass it.\n  There is no question in my mind that John Kerry will be a great \nSecretary of State. I wish him and Teresa the very best, and I look \nforward to working with him in the years ahead.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week the House of Representatives \npassed a plan to prevent the risk of another credit rating downgrade. \nBy ensuring that the United States will not default on its obligations, \nthe House made the responsible decision to stop playing politics--at \nleast for a while--with our Nation's creditworthiness and to prevent \nself-inflicted harm on our economy. Despite this effort, the House \ncouldn't pass up the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\ntry, while doing the right thing, to score at least one political \npoint. We are now considering the measure they passed.\n  This legislation, the No Budget, No Pay Act, coming directly off a \ncampaign document, insists that congressional pay be linked with the \npassage of a budget by April 15. I am fine with that, that we should do \nthat and if we don't, we don't get paid. But let's not forget that the \nSenate passed something even stronger than a budget for the past 2 \nyears; we passed the Budget Control Act, which reduced the deficit by \n$2 trillion. Despite this, House Republicans have no problem misleading \nthe American people with their language, preventing Senators from being \npaid until we pass a budget.\n  I have no problem with no budget, no pay, but why stop there? What \nabout no jobs bills, no pay? In 2011 the Senate passed my legislation, \nbipartisanly cosponsored with Senator Graham and a number of other \nRepublican Senators, including Senator Burr, and a group of Democratic \nSenators, we passed my legislation to punish China when it cheats, when \nit manipulates its currency. The bill could create more than 2 million \njobs, mostly in manufacturing, knowing what happened in places such as \nthe Presiding Officer's State of Massachusetts and in my State of Ohio \nwith lost manufacturing jobs.\n  Despite the clear evidence that leveling the playing field with \nstopping currency manipulation would create jobs, despite the clear \nevidence of an overwhelming vote in the Senate and, 2 years ago, an \noverwhelming vote in the House on the same issue, this legislation has \nlanguished in the House for the past 2 years.\n  But why stop at the budget? Why not a no farm bill, no pay bill? \nCongress is obligated to pass a farm bill every 5 years. The Senate \npassed our bipartisan farm bill, which, among other things, saves some \n$20 billion of direct savings by eliminating the longtime-discredited \ndirect payment program. It would save $20 billion, but, again, the \nHouse refused to act.\n  What about my legislation linking the age at which Members of \nCongress can collect their pensions to the age at which working \nAmericans are eligible for Social Security? Some people, especially in \nthe House of Representatives, want to raise the retirement age for \nSocial Security, yet for themselves--ourselves, if we retire earlier--\ncollect pensions before that age. If people here are going to raise the \neligibility age for Social Security, nobody here should be able to \ncollect any retirement benefits until that same age.\n  Citizens in my home State of Ohio in places such as Middletown, where \nworkers have watched paper factories get priced out of the market \nbecause of unfair competition with places such as China; in Cincinnati, \nwhere call center workers are watching their jobs get contracted to the \nPhilippines; and in Worcester, where there are too many cases of \nshutdown plants, moving overseas, simply or mostly because of currency, \nnot to mention tax breaks that encourage companies, that allow \ncompanies to deduct the cost of moving their plant overseas against \ntheir Federal tax, those are the kinds of things average Americans are \nwaiting for the House of Representatives to act on, legislation that \nwill make a real difference in their lives right now.\n  I am fine with the No Budget, No Pay Act.

Madam President, there is nothing like a good meal \nin a favorite restaurant to make your day. When I travel to Fairbanks, \nthe second largest city in my home State, I often go to Big Daddy's \nBarB-Q owned by Harold Groetsema.\n  There are many good barbeque establishments in Alaska. Barbeque has \nlong been a part of our Nation's culinary history. Few people know that \nour own Library of Congress holds dozens of old drawings, posters and \nprints depicting barbecued meats at picnics, high society events, fairs \nand the like. The Library of Congress has barbeque recipes, stories, \ncookbooks and books on the history of barbeque. Its collection is large \nbecause it is a popular subject whether you like your sauce sweet, \nspicy or vinegar sour.\n  It would be hard to pick an absolute favorite of mine back home. I \nlike them all. Big Daddy's southern-style barbeque is consistently top \nquality. Big Daddy's has won competitions in Alaska, done well \nnationally and was featured on a Food Network TV show. Maybe it's the \nsecret sauce. Maybe it's the meat. Maybe it's the way he slow cooks \nover a hickory fire.\n  Harold and his team are heading to the World Championship Barbecue \nCooking Contest in Memphis later this year. With his skills and \ndedication, I wouldn't be surprised if they return with a high ranking. \nI wish Harold and his team well and I know they will make Alaska \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S355-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MURRAY GALINSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring Murray Galinson, an extraordinary San Diego community \nleader who died earlier this month in California at age 75. Murray was \na dear friend of mine, and I will miss him terribly.\n  Murray Galinson's accomplishments were legendary--as a businessman, \nphilanthropist, teacher, political activist and adviser, friend of \nIsrael, and, above all, family man. But even these amazing achievements \ndo not begin to capture the person Murray was or the life that he \nlived.\n  As Rabbi Michael Berk told a 1,000 mourners at San Diego's Temple \nBeth Israel, Murray was ``a man of substance and loyalty . . . a man \nwho loved family and friends, a man of character and integrity, a man \ndevoted to his people and his community, a man of national stature, a \nman whom we Jews would call a mensch, a fine example of what a human \nbeing should be, a man who leaves this world with the highest \nattainment: a shem tov, a good name.''\n  Murray was a remarkable person who was loved and admired by all who \nknew him and whose countless acts of charity, kindness, and public \nservice touched thousands of people who never met him.\n  Murray Galinson was a proud Democrat who always sought to build \nbridges and consensus across party lines. As Rabbi Berk noted, Murray \nexemplified ``what it means to serve in the noble cause of bettering \nthe lives of those with whom we share this country and this planet by \nseeking answers to our problems, not just winning.''\n  On behalf of the people of California, who benefitted so much from \nhis life and works, I send my love, gratitude, and deepest sympathy to \nMurray's beloved wife, Elaine, and their children, daughters-in-law, \nand grandchildren.\n  One measure of Murray's profound impact on his community is how \ndifficult it is to imagine San Diego without him--yet I know that he \nwill live on through his good works and in the hearts of all of us who \nknew and loved this remarkable man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S355-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S355-S356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ELIZABETH A. HACKER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, public service is a noble \nendeavor, and there are many individuals across our great nation that \ndedicate their lives to making our communities better and function \nsmoothly. I am pleased today to recognize the illustrious career of one \nsuch public servant, a talented and well-respected judge from my home \nState of Michigan. Elizabeth A. Hacker's legal career has spanned more \nthan three decades, and her tenure on the bench has been defined by her \nsound judgment, wisdom, and expansive knowledge of the law.\n  Judge Hacker is retiring from the Federal bench after 32 years of \ndistinguished service to the Detroit Immigration court and to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. Her family, friends, and colleagues from the \ncourt and the Michigan bar gathered this past weekend to celebrate this \nmilestone and to honor her distinguished career. I am delighted to \nhonor her impressive record of public service to our Nation,\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\nthe Justice Department, the City of Detroit and our great State of \nMichigan.\n  Elizabeth Hacker is a proud daughter of Detroit. She received her \nB.A. from Wayne State University in 1974 and a law degree from the \nDetroit College of Law in 1978. Following a brief period in private \npractice, Judge Hacker joined the Detroit office of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service in 1980. She rose quickly within the INS, \nserving as a naturalization attorney; a trial attorney; a chief \nattorney; and finally assistant regional counsel for the western region \nfor three immigration districts, including Los Angeles, where she \nsupervised dozens of other immigration attorneys.\n  Elizabeth Hacker is currently the senior United States immigration \njudge for the Immigration Court with jurisdiction over Michigan, Ohio, \nand northern Kentucky. Notably, Judge Hacker re-established the Detroit \nImmigration Court when she was appointed to the bench in July of 1995.\n  While affiliated with the Immigration Service, Judge Hacker acted as \nan instructor at both Federal law enforcement training academies, \nteaching a range of subjects, including the law of arrest, search and \nseizure, employer sanctions and general immigration law.\n  During her long tenure on the Detroit Immigration Court, Judge Hacker \nhandled numerous noteworthy and high-profile cases, many of which were \ncovered extensively by the news media. Of particular note was the role \nshe played in the deportation of Nazi war criminals that were \ndiscovered residing in the United States living under false pretenses.\n  In 2011, Judge Hacker wrote the opinion in the trial of Ivan Kalymon \nfor his participation in Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution while \nserving as an armed member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police during \nWorld War II. Hacker ordered Kalymon deported.\n  In the months following the attacks of September 2001, Judge Hacker \nhandled several cases involving terrorists and terrorist organizations \nplotting in the United States. Many high-stakes cases came before her \ncourt. Her colleagues on immigration courts across the country came to \nrely on her expertise and experience. They would frequently solicit her \nopinion on complex matters involving national security.\n  Her colleague on the bench, Judge Marsha Nettles, describes Judge \nHacker as someone who ensured that everyone who came before her \n``received a full, fair and complete hearing. She never forgot the \nmission of the Immigration Service or the Court. She always put the \nmission first, no matter the public pressure or media scrutiny.''\n  By all accounts, Judge Hacker is looking forward to her retirement \nand to spending more time on Grosse Ile with her loving husband Brian \nMunson and doing more cooking, which outside of the law, is her true \nlife's passion.\n  Judge Hacker is a trailblazer. Through her tireless dedication, sense \nof purpose and unfailing fidelity to the mission of the Justice \nDepartment and the court, Elizabeth Hacker has set a high standard. I \nknow my colleagues join me in congratulating Elizabeth Hacker as she \nconcludes her long and distinguished legal career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S356-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:12 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsections 5580 and 5581 of the revised statutes (20 U.S.C. 42-43), and \nthe order of the House of January 3, 2013, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Member on the part of the House of Representatives to the \nBoard of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution: Mr. Becerra of \nCalifornia.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 3003, and the \norder of the House of January 3, 2013, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Member on the part of the House of Representatives to the \nCommission on Security and Cooperation in Europe: Mr. Hastings of \nFlorida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S356-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 3:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \npro tempore (Mr. Upton) had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 152.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national origin, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, on January 29, 2009, President Obama \nsigned the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\nAct. It was a proud day and I was there for that. A critical law, the \nfirst legislation signed into law by President Obama after his first \nelection, reversed the outrageous Supreme Court decision in Ledbetter v \nGoodyear and made clear that a worker such as Lilly Ledbetter, who does \nnot learn of her pay inequities for years, still had recourse to \nchallenge her wage discrimination.\n  Today we celebrate the anniversary of the enactment of this important \nlaw, but at the same time we must recognize it was only a first step. \nWe need to do much more to ensure that all workers in our society are \npaid fairly for their work and are not shortchanged because of the \ntheir gender, race or other personal characteristic. That is why, 4 \nyears after enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, I am proud \nto introduce once again the Fair Pay Act, a bill I have introduced in \nevery Congress since 1996.\n  Let me give some background. In 1963, Congress enacted the Equal Pay \nAct to end unfair discrimination against women in the workplace. At \nthat time, 25 million female workers earned just 60 percent of the \naverage pay for men. While we have made progress toward the goal of \ntrue pay equity fully a half century later, too many women still do not \nget paid what men do for the same or nearly the same work. Let's be \nclear about this. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 has to do with women doing \nthe same jobs as men. But still, on average, as we know, for every $1 a \nfull-time male worker earns, a woman earns just 77 cents. So we have \ngone from 60 cents, in all those 60 years, to 77 cents for every $1 a \nman makes.\n  What does that translate into? You might say, OK, 7 cents is that a \nbig deal? Yes, it is. Over a lifetime of work it means an average of \n$400,000 that a woman loses because of the unequal pay practices.\n  I will say that again later on, but that $400,000 is not just the pay \nshe loses during her lifetime. Think about the retirement benefits that \nwoman loses because she has been underpaid all those years. That is why \nwe have a system in America, when a woman retires, a man retires, they \nhad the same kind of work, a man gets a lot more retirement than a \nwoman because they paid in more because they were paid more during \ntheir lifetime.\n  This system is wrong, it is unjust, and it threatens the economic \nsecurity of our families. The fact is millions of American families are \ndependent on a woman's paycheck just to get by, to put food on the \ntable, to pay for childcare, to deal with rising health care costs.\n  In today's economy, few families have a stay-at-home mother. In fact, \n71 percent of mothers are in the labor force. They are a major \ncontributor to their familie's income. Two-thirds of mothers bring home \nat least one-quarter of their familie's earnings and in more than 4 of \n10 families with children, a woman is the majority or sole breadwinner.\n  That means in today's economy, when a mother earns less than her male \ncolleagues, her family must sacrifice basic necessities, as well as \nface greater difficulty for these kids to save for college, afford a \nhome, live the American dream. The lifetime of earning losses all women \nface, including those who are without children or whose children are \ngrown, affects not only their well-being during their working lives, as \nI said earlier, but it affects their ability to save and have a decent \nretirement.\n  The evidence shows that discrimination accounts for much of the pay \ngap. In fact, according to one study, when we look at all the reasons \nthere is a wage gap--we have race, 2.4 percent; 3.5 percent union \nstatus; labor force experience; industry category; occupational \ncategory--41 percent unexplained. They cannot explain why it is. The \nfact is, that is because of discrimination. It is because our laws have \nnot done enough to prevent this discrimination from occurring. That is \nwhy the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was a critical first step. That is \nwhy it is important to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  That bill was introduced last week by Senator Mikulski. I am proud to \nbe an original cosponsor. She has always championed that. What that \ndoes is start to close a lot of the loopholes and barriers to effective \nenforcement in our existing law to close that 41 percent unexplained \ngap. We need to strengthen penalties and give women the tools they need \nto confront discrimination.\n\n  It is outrageous that the Senate has not yet passed the Paycheck \nFairness Act. In the last two Congresses this bill got more than a \nmajority of support. In 2010 58 United States Senators, a large \nmajority, voted to pass this legislation. If we had 58 votes, why \ndidn't we get it? Because of Republican obstructionism, we could not \neven proceed to debate the bill. This was a filibuster on a motion to \nproceed to the bill. We got 58 votes, but we could not even debate it.\n  Since we just went through a recent debate on rules reform, I want \nthe American people to understand this. The Republicans, the minority \nparty has continuously prevented the Senate from even considering the \nissue of unequal wages and gender discrimination. Millions of women and \ntheir families are concerned about the fact that they get paid less \nthan their male colleagues. It is unfair; it is unjust. Nevertheless, \nrepeatedly, the Republicans have filibustered even debating the issue.\n  Just last week we had a vote in the Senate to change the rules. We \nmade some modifications of the rules. I truly hope those modifications \nwhich were made will now enable us to get over this hurdle so we can \nbring up the Paycheck Fairness Act and debate it. If they want to offer \namendments, that is fine, but let's debate it. Let's have amendments \nand then let's vote to pass the bill. I hope the changes in the rules \nlast week will enable us to do so.\n  As I said, the Lilly Ledbetter bill was a first step. The Paycheck \nFairness Act will start to close some of the loopholes and make sure \nthe penalties will be enforced. But there is one more step which needs \nto be taken, and I think it is the most critical one of all--equal pay, \nyes. We have had that since 1963; that is, women and men doing the same \njob. The Lilly Ledbetter Act allows us to go back and get the back \nwages that were due, but that is sort of after the fact.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act will make sure we have penalties and \nenforceability. However, there is one other huge, glaring \ndiscrimination that is ongoing in our society today against women; that \nis, as a nation we unjustly devalue jobs traditionally performed by \nwomen even when they require comparable skills to the jobs \ntraditionally performed by men.\n  Today millions of what we call female-dominated jobs, such as social \nworkers, teachers, childcare workers, nurses, those who care for our \nelderly in assisted living care or in nursing homes--most of these jobs \nare equivalent in skills and working conditions to male-dominated jobs, \nbut the female-dominated jobs pay significantly less. This is unfair \nand unjust discrimination.\n  Why is a housekeeper worth less than a janitor? Why is a maid worth \nless than a janitor? Eighty-nine percent of maids are female; 67 \npercent of janitors are male. While the jobs are equivalent in skills, \neffort, responsibility, and working conditions, the median weekly \nearnings for a maid are $387 and for a janitor it is $463. Computer-\nsupport workers--a job that is 72 percent male--have median weekly \nearnings of $949. In contrast, secretaries and administrative \nassistants, which is 96 percent female, have median weekly earnings of \n$659. Why do we value someone who helps with computers more than \nsomeone who makes the entire office function? That is not to say the \nmen are overpaid, it is just to say that jobs we have long considered \nin our country as ``women's work'' or ``women's jobs'' are grossly \nunderpaid.\n  Now to address this more subtle, deep-rooted discrimination, today I \nintroduced the Fair Pay Act. As I said, this is a bill I have \nintroduced--along with Congresswoman Norton--every year since 1996. The \nbill will ensure that employers provide equal pay for jobs that are \nequivalent in skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions.\n  People have asked: How do we do that? Well, we have some history. In \n1982 the State of Minnesota implemented a pay equity plan for its \nState, and I think, also, municipal employees. The State found that \nwomen were segregated into historically female-dominated jobs and that \nwomen's jobs paid 20 percent less than male-dominated jobs. Pay equity \nwage adjustments\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nwere phased in over 4 years, leading to an average pay increase of $200 \nper month for women in female-dominated jobs.\n  In 1983, in my home State of Iowa, the Iowa Legislature--a Republican \nlegislature and a Republican Governor, I might add--passed a bill \nstipulating that the State shall not discriminate in compensation \nbetween predominately male and female jobs deemed to be of comparable \nworth. That was in 1983. I am proud of Iowa. I just want to say this \nwas passed by a Republican legislature and signed by a Republican \nGovernor.\n  Toward that end, the State engaged a professional accounting firm to \nevaluate the value of 800 job classifications in State government. The \nfinal recommendations, which were made in April of 1984, proposed that \n10,751 employees should be given a pay increase. After being \nimplemented in March 1985, female employees' pay had increased at that \ntime by about 1.5 percent. Think of what that means from 1985 to now \nand how much more those women are paid over all those years. This can \nbe done as well for the women in this country who are currently being \npaid less, not because of their skills or education but simply because \nthey are in undervalued ``female jobs.'' Making sure they receive their \nreal worth will make a real difference for them and the family who rely \non their wages.\n  Again, many of these jobs are jobs that we don't know what we would \ndo without them. Have you ever visited someone in your family who was \nin a nursing home? Who is taking care of those people? Women. If we \ntake someone who is in a situation like that, they have to lift and \nmove heavy people. They have to be strong, and they care for people. \nThen we look at truckdrivers. Most truckdrivers are men. Truckdrivers \nhave power steering and power brakes. A person doesn't have to be \nstrong to drive a truck. They are making a lot more money than that \nwoman who is working in a nursing home and taking care of our \ngrandparents. Why? Skills, effort, responsibility, and working \nconditions are about the same.\n  What my bill would do would be very simple. It would require \nemployers to publicly disclose their job categories and their pay \nscales. Got it? Employers would publicly disclose their job categories \nand pay scales without requiring specific information on individual \nemployees. I am not asking anyone to say what they are paying an \nindividual employee. We just want to know job categories and pay \nscales. If we give women information about what their male colleagues \nare earning, they can insist on a better deal for themselves in the \nworkplace.\n  Right now women who believe they are the victim of pay discrimination \nmust file a lawsuit and endure a drawn-out legal discovery process to \nfind out whether they make less than the man working beside them. With \npay statistics readily available, this process could be avoided. In \nfact, I remember when Lilly Ledbetter first testified before our \ncommittee--the committee I now chair and the committee on which the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair is proud to serve.\n  I had provided Lilly Ledbetter information on the Fair Pay Act--the \none I am talking about. I asked her if the Fair Pay Act had been law, \nwould it have averted her wage discrimination case. She made it very \nclear that had she had the information about pay scales, which our bill \nprovides, this would have given her the information she needed to \ninsist on being paid a fair salary from the beginning rather than \nhaving to resort to litigation years after the discrimination began.\n  Four years after President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct, let's make sure what happened to Lilly never happens again by \nrecommitting ourselves to eliminating discrimination in the workplace \nand making equal pay for equivalent work a reality.\n  I have introduced this bill in every Congress since 1996. We get \nfocused on Lilly Ledbetter, and that is important. We are focused on \npaycheck fairness as well. Let's think about the millions of American \nwomen out there who are in these traditional women's jobs which require \nthe skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions that are \nsimilar to a man and yet they are grossly underpaid.\n  If Minnesota and Iowa--and there may be some other States I don't \nknow about; I just know about those two. If they can do it--and they \ndid this in the 1980s for State employees as well as municipal \nemployees in Minnesota--surely we can do this nationwide. If we really \nwant to stop the discrimination in pay in this country between women \nand men, the Fair Pay Act is the one that will do it.\n  I am going to continue to push for this as long as I am here. \nHopefully, we can have some hearings on it again, which I will, and \nhopefully we can begin to move on it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Coons, \n        Mr. Flake, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Heller, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \n        Hoeven, Mr. Warner, Mr. Nelson, and Mr. Schatz):\n  S. 169. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nauthorize additional visas for well-educated aliens to live and work in \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Immigration \nInnovation--or I-Squared--Act of 2013. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Marco Rubio, and Senator \nChris Coons, without whom this bill would not have materialized. All \nfour of us worked very closely together, and each one of us deserves \ntotal credit for this bill. Together, we have crafted one of the first \nbipartisan immigration bills in this Congress, one that is designed to \naddress the shortage of high-skilled labor we face in this country. \nThis shortage has reached a crisis level. For too long, our country has \nbeen unable to meet the ever-increasing demand for workers trained in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics--or STEM--fields. As \na result, some of our Nation's top technology markets, such as Silicon \nValley, Seattle, Boston, New York, and Salt Lake City, are in desperate \nneed for qualified STEM workers.\n  It is critical that we not only recognize this shortage of high-\nskilled workers but also understand why it exists. Increasingly, \nenrollment in U.S. universities in the STEM fields comes from foreign \nstudents, and despite our urgent need for workers in these fields, we \ncontinue to send these foreign students--potential high-skilled workers \ntrained at American universities--back to their home countries after \ngraduation.\n  Recently I was in a meeting with several leaders in the technology \nindustry where it was mentioned that between 2010 and 2020, the \nAmerican economy will annually create more than 120,000 additional \ncomputer science jobs that will require at least a bachelor's degree, \nand that is just mentioning one aspect of this. This is great news for \nmany of our computer science students. Unfortunately, that is the end \nof the good news. Each year only about 40,000 American students \nreceived bachelor's degrees in computer science. In other words, there \nare approximately 80,000 new computer science positions every year in \nthe United States that cannot be filled by the available American \nworkforce. I might add that these are positions which need to be filled \nso that our technology industry can continue to thrive. Simply put, \nU.S.-based companies have a great need for those trained in the \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics field, but at least \nright now, there are not enough Americans trained and ready to fill \nthese jobs.\n  We cannot continue to simply hope American companies do not move \noperations to countries where they have greater access to individuals \ntrained in these STEM fields. We cannot continue to ignore this \nproblem; it is that simple. Continued inaction causes us to miss out on \nan important opportunity, especially since, as the American Enterprise \nInstitute has confirmed, 100 foreign-born workers with STEM degrees \ncreate an average of 262 additional jobs for native-born workers. Those \ncountries would love to have their American-educated Ph.D.s and other \nhighly educated individuals return and boost their economy--not only \nfrom their acquired skills but also by creating these new jobs as well. \nAn updated, high-skilled immigration system is directly tied to \ncreating jobs\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\nand spurring growth across all sectors of our economy. We cannot afford \nany further inaction on this issue.\n  The I-Squared Act of 2013 addresses the immediate short-term need to \nprovide American employers with greater access to high-skilled workers \nwhile also addressing the long-term need to invest in America's STEM \neducation. I am confident that this two-step approach will enable our \ncountry to thrive and help us compete in today's global economy.\n  I mentioned my three prime cosponsors on this bill, each one of whom \ndeserves credit for this bill, each one of whom has been a pleasure to \nwork with, each one of whom adds a great deal to getting this bill \npassed. I personally thank the Senators for working with me on this \nissue and allowing me the privilege of working with them on this issue.\n  Let me turn some time over to Senator Klobuchar, who, along with \nSenators Coons and Rubio, has been a prime mover on this piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Rubio and \nSenator Coons. I also thank the Senator from Utah for his incredible \nleadership. We have worked as a team. I think that is what this is, a \nteam--team America. We must be a country that makes stuff again, \ninvents things, and exports to the world. In order to do that, we need \nthe world's talent, and that is what this bill is about.\n  As everyone can see by looking at the four of us here on the Senate \nfloor, it is something on which both parties can agree. In order to get \nthis done and get comprehensive immigration reform done, we must work \nin a bipartisan manner. I support the comprehensive immigration \nprinciples that were outlined yesterday for reform and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to get this done.\n  The I-squared bill is about encouraging engineers, inventors, \ninnovators, and entrepreneurs to work here in this country and \ndiscouraging companies from contracting out with people in other \ncountries. I cannot say how many Minnesota companies--small companies--\nhave told me that they could not bring someone over because of the caps \nand they contracted with that person in another country. Well, guess \nwhat. That person then hired assistants and other people to work with \nthem, but in one case they hired French people instead of hiring \nAmericans.\n  In fact, a recent study headed by Mayor Bloomberg of New York, Mayor \nCastro of San Antonio, Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia, and others showed \nthat every H-1B visa creates 1.8 American jobs. Those are jobs in \nHawaii and those are jobs in Minnesota.\n  Take a look at the Fortune 500 companies. Ninety of those companies \nwere founded by immigrants, and over 200 were founded by immigrants or \ntheir children, including Medtronic and 3M in my home State. This has \nmeant an extraordinary number of good American jobs, and we want more. \nWe want the next pacemaker or Post-it note, which were invented in my \nState, to be invented again in the United States of America.\n  I want to quickly lay out the four areas of reform that are included \nin the I-squared bill.\n  First of all, we reformed the H-1B visa system to meet the needs of a \ngrowing science, engineering, tech, and medical community and to help \nthe workers who form the backbone of those businesses.\n  Second, we make changes to student visas to encourage students who \nget degrees here to stay in this country so we don't just say: Hey, go \nback to India or China or some other country and start the next Google \nover there. We want them to start it here.\n  Third, we improve the green card system.\n  Finally, and one of the most important aspects of this bill, we \nactually change the visa funding structure so that companies that bring \nin these high-tech and science and engineering immigrant workers will \nalso be spending some money on funding all of the education efforts we \nneed to do in this country for science, engineering, technology, and \nmath, the STEM education that is going on in this country. Even by a \nconservative estimate, that would be $300 million a year and something \nlike $3 billion in 10 years. That is real change, and it can change the \nsystem.\n  I am very appreciative of the work of my colleagues. I know Senator \nRubio, who has shown great leadership on this issue, is next and will \ntalk about the H-1B and student visa reforms. I thank Senator Hatch and \nSenator Coons for their leadership on this issue. We are very excited \nabout moving ahead on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot in the news over the last 24 \nhours about immigration as an issue that confronts our country. I \nwanted to put this in the context of that and then talk specifically \nabout the details that are within this.\n  First of all, in the context of immigration reform, there are things \nI think the vast majority of Americans would agree. One is this: We \nhave a legal immigration system that is not working for the country. I \nthink that despite the debate which exists about illegal immigration \nand how to deal with that reality--and that is a real debate that needs \nto happen--one of the things everyone agrees on is that legal \nimmigration is good for this country. It is an important part of our \nhistory and critical part of our future. The legal immigration system \nwe have in place right now does not work for America, and it really \ndoes not work for the 21st century.\n  Let me be clear about one thing: I support family-based immigration. \nThat is how my parents came to this country. I don't want us to do \nanything that undermines it. I also know that in the 21st century, we \ncan no longer afford to have an immigration system where literally less \nthan 10 percent of the people who come here do so based on the skills \nthey bring to this country.\n\n  Think about this for a moment: If I said to my colleagues that the \nNBA should be a collection of the best basketball players in the world, \nwho would disagree with that? If I said Major League Baseball should be \na collection of the best baseball players in the world, who would \ndisagree with that? How, then, can we disagree about that when it comes \nto our economy? How can we disagree that we should want the smartest, \nhardest working, most talented people on this planet to come here? I, \nfor one, have no fear our country is going to be overrun by Ph.Ds. I \nhave no fear this country is going to be overrun by nuclear physicists \nand inventors and entrepreneurs. We have to create a system where that \ncan happen in a rational, organized, and legal way. That is what we are \nattempting to do because that is not what we have right now in the \nUnited States.\n  What we have, in fact, is a system--and Senator Hatch has discussed \nthis. It was startling when I heard this. Yearly, our Nation has a \ndemand for 120,000 computer science engineers, but our universities \nonly produce 40,000 people a year. This is an indictment of our \neducational system. We need to fix that. We need to get to a point in \nthis country where we have 120,000 people graduating to meet the \ndemand. But in the short term--right now--we have to deal with the fact \nthat if those 80,000 graduates for those jobs are not created here, \nthose jobs are still going to exist; they are just not going to exist \nhere. Those companies are not going to wait for us to produce more \ngraduates. These countries are not going to wait for us to fix our \nimmigration system. They have a business to run. If they can't find the \npeople they need to fill these jobs, they will send those jobs to \nanother country.\n  What that means in practical terms is these high-paying jobs in these \nindustries will be paying the taxes in some other country, will be \nstimulating the economy in some other country, will be laying down \nroots in some other nation. Do people want to know why one of the \nreasons America is special? Because for over 200 years we have been a \ncollection of the world's best and brightest, a magnet that attracts \npeople here. Now we have an immigration system that in the 21st century \nis making that very difficult to achieve. That is what this effort \ndoes.\n  The other concern I have heard is what about the folks in this \ncountry now. This is a legitimate concern.\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\nWhen people raise it, I don't get upset because it is a very legitimate \nconcern: The kids who are born here and raised here and go into these \nindustries, will they be hurt? As we have seen, the need far exceeds \nwhat we are producing, so that is not an immediate concern. But here is \nthe other, and that is the startling figure that was used earlier; that \nfor every 100 foreign-born STEM workers, we are creating 260-some-odd \njobs. It is indisputable that these jobs create jobs for people right \ndown the line in this process. If someone is an entrepreneur who is an \nimmigrant, they create jobs for all kinds of people, and most of them \nwere born here. If someone creates some new technology or develops it, \nthey create jobs and opportunities for people who work here, live here, \nand were born here. This is a net positive for our economy. That is why \nthis issue is so critical to be confronted.\n  By the way, as we talk about meeting the demand with our entire \nimmigration system, we can't modernize America's legal immigration \nsystem if we don't have a way to get the world's best and brightest to \ncome here in a way that is expedient and in a way that is cost-\neffective, in a way that is safe, and in a way that is legal. That is \nwhat we are attempting to do.\n  This bill is not in competition with any other effort; it compliments \nit. In fact, it is an indispensable part of it. We cannot \ncomprehensively reform America's legal immigration system if it does \nnot include VISA provisions for graduates in science, technology, \nengineering, and math.\n  My final point: It makes no sense to invite people to come to the \nUnited States, to study at our universities, to become the best and \nbrightest in the world at their subject matter, and then ask them to \nleave. Think about that for a moment. We tell people: Come to America. \nWe are going to let you go to our best schools and teach you everything \nwe know and then we want you to go somewhere else and use the knowledge \nyou gained here. That is crazy. That is not just nonsensical, it is \ncrazy. We can't keep doing that. Hopefully, we will begin to change it \nnow.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with all the folks involved with this \neffort. The leadership of Senator Hatch has been extraordinary, as well \nas that of Senator Klobuchar. We have a good group working together. \nOur final colleague who has been a part of this, and an indispensable \none, who has also worked in the context of another piece of legislation \nwhich we are hopeful to get moving soon--startup 2.0--which is an issue \nfor another day, we are obviously interested in hearing from Senator \nCoons from Delaware about this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the opportunity to \nwork with the Senator from Florida on this legislation and other \nlegislation we are focused on about how to create jobs and how to drive \nour economy forward. I am grateful for the leadership of Senator Hatch \nand Senator Klobuchar as well as for their companionship as we serve \ntogether on the Judiciary Committee and as the four of us this day \nintroduce this bill of which we are so proud, the Immigration \nInnovation Act of 2013.\n  For decades, the United States enjoyed the commanding advantage of \nbeing home to all the world's top universities, particularly in science \nand technology, engineering and math, and the so-called STEM fields; \nand we were the best place for the graduates of those universities and \ntheir advanced science programs to stay and launch a new business.\n  But today that field has changed. Our competitors are vying to \nprovide more supportive environments for innovators, inventions, and \nstartup companies. There has been a sea change in the field of \nopportunity back home for those foreign nationals who, in increasing \nnumbers, are educated in the United States and whom we then force to \nreturn to their nation of origin.\n  Even though many of the most talented young people from around the \nglobe still pour into the United States to obtain their master's or \ndoctoral degrees in STEM, now more than ever they are not just tempted \nto take their education home with them and start businesses elsewhere, \nbut they are attracted by their home countries and forced by our \noutdated immigration system. What an unwise way to compete in the \nglobal economy. Our outdated immigration system hasn't adapted to the \nmodern world.\n  Half of all master's and doctoral degrees in STEM fields at American \nuniversities are today earned by foreign-born students who then face an \nuncertain, expensive, and unwieldy path to pursuing their dreams in the \nUnited States. Our country is hemorrhaging innovations and the \ninventors who make them and the jobs that come with them because \nAmerica's immigration laws have failed to keep up with the demands of \nthe modern age. We cannot afford to keep educating the world's \nbrightest students at our leading universities which, I will remind my \ncolleagues, are subsidized by U.S. tax dollars and American charitable \ngiving, and then tell them they cannot repay those investments by \ncontributing to the U.S. workforce. It is both bad policy and bad \nbusiness.\n\n  That is why I have been working on this issue since I arrived in the \nSenate, introducing three bills and calling for the creation of a new \nclass of green card for immigrants who have earned an advanced STEM \ndegree from American universities.\n  I was especially glad to see the bipartisan framework released \nyesterday by Senators McCain, Schumer, Rubio, and others, which moves \nus toward comprehensive immigration reform and embraces this vital core \npremise. I also welcome President Obama's contributions to this \ndiscussion and look forward to hearing what he has to say today in Las \nVegas.\n  There is, indeed, broad bipartisan agreement that it is long past \ntime to reform our immigration system to make room for foreign-born, \nAmerican-educated experts who want to apply their skills, start \nbusinesses, and raise their families here. At the same time, we have to \ndramatically improve STEM education available to American citizens to \nfill this dramatic gap in these fields. As Senator Hatch said just a \nfew minutes ago, if we take the example of computer science, by 2020, \nthe U.S. economy will need 120,000 men and women to fill these jobs. \nYet just 40,000 graduates with degrees in computer science will be \nAmericans. How to fill that gap?\n  The bipartisan legislation we introduce today tackles both sides of \nthis problem, by reforming our outdated immigration system to allow \nhighly skilled engineers and researchers to stay, rather than leaving \nand taking their jobs and future opportunities with them and by \nfunneling the hundreds of millions of dollars in fees these experts pay \nfor their green cards back into improving U.S.-based STEM education. It \nis a win-win.\n  The Immigration Innovation Act of 2013 will open the door, will \nrecapture unused green cards, and will move away from the outdated \nmodel of country caps and overall caps to better compete with countries \nsuch as our neighbors to the north in Canada where these caps don't \nexist, and where Microsoft is eager to open a new massive development \nfacility at our expense and loss.\n  One of the most important parts of this legislation, as I mentioned, \nis that we are using fees from these newly expanded H-1B visas and \ngreen cards to fund State initiatives on STEM. This will keep America \nat the cutting edge of science and technology and fuel economic growth \nfor this country and generations to come.\n  While each of the coauthors of this legislation have made substantial \ncontributions, I am especially grateful to Senator Hatch of Utah for \nhis leadership.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah to tell us a little bit more about \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Coons, Senator \nKlobuchar, and Senator Rubio. As my colleagues can see, it is a real \npleasure to work with these three partners and others as well. I \nparticularly wish to thank each of my colleagues for the helpful \noverview they have given on this bill. It has been a real pleasure for \nme to work with these three very innovative leaders in the Senate.\n  As a number of my colleagues have mentioned, by eliminating per-\ncountry\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\nlimits for employment-based green cards, recapturing lost employment-\nbased immigrant visas, exempting certain classes of immigrants from the \nannual green card limit, and creating a new and sustainable funding \nstream to enhance the U.S. STEM education pipeline, we will help \nAmerica's innovative industries recruit and retain high-skilled talent \nto more effectively compete in today's global marketplace, and it will \nmake us more competitive.\n  We have heard from many industry stakeholders that support the I-\nSquared Act of 2013. To date, we have received letters of support from \nthe following organizations that support this bill: Microsoft, Oracle, \nIntel, IBM, Hewlett-Packard Company, Facebook, Texas Instruments, \nQualcomm, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, BSA The Software Alliance, Compete America, the \nSemiconductor Industry Association, TechNet, the Technology Association \nof America, the Consumer Electronics Association, the Software and \nInformation Industry Association, the Internet Association, the \nComputer and Communications Industry Association, the Information \nTechnology Industry Council, the Information Technology and Innovation \nFoundation, TechServe Alliance, the Association for Competitive \nTechnology, the Telecommunications Industry Association, CTIA--The \nWireless Association, Sabre Holdings, the Council of Chief State School \nOfficers, and just to mention one other, Immigration Voice.\n  Mr. President, working with Senators Klobuchar, Rubio, and Coons, I \nhave to say is a real privilege for me. These are three very fine \nadditions to the Senate. In the case of Senator Klobuchar and Senator \nCoons, they are two respected members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand Senator Rubio, in my view, is one of the most knowledgeable \nSenators we have on immigration policy and, as we can see, a terrific \nleader in so many other ways. We send a strong message that both sides \nof the aisle can come together to craft bipartisan legislation to \naddress one of our country's most urgent economic needs.\n  Yesterday, eight of our colleagues unveiled a framework to overhaul \nour Nation's immigration system. I am proud of them. I commend them for \ntheir willingness to work in a bipartisan way to reform our immigration \nlaws. It is very much needed. One of the leaders is, of course, our own \nSenator Rubio, as well as Senator Schumer and Senator McCain, and \nothers as well whom I hate to not mention, but I think my colleagues \nget the point. Similarly, the work of Senators Klobuchar, Rubio, Coons, \nand I have done in crafting the I-Squared Act of 2013 was no easy task \nand represents hours of negotiations with interested stakeholders and \nhas garnered, as my colleagues can see, widespread industry support.\n  The I-Squared Act makes sense. I hope our language to reform the \nhigh-skilled immigration system is considered by this body in the \nimmediate future. I would surely like to hear a little bit more from \nSenator Klobuchar, if she would care to make some additional points. I \ndon't mean to take all the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind words. \nI wanted to actually follow up a little bit with Senator Rubio's \nanalogy on the teams and the sports because I did note he mentioned \nbasketball and baseball but not hockey. As my colleagues know, \nMinnesota is a State of hockey. In fact, we are very happy the NHL is \nback playing again and that our team The Wild is playing. I actually \nlooked at some of the numbers similar to what Senator Rubio was talking \nabout and, in fact, a significant number of our players on our \nprofessional hockey team come from other countries. As my colleagues \nknow, there are a lot of Canadian hockey players and players from all \nover the world in all these sports.\n  You wonder: Why is that? With all the talk about immigration backlogs \nand the visa shortages, you wonder how all these great athletes are \ncontributing to our teams. The answer is, there is no cap on visas for \nathletes. Again, there is no limit on how many athletes can come over \nand play on our sports teams. As a result, athletes from across the \nglobe can compete here, and we have the best sports leagues in the \nworld.\n  Why shouldn't we apply the same principles to engineering, to \ninnovation, to science, to medical development? That is what we should \nbe doing. In this bill, we do have some caps. But we are raising those \ncaps because we think it is time to compete with the rest of the world.\n  Immigrants have always played a crucial role in these disciplines in \nthe United States. In fact--and this was an interesting statistic we \ngot--of the U.S. Nobel Prize winners, 30 percent of them, I say to \nSenator Hatch, have been immigrants--30 percent of them.\n  One of those was Mario Capecchi. He was born in Italy in 1937. His \nmother survived a Nazi concentration camp and was eventually able to \nbring him to the United States. In 2007, he won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine for his work on altering genes in mice through the use of stem \ncells. Obviously, this is an exciting area of work that gives us great \nhope to solve many diseases.\n  Medtronic, a Minnesota institution that has pioneered medical devices \nfor years, started in a garage and was started by the child of an \nimmigrant.\n  So why would we want to prevent the next person who would come in who \ncould cure cancer, who would create a new energy source, who would \nbring in new means of communication to our country? This bill is about \nmoving our country forward. This bill is about competing in the world \neconomy. If we can do it in baseball, in basketball, and I would add, I \nsay to Senator Rubio, hockey, we can do it in engineering, science, \ntechnology, and math.\n  I thank my colleagues and turn it over to Senator Rubio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, let the Record reflect I did not mean to \noffend hockey fans. On the contrary, we have two hockey teams, the \nFlorida Panthers and the Lightning in the Tampa Bay area, which \nactually has won the Stanley Cup before, and the Florida Panthers were \nin the playoffs last year. So we like hockey too. We cannot play it \noutdoors in Florida. But in any event, I think the point is well taken \nthat we do want the best and brightest.\n  The one point I wish to make is the one point I have picked up on, on \nthe immigration issue, in general, over the last 24 to 48 hours; that \nis, how important it is that accurate information reach the American \npeople about what it is we are working on and what it is we are not \nworking on.\n  Immigration is a complicated issue. We hear a lot of discussion about \nimmigration. I will have more to say about it later today. But \nimmigration is a complicated process. The one we have now is \ncomplicated. It is important for people to understand what it is we are \ntrying to do and what it is not. I think that is true for the entire \nissue of immigration but particularly important for this one.\n  To that end, I guess I wish to issue a public challenge to the \ncompanies that in the past have gotten engaged in the public discourse \nand in the public debate on issues that involve the issues of \ntechnology.\n  Just a few months ago--and it is a sore spot in some places, I \nimagine--we had this issue of SOPA and PIPA and all these other things \nthat were going to impact the freedom of the Internet and the freedom \nof communicating online, and a lot of groups got involved to speak \nabout that and to try to clear up the record about what they were for \nand what they were against.\n  I hope they will do the same thing on this. I hope they will use the \nplatforms on this to openly discuss what this is about.\n  I guess this is a challenge to the Facebooks and the Googles and the \nTwitters of the world: Get engaged in letting people know what is at \nstake. If we like these innovations that have radically changed the way \nwe live in this country--just think about this for a moment. If a \ndecade ago we would tell someone we are going to Google them, they \nwould be offended because that did not mean anything a decade ago. Now \nit means something. If we were to say a decade ago that we were going \nto tweet something, people would look at us funny. Now it actually \nmeans something.\n  These are innovations that happened in America that have not only \nchanged the way we live and made our lives\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\nmore interesting and in some ways more productive but are transforming \nthe world.\n  Think about the political movements here and around the world. There \nwas a time when one could not even engage in public discourse in \nAmerica if they did not have an organization to back them. Now any \nsingle individual can become the leader of a movement fairly quickly by \nusing the platforms that have been created by innovators.\n  A disproportionate number of the people who develop this stuff are \nimmigrants or the children of immigrants or children or people we have \ntrained in this country who, thank God, we did not send back home.\n  We have a chance to do that, and I hope those who have a vested \ninterest in this issue passing will use the platforms they own and \noperate to clearly inform the American people about what is at stake on \nthe issue of immigration as a whole but in particular on this issue of \nhigh-skill immigration.\n  I guess for some additional thoughts, I wish to turn it over to \nSenator Coons, who has a unique insight into innovation. We worked on \nthe Startup 2.0. I will plug it again because it is an important piece \nof legislation we would like to get done fairly soon. A lot of it is \nbased on investor visas and things of that nature.\n  I think Senator Coons has more to add about our effort here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I say to Senator Coons, would the Senator \nyield just for a moment for a compliment?\n  Mr. COONS. Certainly. I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I just wish to compliment my colleague \nfrom Florida. As I gave a number of interviews yesterday on his \ninitiatives with regard to comprehensive immigration--not to speak of \nthe issue at hand, more about the specialized necessity of visas, but \non overall comprehensive immigration, which I certainly favor and have \nvoted for in the past--a huge step was taken because of the initiative \nof a number of courageous Senators, among whom I would include my \ncolleague from Florida.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Florida in thanking \nand recognizing the junior Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio, for his \ngreat work on the issues of job creation and innovation through Startup \n2.0 and other bills we have worked on together but also through the \ncomprehensive framework that was released yesterday. The framework \nreleased by Senators Schumer, McCain, Rubio, and others takes the right \napproach to ensuring that the United States has a modern, efficient, \neffective, and compassionate immigration system.\n\n  I was glad to see it addressed family-based immigration challenges, \nincluding creating an expedited path to citizenship for young people \nbrought here as children through no fault of their own--people we \nrightly call DREAMers.\n  While the Immigration Innovation Act we are introducing today \nrecognizes the vital, the critical contributions immigrants have made \nand will continue to make in highly technical fields, we also must \nrecognize the essential contributions immigrants make along the entire \nlabor spectrum, across the whole breadth of this country--to building \nup this country in the past and to giving it a brighter future.\n  As you heard from Senator Klobuchar before, if Team USA is to play \ncompetitively globally, we need the best and the brightest contributors \nto our future. Why would we educate the best inventors and innovators \nin the world and send many of them back to compete against us from \nother countries rather than embracing them and allowing them to invent, \nto invest, and create companies and jobs in the United States?\n  While I am eager to move ahead on family-focused reform, I am equally \neager to have us move ahead with reform for STEM degree holders. \nComprehensive immigration reform is a necessity for the hard-working \npeople of Delaware and around the country, for those who want nothing \nmore than to play by the rules, build a better life for their children, \nand contribute to the American dream.\n  That is what any of us would want, the chance to work hard, to see \nour children grow up happy and healthy, with the education and \nopportunities that make their dreams come true, and to contribute to a \nstronger America.\n  That is why I am committed to a comprehensive overhaul of our \nimmigration system, one that supports children and families, as well as \nour economy and our vital technology sector, and that welcomes \nimmigrants into the rich fabric of this country, as the United States \nhas done since our founding.\n  As someone who trained in chemistry, as someone who worked for a \nhigh-technology, materials-based science company, as someone who met \njust yesterday with a Delaware company complaining of the challenges \nthat visa caps and limits place on their ability to do research and \ndevelopment and to compete in the global economy, I am grateful for the \nleadership Senator Hatch and Senator Klobuchar and Senator Rubio have \nshown in crafting this piece--this vital piece--of the total picture of \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I say to Senator Hatch, does the Senator have some closing comments \nas we conclude this colloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to particularly thank my \ncolleagues--Senator Coons and Senator Rubio and Senator Klobuchar--for \ntheir work on this bill. It is obvious from their statements here today \nthey have a great deal of commitment to these important issues.\n  I-squared is a commonsense approach to ensuring that those who have \ncome to be educated in our American universities have the ability to \nstay with their families and contribute to our economy and our society.\n  This bill is good for workers, it is good for businesses trying to \ngrow, and it is good for our economy.\n  I am pleased with the momentum we already have seen on this bill \nthrough industry support and within the Senate itself.\n  I am pleased to announce that Senators Flake, Shaheen, Heller, \nBlumenthal, Hoeven, Nelson, and Warner have agreed to be original \ncosponsors of the I-Squared Act, and I encourage many more of my \ncolleagues to support and help pass this bill. It is long overdue. It \nis well thought out. We have run it by the top people in this country. \nFrankly, it has a lot of support so far. We have not even gone out and \ntried to get cosponsors, and they are starting to come naturally. I \nhope we can get the Senate to call up this bill. Of course, I think we \nare all interested in going beyond this bill too, in doing true \nimmigration reform that will help our country to continue to maintain \nitself as the greatest country in the world.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues. This has been a real privilege to \nserve with them on the floor today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to recognize the heritage of recreational fishing, \nhunting, and recreational shooting on Federal public land and ensure \ncontinued opportunities for those activities; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nbipartisan Recreational Fishing and Hunting Opportunities Act.\n  My bill is cosponsored by my friend from West Virginia, Senator \nManchin, and is a commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation. It \nenjoys support from over 39 separate organizations from the hunting, \nshooting, recreational fishing and wildlife conservation community. In \naddition, my staff has worked diligently with environmental and \nconservation organizations such as the Wilderness Society and the \nNational Parks Conservation Association to alleviate their concerns \nwith previous versions of the bill by removing references to the \nWilderness Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Furthermore, \nthis legislation specifically exempts National Park Units, National \nWildlife Refuges and land held in trust for the benefit of Native \nAmericans.\n  Our bill would acknowledge the importance of hunting and fishing on \nour BLM lands and in our National Forests by requiring hunting and \nfishing to be recognized activities on those lands. We are talking \nabout traditional American activities, and they are activities that \ndeserve the same consideration as other traditional uses of our public \nlands. Our legislation would establish an ``open unless closed'' policy \nfor recreational hunting, fishing and shooting on BLM and Forest \nService land. It is important to note, though, that this would not give \nthese activities special priority, but merely level the current playing \nfield between these traditional activities and other uses of our public \nlands.\n  I would like to thank Senator Manchin, an original cosponsor of this \nbill, for his and his staff's hard work in moving this bill forward. It \nis our hope that this bill will receive quick but careful consideration \nas many sportsmen across this country have been eagerly awaiting \npassage of this measure for quite a long time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/29/senate-section/article/S367-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 20--DESIGNATING CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON \n                           FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.
