Mr. President, I just indicated the Senate will vote today \nfor a second time to move forward on the nomination of Senator Chuck \nHagel, a Republican, serving as Secretary of Defense. Twelve days ago, \nthe Republicans mounted a first-of-its-kind filibuster of Senator \nHagel's confirmation. Senator Hagel is the first nominee for Secretary \nof Defense in the history of our country to have been filibustered. And \nwhat has the filibuster gained my Republican colleagues 12 days later? \nNothing. Nothing has changed. Twelve days later Senator Hagel's \nexemplary record of service to his country remains untarnished.\n  I can still remember going to visit Senator Hagel in his office. I \ndon't remember what we were to discuss, but it was something dealing \nwith Senate business. As I walked into his office, I saw a picture of \ntwo young men on a mechanized vehicle in Vietnam. I asked what that \nwas, and his staff indicated those were the Hagel brothers and their \ntime together serving in Vietnam. They had both been wounded--Senator \nChuck Hagel more than once--and Chuck Hagel was also credited with \nsaving his brother's life in Vietnam. And this is the person who is \ngoing to be our next Secretary of Defense.\n  I repeat: His record of service to his country is untarnished. And 12 \ndays later President Obama's support for this qualified nominee is \nstill strong. Twelve days later a majority of Senators still supports \nhis confirmation.\n  Senate Republicans have delayed for the better part of 2 weeks for \none reason: partisanship. At a time when our Nation faces threats \nabroad--and that is an understatement--the President's nominee for \nSecretary of Defense deserves a fair and constructive confirmation \nprocess. Politically motivated delays send a terrible signal to our \nallies around the world and they send a terrible signal to the tens of \nthousands of Americans serving in Afghanistan, other parts of the \nworld, and those valiant people who are serving here in the United \nStates. For the sake of national security, it is time to set aside this \npartisanship.\n\n  In 3 days, across-the-board cuts to the Defense Department are \nscheduled to take effect. The Pentagon needs a seasoned leader to \nimplement these cuts. Democrats are working hard to avert the worst of \nthese arbitrary cuts--cuts for which an overwhelming majority of \nRepublicans in Congress voted. The so-called sequester was supported by \n174 Republicans in the House of Representatives and 28 Republicans here \nin the Senate--60 percent and 75 percent of the two Republican bodies \nin this Congress.\n  We have a balanced proposal to replace those across-the-board cuts \nfor this year with smart spending reductions, which must continue; \nmeasures\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\nthat would close corporate tax loopholes and wasteful subsidies; and \nrevenue from the very wealthiest among us--Americans making millions of \ndollars each year.\n  It is critical Republicans and Democrats come together to find a \nbalanced way to avert these drastic cuts. The consequence of the so-\ncalled sequester cuts is real, not only for our national defense but \nfor millions of American families and businesses alike. Three-quarters \nof a million jobs--750,000 jobs--are at stake. Across the country, tens \nof thousands of teachers, including thousands who work with disabled \nchildren, would be laid off; 70,000 children would be dropped from Head \nStart; 373,000 adults living with serious mental illnesses and children \ndealing with severe emotional problems will go untreated.\n  Airports could close due to a shortage of air traffic controllers and \nother essential personnel. And lines at airports that do stay open will \nstretch out the door, as TSA workers are furloughed.\n  At McCarran Airport in Las Vegas last year more than 40 million \npeople used that airport in coming to visit the bright lights of Las \nVegas, the Las Vegas strip and downtown Las Vegas. Those lines are \ngoing to get longer, waiting to take off from Las Vegas. That is too \nbad.\n  From coast to coast hundreds of thousands of civilian employees from \nthe Department of Defense will face furloughs that will devastate their \nfamilies and devastate our economy. These cuts will take place.\n  On Friday, when this kicks in, not everyone is going to see these \ncuts on Saturday, but they are going to kick in for the people who run \nthese agencies, the people who run the Pentagon. I met with the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before we left for our break. \nThese cuts are going to take place. They are going to be felt in \nDefense more quickly because the civilian agencies have not rehired the \npeople they could have, and they have done other things because of the \nessential nature of what the military does. They haven't done that, so \nthe cuts in the military are going to kick in more quickly. The other \ncuts are not going to come immediately, but as the weeks move on, we \nwill see more and more people who have been hurt in the nondefense \nfields. The effects are cumulative and they are going to hurt and hurt \nbadly.\n  We want to work with the Republicans to come to a balanced, \nresponsible way to reduce the impact of this sequester, but my \nRepublican colleagues are standing in the way of a solution. They only \nwant cuts and more cuts. They are willing to sacrifice 750,000 American \njobs rather than ask multimillionaires to pay a penny more.\n  Mr. President, 56 percent--almost 60 percent--of the Republicans \naround the country support this balanced approach we have. Republicans, \nI repeat, around the country support this, in addition to the \nIndependents and the Democrats. The only Republicans in America who \ndon't support this balanced approach are the Republicans who serve here \nin Congress--in the Senate and in the House.\n  Three-quarters of Americans, I repeat, including almost 60 percent of \nRepublicans, are crying out for a balanced approach. With only 3 days \nleft to protect American families and our economic recovery from this \nlatest crisis, it is time for Republicans to work toward a solution \ninstead of being part of the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S820-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to say a word about the \nsequester.\n  The President's top aides proposed this sequester as a way to help \nthe White House avoid a debt limit debate during last year's campaign. \nIn essence, the deal we struck was that in exchange for avoiding a \nsecond vote before the election, the debt limit would be paired with \nspending cuts only--spending cuts only--and would not involve a tax \nincrease.\n  The President had more than a year and a half to revisit his proposal \nand to work with us to prevent it. He obviously thought his time and \nenergies would be better spent elsewhere. In fact, I note that today he \nis off campaigning again in Virginia instead of working with us to \nresolve the issue.\n  So here we are. Here we are. The President has been running around \nacting as though the world is going to end because Congress might \nactually follow through on an idea he proposed--he proposed--and signed \ninto law, all the while pretending he is somehow powerless to stop it. \nWell, it is time to put the record straight. As someone who was \npersonally involved in the 2011 budget talks, I think I am in a pretty \ngood position to do that.\n  On the question of who came up with the idea in the first place, it \noriginated, as I noted, in the White House. I was less than 100 yards \nfrom this very spot when Vice President Biden called me at my desk to \nlay it out. He explained the sequester in exquisite detail. And then, \nas has been reported, the administration stubbornly stuck by those \ndetails throughout the negotiations, refusing any effort by Republicans \nto adjust the design in any meaningful way.\n  More important than who came up with the idea of the sequester, \nhowever, is the fact the bipartisan agreement that included it, and \nthat brought us to this point, envisioned $2.1 trillion in spending \ncuts. That is what we voted for in August of 2011. Democrats and \nRepublicans agreed to $2.1 trillion in spending reductions as part of \nthe 2011 Budget Control Act.\n  So we can all go back and talk about what might have been or what the \nPresident wanted or what he now wants, but let us be clear about the \nfacts. Those cuts were to come in two steps: First, through an \nimmediate $900 billion spending reduction in the form of budget caps, \nand then by an additional $1.2 trillion in cuts to be achieved in one \nof two ways, either by the so-called supercommittee or, if that failed, \nthrough the President's sequester proposal, meaning automatic spending \ncuts to both domestic and defense programs.\n  While the President tried repeatedly to make tax hikes a part of the \nbackup plan, he ultimately gave up on that in exchange for avoiding a \nsecond vote on the debt limit before his election. The President made a \ndeliberate decision to give up on getting any tax hikes or revenue \nenhancements, or whatever the White House wants to call it, as part of \nnegotiations over the sequester mechanism. He made the calculation that \navoiding a second vote on the debt limit before the election was more \nimportant.\n  So any effort to bring taxes into the picture now is a ploy to move \nthe goalpost, as the primary chronicler of this whole episode, Bob \nWoodward, has noted.\n  Of course, the White House has tried to refute those historical \nfacts, but it hasn't gotten anywhere because we know what happened.\n  As the chairman of the Finance Committee helpfully reminded us last \nweek, ``The President is part of the sequester'' because ``the White \nHouse recommended it . . . and so now we're feeling the effects of \nit.''\n  So it is time for the administration to at least accept reality so we \ncan all move forward and focus on what the White House is actually \ndoing right now. It is asking the American people for permission to \nbreak its word on spending.\n  Look, we reached an agreement to cut $2.1 trillion in government \nspending over 10 years, and we intend to keep our word. Should these \ncuts be implemented in a smarter way? You bet. But the President and \nhis Cabinet Secretaries had a year and a half to think about that. They \njust can't show up now at the last minute and expect the American \npeople to bail them out of their own lack of responsibility.\n  We can either secure these reductions more intelligently or we can do \nit the President's way with across-the-board cuts. But one thing \nAmericans simply will not accept is another tax increase to replace \nspending reductions to which we already agreed.\n  It was my hope that the supercommittee would succeed. The Senators I \nappointed took their assignments very seriously. They put real skin in \nthe game because they wanted it to work. They didn't like the sequester \nidea either. Had the President engaged in a\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\nserious and supportive way at that time, the supercommittee may well \nhave succeeded. But he was busy. He was campaigning and, I would argue, \nundermining the process instead.\n  But even after the supercommittee failed, Republicans continued to \nwork to find another way to achieve these spending cuts. We repeatedly \ncalled for replacing the sequester with smarter cuts rather than tax \nhikes, according to the original pact. House Republicans actually \npassed two bills to do just that. But again, instead of engaging with \nus, the President just set up more roadblocks. For more than 1 year, he \nresisted and dismissed every Republican attempt at a compromise. He \nrefused to offer any kind of reasonable alternative, and he even \nthreatened to veto other proposals aimed at averting the sequester.\n  Now here we are, with the President presenting the country with two \noptions: Armageddon or a tax hike. Well, it is a false choice, and he \nknows it, but the President is a master at creating the impression of \nchaos as an excuse for government action--do nothing, fan the flames of \ncatastrophe, and then claim the only way out is more government in the \nform of higher taxes.\n  Look, the choice we face isn't between the sequester and tax hikes. \nRemember, we are only talking about cutting 2 to 3 percent of the \nbudget. Any business owner or middle-class parent will tell you it is \ncompletely ridiculous to think Washington can't find a better way to \ncut 2 or 3 percent of the Federal budget at a time when we are $16 \ntrillion in debt. Every single working American had to figure out how \nto make ends meet with 2 percent less in their paychecks just last \nmonth when the payroll tax holiday expired. Are you telling me \nWashington can't do the same? It is absurd. It is utterly absurd.\n  There is no reason in the world these cuts need to fall on essential \nservices or emergency responders. After all, even with the sequester, \nWashington will be spending more than when President Obama got here. We \nare only talking about cutting one-tenth of what the President spent on \nthe stimulus bill. Enough. Enough.\n  Step 1 in this process of getting to a serious solution is to end the \nWhite House's denial of historical reality. We are starting to get \nthere, slowly but surely. More important, though, is the next step, and \nthat is when the President and his Democratic allies actually come to \nthe table and negotiate in a serious way, without gimmicks and without \ngames, on how best to reduce Washington spending. So let's shelve the \ntax hikes and the endless campaigning.\n  Finally, I think there is an even larger point to be made. The \nPresident has been going around warning of utter chaos if the sequester \ntakes effect. While I agree that those cuts could be made in a much \nsmarter way and I don't like the fact that they fall disproportionately \non defense, what does it say about the size of government that we can't \ncut it by 2 or 3 percent without inviting disaster? Doesn't that really \nmake our point? Hasn't government gotten too big if just cutting the \noverall budget by a couple of percentage points could have that kind of \nan impact? Personally, I don't believe the world will end if the \nPresident's sequester takes effect, but our country would be much \nbetter served if the Democrats who run Washington would get off the \ncampaign trail and work with us to trim the budget in a more rational \nway.\n  Americans are tired of the manufactured crises. I know my \nconstituents in Kentucky are. It is simply time. They want us to work \ntogether, and Republicans are ready to do just that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the \nmotion to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture \nwas not invoked on the nomination is agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider is agreed to.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12 noon will be equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe it is now time for us to vote on \nthe Hagel nomination.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Excuse me. Would the Senator from Michigan yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course.\n  MR. INHOFE. It is my understanding that we have equally divided our \ntime between now and noon. That is about 1 hour 40 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent, on the Republican side, that I be given the first 10 \nminutes and the last 15 minutes of our Republican time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is now time for us to vote up or down on \nthe nomination, for many reasons.\n  The nomination has been before us for an adequate length of time for \nus to get the information our colleagues have asked for, but also there \nis the looming fact of sequestration. We need to have a Secretary of \nDefense who is not only in office but whose leadership is not in limbo \nbut is there. Our troops need it. Their families need it. Our country \nneeds it.\n  As of today we have 66,000 military personnel in harm's way in \nAfghanistan. The President of Afghanistan has just directed the United \nStates to remove its special operations forces from a key Afghan \nprovince. Our military faces key decisions about the pace of the \ndrawdown between now and the end of 2014, the size and composition of a \nresidual force, and the terms and conditions for the ongoing presence \nin Afghanistan of the United States and our coalition partners after \n2014.\n  At the same time we face new and growing threats elsewhere, including \nthe ongoing threat posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program and the \nincreasingly destructive civil war in Syria, with the risk that that \nconflict could result in the loss of control over that country's \nsubstantial stockpile of chemical weapons. There is also the growing \ninstability in other countries affected by the Arab spring; the growth \nof al-Qaida affiliates in ungoverned regions, including parts of Yemen, \nSomalia, north Africa; and the continued unpredictable behavior of the \nnuclear-armed regime in North Korea.\n  We face these challenges at a time when the Department of Defense \nbudget is under unique pressure as a result of cuts previously agreed \nupon by Congress, the budgeting by continuing resolution, and the \nimpending threat of a sequester. These across-the-board cuts will \naffect Defense and just about every other agency we have. Those cuts \nare going to be disastrous in many ways. I hope we can still find ways \nto avoid them, but as of right now the threat of a sequester is a real \none. It is within a few days.\n  The Department of Defense has already instituted civilian hiring \nfreezes, reduced or eliminated temporary and term employees, deferred \nfacilities maintenance, and begun canceling or postponing the \nmaintenance of ships, aircraft, and ground vehicles. In the next few \ndays, the Department will begin to implement additional actions, \nincluding furloughs for most civilian employees, cutbacks in flying \nhours, steaming hours and other military training, and cancellation of \ncontracts. And those contracts, when they are cancelled, have major \ncosts to the Treasury. Those are not savings, except in the short term, \nperhaps. But in\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\nthe long term, we not only lose the equipment and the product of the \ncontracts, but we also have these cancellation costs which will hit the \nTreasury.\n  The result of these looming cuts is truly devastating and it is \nserious. For example, the Army informs us that if sequestration \ncontinues through the end of the fiscal year, two-thirds of its brigade \ncombat teams will fall below acceptable readiness levels. The Air Force \nsays it will not be able to support requirements outside of Afghanistan \nand will experience significant degradation in its airdrop and \nrefueling capabilities. The Navy says the Nimitz and the George H.W. \nBush carrier strike groups will not be ready for scheduled deployments \nlater this year, resulting in an indefinite extension of the Truman and \nEisenhower deployments, with the resulting impact on morale and \nretention.\n  Hundreds of Department of Defense investment programs, acquisition \nprograms, and research and development projects may become unexecutable \nbecause we have insufficient funds to enter needed contracts. By the \nend of the summer, the Department of Defense says it will be unable to \npay its TRICARE bills and will be in a position of having to deny that \ncritical health care service to military members, families, and \nretirees.\n  Our men and women in uniform need a Secretary of Defense to lead them \nthrough these difficult challenges. They need a Secretary of Defense to \ndefend their interests in the budget battles we know are about to come. \nThey need a Secretary of Defense to speak out and ensure that Congress \nand the country understand the consequences of sequester and, if the \nsequester cannot be avoided, to help them avoid the worst of those \nconsequences and to end the impacts as quickly as possible. Now, as \nmuch as anytime in the recent past, is not a time when we can afford to \nleave the Department of Defense with leadership that is in limbo.\n  Information has been requested, appropriately, by colleagues about \nthe nominee. Information has been provided to the best of the nominee's \nability. This information falls into two categories: requests for \nSenator Hagel's speeches and requests for additional financial \ndisclosure.\n  With regard to the speeches, Senator Hagel and his team have \nconducted an exhaustive review and have provided us with all of the \nspeeches available to them--not only the prepared statements requested \nin our committee questionnaire but also transcripts and even videos of \nspeeches he has been able to obtain from outside sources. Before the \nrecess, I placed in the Record links to several other speeches that had \nsurfaced on the Internet.\n  In recent days, Senator Hagel has received additional requests for \nspeeches in the exclusive control of the Washington Speakers Bureau and \nfor access to his senatorial archives at the University of Nebraska.\n  On the first point, the Washington Speakers Bureau has informed \nSenator Hagel and the Department of Defense that all speeches given \nunder its auspices are ``private, off the record, and not recorded''--\nexcept in rare cases where a customer requests that a recording be kept \nfor archival purposes only. Further, the Department of Defense informs \nus that the Washington Speakers Bureau will not provide any recordings \nof speeches that were given by Senator Hagel or even confirm which of \nits clients may have recorded speeches. Since neither Senator Hagel nor \nthe Department of Defense has access to these speeches, they cannot be \nprovided to the Senate.\n  On the second point, the University of Nebraska holds title to \nSenator Hagel's archives. The University has publicly stated that once \nthe archives are processed and indexed according to the standards of \nthe Society of American Archivists, they will be open to the public. \nUntil that time, the archives will not be open to the public. Again, \nsince neither Senator Hagel nor DOD has access to these materials, they \ncannot provide them to us. It is also worth noting that these archives \ncover the period of Senator Hagel's service in the Senate. Senator \nHagel has an extensive record of speeches and votes during this period \nthat are readily accessible to the Senate and the public through the \nCongressional Record and other official documents.\n\n  With regard to financial disclosure, Senator Hagel has complied with \nthe same disclosure requirements and conflict of interest rules that \nhave applied to at least the last eight Secretaries of Defense and to \nhundreds of other nominees for senior DOD positions over the course of \nthe last five administrations.\n  Despite his compliance with the same disclosure rules that apply to \neverybody else, we have heard innuendos that Senator Hagel is trying to \nhide something. Senator Hagel serves with a number of distinguished \nindividuals on the Board of Advisors of a private equity firm. We had \none Senator suggest, without any evidence, that ``it is, at a minimum, \nrelevant to know'' if the fees that Senator Hagel received for his \nservice on this Board ``came directly from Saudi Arabia, [or] . . . \nfrom North Korea.'' Another Senator suggested that we should postpone a \nvote on the nomination because ``FOX News is going to run a story \ntomorrow regarding some speeches . . . which were made and paid for by \nforeign governments \n. . . [that] may not be friendly to us.'' This story apparently died \nbefore it was aired, because it was apparently based on a hoax.\n  These are unfair innuendos and they have been answered even though \nthey are unfair.\n  Senator Hagel has an extensive record of service to his country. As a \nyoung man, he enlisted in the Army and served with distinction in \nVietnam. He served as the head of the USO, and as the Deputy \nAdministrator of the VA during the Reagan Administration. He was a \nbusinessman. Many of us served with him during his two terms in the \nSenate. Since he left the Senate, he has continued to serve, as co-\nchairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a \nmember of the Defense Policy Board, and a member of the Energy \nDepartment's Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future.\n  Senator Hagel has been endorsed by five former Secretaries of \nDefense, three former Secretaries of State, and six former National \nSecurity Advisors, who served under both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents. He has been endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, and the American Legion. He has received the support of the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, the Foreign Area Officers \nAssociation, and the Non Commissioned Officers Association.\n  Last month, Senator Hagel was endorsed in a letter signed by six \nformer U.S. Ambassadors to Israel, along with dozens of other retired \nsenior diplomats. The letter stated:\n\n       We support, strongly and without qualification, President \n     Obama's nomination of Chuck Hagel to be the next Secretary of \n     Defense. Most of us have known the Senator for a decade or \n     more and consistently have found him to be one of the best \n     informed leaders in the U.S. Congress on national security \n     issues.\n       Senator Hagel's political courage has impressed us all. He \n     has stood and argued publicly for what he believes is best \n     for the United States. Time and again, he has chosen to take \n     the path of standing up for our nation, rather than the path \n     of political expediency. He has always supported the pillars \n     of American foreign policy: a strong military; a robust \n     Atlantic partnership; a commitment to the security of Israel, \n     as a friend and ally; a determination to stop the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons; and the defense of human \n     rights as a core principle of America's role in the world. . \n     . .\n       We urge speedy confirmation of this outstanding American \n     patriot to be the next Secretary of Defense.\n\n  If confirmed, Senator Hagel would be the first former enlisted man, \nand the first veteran of the Vietnam War, to serve as Secretary of \nDefense. This background gives Senator Hagel an invaluable perspective \nnot only with respect to the difficult decisions and recommendations \nthat a Secretary of Defense must make regarding the use of force and \nthe commitment of U.S. troops overseas, but also with respect to the \nday-to-day decisions a Secretary must make to ensure that our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families receive the support and assistance \nthat they need and deserve. It would be a positive message for our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in harm's way around the world \nto know that one of their own holds the highest office in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The President needs to have a Secretary of Defense in whom he has \ntrust, who will give him independent advice,\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\na person of integrity and one who has a personal understanding of the \nconsequences of decisions relative to the use of military force. \nSenator Hagel certainly has those critically important qualifications \nand he is well-qualified to lead the Department of Defense.\n  The vote which is coming at noon is a vote to invoke cloture to end \nthe debate so we can finally, later on today, hopefully, but at some \nfuture hour, finally vote on this important nomination and end the \nsituation where this nominee is in limbo and the leadership of the \nDepartment of Defense is uncertain and in limbo as well. The time has \ncome to vote on the nomination of Senator Hagel, and to do that we must \nend debate and invoke cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I agree with a lot of what \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee has \nsaid. Certainly Senator Hagel has had a brilliant military career. I \nsometimes look at my time in the Army and his time in the Army and mine \nis very unimpressive. That is not what the issue is.\n  I do think it is interesting in the debate we have had on the floor, \nall the time from the Democrats has been talking about his military \nrecord. Nobody disagrees with that. That is a fact. But there are some \nthings that have to come out because they are very significant.\n  First of all, what we are going to vote on at noon is the vote. There \nis not any other vote. The vote after that is merely a simple majority \nand that would be automatic. Those who are expressing where they are on \nthe Hagel nomination must be reflected in the vote that takes place \nnow, the cloture vote at noon today. Our time is equally divided. \nLeadership time did take up some of that so we are a little bit scarce \non time. First, let me make it real clear this is the one vote that \nmakes a difference. If they are able to get 60 votes for the Hagel \nnomination, it is history. It is over.\n  I do wish to say a couple things for clarification before others on \nour side start speaking. One is about the whole idea of a 60-vote \nthreshold. I have been listening to some of the pundits on television. \nOne of my favorites--I will not mention her by name, but she is kind of \nthe leader of the far left on television. I was watching her a couple \ndays ago and she was talking about how this is something that never \nhappened before, we have never had a 60-vote margin on a Cabinet-level \nposition.\n  This is not true. It happens all the time. It is normal. This is how \nsignificant this confirmation vote is. It is not something that would \nmake it go for a long period of time. Actually, I have lists. Later on, \nif there is time, I am going to go over some of these. Kathleen \nSebelius, for example, that was a 60-vote margin; John Bryson for \nSecretary of Commerce, 60-vote margin.\n  Here is an interesting one. Back when President Bush, who was a \nRepublican, was President, he nominated Stephen Johnson to be the EPA \nAdministrator. He was a Republican. The President was a Republican. \nStephen Johnson was a Democrat. Of course the other side was saying, \nno, we are going to demand to have cloture, and they finally did get 61 \nvotes on that; Dirk Kempthorne, same thing, Secretary of the Interior.\n  This idea that this is the first time is just not right. I would \nappreciate it if people would be a little more honest when they are \nlooking at that issue.\n  They also have said we are in the middle of the wars, which we are. I \nam the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. No one is more \nsensitive to it, no one spends more time talking to the troops than I \ndo, and we do need to have confirmed a Secretary of Defense. Leon \nPanetta has said he will serve until such time as one is confirmed. But \nif we go ahead and if this should for some reason not be able to come \nup with 60 votes, I suggest they go ahead and nominate someone else and \nwe will run it through. I would even help them.\n  I called Leon Panetta not too long ago--I guess I should not say this \non the floor--and asked: Why don't you agree to serve again? He has, of \ncourse, family reasons, and I certainly understand he was unable to do \nit. Michele Flournoy, I commented, would be one. I don't agree with her \nphilosophically on a lot of things, but I think she is one who would \nnot be controversial. Ash Carter--we have a number who could be \nconfirmed in a matter of minutes, and I would be right there with them \nin order to help that take place.\n  I do wish to say something about advice and consent. Sometimes people \ndo not understand it. I had someone go back and research this. It \nstarted back in 1787. At the Constitutional Convention they talked \nabout it. Back then they used the term ``approbation or rejection of \nthe Senate.'' It means the same thing. This has been going on for a \nlong period of time. Certainly, in the Federalist Papers, Hamilton \ntalked about it as long as he talked about any other subject. So \n``approbation or rejection of the Senate'' is the rejection language \nthat was used at that time that is advice and consent today.\n  Where are we today? Certainly, the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, from whom we just heard, is one of the \nstrongest supporters of advice and consent who has said: ``It is \nshocking and sad to me that the Senate may vote on this nominee''--it \ndoesn't matter, it could be any nominee--``while Senators are being \ndenied critical, relevant information.''\n  The leader of the Senate has also said many times, he said ``raising \nthe impression that the nominee and the White House have something to \nhide.''\n  This is exactly what now is going on in reverse. It goes on and on \nwith different ones who have stated over and over again the \nsignificance of the role that the Senate has in advice and consent.\n  John Kerry said: What the Senate has to decide is whether it is going \nto stand for the rights of the committees, the rights of advice and \nconsent. The Senators ought to respect the fact that both the chairman \nand ranking members had requests and those requests had not been \nfulfilled.\n  That is exactly what happened. We have one of the new Senators for \nwhom I have a great deal of respect, Senator Cruz. I was talking to him \nlast night. I said: You ought to come down and let them know why it is \nyou are not speaking on this. He said: Look, what else can I do? I have \nrequested over and over and over again for information on our nominee \nfor Secretary of Defense and I have been denied. I have been \nstonewalled. What else can I say?\n  I said--maybe it sounded a little extreme the other day when I said I \nwould walk through fire for the ability of our members on the committee \nto get all the information they are entitled to. Senator Cruz has not \nreceived that information. That is something that I think is very \ncritical.\n  What I want to do, in the short time I have left over--by the way, I \nask unanimous consent, if following me, if Senator Coats could be \nacknowledged for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I have been waiting to \nspeak on this subject.\n  Mr. INHOFE. After the remarks of the Senator from Illinois, I have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection after the Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The problem I had is not with information I had. I didn't \nneed any additional information. I didn't request additional \ninformation. Many of the members on the Republican side of our \ncommittee did not receive the information they asked for. That was the \ncase with Senator Cruz.\n\n  I had a different reason. My reason is that while I think so highly \nof Senator Hagel and the work he did while he was in the Vietnam war--\nhe was, in fact, a hero--I have to also look at nominees and ask what \ntheir philosophy is. Senator Hagel was one of only two who voted \nagainst sanctions for Iran. He was one of only four who voted against \nan effort to designate the Iran Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group, \nand one of only four who refused to sign a letter of solidarity with \nIsrael.\n  The Global Zero movement advocates a nuke-free world. That sounds so \ngood, and it is something President Obama has talked about. He \nwistfully looks to the day when we have a nuke-free world. That sounded \ngood back in the days of the Cold War. I look wistfully\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\nback at the days of the Cold War. Back then we had two superpowers. \nThey were predictable. We knew what they had. Mutual assured \ndestruction meant something to them. Mutually assured destruction \ndoesn't mean much to some people in the Middle East, and I think we all \nunderstand that. So Global Zero sounds good until we realize that we \nhave countries such as Iran--even our nonclassified intelligence says \nit is going to have the nuclear capability and delivery system by 2015. \nI am concerned with that.\n  I was in shock--and, first of all, I have to thank the chairman of \nthe committee because in the years I served on the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have never seen this done before--when the chairman agreed \nto allow Senator Cruz, a member of the committee, to use a video that \nhad the Al Jazeera interview where Senator Hagel agreed with Al \nJazeera's position that Israel has committed war crimes, that Israel \nhas committed sickening slaughter, and that America is the world's \nbully. These are things which concern me about the attitude toward \nIsrael. I understand we can go back and get a lot of people in the past \nto sign a letter, but I have to say that is still very much a concern \nof mine.\n  With that, I will yield the floor to my good friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nIndiana. I rise today to express my support for our former colleague \nChuck Hagel to be America's 24th Secretary of Defense. We hoped Chuck \nHagel would have been named Secretary of Defense 2 weeks ago and could \nhave led the delegation to Brussels last week to meet with our NATO \npartners on the challenges we face in Afghanistan and around the world.\n  Instead, he was subjected to a rare and historic filibuster by the \nother side of the aisle. What a way to give an opportunity to a man of \nChuck Hagel's background to serve our Nation. What we have seen over \nthe past 2 weeks is the cost of apostasy, the cost of breaking with a \nparty, or a leadership, and what it means when their name comes up \nagain for consideration.\n  There is no question that there are some who bear some negative \nfeelings toward Chuck Hagel because of his independence and some of his \nvotes in the past--even his support of President Obama in the last \nPresidential election. But this has been taken to a level I never \nexpected.\n  Chuck Hagel is no stranger to most of us in the Senate. We served \nwith him. I served with him on the Intelligence Committee for 4 years. \nNot once did I have any question about this man's commitment to America \nand its national defense--not once. I watched votes being taken behind \nclosed doors on some very sensitive issues, and I saw Chuck Hagel \nrespond in a nonpartisan way to those votes. I believe, as many have \nsaid on the floor, he is an extraordinary individual who has proven \nwith his life his commitment to this Nation and its defense.\n  He has big shoes to fill with Secretary Leon Panetta leaving. Leon \nPanetta has been an extraordinary public servant and a very close \npersonal friend of mine for years now. The fact that he received a \nunanimous vote to be Secretary of Defense is as solid a tribute as \nanyone can expect in this life of public service. I believe Chuck Hagel \nis up to this task.\n  There is an expression that adversity doesn't build character, it \nreveals it.\n  Chuck Hagel enlisted in the Army and served in Vietnam. He received \ntwo Purple Hearts, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Combat \nInfantryman Badge for his service. Less well known is how he got there. \nHagel was drafted and immediately volunteered for the Army, but he \nlucked out. He was assigned to Europe during the Vietnam war. There \nwasn't much of a war going on in Europe, so this brave, future nominee \nto head the Department of Defense literally told his commanders: I want \nto volunteer to actually go to Vietnam and risk my life.\n  As he recounted it to me, he said: ``The room just stopped.'' This \nwasn't something that many people in Europe saw--in those days an \nenlisted man, who received a safe assignment in Europe, would volunteer \nto go to war. He convinced his leaders to give him that chance and he \nserved alongside his brother Tom in the same unit. He said they saved \neach other's lives more than once, and thankfully they both came home \nsafe to Nebraska. That was the first chapter of Chuck Hagel's public \nservice and his commitment to servicemembers and veterans.\n  A second chapter came in 1981 when President Ronald Reagan appointed \nChuck Hagel Deputy Administrator of the Veterans' Administration. The \nWashington Post speculated at the time of his appointment that Hagel \n``might be expected to toe the company line.'' How wrong they were. He \nwent to work immediately to be an advocate for veterans. He quickly ran \ninto roadblocks while serving Vietnam vets. At one point the head of \nthe VA publicly called Vietnam vets ``crybabies.''\n  After months of unsuccessful attempts to bring attention to the care \nof our veterans, as they deserved, including repeatedly raising the \nissue to the White House, he did the right thing. As a matter of \nprinciple, he resigned in order to bring the poor treatment of veterans \nto light in America.\n  He went on to start Vanguard Cellular, a very large multimillion-\ndollar mobile phone company. He served as president and CEO of the USO, \nwhich brings a smile, a laugh, and some comfort and entertainment to \nour servicemembers around the world.\n  Later, as a U.S. Senator, he shepherded the post-9/11 GI Bill into \nlaw along with fellow veteran Jim Webb. It was a substantial and \noverdue update of the law to ensure that we continue to keep our \ncommitment to veterans. It should not surprise any of us that this \ncommitment is among the reasons so many organizations back Senator \nHagel's nomination, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Iraq \nand Afghanistan Veterans of America, the AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, the American Legion, Military Officers Association of America, \nand the Noncommissioned Officers Association. They recognize that a \nperson of his character is precisely the person we need to head the \nDepartment of Defense.\n\n  When I spoke with Senator Hagel in my office a few weeks ago, he \ndiscussed his views on security challenges around the world, including \nthe challenges to the Pentagon's budget and the Iran nuclear program \nand its threat to peace in the world. It included safeguarding our \nrock-solid commitments to allies such as Israel.\n  I am firmly convinced that Senator Hagel shares President Obama's \ncommitment to addressing these challenges and supporting our allies. He \nis committed to the President's Iran strategy and he voted for many \nmultilateral sanction packages against their nuclear program.\n  My friend from Oklahoma raised one vote when it comes to Iran, but I \nwish to make a record of the fact that Chuck Hagel voted for the Iran \nMissile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1998, the Iran Nonproliferation \nAct of 2000, and the Iran Freedom Support Act of 2006.\n  In his book ``America: Our Next Chapter,'' Chuck Hagel stated that \nIran is a ``state sponsor of terrorism,'' and that it ``provides \nmaterial support to Hezbollah and Hamas.'' Chuck Hagel's public \nstatements and voting record in the Senate demonstrate a strong \ncommitment to Israel, a commitment that the United States-Israeli \nrelationship will grow even stronger in the future.\n  As he said in his book in 2008:\n\n       [a]t its core, there will always be a special and historic \n     bond with Israel exemplified by our continued commitment to \n     Israel's defense.\n\n  He also understands the budget challenges facing the Pentagon. During \nhis testimony to the Armed Services Committee, he said that \nsequestration ``would send a terrible signal to our military and \ncivilian workforce.''\n  On this, and many other issues, Senator Hagel continues to \ndemonstrate a clear-eyed commitment to our core national security \ninterests and a nuanced, personal understanding of the gravity of the \nuse of force. This is not just my judgment; 13 former Secretaries of \nState and Defense and former National Security Advisors wrote to the \nSenate recently, urging Senator Hagel's swift confirmation. The \nsignatories included senior leaders from both parties across several \ndecades of Presidential administrations, such as Robert Gates, Colin \nPowell, Brent Scowcroft, and William Cohen. These\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nmen--all of whom have been part of the responsibility of keeping \nAmerica safe--believe Chuck Hagel, as Secretary of Defense, will do \nexactly that. There are some here who may question that, and this is \ntheir right. But men who have had that responsibility trust Chuck \nHagel, as do I.\n  Let me quote from their letter:\n\n       His approach to national security debates about the use of \n     American power is marked by a disciplined habit of \n     thoughtfulness that is sorely needed and these qualities will \n     serve him well as Secretary of Defense at a time when the \n     United States must address a range of international security \n     issues that are unprecedented in scope.\n\n  Allow me to conclude by pointing to the 2002 interview Chuck Hagel \ngave to the Library of Congress Vietnam History Project. He discussed \nhow he and his brother Tom would volunteer to ``walk point.'' In other \nwords, to watch, be out in front watching for ambushes, booby traps, \nleading his men safely through the day. He said, ``You know what \nhappens to a lot of point men, but I always felt a little better if I \nwas up front than somebody else.''\n  Forty-five years after first walking point for our servicemen in \nVietnam, I hope Chuck Hagel may be out in front again walking point as \nour next Secretary of Defense. We need his wise counsel on matters of \nwar and peace and his rock-solid commitment to our men and women in \nuniform.\n  Let me conclude by saying that over this past week, in my new \ncapacity as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I \ntraveled to Africa and the Middle East. While I was there, I met with \nsome of our great men and women in uniform. It was humbling to see the \nsacrifice they are making personally for the safety of the United \nStates. I visited places where people we don't even know are working on \nthe job every single day to protect this great Nation. I am confident \nthat Chuck Hagel, as Secretary of Defense, will keep them in mind and \nkeep our national security in his heart.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will relent and spare us this \nfilibuster on Chuck Hagel, and will, in fact, give him an opportunity \nto continue to serve this Nation in the capacity of Secretary of \nDefense. I look forward to working with him when that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, normally I would be talking about the \nsequester and the Nation's fiscal health, but we are about to vote on a \ncritical nomination for a very critical position in this government. I \nwish to spend a few minutes defining why I came to the decision I have \nto oppose the confirmation of Senator Hagel to be Secretary of Defense.\n  Chuck Hagel is a former colleague. He is someone I respect for his \nhonorable service to this country, both in uniform and out of uniform. \nI respect him as a human being and as a person and, as I said, a \ncolleague. I also recognize that elections have consequences, and in \nmost situations the President has the right to choose his own advisers, \nbut this is no ordinary Cabinet position. This is Secretary of Defense \nand one of the most critical positions in this government to protect \nthe American people and to deal with national security issues.\n  Based on a number of positions Senator Hagel has taken and a number \nof statements he has made throughout his career, I have serious concern \nthat his nomination and confirmation will send the wrong signal and \ncould have a very adverse effect on our national security. I will list \nthose.\n  First, and the primary reason, goes to the question of Iran and its \nrelentless pursuit of nuclear weapons capability. As a Senator, Chuck \nHagel repeatedly voted against sanctions legislation. He even opposed \nsanctions aimed at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps who were \nkilling and maiming our troops in Iraq.\n  As someone who, as ambassador to Germany, made many trips to \nLandstuhl, the first stop for those maimed by improvised explosive \ndevices supported by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, I saw the \ntragic consequences of their action. I could not come to grips with how \nit is possible to vote against efforts to try to sanction and punish \nthose who were injuring and maiming our soldiers. During his recent \ntestimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Hagel \nalso proclaimed the legitimacy of the current regime in Tehran which \nhas violently repressed its own citizens. We have seen that played out \nbefore our very eyes. They have rigged recent elections, provided \nmaterial support for terrorism and denied the Holocaust.\n  Regarding U.S. policy in Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, Senator \nHagel displayed an embarrassing lack of knowledge and confusion \nregarding our official policy toward Iran--a well-understood policy. \nOne of the most critical topics facing our Nation is Iran's threat to \nworld stability by the possession of nuclear capability and weapons. \nSenator Hagel had to be handed a note by an aide, indicating he was not \naware his answer was contrary to even the administration's position. \nAnd his attempt to correct his answer had to be further clarified by \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee. This is central to our \nposition, to our policy relative to how we deal with Iran. Yet our next \nSecretary of Defense stated a position exactly opposite from what that \ncurrent policy is.\n  The second issue of concern to me is that it is widely accepted, I \nthink in a bipartisan way, that any sound strategy on Iran must be \nunderpinned by the highly credible threat of U.S. military force if all \nother efforts fail; if diplomacy fails, if our ever-ratcheting \nsanctions fail as they have to this particular point. They may have had \nan impact on the Iranian public, but it has not had an impact on those \nleaders who are making the decisions about the pursuit of nuclear \nweapons. This has broad bipartisan support: Four U.S. Presidents, \nincluding President Obama, has declared that an Iranian nuclear arms \ncapability is ``unacceptable.'' Use of military force as the last \noption, if all other options fail, is central to our ability to success \nin preventing Iran from achieving this capability.\n  Senator Hagel's previous statements and record contradict all that. \nHe has publicly stated that military action to stop Iran's weapons \nprograms is--and I quote his statement: ``Not viable, feasible, or \nreasonable.'' Not reasonable? Is it not reasonable to have a policy the \nadministration has adopted and four U.S. Presidents have endorsed? When \nasked about this at the hearing, he again failed to offer, in my \nopinion, a coherent response.\n  Senator Hagel has long called for direct, unconditional talks with \nthe Iranian regime, not to mention direct talks with Hamas, Hezbollah, \nand Syria as well. He has pressed that such talks should proceed \nwithout the backing gained from other more forceful, credible options. \nThis approach is far too weak, in my opinion, to be effective and \nreveals a person less committed to results than this critical moment--\nparticularly regarding the Iranian intentions--demands. In fact, I fear \na military option will have virtually zero credibility if Senator Hagel \nbecomes Secretary of Defense because it sends a dangerous message to \nthe regime in Tehran and undermines our efforts to prevent their \nintentions as it seeks to obtain the means necessary to harm both the \nUnited States and the country of Israel.\n  Lastly, and the third reason I have problems with this nomination, is \nthat it does not have bipartisan support. Over the last half century, \nno Secretary of Defense has been confirmed and taken office with more \nthan three Senators voting against him. Further, in the history of this \nNation, in this position, none has ever been confirmed with more than \n11 opposing votes.\n  The occupant of this critical office should be someone whose \ncandidacy is neither controversial nor divisive. It would be \nunprecedented for a Secretary of Defense to take office without the \nbroad base of bipartisan support and confidence needed to serve \neffectively in this critical position.\n  At this critical time in our Nation's history, we need a Secretary of \nDefense who commands bipartisan support and is willing to take every \naction necessary to defend the United States if the need arises. Based \non the years of public statements and actions taken during his career, \nI cannot say Chuck Hagel meets the criteria needed for this position \nthat is so critical--the position of Secretary of Defense; therefore, I \nwill oppose his nomination when the vote comes before us.\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper, wishes to be heard. He is not on the floor now, \nso I think it is acceptable to go ahead with another Republican now; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I recognize the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we all know the Chamber is about to hold a \ncloture vote on the President's nominee to be the next Secretary of \nDefense. If former Senator Chuck Hagel is eventually confirmed, he will \ntake office with the weakest support of any Defense Secretary in modern \nhistory, which will make him less effective on his job.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nregarding this nomination following my remarks. It is a letter dated \nFebruary 21, signed by 15 Senators, to the President asking him to \nwithdraw the nomination, noting that no Secretary of Defense since that \nposition has been created has received more than 11 opposing votes. I \nam confident this vote will eclipse that former record demonstrating \nwhat the Senator from Indiana was just talking about, and that is a \nlack of bipartisan support for this critical position in the \nPresident's Cabinet.\n  What should we expect from Senator Hagel if he is confirmed as \nSecretary of Defense? Well, it is hard to say. Over the last 2 months \nhe has repudiated many of his past votes and stated positions related \nto the Middle East and the Defense Department. During his confirmation \nhearings, he actually said the Defense Secretary was not a policymaking \nposition. I had to scratch my head at that one.\n  I also had to scratch my head when Senator Hagel described President \nObama's policy toward Iran and its nuclear program as containment. When \nhe tried to correct himself, he said President Obama does not have a \nposition on containment, but that is not true either. The U.S. \nposition--as the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nreminded Senator Hagel during that hearing, and which reflects a wide \nbipartisan consensus--is that we oppose containment and will prevent \nIran from getting nuclear weapons. That is the U.S. policy, one that \npeople would think the nominee for Secretary of Defense would be aware \nof.\n  Unfortunately, I fear Senator Hagel is actually expressing his own \npersonal views. I fear he really does think a nuclear Iran could be \ncontained. He suggested as much in the book he wrote in 2008.\n  At another point during the hearing, Senator Hagel described the \nmurderous, terror-sponsoring Iranian theocracy as an ``elected, \nlegitimate government.'' That comment is a slap in the face to all of \nthe courageous Iranian democracy activists who have risked their lives \nand, in many cases, given their lives to oppose the dictatorship and \npromote freedom.\n  There is simply no way to sugarcoat it. Senator Hagel's performance \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee was remarkably inept, and we \nshould not be installing a Defense Secretary who is obviously not \nqualified for the job and who holds dangerously misguided views on some \nof the most important issues facing national security policy for our \ncountry. For that matter, Senator Hagel was candid to admit there are \nmany things about the Department he doesn't really know. He has assured \nus he will learn on the job. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence \nin me because I don't think we want a Secretary of Defense who has to \nlearn on the job.\n  A moment ago I mentioned Senator Hagel holds dangerously misguided \nviews about many critical issues. His supporters have called him a \nrealist. In fact, there is nothing realistic about his world view.\n  It is not realistic to think that by offering unconditional talks or \nestablishing a new U.S. diplomatic post in Iran it will change the \ncharacter of a regime that has spent the past 34 years waging war \nagainst America and our allies--a regime that was recently discovered \nto have been plotting to assassinate a Saudi diplomat by blowing up a \ncrowded restaurant in Washington, DC. Likewise, it is not realistic to \nthink that further engagement with Hamas will dissuade it from pursuing \nIsrael's destruction. A terrorist organization that promotes genocidal \nviolence is never going to be reformed by dialogue or concessions.\n  Finally, it is not realistic to think that browbeating Israel will \njumpstart the Middle East peace process. President Obama tried that \napproach himself during his first term, and it was a spectacular \nfailure. We are further from a lasting peace agreement today than we \nwere in January 2009, and many Israelis, along with many Arabs, believe \nthe United States is no longer a reliable ally.\n  When we look around the Middle East, not only do we see a theocratic \ndictatorship trying to acquire nuclear weapons, we see a terrible civil \nwar raging in Syria which is led by a desperate, pro-Iranian regime \nwith massive stockpiles of chemical weapons that has no reservation \nwhatsoever at killing tens of thousands of its own civilians. We see \nthe Muslim Brotherhood attempting to create a new dictatorship in \nEgypt. We see rising sectarian violence in Iraq because of our \nwithdrawal without a status of forces agreement that would stabilize \nthe country and a democracy earned by the blood and treasure of so many \nAmericans. We see a substantial al-Qaida presence in countries such as \nLibya and Yemen.\n  President Obama would like to pivot away from the Middle East, but \nthe region isn't cooperating. Now, more than ever, we need a Secretary \nof Defense who understands the disastrous consequences of a nuclear \nIran.\n  We need a Defense Secretary who understands the importance of a \nrobust U.S.-Israeli alliance.\n  We need a Defense Secretary who understands Hamas for what it is: a \ngenocidal terrorist group sworn to Israel's destruction.\n  In a larger sense, we need a Secretary of Defense who understands why \nU.S. leadership is indispensable to solving our greatest challenges in \nthe Middle East and beyond.\n  Senator Hagel is clearly the wrong man for the job. This isn't about \npersonality, this isn't about politics, but I will be voting against \nhis confirmation for that reason: because he is clearly the wrong man \nfor the job.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 21, 2013.\n     President Barack H. Obama,\n     The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear President Obama: Last Thursday, the Senate voted to \n     continue its consideration of your nomination of former \n     Senator Chuck Hagel to serve as our nation's next Secretary \n     of Defense. While we respect Senator Hagel's honorable \n     military service, in the interest of national security, we \n     respectfully request that you withdraw his nomination.\n       It would be unprecedented for a Secretary of Defense to \n     take office without the broad base of bipartisan support and \n     confidence needed to serve effectively in this critical \n     position. Over the last half-century, no Secretary of Defense \n     has been confirmed and taken office with more than three \n     Senators voting against him. Further, in the history of this \n     position, none has ever been confirmed with more than 11 \n     opposing votes. The occupant of this critical office should \n     be someone whose candidacy is neither controversial nor \n     divisive.\n       In contrast, in 2011, you nominated Leon Panetta, who was \n     confirmed by the Senate with unanimous support. His Pentagon \n     tenure has been a huge success, due in part to the high \n     degree of trust and confidence that Senators on both sides of \n     the aisle have placed in him. The next Secretary of Defense \n     should have a similar level of broad-based bipartisan support \n     and confidence in order to succeed at a time when the \n     Department of Defense faces monumental challenges, including \n     Iran's relentless drive to obtain nuclear weapons, a \n     heightened threat of nuclear attack from North Korea, \n     potentially deep budget cuts, a strategic pivot to the Asia-\n     Pacific region, military operations in Afghanistan, the \n     ongoing Global War on Terror, the continued slaughter of \n     Syrian civilians at the hands of their own government, and \n     other aftermath of the Arab Spring.\n       Likewise, Senator Hagel's performance at his confirmation \n     hearing was deeply concerning, leading to serious doubts \n     about his basic competence to meet the substantial demands of \n     the office. While Senator Hagel's erratic record and myriad \n     conversions on key national security issues are troubling \n     enough, his statements regarding Iran were disconcerting. \n     More than once during the hearing, he proclaimed the \n     legitimacy of the\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\n     current regime in Tehran, which has violently repressed its \n     own citizens, rigged recent elections, provided material \n     support for terrorism, and denied the Holocaust.\n       Regarding U.S. policy on Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, \n     Senator Hagel displayed a seeming ambivalence about whether \n     containment or prevention is the best approach, which gives \n     us great concern. Any sound strategy on Iran must be \n     underpinned by the highly credible threat of U.S. military \n     force, and there is broad bipartisan agreement on that point. \n     If Senator Hagel becomes Secretary of Defense, the military \n     option will have near zero credibility. This sends a \n     dangerous message to the regime in Tehran, as it seeks to \n     obtain the means necessary to harm both the United States and \n     Israel.\n       We have concluded that Senator Hagel is not the right \n     candidate to hold the office of Secretary of Defense, and we \n     respectfully request that you withdraw his nomination. Thank \n     you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely.\n         John Cornyn; Lindsey Graham; David Vitter; Mike Lee; \n           Marco Rubio; Ron Johnson; Tom Coburn; Tim Scott; James \n           Inhofe; Roger Wicker; Ted Cruz; Patrick Toomey; Daniel \n           Coats; James E. Risch; John Barrasso.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is rare that I disagree with the \nSenator from Texas--maybe once or twice in the last half a dozen years. \nSeriously, we disagree from time to time, but we do it in a way that we \nare not disagreeable with one another.\n  I support the President's nomination of Chuck Hagel to be our \nSecretary of Defense, and I wish to take a couple of minutes to explain \nwhy.\n  For folks who might be watching this from afar, this body used to \noperate very differently than it does today. The President would \nnominate people to serve in a cabinet or to serve as judges and there \nwould be hearings. There would be debate. Sometimes people would \ndisagree. But, certainly, for Cabinet appointments and for sub-Cabinet \nlevel appointments, for the most part, the President got the team he, \nor someday she, asked for. That is the way we have done it as Governors \nacross the country, and it is the way we still do it. The idea of 4 \nyears of this administration to still be playing a game of executive \nbranch Swiss cheese--we have so many relatively high level positions, \nconfirmable positions that are still vacant--is not good, whether it \nhappens to be a Democratic administration or a Republican \nadministration.\n  The President, regardless of what party they are from, needs, for the \nmost part, to have the team they want to put in place. They have been \nelected to lead. Let's give them a chance to lead. If they screw up, we \ncan hold them accountable.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with Chuck Hagel for, I guess, my first \n8 years as a Senator. I like him and respect him as a fellow Vietnam \nveteran. He is a war hero. He was wounded not once but twice. He has \nthe Purple Hearts and some other decorations to show, to demonstrate \nhis valor.\n  He came back, put his life together, built a business, a good-sized \nbusiness, ran that business, and he has led some large government \nentities, including those that look out for our veterans and others \ntoo.\n  As to the question of does one have the kind of intimate knowledge of \nthe Department of Defense we would like for a person to have, he has \nhad good training. He has had good exposure. He has been there. He has \ndone that. He has been able to, as an innovator, as an entrepreneur, \nstart a business, grow a business, run that business, build that \nbusiness.\n  Here he served on the committees of jurisdiction that actually \nenabled him to drill down on parts of the Department of Defense and \npart of our defense policy and foreign policy that you never have a \nchance to when you are over there serving in Southeast Asia or some \nother area around the world as a member of our Armed Services.\n  When I went with Chuck on a codel--I want to say it was maybe in \n2005--that is when we actually get to know people around here. We could \nbe here, be kind of airdropped in on Monday afternoons, vote, and then \nby the time Thursday night rolls around, folks here smell the jet fumes \nand they are ready to go back to Hawaii or Michigan or Oklahoma or \nsomeplace such as that. We go by train to Delaware. But people are \nready to head for home, and we just do not have the kind of time \ntogether, quality time together, that we used to have when people would \nactually stay here for weekends, when we were not focused 24/7 on \nfundraising, and we actually had--believe it or not--dinner clubs and \npeople carpooled to work. Can you imagine that: Democrats and \nRepublicans carpooling to work here? We just do not have those \nopportunities these days. I do not know that we ever will again.\n  So one of the great opportunities we have to know people is when we \ngo on codels, these congressional delegation trips. I had the \nopportunity to go with Chuck Hagel on a codel he led over one-half \ndozen years ago. We went to the Middle East. We went to Israel. We \nspent time along Gaza. We went to Jordan. We met with leaders of Saudi \nArabia. I had a chance to actually see him interact up close and \npersonal with leaders of all those countries, see how he handled \nhimself, to see his knowledge of the issues, his ability to debate, \ndiscuss those issues with the leaders of three of the most important \nnations, allies of ours in the world.\n  I was proud of the job he did then. I was proud of the leadership he \nshowed on those occasions. I was proud of his grasp of the issues.\n  Do you know the other thing I was proud of? He was willing to be \nhonest and frank with people with whom we need to be honest and frank. \nHe reminds me of one of the old caveats of leadership, which is that \nleadership is having the courage to stay out of step when everybody \nelse is marching to the wrong tune. Leadership is also the willingness \nto speak truth to power, to tell people--sometimes our leaders, whether \nthey be the President or, frankly, sometimes leaders of other \ncountries--what they need to hear, maybe not what they want to hear.\n  Chuck Hagel is that kind of person. I believe he is principled. I \nthink he is hard working, that he will surround himself with good \npeople, ethical people, honest people, capable people, bright people.\n  I think as a former Member here, he understands the importance of the \ninteraction between us and the Department of Defense, which I hope he \nwill have the opportunity to lead.\n  When we passed something called the Chief Financial Officer Act, I \nthink in 1990 in this Chamber, coauthored, I think, by Bill Roth, my \npredecessor, one of the requirements of that legislation was not only \nwould every major department in our government be required to have a \nchief financial officer, but also, in addition, there was a full \nexpectation that all these departments which were not auditable--could \nnot be audited--had to become auditable. They had to be capable of \nbeing audited. Then there was the full expectation that once they were \nauditable, they would be able to pass an audit fully without \nqualification.\n  Today, there are two departments in the Federal Government that are \nnot auditable and have not passed an audit in an unqualified manner. \nOne of them is the Department of Homeland Security. They are getting \nreal close. They are knocking on the door. I think they will get it \ndone by next year. I congratulate the Secretary and their team for \ndoing that.\n  The other is the Department of Defense. For years and years and years \nthey would say: Well, manana. We will do that manana, next year or the \nyear after that. They have not. Why is this important? What you cannot \nmeasure you cannot manage. What we cannot measure we cannot manage. The \nDepartment of Defense is unable to measure well and, as a result, they \ndo not manage as well as they need to.\n  We just got a high risk update from the GAO, the General \nAccountability Office, 2 weeks ago. High on their list of issues that \nneed to be addressed is the Department of Defense's need to be able to \npass an unqualified audit so their financials, their accounting systems \nand supply systems, their spare parts systems, personnel systems \nactually work.\n  Leon Panetta has done much in the 2 years he has served as Secretary \nof Defense to make sure the Department of Defense takes this obligation \nseriously. I commend him and I thank him for that. He has been like a \nbreath of fresh air.\n  Second, Chuck Hagel has given me his personal commitment that he will \nnot relent, he will not turn back, but\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\nhe will continue on this path of undertaking and be in a position by \nthe next 3 years to do what the Department of Homeland Security is \nabout to complete, the benchmark they are about to reach, the milestone \nthey are about to reach, and the milestone that virtually every other \nDepartment of the Federal Government has reached.\n  We are looking down the barrel of a gun this Friday--sequestration. \nIf we are serious about making sure we do not get shot by that gun, \nmortally wounded by that gun, along with our economy, we are going to \nhave to make sure we are doing three things better.\n  One of those is, we need some additional revenues. We need to have \nrevenues closer to the level of where revenues were in the 4 years we \nhad balanced budgets under Bill Clinton, where revenues as a percentage \nof GDP, my colleagues will recall, ranged anywhere from 19\\1/2\\ percent \nof GDP to 20\\1/2\\ percent of GDP--somewhere in that range. Last year, \nit was about 15\\1/2\\, maybe 16 percent of GDP.\n  With the fiscal cliff deal adopted in this body and signed by the \nPresident back in early January, revenues as a percentage of GDP by the \nend of these 10 years will be up to about 18, 18\\1/2\\ percent. But some \nadditional revenues are needed, very much in line with what we had when \nwe actually had four balanced budgets in a row under the Clinton \nadministration. Remember, those were the first balanced budgets we had \nsince 1969. So, No. 1, we need some additional revenues--in smart ways.\n  The second thing we need to do is entitlement program reform. Over \nhalf the money we spend is on entitlements. Is it possible? The \nPresident says we need entitlement reform that saves money, does not \nsavage old people, poor people, and actually makes sure these programs \nare around for future generations. I could not agree more. That is No. \n2.\n  The third thing we need to do is find ways to save money in \neverything we do--everything we do--from agriculture to transportation \nand everything in between, including defense.\n  I am told--and I am going to look over here at Senator Levin, the \nchairman of the committee, and the ranking member, Senator Inhofe, and \njust ask a rhetorical question. I recall hearing not long ago that we \nspend more as a nation on defense--I say this as a 23-year veteran \nnaval flight officer, Active and Reserve Duty, a Vietnam veteran--but I \nam told we spend as much money on defense as maybe the next 5, 6, 7 \nnations combined.\n  As important as it is for our next Secretary of Defense to have a \ngood grasp of military issues--foreign issues, intelligence issues, the \nability to manage big operations, to have strong managers under him or \nher--as important as that is, it is important for us to spend more \nwisely.\n  A good place to start is the GAO high risk list for high-risk places \nwhere we are wasting money and that we get a good to-do list out of \nGAO. It is one I think we ought to take seriously. I know the chairman \nof our committee and the ranking member take it seriously. Believe me, \nI do too.\n  One of things we are going to use from our commitment of Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs--on which Senator Levin serves, and \nhe chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations--we are going to \nmake sure we hold the feet of the Department of Defense to the fire, \nand we need a Secretary of Defense who will do that as well--someone \nwho is a fiscal hawk, someone who understands the importance of getting \nbetter results for less money in everything we do, including providing \nfor the defense of our country.\n  That is not the speech I brought with me to the floor, but it is the \nspeech that is in my heart.\n  I just say to my colleagues, if you are on the fence and you are not \nsure whether you ought to vote for cloture, someday we are going to \nhave a Republican President again. Someday we will have a Republican \nmajority here. There is an old saying: Every dog has its day. Today we \nhave a Democratic President and we have a Democratic Senate for \nconfirmations. Someday that will not be the case. I will say to our \nRepublican friends, just be careful. Just be careful. I say this with \nrespect: Be careful of the bed we make because someday our friends on \nthe other side will get to lie in it. Do we want to continue to go on \nwith this precedent of maybe even denying an up-or-down vote on the \nnomination of a Secretary? I do not think so. I do not think that is a \ngood precedent. An even worse precedent is to have all these sub-\nCabinet-level positions that are vacant and have been vacant, in some \ncases, for weeks, months, in some cases for longer. That is a terrible \nprecedent to have, and we need to stop it. A good time to stop it is \nright now.\n  I am pleased to stand and endorse the nomination of Chuck Hagel. I \nthink he was a credit to his State, to this body when he served here, \nand I think he will be a credit to us if he is confirmed. I urge his \nconfirmation starting with today's vote for cloture.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I too rise in opposition to the nomination \nof Chuck Hagel to lead the Department of Defense. Mr. Hagel is probably \ngoing to get his vote, but let me say this to my friend from Delaware. \nIf a Republican President in the future brings a nomination for Defense \nSecretary to this Senate and he does not get as many as 60 votes, I \nwill ask that Republican President to withdraw that nomination, and I \nwish this President would do the same. This could have been an easy \nmatter. The selection of the Defense Secretary for President Obama's \nsecond term could have been a unifying moment. There were a host of \nqualified, able candidates, both Republican and Democrat, who could \nhave sailed through the process. The President knew controversy was \nahead and decided to name Senator Hagel anyway.\n  There were signals from the right and from the left that Senator \nHagel would be a divisive and distracting choice. The Washington Post \neditorial board gave the President good advice on December 18 by \nsaying: ``Chuck Hagel is not the right choice for defense secretary.''\n  The differences surrounding Senator Hagel's nomination during the \nlast few weeks stand in stark contrast to the unanimous support for \noutgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Mr. Hagel's nomination is \nmarkedly different from the overwhelming confirmation of Senator John \nKerry for Secretary of State.\n  With so much at stake in the coming days, this should be a time for \nconsensus and cooperation. A nominee who could draw unequivocal support \nwould have served our defense priorities better--and those of our \nallies.\n  This confirmation fight occurs against the backdrop of severe across-\nthe-board cuts to America's defense programs that are set to take \neffect this week unless current policy is changed. The Joint Chiefs of \nStaff reiterated this disastrous reality at a hearing on February 12. \nThe generals and admirals who testified are some of the most respected \nin the Pentagon. They are some of the most respected in the world. They \nmade it clear that these cuts, at nearly one-half trillion dollars, \nthreaten America's military readiness and national security. Based on \ntheir expertise, we are obliged to believe them.\n  By contrast, Senator Hagel has called the defense budget ``bloated.'' \nHe did not simply say there is some fat we can trim or that there is \nroom for savings, as we all believe. No, he said it was bloated.\n  Which is it? Are the Joint Chiefs of Staff correct or is Chuck Hagel \ncorrect? The testimony from Defense officials is clearly at odds with \nMr. Hagel's shortsighted assessment.\n  Would Senator Hagel defend a robust defense budget in the face of \nindiscriminate cuts that could weaken our national security or does he \nbelieve sequestration is the answer to what he calls a bloated defense \nbudget?\n  The statement that our national security budget is bloated is only \none of many outlandish pronouncements Senator Hagel has used to grab \nattention rather than give an accurate evaluation of the situation at \nhand.\n  Senator Hagel has in fact made a career out of speaking against the \nbipartisan mainstream and taking positions on the fringe of public \nopinion. Here are a few other examples: Senator Hagel has accused \nIsrael of ``playing games'' and committing ``sickening slaughter'' when \nit was defending itself from Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon. He has \nsaid that Israel should not keep\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\nthe Palestinians ``caged up like animals.''\n  We never had a Defense Secretary who would have said such a thing. \nSenator Hagel has said the ``Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people \nup here'' and forces Congress to do ``dumb things.''\n  On Iran, Senator Hagel has stated he is both for and against \nunilateral sanctions. He wrote to Senator Boxer's office on January 14:\n\n       I agree that, with Iran's continued rejection of diplomatic \n     overtures, further effective sanctions, both multilateral and \n     unilateral--may be necessary.\n\n  A week earlier, Senator Hagel told the Lincoln Journal Star that he \nopposed unilateral sanctions because they ``don't work and they just \nisolate the United States.''\n  When speaking about the Iraq war, Senator Hagel has described it as a \n``meat grinder,'' a crude characterization that succeeded, once again, \nin gaining him some additional headlines.\n  Perhaps, in an effort to minimize his inconsistent record, Senator \nHagel said during the Armed Services hearing on January 31 that he \n``won't be in a policy-making position'' as Defense Secretary. This \ncomment illustrates either naivety or a disturbing abdication of the \nDefense Secretary's responsibilities, which include well-informed \npolicy decisions that will affect the lives of men and women in \nuniform. Of course the Secretary of Defense makes policy.\n  During the Armed Services hearing, Senator McCain was correct to try \nto ascertain what Senator Hagel's feelings are today about the surge in \nIraq. A number of people agreed with Senator Hagel at the time but are \nnow willing to admit with hindsight that the surge went better than \nexpected, but not Senator Hagel.\n  Let's not forget that Senator Hagel did not merely oppose the surge. \nIt was not enough to say he had misgivings or doubts. He called it the \ngreatest foreign policy blunder since the Vietnam war. This has been \nthe extreme, outlandish, rhetorical approach of Chuck Hagel throughout \nhis career.\n  People involved in a position of this importance need to be careful \nabout what they say. When one is being interviewed for a book, they \nshould choose words wisely. That is why, during the Armed Services \nhearing, I asked Senator Hagel about why he told author Aaron David \nMiller ``the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here'' and \nthat he ``always argued against some of the dumb things they do.''\n  Let me make this clear. Americans who come to Washington and advocate \nfor Israel do meaningful work to advance a strong, sovereign, and \ndemocratic Israel, America's closest ally in the Middle East. Mr. Hagel \ndid not defend his comments at the hearing. Instead, he blamed his \nstatements on a poor choice of words.\n  Congressional actions, such as tough Iran sanctions and greater \nmilitary cooperation with Israel, are not the products of intimidation. \nTo suggest otherwise challenges the bipartisan judgment of the men and \nwomen elected to serve in this Chamber.\n  When questioned by Senator Graham during the hearing, Senator Hagel \ncould not name one person in Congress who had been intimidated or one \ndumb thing that Congress had done because of the pro-Israel lobby. One \nor two troubling statements might not be disqualifying when taken \nalone, but all of the positions taken together paint what I believe is \nan accurate picture of this nominee. Our troops and allies need to rely \non the words of the Secretary of Defense. Changing viewpoints for the \npurpose of political expediency or to make headlines is not the \nhallmark of a steadfast leader.\n  Weeks after the process began, two conclusions emerged from the \ntotality of the information that has come to light about Senator Hagel: \nEither we should disregard everything he has said and stood for as \nmerely hyperbole---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WICKER. May I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Let's say everything the Senator has said is merely hyperbole or this \nis a nominee with a very unsettling and naive world view. You can't \nhave it both ways. Either he means what he said over his career or it \nhas all been theater.\n  The President is entitled to make his nomination, but the Senate must \nuphold its important constitutional duty to provide advice and consent \non this nomination.\n  Early on, many friends on the Democratic side of the aisle voiced \ntheir very real concerns. Let me ask, Has Chuck Hagel truly answered \nthose concerns? Which Chuck Hagel are we being asked to confirm: the \none who shoots from the hip and means what he says or the one who is \nnow willing to say anything to be confirmed?\n  We need a Secretary of Defense who can stand before the world and \narticulate that America is opposed to a nuclear Iran and rejects a \npolicy of containment. We need a Secretary of Defense who can stand \nbefore the world and be clear that the Iranian Government is not a \nlegitimately constituted government. We need a Secretary of Defense who \nhas broad, bipartisan support. Sadly, that Secretary is not Chuck \nHagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 11\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Oklahoma has 11 minutes.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding we each have about \n11 minutes. I will take my time and request to be acknowledged when I \nhave 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this has been a good debate. We have \nrepeated a lot of things that have been said before. There are just \nsome things I think are worth repeating.\n  I need to say over and over again, as often as I can, that nobody is \nimpugning the integrity of former Senator Hagel. Everyone is very \ncomplimentary of the great service he has performed in military \nservice. That is not the issue. That has nothing to do with it.\n  The thing that is important is the fact that they have said \ncontinuously, over and over again, this is a filibuster. They have said \nthis is the first time that there has been a filibuster on a Cabinet \nnominee. That is just not true. This happens all the time. In fact, in \nrecent history there have been six demands for cloture on the \nDemocratic side as opposed to only one on the Republican side. This is \nnot a filibuster.\n  Rather than take my word for it, take our Vice President Joe Biden's \nword for it when he said this is not a filibuster. He was talking about \na controversial appointee. A letter was sent by him to his colleagues \narguing that opposing cloture was not a filibuster. He said: ``It is a \nvote to protect the Senate's constitutional power to advise and consent \nto nominations.''\n  This is worth repeating. Vice President Joe Biden said it is not a \nfilibuster. ``It is a vote to protect the Senate's constitutional power \nto advise and consent to nominations.''\n  This expresses the frustration of our new Senator from Texas, Senator \nCruz, who finally just gave up. He said: You know, I have been wanting \nto exercise my constitutional rights all of this time. Senator Cruz \nsaid, I have said it over and over again, and I have requested over and \nover again the information to which I am entitled and to which I have a \nconstitutional right.\n  I am in a position to quote--I have already done it several times \nfrom this podium--our distinguished chairman, who also agrees we need \nto have those rights. Certainly, we have quoted Senator Kerry and \nothers talking about the fact that requiring this information is simply \nsomething so ingrained in our system. This is not just Jim Inhofe and \nAlexander Hamilton talking, this is everybody throughout this country's \nhistory.\n  This is one of the things that people should consider: This is not a \nfilibuster, and we have not received the information to which we are \nentitled. It is not just Senator Cruz, it is others too. It doesn't \nhappen to be me because I am opposing this nominee for many of the same \nreasons that the previous speakers, Senator Cornyn and Senator Wicker \nfrom Mississippi, have stated.\n  I know we are close to running out of time. I think the senior \nSenator from\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\nTexas, Mr. Cornyn, brought out and has probably talked more--and has in \nthe last month--about the concerns he has regarding the Middle East, \nwith the attitude of former Senator Hagel to the various Middle Eastern \ncountries and how Hezbollah, Hamas, all of those work into it.\n  In the case of Iran, I am and have been concerned about the attitude \nof Mr. Hagel in terms of this group called Global Zero movement that \nwants to do away with nukes, even if it is unilateral.\n  This isn't the way it used to be in the old days. As I said a minute \nago, I look wistfully upon those days because it is not that way \nanymore. Our unclassified intelligence says Iran is going to have \nnuclear capability and a delivery system by 2015. Why would we want to \nbring down our nuclear capability in an environment like that? We also \nknow and have watched recently what North Korea has done, all of them \ntrading with China, Syria, and these other countries. It is not like it \nwas in the old days.\n  I need to mention this also because three of the previous speakers \nspoke about Iran, their concern about the statements that have been \nmade in support of Iran by Mr. Hagel. If you look at some of the quotes \nthat come from Iran, you need to remind people those guys are bad guys \nover there. One of their statements from their ministry was that people \nof the Middle East--the Muslim region and North Africa, people from \nthese regions--hate America from the bottom of their hearts. Then they \ngo after, of course, Israel. They said Iran's warriors are ready and \nwilling to wipe Israel off the map. The Zionists will receive a \ncrushing response from the Islamic Republic's armed forces, which will \nlead to their annihilation.\n  This is the Islamist Revolutionary Guard, the same group which was to \nbe declared a terrorist group when he was then-Senator Hagel, and he \nwas only one of four Members of the entire Senate who objected to \ndesignating the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group. This quote is \nthe one that received my attention the most, and it has directly to do \nwith Israel. Iran said:\n\n       They launched the myth of the Holocaust. They lied, they \n     put on a show and then they support the Jews.\n\n  This is interesting they would have that kind of a strong statement. \nI asked my staff this morning if they remembered a movie called \n``Schindler's List.'' ``Schindler's List'' was a movie I never saw \nuntil it was on national TV 3 days ago, and I couldn't stop watching \nit. I couldn't turn it off. You need to look at the Holocaust from that \nperspective. Iran denies it even took place.\n  You will not find any country or any area we have dealt with in the \npast that is more anti-Israel than Iran. I have to say also, if anyone \nwants to know some of my feelings, I have made over five speeches more \nthan 1 hour each on the floor of this Senate about Israel, and they are \nentitled to the land. All of these issues are very important--the mere \nfact Iran would say the Holocaust didn't exist.\n  Now, keep in mind--and I know the response to this is that we don't \nhave any control over who supports him, but it is interesting, though--\nthat Iran supports Chuck Hagel's nomination to be Secretary of Defense. \nI mean, Iran arguably could be considered to be the greatest foe that \nis out there for the United States, recognizing the capabilities they \nare going to have and the statements they have made about the United \nStates of America. That is frightening.\n  So those are the reasons I was concerned initially about this \nnomination--and I think it has been said and said very well by the \nSenator from Mississippi, who went over all the details--and I think it \nis something that has to be looked at and looked at seriously.\n  The idea that this process of requiring a 60 vote margin is new at a \nCabinet level--I mentioned that a very prominent leftwing television \nstation was talking about that over and over again, that this has never \nhappened, there has never been a Cabinet position that has been \nfilibustered. First of all, it is not filibustering. We know that \nbecause we heard that from John Kerry, Joe Biden, and all the rest of \nthe people who have been concerned about the fact that there is \nsomething improper about cloture when it comes to nominees. There is \nnothing more important than a President nominating someone for these \nCabinet positions, and it is very common that they are questioned by \nthe opposition, by an opposition party to the President in the Senate. \nWe are the ones who have that constitutional responsibility.\n  I remember because I was sitting here when Kathleen Sebelius went \nthrough the same thing. She, obviously, had to finally have a 60-vote \nmargin. John Bryson, Secretary of Commerce--I remember what he went \nthrough. Also, I recall very well Miguel Estrada. I remember being down \nhere with Miguel Estrada, and they rejected him seven different times. \nThey required a 60-vote margin. He always got in the fifties. The \nhighest he got was 55. But he was rejected.\n  So what we are saying is that this is not anything unusual. We all \nknow about Dirk Kempthorne and Steven Johnson. Steven Johnson happened \nto be an appointee of Republican President Bush, yet he was a Democrat, \nand he was one where finally we were able to get the 60 votes. We got \n61 votes. So, again, there is nothing unusual about this.\n  My only plea is that we consider some of the things that are in the \nbackground of this nominee to be Secretary of Defense, as has been \nstated before. The fact that he is one of only two who were against \nsanctions in Iran, one of only four who opposed designating the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard as terrorists, one of only four who refused to sign \na letter of solidarity with Israel, and the fact that--and I do applaud \nand appreciate the chairman of the committee for allowing Senator Cruz \nto show the video of an interview on Al Jazeera--Senator Hagel agreed \nwith the comment that Israel made war crimes or the statement that \nIsrael committed sickening slaughters and that America is the world's \nbully. These all underscore the fact that Senator Hagel is not the kind \nof person we need as Secretary of Defense for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, on the question of whether this is a filibuster, \nunder our rules Senators have a right to speak and debate as long as \nthey want until 60 Senators decide it is time to end debate. That is \nthe definition, under our rules, of a filibuster. And that is the right \nof Senators to engage in. That is not the issue, as to whether it is \nright; the issue is whether it is now time to end debate. Under our \nrules, in order to bring debate to an end, where Senators insist on \ncontinuing a debate unless 60 Senators vote to end it, this is what \nthis vote will be about at noon--whether we want to bring this debate \nto an end. Why? Well, first of all, we need a Secretary of Defense. But \nbefore we can get a Secretary of Defense, there has to be a vote on the \nnomination itself. The vote at noon will be a vote as to whether we \nwant to bring this debate to an end so that we can, at a later time--\nhopefully today--then vote on the nomination itself. That is a majority \nvote, not 60 votes. In fact, the final vote on either a nominee or on a \nbill is always a majority vote. The 60 votes comes into play when \nSenators say: We are not going to end debate. We have a right to talk \nas long as we want in the Senate until 60 Senators vote to end it. And \nwe demand that vote of 60 Senators takes place to see if there are 60 \nSenators who want to end debate. That is called cloture. That is what \nwe will be voting on at noon. That is the very definition of a \nfilibuster, under our rules.\n  So it is not unusual, as the Senator from Oklahoma says, for there to \nbe a demand for a cloture vote on positions in the Cabinet. That has \nhappened before. But what has never happened is that that has been \ninsisted upon for a nomination to be Secretary of Defense. That is what \nis unusual.\n  It seems to me it is essential now that we get to the vote on the \nnomination itself, which will come later on today--again, I hope--and \nthe only way to do that is if we vote to end the debate on this \nnomination, which is what will take place at noon. Whether there will \nbe 60 votes, we will find out at noon, but hopefully there will be \nbecause this is a position which needs to be filled.\n  There have been many misstatements about quotes of Senator\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\nHagel. Obviously, not all of the statements that have been attributed \nto him are misstatements, but some of them are. Just one of them we \nheard earlier this morning was about the fact that he has talked about \nthe sickening slaughter by the Israelis in the case of Lebanon. So here \nis the quote, and it was a full speech. It was on C-SPAN. The quote \nis--and this involves the issue of Lebanon--``The sickening slaughter \non both sides must end.'' So what Senator Hagel was bemoaning was the \nloss of lives on both sides. I would hope that decent people everywhere \nwould bemoan the massive loss of lives on both sides that occurred \nduring those events in Lebanon. I was there, and I saw what happened--\nthe huge loss of life. So he was bemoaning the sickening slaughter on \nboth sides and saying it must end and calling on President Bush to call \nfor an immediate cease-fire. I find nothing reprehensible about such a \ncall.\n  This has been a debate which has raised a lot of issues, but, to me, \nsome of the most compelling arguments have been made by former \nSecretaries of Defense and State urging that we approve and confirm \nSenator Hagel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support to which I will refer. At an earlier time, they were \nmade part of the Record, but it is important that they be made a part \nof the Record of today's debate and not just previous debates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 20, 2012.\n     Ambassadors' Open Letter: Senator Hagel Impeccable Choice for \n         Defense Secretary\n       We support, most strongly and without qualification, \n     President Obama's reported intention to nominate Senator \n     Chuck Hagel to be the next secretary of defense. Each of us \n     has known the senator over the past twenty years and has \n     found him invariably one of the best informed leaders in the \n     U.S. Congress on the issues of U.S. national security. \n     Senator Hagel's credentials for the job are impeccable. As a \n     decorated Vietnam veteran, an extremely successful \n     entrepreneur in the private sector and as a two-term senator, \n     he brings unusually high qualifications and experiences to \n     the Department of Defense at this time of budget constraint \n     and challenges to reshape America's military power while \n     keeping it strong for the coming decades.\n       Senator Hagel's political courage has impressed us all. He \n     has stood and argued publicly for what he believes is best \n     for the United States. When he was attacked for opposing the \n     war in Iraq as ``unpatriotic,'' he replied, ``To question \n     your government is not unpatriotic--to not question your \n     government is unpatriotic.''\n       Time and again he chose to take the path of standing up for \n     our nation over political expediency. He has always supported \n     the pillars of American foreign policy--such as: a strong \n     NATO and Atlantic partnership; a commitment to the security \n     of Israel, as a friend and ally; a determination to stop the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons; and the defense of human \n     rights as a core principle of America's role in the world.\n       Each of us has had the opportunity to work with Senator \n     Hagel at one time or another on the issues of the Middle \n     East. He has invariably demonstrated strong support for \n     Israel and for a two state solution and has been opposed to \n     those who would undermine or threaten Israel's security.\n       We can think of few more qualified, more non-partisan, more \n     courageous or better equipped to head the Department of \n     Defense at this critical moment in strengthening America's \n     role in the world. If he is nominated, we urge the speedy \n     confirmation of Senator Hagel's appointment.\n           Sincerely,\n         Nicholas Burns, former Under Secretary of State for \n           Political Affairs, Ambassador to NATO and Greece; Ryan \n           Crocker, former Ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan; \n           Edward Djerejian, former Ambassador to Israel and \n           Syria; William Harrop, former Ambassador to Israel; \n           Daniel Kurtzer, former Ambassador to Israel and Egypt; \n           Sam Lewis, former Ambassador to Israel; William H. \n           Luers, former Ambassador to Venezuela and \n           Czechoslovakia; Thomas R.

Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush on a \n     host of international matters.\n       I hope that you will take a moment to review their letter \n     as you consider Senator Hagel's nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 24, 2013.\n       To Members of the U.S. Senate: We, as former Secretaries of \n     State, Defense, and National Security Advisors, are writing \n     to express our strong endorsement of Chuck Hagel to be the \n     next Secretary of Defense.\n       Chuck Hagel has an impeccable record of public service that \n     reflects leadership, integrity, and a keen reading of global \n     dynamics. From his time as Deputy Veterans Administrator \n     managing a quarter of a million employees during the Reagan \n     presidency, to turning around the financially troubled World \n     USO, to shepherding the post-9/11 GI Bill into law as a \n     United States Senator, and most recently through his service \n     on the Defense Policy Board at the Pentagon and as co-\n     Chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, \n     Chuck Hagel is uniquely qualified to meet the challenges \n     facing the Department of Defense and our men and women in \n     uniform. As President Obama noted in announcing the \n     nomination, this twice-wounded combat veteran ``is a champion \n     of our troops and our veterans and our military families'' \n     and would have the distinction of being the first person of \n     enlisted rank and the first Vietnam veteran to serve as \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       His approach to national security and debates about the use \n     of American power is marked by a disciplined habit of \n     thoughtfulness that is sorely needed and these qualities will \n     serve him well as Secretary of Defense at a time when the \n     United States must address a range of international issues \n     that are unprecedented in scope. Our extensive experience \n     working with Senator Hagel over the years has left us \n     confident that he has the necessary background to succeed in \n     the job of leading the largest federal agency.\n       Hagel has declared that we ``knew we needed the world's \n     best military not because we wanted war but because we wanted \n     to prevent war.'' For those of us honored to have served as \n     members of a president's national security team, Senator \n     Hagel clearly understands the essence and the burdens of \n     leadership required of this high office. We hope this \n     Committee and the U.S. Senate will promptly and favorably act \n     on his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n         Hon. Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State; Hon. \n           Samuel Berger, former National Security Advisor; Hon. \n           Harold Brown, former Secretary of Defense; Hon. \n           Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Advisor; \n           Hon.

The members of NCOA share a common \n     experience with Senator Hagel who personally experienced the \n     rigors of military service to include combat in the Vietnam \n     War.\n       His military service including being twice wounded in \n     action has instilled the values of service and personal \n     sacrifice and for which he knows well the human cost of war.\n       He has been an advocate for Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Coasties to ensure the training and equipage of \n     America's 21st Century Military Force to coincide with a \n     solid revised Defense posture to meet conventional and \n     unconventional world challenges.\n       Senator Hagel has also championed personnel issues relating \n     to combat dwell time, force protection, transition issues \n     including electronic medical issues, preparation for future \n     employment and training, veterans benefits including \n     enhancements to Post 9/11 educational benefits. He also \n     recognizes the value and sacrifice of families of the men and \n     women who serve in this nation's Uniformed Services.\n       The NCOA has no hesitation in asking that Senator Hagel \n     receive an expeditious hearing that confirms his confirmation \n     to be the next Secretary of Defense. This Association \n     recognizes the challenges that will be faced as Secretary of \n     Defense and believe Senator\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\n     Hagel is well qualified to lead the Department of Defense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Richard C.

Obama announced the \n     nomination yesterday, Jan. 7, 2013.\n       ``AMVETS fully supports President Obama's nomination of \n     Chuck Hagel for the future Secretary of Defense,'' said Geer. \n     ``As a veterans service organization, AMVETS' main mission is \n     to serve as an advocate for veterans, their families and the \n     community in which they live. I am confident that former Sen. \n     Hagel will utilize his experience and understanding of \n     America's military to lead this nation's troops and the \n     Department of Defense.''\n       If confirmed by the Senate, Hagel will be the first \n     infantryman to serve as the Secretary of Defense. He will \n     replace current Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who has \n     been in this position since 2011. Hagel's experience ranges \n     from serving in the Army during the Vietnam War to \n     representing Nebraska as a senator.\n       About AMVETS:\n       A leader since 1944 in preserving the freedoms secured by \n     America's armed forces, AMVETS provides support for veterans \n     and the active military in procuring their earned \n     entitlements, as well as community service and legislative \n     reform that enhances the quality of life for this nation's \n     citizens and veterans alike.

Carl Levin, \n     Chairman,\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe, \n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe: While some \n     of our organizations cannot recommend whom the President \n     should appoint to his cabinet, we believe that Senator Chuck \n     Hagel would make an outstanding Secretary of Defense, and is \n     uniquely qualified to lead the men and women of America's \n     Armed Forces.\n       Chuck Hagel is a true patriot who volunteered to fight in \n     the war of his generation when he could easily have opted for \n     a safe assignment. Twice wounded in the service of our \n     nation, this combat veteran knows first-hand what it means to \n     wear the uniform, what it means when the nation sends its \n     young people to war, and the price that our Soldiers, \n     Sailors, Airmen and Marines sometimes pay in our defense.\n       He has fought with and for our troops his entire adult \n     life: as a 21-year-old infantry sergeant in Vietnam; as the \n     deputy head of the VA who pushed for Agent Orange Benefits \n     and for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; as the President of \n     the USO; and as a U.S. Senator who coauthored the Post-9/11 \n     GI Bill. As Secretary of Defense he will be a strong advocate \n     of preparing servicemen and women for a smooth transition \n     from the military to the VA system, including making jobs and \n     training, and efficient electronic records a top priority. \n     His door would always be open to veterans' service \n     organizations.\n       Chuck Hagel knows that, while military force in defense of \n     the nation is unfortunately sometimes necessary, decisions \n     concerning war and peace, life and death, never should be \n     undertaken lightly. This is the least that we can ask of our \n     leaders.\n       The President has said that ``in Chuck Hagel our troops see \n     a decorated combat veteran of character and strength. They \n     see one of their own. Chuck is a champion of our troops and \n     our veterans and our military families.'' ``Chuck knows that \n     war is not an abstraction. He understands that sending young \n     Americans to fight and bleed in the dirt and mud, that's \n     something we only do when it's absolutely necessary.'' As \n     veterans, we could not agree more. As the nation commemorates \n     the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, it is fitting and \n     proper that the next Secretary of Defense should be a wounded \n     and decorated veteran of that conflict--the first Vietnam \n     veteran and the first enlisted man to hold this post.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stewart M. Hickey,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The first letter is a letter of 11 Ambassadors, including \nfour former Ambassadors to Israel, in which these Ambassadors say that \nSenator Hagel ``has always supported the pillars of American foreign \npolicy--such as a strong NATO and Atlantic partnership; a commitment to \nthe security of Israel, as a friend and ally . . . ''\n  The second letter is from 13 former Secretaries of Defense, State, \nand National Security Advisers, including a number of Republicans who \nserved in Republican administrations. Part of their letter reads as \nfollows:\n\n       His approach to national security and debates about the use \n     of American power is marked by a disciplined habit of \n     thoughtfulness that is sorely needed.\n\n  It also says:\n\n       Our extensive experience working with Senator Hagel over \n     the years has left us confident that he has the necessary \n     background to succeed in the job of leading the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  These, again, are 13 former Secretaries of Defense.\n  Then there is a series of letters that came in from veterans \norganizations. These are elegant pleas for Senator Hagel to be \nconfirmed.\n  This is from the Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United \nStates:\n\n       Senator Hagel has championed personnel issues relating to \n     combat dwell time, force protection, transition issues \n     including electronic medical issues, preparation for future \n     employment and training . . . He also recognizes the value \n     and sacrifice of families of the men and women who serve in \n     this Nation's Uniformed Services.\n\n  This is from AMVETS:\n\n       AMVETS fully supports President Obama's nomination of Chuck \n     Hagel for the future Secretary of Defense. As a veterans \n     service organization, AMVETS' main mission is to serve as an \n     advocate for veterans, their families and the community in \n     which they live. I am confident that former Senator Hagel \n     will utilize his experience and understanding of America's \n     military to lead this nation's troops and the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  In terms of Israel and in terms of Iran, I wish to read a couple of \nstatements of Senator Hagel and about Senator Hagel--first in terms of \nhis statements about Iran. In his 2008 book, he said:\n\n       At its core, there will always be a special and historic \n     bond with Israel, exemplified by our continued commitment to \n     Israel's defense.\n\n  And this is a statement made by an Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister \nwhose name is Danny Ayalon. This is what he said just recently:\n\n       Senator Hagel believes in the natural partnership between \n     Israel and the United States. Senator Hagel is proud of the \n     volume of defense relations between Israel and the United \n     States, which are so important for both countries. Hagel is a \n     true American Patriot and the support America gives Israel is \n     in America's interest, so I am optimistic.\n\n  Relative to Iran, this is what Senator Hagel has said about Iran:\n\n       Iran poses a significant threat to the United States, our \n     allies and partners, and our interests in the region and \n     globally. Iran continues to pursue an illicit nuclear program \n     that threatens to provoke a regional arms race and undermine \n     the global nonproliferation regime. Iran is one of the main \n     state sponsors of terrorism and could spark conflict, \n     including against U.S. personnel and interests.\n\n  He has also said that he is ``fully committed to President Obama's \ngoal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,'' and he has \nsaid that ``all options must be on the table to achieve that goal.'' He \nspecifically said that his policy will be that of the President's \npolicy--one of prevention and not containment.\n  Relative to sequestration--and we are facing sequestration--Senator \nHagel has said the following, which is also what Secretary Panetta has \nsaid.\n\n       Sequestration, if allowed to occur, would damage our \n     readiness, our people and our military families. It would \n     result in the grounding of aircraft and returning ships to \n     port, reducing the Department's global presence and ability \n     to rapidly respond to contingencies. Vital training would be \n     reduced by half of current plans and the Department would be \n     unable to reset equipment from Afghanistan in a timely \n     manner. The Department would reduce training and maintenance \n     for nondeploying units and would be forced to reduce \n     procurement of vital weapon systems and suffer the subsequent \n     schedule delays and price increases. Civilian employees would \n     be furloughed. All these effects negatively impact long-term \n     readiness as well. It would send a terrible signal to our \n     military and our civilian workforce, to those we hope to \n     recruit, and to both our allies and adversaries around the \n     world.\n\n  Mr. President, we must end this uncertainty about this position. It \nis time for us to end this debate, and that is what we will be voting \non now. Later on there will be a vote on whether to confirm Senator \nHagel. The vote now is whether to bring this debate to an end. I hope \nwe will do so and get on to the nomination vote.\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\n  I yield the floor, as I think it is noon and time for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as everyone in the Senate knows, and \npeople across the United States, with the sad passing of Senator Daniel \nInouye in December, there were a number of changes that were made in \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee--a committee which Senator Inouye \nskillfully chaired until his passing. He also chaired the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee and served our Nation with the kind of \nleadership that only a person with his distinguished military service \ncould give.\n  With this unfortunate change of events, I found myself unexpectedly \nin a new role as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I \nnever would have guessed 2 months before that it was even in the realm \nof possibility. Given this new role, I thought it was appropriate and \nworthwhile during the recent recess to take a firsthand look at some of \nwhat our military is doing in an often overlooked part of the world--\nAfrica--and in the nearby gulf.\n  Before I go any further, let me note how impressed I always am on \nthese trips that no matter where we go in any corner of the world, \nthere is an outpost of America's finest--our diplomatic personnel \nserving on the front lines and representing the best of our values. \nThey are often joined by American development and military personnel, \nhelping to improve the lives of host nation populations, providing \ntraining and security in the area.\n  I want to thank all of the Ambassadors, their staff, and others who \nmade great personal sacrifice to make my recent short, quick visit a \ngreat success.\n  My first stop last week was Uganda--a good friend of the United \nStates located in a difficult neighborhood of central Africa. Many know \nthat Uganda was recognized around the world for its early efforts to \nstem the spread of AIDS at a time when many other African nations were \nin complete denial. Some of that progress has waned over the years, but \nthere has been a renewed effort to rebuild on earlier success.\n  Uganda is also helping to lead negotiations with various factions \ninvolved in the violence in eastern Congo, also known as the rape \ncapital of the world. Last year, the armed rebel group M23 overran key \nparts of this eastern Congo, bringing further human suffering to an \nalready scarred part of Africa. I want to acknowledge the constructive \nrole Uganda has played in moving these talks forward.\n  Uganda is also home--originally--to the horrific actions of the \nLord's Resistance Army, an army group led by a messianic and violent \nwarlord named Joseph Kony. Kony and the LRA's brutality were once again \nin the spotlight last year when the group Invisible Children launched \nan online video detailing more than 20 years of brutal LRA violence, \nincluding murder, rape, kidnapping, and the dragooning of child \nsoldiers. To date, this video has had almost 100 million viewers.\n  In Uganda, I had the chance to meet with two impressive people who \nwere victims of the Lord's Resistance Army. They witnessed some \nhorrific acts.\n  One young man met with us at the Ambassador's residence. This Lord's \nResistance Army invaded his village, dragged all the young men out, put \nthem in a circle, and said: You are about to become soldiers in the \narmy. Before you become soldiers, though, you will be asked to kill \nyour family.\n  Many of them could not believe it. This young man said he was praying \nthey would spare his father. They\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nbrought his father in front of him and murdered him, as the child \nlooked on. Then he was brought into service for 6 months, roaming \nthrough the jungles, fighting on behalf of this Lord's Resistance Army, \nuntil there was an opportunity for him to escape. He has turned his \nlife around. It is hard to imagine anyone could after those horrible \nexperiences, but he has.\n  Next to him was Lilly, a beautiful young woman. She too was kidnapped \nby the Lord's Resistance Army and forced into unspeakable things for \nthe time she was under their control, until she too escaped.\n  The good news in both of those stories is they have made a life since \nthen, and they have tried to help others who have been victimized by \nthis kind of kidnapping. These horrible things are occurring in Africa, \nand we have decided to help. With the Ugandans, we are working to put \nJoseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army out of business. We have \npushed them out of Uganda. We now believe they are in the Central \nAfrican Republic.\n  In 2010, Congress passed a bill led by a former colleague and great \nchampion of Africa, a friend and former colleague of the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, called the Lord's \nResistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009, \nan important step forward--and it was. I was proud to cosponsor the \nbill. As a result, last year, President Obama--because of the Feingold \nlegislation--sent 100 U.S. military personnel to help the Ugandan Army \ntrack down and bring an end to the Lord's Resistance Army menace.\n  I met in the bush with our military in Uganda that was following up \non this Feingold legislation. I can't tell you what a remarkable job \nthey are doing under very difficult circumstances.\n  The LRA is on the run. Defections are increasing and formerly \nterrorized communities are starting to live without fear. There is \nstill more to be done, but I was impressed and proud of how the United \nStates stepped up and is doing something that will be remembered for \ngenerations by the Ugandan people.\n  Let me also take a moment to mention another issue in Uganda. There \nis a proposed law pending before the Parliament in Uganda that would \nliterally criminalize homosexuality, in some cases even imposing the \ndeath penalty. This is a cruel piece of legislation that has been met \nby global condemnation and concern. I met with the activists in Uganda \nwho fear for their personal safety if this bill becomes law, a fear \nthat I believe, unfortunately, is warranted.\n  I and others have appealed to the Ugandan Government not to tarnish \nits international reputation and impose criminal penalties against \npeople simply because of their sexual orientation. Uganda must continue \nto be a leader in the region, something this legislation will \nsubstantially erode. I hope ultimately common sense will prevail and \nthe Ugandan Parliament will not pass this terrible legislation.\n  While few have ever heard of a small, hardscrabble country in the \nHorn of Africa called Djibouti, it is one of the most strategic pieces \nof real estate in the world. Tens of thousands of ships pass through \nthe nearby shipping lanes every year. Over 30,000 vessels, 40 percent \nof all the ocean traffic in the world, passes this point. The country \nis surrounded by violence and instability, including Yemen, just 17 \nmiles away, and Somalia, their next-door neighbors.\n  We are fortunate, therefore, to have Camp Lemonnier located in \nDjibouti. It is a significant U.S. military base helping to bring \nsecurity and stability to a difficult neighborhood. It is not an easy \nlocation to do business. In the summer, temperatures reach 120 degrees. \nThere is not a tree in sight in Djibouti. The country is extremely poor \nand opportunities for recreation and escape are almost nonexistent.\n  These American service men and women are to be thanked for their \ndedication and long tours away from family and friends. They are \nplaying an important role in bringing greater security to the region \nand helping to dramatically reduce the scourge of piracy that has so \ndramatically impacted the waters in recent years.\n  USAID also has a major humanitarian distribution warehouse in \nDjibouti in which emergency food aid can be shipped quickly and \nefficiently throughout the region as far as Bangladesh.\n  Even in faraway Djibouti, there was a woman from Illinois helping \nwith this effort. I wish to recognize her work for a moment on the \nfloor. Her name is Christine Karpinski. She is from Chicago, and she is \npart of this USAID effort to save the lives of the most vulnerable \npeople in the world.\n  Let me also note Djibouti had elections last weekend, elections the \nopposition is claiming were fraudulent. I wasn't there as an election \nobserver, but certainly Djibouti can do more to open its political \nsystem. It took some notable steps with the current election, and I \nhope the postelection process can move forward in a peaceful manner. I \nalso hope the Djibouti Government and other foreign powers which have \nsignificant footprints there will do more to help its own people out of \npoverty.\n  What I saw there in terms of underdevelopment, particularly given the \nsizable sums being paid by foreign governments for base leases and a \npopulation of less than 1 million people, simply didn't add up. We and \nthe Government of Djibouti have a responsibility to do more for the \npeople who live there, especially the next generation of young people.\n  In Uganda, Djibouti, and so many countries in that region, we will \nfind 50 percent of the population under the age of 15. It is a reminder \nto us that the forces, the dynamic forces behind the Arab Spring in \nmany parts of the Middle East and northern Africa are at least evident \nin many of these other countries that haven't been touched yet by that \nchange.\n  Lastly, I had the opportunity to visit the small gulf nation of \nBahrain. It has been one of the more open and forward-thinking \ncountries in the gulf region. It is also a close U.S. ally, home to the \nU.S. Fifth Fleet and located in yet another difficult neighborhood \nbordering Iran, just across the straits.\n  Bahrain has been a generous host to our Fifth Fleet. Anyone who \nlooked at the map or followed tensions with Iran knows the importance \nof such a naval force in this part of the world. These dedicated \nsailors help keep shipping lanes open and ensure that Iran does not \nthreaten its neighbors or U.S. interests. Their presence alone is \nlikely to make Iran think twice about reckless moves in the Persian \nGulf.\n  Let me say a word about the Navy. I guess I am partial because my two \nlate brothers both served in the Navy during the Korean war. When I get \na chance to go aboard ships, I visualize my older brothers and what \nlife must have been like in those days. When I went out with ADM John \nMiller to visit some of the ships in the fleet, I met some of the \nfinest young men and women you could ever ask for. Most of them trained \nin Illinois at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station and now were off \nserving in the U.S. Navy around the world.\n  No one, unless they have some experience and knowledge of the \nsubject, could understand the enormity of the responsibility which \nthese men and women in the Navy have. We often hear about the heroic \nefforts of those who were in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force--and \nI certainly don't want to take anything away from them--but the \nimportant lifesaving peacekeeping jobs being done by the U.S. Navy, \nparticularly the Fifth Fleet that I visited, cannot be overstated.\n  Bahrain, incidentally, is going through its own domestic \ndifficulties. It experienced its own Arab Spring in early 2011, one \nthat started with a peaceful protest calling for a more open political \nprocess. That process unfortunately broke down and many demonstrators \nwere killed or jailed. Others, sadly, were tortured.\n  The Government of Bahrain did what few other countries in the region \nwould be willing or brave enough to do. They created an outside \ncommission to look into many issues around the uprising. A blunt and \nsober report was issued, and it is my hope the Government of Bahrain \nwill abide by many of its recommendations. At the same time, I hope the \nopposition will seriously explore the latest attempt at dialog offered \nby the government as a means to address the current political impasse.\n\n  Bahrain has so much promise and can continue to be one of the shining \nlights of the gulf. Both sides must renounce\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\nviolence and work toward a peaceful political solution.\n  Let me also note an overarching theme noted on this trip, one I \nmentioned before on the Senate floor, the role of China. Everywhere we \nwent we heard time and again how China is everywhere, often at the \nexclusion of American businesses, investment, and influence. This \npattern costs us not only lost jobs but lost diplomatic and security \nengagement.\n  That is why, last year, Senator Boozman and I introduced a bill to \ncreate a coordinated U.S. strategy to boost U.S. exports to Africa and \nin turn foster American jobs. This bipartisan bill cleared the Foreign \nRelations, Banking and Finance Committees only to be held up at the \nlast minute at the end of the year by Senator Toomey of Pennsylvania. \nTo his credit, he didn't do it in a secret manner; he came to the floor \nand objected.\n  Although I disagreed with him, I respected him for the fact that he \nstated his point of view. I would like to sit down with him again and \nany others who are skeptics about this legislation and let them know \nwhat I saw on this trip. Delaying the passing of this legislation costs \nus more than lost influence on the continent and jobs here at home.\n  It is going to be a squandered opportunity. Think about this. In the \nlast 10 years, the six fastest growing economies in the world were in \nAfrica. In the next 10 years, 8 of the top 10 will be in Africa. Where \nare we? We are playing a distant second fiddle to China.\n  What does that mean for the future? It isn't very encouraging. It is \ntime for us to step forward and show real American leadership in this \narea. I appeal to those who have opposed this Africa trade bill, which \nSenator Boozman and I have sponsored, to take a second look and \nreconsider their position.\n  It was an honor to visit our dedicated diplomatic, development, and \nmilitary personnel. It was a reminder of the importance of \nindispensable contributions to U.S. policy they still play around the \nworld in improving lives and ensuring security. These investments \nabroad are not only symbols of American generosity and values, they \nmake the world safer for everyone. We should keep this in mind when we \nconsider America's foreign assistance budget, one that includes \nmaintaining all our embassies around the world, is just over 1 percent \nof the total U.S. budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent any remaining time between now and 4:30 be \nequally divided and that time which is in quorum calls be equally \ndivided between those supporting and opposing the vote at 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have the honor of being the chair of \nthe U.S. Helsinki Commission representing this body. This is a \ncommission which was established in 1975 in order to implement the U.S. \nresponsibilities in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope. Its membership includes all the countries of Europe, as well as \nthe former Republics of the Soviet Union, Canada, and the United \nStates.\n  The main principles of Helsinki are we are interested in each other's \nsecurity. In order to have a secure nation, you need to have a nation \nthat respects the human rights of its citizens, which provides economic \nopportunity for its citizens, as well as the defense of their borders. \nWe also have partners for cooperation, particularly in the \nMediterranean area, that used the Helsinki principles in order to try \nto advance security in their region.\n  During this past recess, I took the opportunity to visit that region \non behalf of the U.S. Helsinki Commission. I was joined by several of \nour colleagues looking at the current security issues. Our first visit \nwas to Israel, and our main focus, quite frankly, was on Syria--what is \nhappening today in Syria.\n  In Israel, we had a chance to meet with the Israeli officials, and it \nwas interesting as to how many brought up the concerns about Syria. \nThey were concerned about Syria's impact on Israel's neighbors and what \nwas going to happen as far as security in that region.\n  While we were there, there was an episode on the Syrian-Israeli \nborder, and the Israelis provided health care to those who were \ninjured, providing humanitarian assistance. We thank the Israelis for \nproviding that humanitarian assistance.\n  It was interesting that the Israeli officials pointed out the concern \nabout the refugees who are leaving Syria going into neighboring \ncountries. We know the vast numbers. There are almost 1 million Syrians \nwho have left Syria for other countries because of the humanitarian \nconcerns. About one-quarter of a million have gone to Jordan, about \n280,000 are in Lebanon, about 281,000 in Turkey, another 90,000 in \nIraq, and 16,000 in Egypt.\n  Israel is concerned about the security of its neighbors and concerned \nabout how Jordan is dealing with the problems of the Syrian refugees, \nhow Lebanon is handling them. We note the concerns about Hezbollah \noperations in Lebanon and how that is being handled with the Syrian \nrefugee issue.\n  We had a chance to travel to Turkey when we left Israel. We met first \nwith the Turkish officials in Ankara, and we received their account as \nto what was happening in Syria and what Turkey was doing about it. We \nthen had a chance to visit the border area between Turkey and Syria.\n  We visited a refugee camp named Kilis, where there has been about \n18,000 Syrian refugees. We also had a chance to meet with the \nopposition leaders who were in that camp, as well as later when we were \nin Istanbul meeting with the opposition leaders from Syria.\n  I mention that all because the humanitarian crisis is continuing in \nthe country of Syria. The Assad regime is turning on its own people. \nOver 70,000 have been killed since the Arab Spring started in Syria. \nWhile we were there, the Assad regime used scud missiles against its \nown people, again killing Syrians and killing a lot of innocent people \nin the process. This is a humanitarian disaster.\n  I wish to mention one bright spot, if I might. We had a chance to \nvisit the camps, I said, in Kilis, on the border of Syria and Turkey, \nin Turkey. We had a chance to see firsthand how the Syrian refugees are \nbeing handled by the Turkish Government. I want to tell you, they are \ndoing a superb job. I think it is a model way to handle a situation \nsuch as this. They have an open border.\n  The border area at that point is controlled by the Syrian freedom \nfighters. They control that area. The Turks allowed the Syrians to come \nin and find a safe haven. The Turkish Government has built housing for \nthe refugees in the camp. We had a chance to see their children in \nschools. They are attending schools. They are getting proper food and \nproper medical attention. They have the opportunity to travel where \nthey want in Turkey, freedom of movement. They have the opportunity to \ngo back to Syria if they want to go back to Syria. The Turkish \nauthorities are providing them with a safe haven and adequate help. \nThey are doing this primarily with their own resources.\n  There is one other thing we observed when we were in this camp on the \nborder. We had a chance to meet with the elected representatives of the \nrefugees in Kilis. They actually had an election. They don't have that \nopportunity in Syria. They are learning how to cast their votes. They \nare learning what democracy is about. They are learning what \nrepresentation is about. We had a chance to talk to these \nrepresentatives about the circumstances in Syria and what we could do \nto help.\n  First, I want to point out there is still a tremendous need for the \ninternational community to contribute to the humanitarian needs of \nthose who are affected in Syria. There are approximately 4 million \nSyrians in need of humanitarian assistance. There are 2\\1/2\\ million \ninternally displaced people within Syria. The United States has taken \nthe lead as far as humanitarian aid, having provided $384 million. \nOther countries have stepped up but, quite frankly, more needs to be \ndone.\n  In talking with the opposition leaders--and we had a chance to talk \nto them in depth when we were in Istanbul--they expressed to us a sense \nof frustration that there hasn't been a better, more unified \ninternational response to the actions of the Assad regime--to what the \nAssad regime has\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\ndone to its own people--and to get Assad out of Syria. Quite frankly, \nthey understand--or, as we explained--some countries might be willing \nto provide a certain type of help; other countries may not. The United \nStates has provided nonlethal help, other countries are providing \nweapons, still other countries training. But we need to coordinate \nthat. The absence of coordination provides a void in which extreme \nelements are more likely to get into the opposition, and that is \nsomething we all want to make sure doesn't happen.\n  The message I took back from those meetings is that the United States \nneeds to be in the lead in coordinating the efforts of the opposition. \nWe made it clear, and I think the international community has made it \nclear, that Assad must go, and he should go to The Hague and be held \naccountable for his war crimes. He has no legitimacy to remain in power \nin Syria. That has been made clear and we underscored that point again. \nWe also underscored the point there is no justification for any \ncountry--any country--providing assistance to the Assad regime on the \nmilitary side. As we know, Russia and Iran have provided help. That is \nwrong. That is only adding to the problems and giving strength to a \nperson who has turned on his own people. But then we also need to \ncoordinate our attentions so we can provide the help they need and the \nconfidence they are looking for so they will have the necessary \ntraining not only to reclaim their country but then to rule their \ncountry in a democratic way that respects the rights of all of its \ncitizens.\n  As the Chair of the Helsinki Commission, I pointed that out to the \nSyrian opposition, that we want to provide the help so they can rule \ntheir country one day--we hope sooner rather than later--in a way that \nrespects the rights of all of its citizens and provides economic \nopportunity for its citizens, for that is the only way they will have a \nnation that respects the security of its country.\n  That was the message we delivered, and I hope the United States will \njoin other countries in a more concerted effort to get Assad out of \nSyria. As I said, I think he should be at The Hague and held \naccountable for his war crimes and held accountable for not allowing \nthe people of Syria to have a democratic regime.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                      Tenth Anniversary of PEPFAR\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise today, in this year of 2013, on \nthe tenth anniversary of the State of the Union Address given by \nPresident George W. Bush when he introduced a program known as PEPFAR--\nthe President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief--a program that has \nhad remarkable success in the last decade.\n  A lot of that success has taken place on the continent of Africa, \nwhere I just returned from my seventh trip in the last decade. This was \na trip where remarkable things were observed happening all over the \ncontinent in terms of AIDS infection being reduced, mother-to-child \ntransmission being in fact eliminated in many cases, and seeing that \nthe biggest challenge today for those who fall victim to AIDS is not \nthat they will die soon but that they will have the continuum of care \nnecessary to see to it they live a normal lifestyle with the \nantiretrovirals provided by PEPFAR.\n  It is important that the American taxpayers, the American people, \nthose of us in Congress recognize what has been achieved in the last \ndecade, for our taxpayers have invested billions of dollars on the \ncontinent of Africa to begin the process of trying to eliminate AIDS. \nWe cannot yet declare victory, but we can declare great victories in \nbattles along the way, and we are making more and more of them along \nthe way. Males are getting tested, females are getting tested, as they \nshould, and mothers are getting the care they need with antiretrovirals \nduring their pregnancies to prevent the transmission to their babies, \nand we are seeing a continuation of the progress of the great program \nstarted 10 years ago by this Congress, by President Bush, and by the \nAmerican people.\n  We are beginning to send the message, and we need to let the African \ncountries know, that we will be scaling down our investment and raising \ntheir participation at the government level. It is important to see to \nit that PEPFAR remains a viable program. In our visit of the past 7, 8, \nnow 9 days, I guess it was, we visited the Congo, we visited Mali, \nSenegal, Morocco, and we visited South Africa. In each and every \ncountry they are beginning the process of having more and more of their \nhealth professionals taking more and more of the responsibility of \ncaring for people, testing people, and distributing the \nantiretrovirals, which lessens the pressure on the budget of the United \nStates of America. But I think it is important to recognize that a \ndisease we feared was going to take much of the population of that \ncontinent--and ours, for that matter--10 years ago is now a disease \nthat is being managed and being reduced, and over time, we hope, we \nwill have a generation free of HIV/AIDS not only in America but around \nthe world.\n  There is a troubling event happening on the continent of Africa and \nin Asia, and that is there are those who are taking the volunteers who \ncome from our country and other organizations and actually stopping \nthem from giving inoculations and vaccinations to the people. Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, and Nigeria are the last three countries on Earth where \npolio still exists. A few weeks ago, in the Congo, in Nigeria, nine \nworkers were killed trying to give vaccinations to children in Nigeria \nbecause Islamic leaders in those countries had tried to tell them that \nin order to reduce the Arab population American donations of polio \nvaccine would in fact cause them to be impotent when they grew up. That \nis the farthest thing from the truth, but it is a wives' tale being \ntold to eliminate or keep vaccinations from getting to the people who \nneed them. In the country of Pakistan, since December 12, there have \nbeen five attacks on workers distributing vaccines trying to eliminate \npolio in Pakistan.\n  So as we celebrate the victories in terms of HIV/AIDS, polio, \nmalaria, and other diseases, we have to also recognize there is still \nignorance in some parts of the world that is prohibiting people who \nwill ultimately get sick and die from getting the vaccines necessary to \nkeep from contracting these difficult diseases. So I come to the floor \ntoday to recognize the great achievement of the American people in the \nwar against AIDS on the continent of Africa, and the creation of PEPFAR \nby George W. Bush, but also to send out a warning to those trying to \nprohibit the vaccinations and the antiretrovirals from getting to the \npeople who need them in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Because one \nday we want a generation free of HIV/AIDS and disease not just on the \ncontinent of North America or the continent of Africa but around the \nworld.\n  It is a tribute to the American medical community, the researchers \nand developers, the American people, and this Congress that the war on \nAIDS is still being engaged, and we are declaring victory after victory \non the battlefield. One day we hope we will have a generation free of \nAIDS not just in America but around the world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, what is the pending business before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the Hagel \nnomination.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas if in morning business for approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I was so excited when I came in because \nI have a new desk in the Senate. With seniority, I have now moved to \nthe row where giants in our institution once stood. This is the \nparticular seat which just a few weeks ago was held by John Kerry.\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\n  Although my desk location is new, I come to the floor with what seems \nto be a persistent pattern in the Senate and in the Congress, which is \nthat when faced with big problems that affect the fate of the Nation, \nlet's delay, let's blame, and let's not get to the work the American \npeople elected us to do.\n  I rise today to speak about sequester--something that was never, ever \nmeant to happen. It came out of the dark days of the debt ceiling \ndebacle in the summer of 2011 when we were facing a downgrade of the \nU.S. economy and a dysfunction of the Congress. In order to get us to \nthe table, we came up with an agreement to have a supercommittee that \nwould meet on both sides of the dome to come up with how we could begin \nto solve the serious fiscal issues facing the United States of America.\n  There was an insistence, yes, by one side of the aisle that we have a \ntrigger. And, yes, the President looked back on history.\n  What we have now is a situation where we said what we would propose \nas a trigger if we didn't get our act together, which we have not. We \nwould put into place something so serious, so Draconian, so \nunthinkable, so unworkable that we would solve the problems through \nregular order and find that sensible center Colin Powell has so often \ntalked about. Well, the supercommittee collapsed--not because there \nweren't the great efforts of people such as Senators Murray and Durbin \nand Members over at the House, such as Maryland's very own Chris Van \nHollen.\n  Then we were faced with New Year's Eve. We had put it off to New \nYear's Eve and after the election, and here we were--while people were \nwearing funny hats all over America, we were doing funny things. And \nwhat did we do again? We put off sequester for 2 months--again not \nsolving the problem.\n  Well, now we have a rendezvous. On March 1, sequester will happen.\n  I am opposed to sequester. I think it is bad policy for our country. \nIt will hurt our economy. It will exacerbate the fragile job situation \nwe have. It will affect not only government employees but those who \nwork in private sector jobs because of the Federal Government.\n  I support what was originally intended: a balanced approach that \nwould look at increased revenues--particularly plugging up tax \nloopholes, particularly getting rid of tax-break earmarks--along with \nstrategic cuts in spending and a review of mandatory spending to see \nhow else we could get more value for our dollar.\n  I am going to speak tomorrow about the impact on science, technology, \ninnovation, and jobs. Today I want to speak about my own beloved State \nof Maryland and the people who work there.\n  Maryland is home not only to the Super Bowl champions but to Nobel \nPrize winners and also people who work every day to help create the \njobs today and the jobs tomorrow.\n  I have the honor of representing 130,000 Federal employees.\n  They say: Wow, how many of them can we get rid of?\n  Well, why would we want to get rid of the people who work at the \nSocial Security Administration? These are the people who calculate the \neligibility for the benefits in regular Social Security and in \ndisability.\n  Why would we want to get rid of anybody who works for the Food and \nDrug Administration, people who every day are analyzing clinical trials \nto see if they can be moved to pharmaceutical or biotech or medical \ndevice production, ensuring that when they come out into clinical \npractice, they are safe, they have efficacy, they can be taken by the \nAmerican people, and we can export them around the world? Why would we \nwant to get rid of anybody at FDA who is helping make sure our drug \nsupply is safe?\n\n  How about the food inspectors? Right now, one of the turbo engines of \nmy Eastern Shore economy is seafood production and poultry production. \nYou can't have poultry production unless you have food inspectors. When \nwe start laying off or furloughing food inspectors, it is going to \naffect those private sector jobs. If you don't have an inspector, you \nare not going to be able to have those companies working with the same \nlevel of production.\n  Hundreds of thousands more work because of the Federal Government, \niconic contractors, particularly in defense and also at NASA Goddard, \nwhich is our space science center. Yes, there are 3,000 civil servants, \nbut there are also thousands of contractors. And what are they facing? \nLayoffs, furloughs, pay cuts, and lousy morale. What are they worried \nabout? Their future. And they wonder whether they should give us \nanother future. Make no mistake; we are not only going to hurt our \neconomy, but there is an anti-incumbent fever developing around the \ncountry.\n  Now, as we look at solving the problems, there are those who want to \nprotect lavish tax breaks or tax earmarks for a few. I want to stand up \nhere for the many, not only the people who are multimillionaires or \nbillionaires who can take a tax deduction on their corporate jets. I am \nfor the people who are working every day right now to find a cure for \nAlzheimer's, to find a cure for autism, to find a cure for AIDS, to \nfind help a cure for the arthritic, and most recently not only what is \ndone by government but even what is done in private institutions. \nWithin the last few weeks at Johns Hopkins University, under Federal \nhelp from the Veterans' Administration, on an American war veteran from \nIraq who had lost both arms, Hopkins was able to perform surgery that \ndid the first successful arm transplant. Doesn't that bring tears? That \nhappened because of the genius of the Hopkins personnel, with financial \nhelp from the VA to do the kind of research to make sure that not only \nthe surgery was a success but also that the autoimmune suppression was \nalso.\n  This is what the American people want us to do to not only help that \nveteran, but what we learn through the VA will also then move into \ncivilian clinical practice.\n  We have to come up with a solution where government is doing the job \nto help the American people with compelling human needs or America is \ndoing the job that enables other people to keep their jobs or protect \ntheir livelihoods--for example, weather. People watch the Weather \nChannel and say: Isn't that Cantore great? I love Cantore. We even \ntweet each other from time to time. But Jim Cantore and the Weather \nChannel get a lot of their information from the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. That is the agency in Maryland that runs \nthe weather forecast for all of America, predicting hurricanes, \ntornadoes, and it also ties up with the global weather prediction \nsystem that protects our ships at sea--civilian, cargo, military--as \nwell as whether airlines can fly or not.\n  When we look at our legislation we have to know that there are real \nconsequences to those employees. The numbers sound like a lot, but \ntheir contribution to saving lives and saving livelihoods is enormous.\n  Then we look at compelling human need. Do the American people really \nwant to protect people not paying taxes on their second million over \nHead Start? If the sequester goes into effect, we are going to have a \nterrible effect on special education. Special education teachers would \nbe affected, and it would be an across-the-board cut in education. The \nsame with title I. Maryland would lose over $14 million.\n  Federal law enforcement is something I know you are very keenly \ninterested in, Mr. President. If the sequester goes into effect, it is \ngoing to affect over 1,000 Federal agents--at the FBI, at the Drug \nEnforcement Agency, at the Marshals Service. We don't know much about \nour Marshals Service. They are so quiet and efficient. Do you know what \nthey do? They protect our judges at the Federal courthouses. You \nremember some got shot or wounded. It also serves warrants for runaway \nfugitives, and it also enforces the law on sexual predators in our \ncountry. Do we really want to furlough these men and women? I don't \nthink so.\n  Then there is the FBI. The FBI is crucial not only in mortgage fraud, \nfinancial fraud, but now the world of cyber. Do you know, last year in \nAmerica there were 300 bank robberies? That is a terrible number if you \nare one of those banks. But there were thousands of attacks by cyber on \nour American financial institutions, of which the FBI was prime time. \nDo we really want to lay them off? No, I don't think so.\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\n  There is another issue of safety, and that goes to aviation safety. I \nam deeply concerned about the cut in air traffic control with \nfurloughs, layoffs, or asking even fewer to work longer hours. We \ncannot have it.\n  When we think about law enforcement, it also cuts Border Patrol. I am \nfor comprehensive immigration reform, but I am also for protecting \nAmerican borders. We now have 57,000 border control agents, a \nsurprising number. If the sequester goes in, we could be forced to lay \noff or furlough 5,000 of them. Do you know what a furlough is? It says \nto someone who is going to be out there in the desert facing those who \nengage in the illegal traffic of people, guns, or drugs: While you are \nout there in that hot Sun, you are in harm's way, putting your life in \ndanger, we are going to ask you only to work 4 days a week, and we are \ngoing to furlough you one-fifth of the time. To that border control \nagent being furloughed, that is a 20-percent cut.\n  I will say this: If the Federal employees are going to take a 20-\npercent cut and be furloughed, we should take a 20-percent cut. I think \nI should be treated like my Social Security employees, like my NIH \nemployees working for cures, like FDA, the food inspectors, the people \ninspecting cargo coming into the Port of Baltimore or looking for \nillegal cargo coming into our airports. If they take a hit we should \ntake a hit, and I look forward to moving on that legislation.\n  I hope we do not get to that point--not for me to protect my pay, but \nto protect their future; to say, America, we believe in what you are \ndoing, and we want to protect you so you can do your job for America \ninstead of protecting all these breaks for billionaires.\n  People can say: Didn't we do the tax break thing New Year's Eve with \nBiden and McConnell? Yes. It was a nonpayment, but there are lots and \nlots of very juicy loopholes or tax breaks--tax breaks for sending jobs \noverseas, tax breaks for reductions on corporate jets.\n  Do we need those? Those are really earmarks. A tax earmark goes to \npeople in a particular class, and it lasts indefinitely. While we are \nwaiting for comprehensive tax reform, let's go after some of these and \ncome up with a balanced approach for revenue.\n  Mr. President, I know you were a Governor so you know about bond \nratings. In my State of Maryland and my large counties, they are going \nto be affected by sequester because as the Federal Government goes, \nMoody's rates our bond rating. Maryland could lose millions of dollars \nand have to pay high interest rates on bonds.\n  This is going to have a terrible impact, particularly in the area of \nschool construction. It will cost hundreds if not thousands of jobs in \nnot building schools we need or roads that need repair or water systems \nthat need to be upgraded.\n  People say: Oh, well, that is government. That is the way it is. Mr. \nPresident, I want you to realize if in fact people begin to lose their \njobs or get furloughed and lose a big part of their income, they are \nnot going to be spending money in the local economy, the real economy. \nIt also means they will not be giving to their charitable \norganizations. It is regrettable, but if you have less money to spend \nand you save it somewhere for your family, you are not going to be \ngiving to the United Way, to that great Federal campaign.\n  The lab assistant at NIH who is facing losing her job is not going to \ngive to her favorite charity. The customs official at Thurgood Marshall \nAirport is not going to have the same disposable income to make sure \nthey give again to the United Way.\n  We have to stop sequester. Thursday I will be joining with my \ncolleagues, my Democratic colleagues. We have a plan. Our plan is \nsimple and straightforward: We come up with $86 billion. Half of that \nis in revenue. What does that mean? It means we come up with money for \nthe Buffett rule. It was argued by Warren Buffett when he said he \nshould pay the same rate of taxes as his secretary.\n  What that means is that on his second million--not his first; we \nbelieve in entrepreneurship, the job creators, et cetera. But on his \nsecond million he will pay the same rate as somebody who makes $55,000 \na year.\n\n  The other is we want to close a loophole sending jobs overseas. For \ntoo long we have rewarded exporting jobs while we should have a Tax \nCode that rewards export of products, whether it is that great \npharmaceutical industry or art, protecting intellectual property, and \nso on.\n  We have come up with that, and then we have a cut in the farm subsidy \nprogram where we will no longer pay people not to plant. That will be \nabout $27 billion. Then, yes, we do cut defense, but that doesn't \ntrigger until 2015 when our troops are home from Afghanistan. We never \nwant to, through our budget problems, put our troops into harm's way.\n  I wanted to share what is going to happen. In my State we represent \nmany great Federal iconic agencies that moved to Maryland in the early \n1930s, 1940s, and 1950s when real estate was so high in Washington, DC. \nI am so proud of them. They win the Nobel prizes. They help us win the \nmarkets.\n  They are coming up with the new jobs, the new ideas for the new jobs \nfor tomorrow. They are out there--for example, the Coast Guard--making \nsure the Chesapeake Bay is safe or they are dealing with our customs. \nMoney is going to the University of Maryland, to Johns Hopkins, to not \nonly help our veterans get new arms but to get a new life. Isn't that \nwhat the people want?\n  We can be more frugal. We have to be sensible, but let's not do \nsequester. It is bad money management, and we can do better. What we \ncannot do is continue to delay and put the entire burden on \ndiscretionary spending. Let's stand up, let's be counted, let's have a \nvote on Thursday. I do hope the Democratic alternative prevails.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, following my remarks I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before Senator Mikulski, the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee, leaves the floor, I want to thank her for her \nvery hard work along with several colleagues putting together a plan \nthat is a commonsense plan to avoid this sequester, these automatic, \nsenseless spending cuts. It was not easy to do, but I think they \nfigured out a way to pay for it, as she described, called the Buffett \nrule, which basically says to a multimillionaire: We think it is only \nfair that you pay the same effective tax rate as your secretary.\n  If you were to ask anyone on the street, any party--Republican, \nDemocratic--if they think that is the right way to go, I am convinced \n90 percent of the people would say: Of course. I thank her. I know \nSenator Inouye is looking down and smiling because his successor, \nSenator Mikulski, is doing such a great job already.\n  I rise as a Senator from California. Senator Feinstein and I \nrepresent 38 million people. Anything that happens around here comes \ndown very hard on our State--or if it is a good thing, it is very good \nfor our State. What we are facing is not a good thing, the sequester. \nIt is a self-inflicted wound that will harm our economy.\n  I have to say, when I listened to Speaker Boehner over there--he is \nrefusing to do anything about it. He says, and I will not quote him \nbecause it would be language not acceptable, but he basically said in \nthe press, and it is written there--I urge everyone to see it--that the \nSenators ought to get off their ``blank'' and get to work and get \nsomething done.\n  I am proud to say we have an alternative to the sequester. Senator \nMikulski laid it out. I believe we have a majority vote in this Senate \nfor that plan.\n  I hope our colleagues will not filibuster. Let's have that up-or-down \nvote because when you are looking at job losses into the hundreds of \nthousands--and that is certainly true in my State and the country as a \nwhole--no one should filibuster a plan that would stave off that pain.\n  How did we get to this place? In 2011 the Republicans decided to hold \nour country hostage over raising the debt ceiling. We know if we do not \npay our bills--which is what the debt ceiling is about--this country is \ngoing to face default, and our credit rating is going to be lowered. \nEven though we finally resolved this thing at the eleventh hour, we \nstill caused the downgrade the time\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\nbefore. This time we averted another downgrade, but it is very \nimportant that we remember why we got to this place of facing this \nsequester. The Republicans played games with the debt ceiling again.\n  Even though under Ronald Reagan, their hero--and, by the way, I think \neven Ronald Reagan would have a hard time getting into the Republican \nParty these days because Ronald Reagan said you should never play games \nwith the debt; even talking about the debt is a problem. We raised the \ndebt when Ronald Reagan was President; 18 times we raised the debt \nceiling. But all of a sudden, when there is a Democratic President, \nthey are playing games. That is wrong. Obviously, we didn't want to see \nanother downgrade. We had already seen a delay the last time, which \ncost us $1.3 billion, in borrowing costs alone.\n\n  In order to avert this, on August 2, 2011, we enacted the Budget \nControl Act. When it became law, we were within hours of defaulting on \nour debts. The Budget Control Act allowed us to raise the debt ceiling, \nbut on the condition that a ``supercommittee'' find $1.2 trillion in \ncuts or force a trigger of across-the-board cuts known as \nsequestration.\n  Straight from my heart, I say this: No one thought the sequester \nwould go forward. Everyone thought the pain to the economy would be so \ngreat that everybody would sit down and resolve it. But here is what is \ngoing on right now. Democrats say the way to resolve it and avert the \nsequester is to have dollar-for-dollar spending cuts and increases in \nrevenues. Republicans say 100-percent spending cuts and they would \nprefer to do no defense cuts and have it all come out of education, \ntransportation, medical research, law enforcement, the environment. \nThat is what their plan was last year. So let's face it. No one thought \nwe would get to this point, but we are at this point.\n  What is the choice? I think it is pretty clear what the choice is. It \nis the Democratic plan, which is a growing economy, versus the \nRepublican plan, which is a sequester, which is a slowing economy. When \nI say that, I mean it.\n  Mark Zandi, who is one of the leading economists in the country, said \nif sequestration goes forward, it would cut a half of a point off our \neconomic growth. What does that mean? It means jobs lost. I have to \nsay, when I look at my State, this is not a pretty picture.\n  The Los Angeles Times, in an article by Ricardo Lopez and Richard \nSimon today, says: ``California braces for impending cuts from Federal \nsequestration.'' I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 25, 2013]\n\n    California Braces for Impending Cuts From Federal Sequestration\n\n                  (By Ricardo Lopez and Richard Simon)\n\n       California's defense industry is bracing for a $3.2-billion \n     hit with the federal budget cuts that are expected to take \n     effect Friday.\n       But myriad other federally funded programs also are \n     threatened, and the combined effect is expected to slow the \n     momentum that California's economy has been building over the \n     last year.\n       As the state braces for pain from so-called sequestration, \n     there are warnings of long delays at airport security \n     checkpoints, potential slowdowns in cargo movement at harbors \n     and cutbacks to programs, including meals for seniors and \n     projects to combat neighborhood blight.\n       Despite the grim scenarios from local and state officials, \n     economists say the cuts' overall blow to the economy would be \n     modest, felt more acutely in regions such as defense-heavy \n     San Diego and by Californians dependent on federal programs, \n     such as college students who rely on work-study jobs to pay \n     for school.\n       Critics say the cuts come at an inopportune time because \n     the economic recovery in the U.S. and California is still \n     weak.\n       ``We need stimulus, not premature austerity,'' Gov. Jerry \n     Brown said during a break at the National Governors Assn. \n     meeting in Washington.\n       Rep. John Campbell (R-Irvine) contends that critics of the \n     cuts are exaggerating the effects.\n       ``If we can't do this, what can we do'' to reduce \n     Washington's red ink, he asked. ``We ought to be panicked \n     about the day when people won't buy our debt anymore because \n     we borrowed too much.''\n       If automatic spending cuts occur as planned, the growth in \n     the country's gross domestic product is likely to slow by 0.4 \n     percentage points this year, from about 2% to 1.6%, \n     economists said.\n       California's GDP would see a similar slowdown. The state \n     stands to lose as much as $10 billion in federal funding this \n     year, according to Stephen Levy, director of the Center for \n     Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.\n       Levy said the more than $1 trillion in cuts planned over \n     the next decade include ``items in the federal budget that \n     invest for the future,'' such as support for research and \n     clean energy, that particularly affect California because of \n     its ``innovation economy.''\n       The ripple effects the cuts might have on business and \n     consumer confidence--which would further dampen economic \n     activity--remain to be seen, said Jason Sisney, a deputy at \n     the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.\n       ``We're at a point where gains in housing and construction \n     markets have begun to take hold,'' Sisney said. ``A slowdown \n     from sequestration would come at just the moment that the \n     economy was beginning to right itself.''\n       Jerry Nickelsburg, a UCLA economist who writes a quarterly \n     economic forecast on the Golden State, said the state's \n     recent economic gains would provide a buffer against \n     sequestration.\n       ``California can absorb it,'' Nickelsburg said. ``Will it \n     slow economic growth? The answer is yes. Will it result in \n     negative economic growth? I think the answer is no.''\n       Los Angeles officials project that the city would lose more \n     than $100 million at a time when they're struggling to close \n     a hole in the city's budget.\n       Douglas Guthrie, chief executive of the Los Angeles city \n     housing authority, said Monday that rent subsidies to as many \n     as 15,000 low-income families would be cut an average $200 a \n     month, forcing many families to search for less expensive \n     housing. His agency also might face as many as 80 layoffs in \n     an already reduced workforce.\n       But Guthrie said in a letter to the Los Angeles City \n     Council that the housing authority must plan for the \n     ``painful consequences'' of the federal budget cuts and is \n     preparing to send warning notices to participants in the \n     housing assistance program ``as soon as we see that the cuts \n     are made and there are no immediate prospects to resolve the \n     budget crisis.''\n       At Yosemite National Park, snow plowing of a key route over \n     the Sierra would be delayed, ranger-led programs are likely \n     to be reduced and the park would face ``less frequent trash \n     pickup, loss of campground staff, and reduced focus on food \n     storage violations, all of which contribute to visitor safety \n     concerns and increased bear mortality rates,'' according to \n     the National Park Service.\n       Some programs, such as Social Security, would be spared \n     from the $85 billion in cuts nationwide due to kick in \n     Friday. But defense programs are expected to be cut by about \n     13% for the remainder of the fiscal year and domestic \n     spending by about 9%, according to the White House budget \n     office.\n       The Obama administration sought Monday to highlight the \n     effects close to home in an effort to step up the pressure on \n     Congress to replace across-the-board cuts with more targeted \n     reductions and new tax revenue collected from taxpayers \n     earning more than $1 million a year.\n       The Los Angeles Unified School District is bracing for a \n     loss of $37 million a year in federal funding. Supt. John \n     Deasy said Monday that he is sending a letter to the \n     California congressional delegation warning about the \n     ``potential very grave impact'' of the cuts on Los Angeles \n     schools.\n       Rachelle Pastor Arizmendi, director of early childhood \n     education at the Pacific Asian Consortium for Employment in \n     Los Angeles, said she anticipated that the cuts would cost \n     her agency $980,000 in federal Head Start funding. That would \n     force PACE to eliminate preschool for about 120 children ages \n     3 to 5.\n       ``It's not just a number,'' she said. ``This is closing \n     down classrooms. This is putting our children behind when \n     they're going to kindergarten.''\n       The nonprofit serves about 2,000 children, providing most \n     of them two meals a day in addition to preschool education. \n     The cuts would mean PACE would have to lay off four of its 20 \n     teachers, forcing the closure of eight Head Start classrooms, \n     Arizmendi said.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Our Governor makes the point--he has a way of getting to \nthe point: ``We need stimulus, not premature austerity,'' said Gov. \nJerry Brown.\n  The Republicans have become the austerity party and the Democrats \nhave become the jobs party. I think people want jobs. There are still \ntoo many long-term unemployed. We have a stubbornly high unemployment \nrate. There is no question about it.\n  Jerry Nickelsburg, a UCLA economist who writes a quarterly economic \nforecast on the Golden State--my State--said: The State's recent \neconomic gains would provide a buffer against sequestration, but would \nit slow economic growth? Yes. Why would we do something like this, a \nself-inflicted wound, when there is an easy way to get out of it, which \nis to put into place a rule that says on a person's second million \ndollars, once they get to that point, they are going to pay an \neffective tax rate equal to their secretary? Give me a break. This is \nthe greatest country on Earth, and the people I know who live in \nCalifornia, for the most part, in the wealthy brackets\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nare very happy to pay their fair share. They want to pay their fair \nshare. They want to give back. They love this country. It gave them \neverything. A lot of them started with nothing.\n  So we have the two plans. The Democratic plan was outlined by Senator \nMikulski and we are going to vote on it on Thursday. I pray to God it \nis not filibustered and a majority will rule and we will get it done. \nIt will create a growing economy because it is a balanced plan with \nhalf cuts, half revenues.\n  Then there is a Republican plan which we don't know yet, but the one \nthey passed in the House doubled down on the cuts to education, the \nenvironment, transportation, and left defense alone. That is not fair, \nand that is a sure way we are going to lose hundreds of thousands of \njobs.\n  I wish to share a picture with my colleagues. I don't know if people \ncan see this, but it is on the front page of the Washington Post and it \nis a picture of a shipyard worker. The look on his face I can only \ndescribe as frightened. As a matter of fact, when I saw the photo, \nwithout seeing what the story was about, I thought, This man is \nexpecting some terrible gloom and doom to occur. And, yes, it is his \nfear that he will be laid off. He said his wife is pregnant and he \ndoesn't have a second source of income in the family and he is \ndesperate.\n  We just went through that. Why would we ever do it again? And people \nsay to me, What is going to happen? How will I feel it back home? Will \nI have a longer wait at the airport? Yes, you might. Will I go to the \nNational Park Service and it may be closed down? Yes. Will job training \ncenters, some of them, shut down? Yes. There is a list of what will \nhappen.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nconsequences of the sequester cuts nationwide.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   The Consequences of Sequester Cuts\n\n\n                              to Education\n\n       70,000 Children From Head Start\n       10,000 Teacher Jobs\n       7,200 Special Education Teachers\n       2,700 Schools From Receiving Title 1 Funds, Cutting Support \n     for 1.2 Million Students\n\n\n                            to Public Health\n\n       424,000 HIV Tests Conducted by CDC\n       25,000 Breast and Cervical Cancer Screenings\n       804,000 Outpatient Visits to Indian Health\n       Service Hospitals and Clinics\n       2,100 Food Inspections\n       4 Million Meals Served to Seniors Through\n       Programs Like Meals on Wheels\n       600,000 Women and Children From Receiving Nutrition \n     Assistance\n       1,000 NSF Grants--Impacting 12,000 Scientists and Students\n       $902 Million From SBA Loan Guarantees for Small Businesses\n\n\n                         to Security and Safety\n\n       1,000 FBI Agents and Other Law Enforcement Personnel\n       1,000 Criminal Cases From Being Prosecuted by U.S. \n     Attorneys\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are looking at 70,000 children not being able to go to \nHead Start. We are looking at 10,000 teacher jobs. We are looking at \n7,200 special ed teachers--we know those special ed teachers; they are \nangels from heaven who work with kids who can't even sometimes manage \nto get dressed in the morning by themselves.\n  Then: 2,700 schools won't receive title I funds, cutting support for \n1.2 million children who need help learning to read. Tell me, does this \nmake sense, when all we have to do is ask someone earning a second \nmillion dollars to pay the same effective rate as a secretary? I don't \nget it.\n  How about 424,000 HIV tests conducted by the CDC won't happen, so \nsomeone is going to sneak through and give HIV to someone else? Really, \nthat is not a smart thing. Twenty-five thousand breast and cervical \ncancer screenings will not take place, and some poor woman who might \nhave had a chance to catch breast cancer at an early stage is thrown \noverboard. Eight hundred thousand outpatient visits to Indian hospitals \nand clinics. Food inspections. Just the time to cut back on food \ninspections. How about 4 million meals will be cut that would have been \nserved to seniors through programs such as Meals-on-Wheels. Four \nmillion seniors won't get that. And what if they don't have a loving \nchild to take care of them or what if they don't have a neighbor to \ntake care of them? Six hundred thousand women and children won't \nreceive nutrition assistance, and we have a lot of hungry people in \nthis great country of ours; scientific grants to find cures for the \ndiseases that plague our families, whether they are rich or poor or \nanywhere in the middle, to find the cures for Alzheimer's, to find the \ncures for diabetes. Small businesses that do so well when they get that \nlittle seed money--$902 million cut from there.\n  Then: 1,000 FBI agents and other law enforcement personnel, and that \nis because we are just so safe in our communities. I have gone around \nmy State and not one person ever came up to me and said, I want less \nenforcement in my neighborhood. It is just too much. It is too safe. \nNot one person ever told me, oh, don't bother checking my air or my \nwater quality; I am just fine.\n  So if we take these cuts and we apply them to our States, we will \nfind out what happens and it is not a pretty picture. Los Angeles alone \ncould lose as much as $115 million in Federal grants, just in the first \n6 months of 2013. Community development, public safety, I have been \nthrough it.\n  We don't have to inflict this pain on the American people. Everything \nI said relates to jobs. All of those cuts, what do they mean? Real \npeople who do real things in the community such as law enforcement, \nteaching our kids, et cetera, will lose their jobs, not to mention \npeople in the Defense Department who are making sure we are always safe \nand ready. That is why we see the look on his face, because he is \npotentially one of those people.\n  In closing, I want to thank those who have put together a package for \nus, and I have a plea to my Republican friends: Do not filibuster this. \nToo many lives are at stake. Too many jobs are at stake. Put your plan \nforward, get a vote on it if you have a plan or if your plan is to let \nsequester go through, let's see that vote again, and let us have our \nvote on our plan to avoid this pain and suffering people are going to \nfeel.\n  I actually have one more point to make and then I will turn to my \nfriend from Arkansas. We hear a lot of posturing from my Republican \nfriends about how the Democrats are such big spenders and all they want \nto do is spend and tax and tax and spend. What party led the way to the \nfirst balanced budget in almost 30 years? I will give my colleagues a \nclue: It was not the Republican Party. It was the Democratic Party. \nWhen Bill Clinton was President, we not only balanced the budget but we \nleft George W. Bush a surplus of $281 billion.\n  By the way, I happened to be here when we voted on the budget plan \nand we did not have one vote to spare. We did it ourselves.\n  What did George W. Bush do with this huge surplus? He squandered it. \nHe put two wars on the credit card, never paid for them; gave tax \nbreaks to people who didn't need them, and handed President Obama a \n$1.2 trillion deficit, which is now projected to be $850 billion for \n2013. It is going in the right direction under a Democratic President. \nWe want to get that down and we can get that down, and we can work \ntogether to get that down, but we do not have to do this sequester. \nHistory has shown us the balanced approach we used when Bill Clinton \nwas President of smart investments in things that help our people such \nas job training and education and lifting up our children, and making \nsure they don't go hungry--those kinds of investments pay off in a \nsociety.\n  We have 23 million jobs. Under George W. Bush, we lost jobs: George \nW. Bush, we lost jobs. And this President, our President who just got \nreelected, is following the model of Bill Clinton: a balanced approach \nto deficit reduction, investments in things we need, cutting things we \ndon't need, and working together.\n  I say if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. We \nare coming out of the greatest recession since the Great Depression, \nand we cannot afford to have this sequester. We need to avert it, come \ntogether with a balanced plan of cuts and revenues, not just the cuts-\nonly approach, the austerity approach of the Republicans.\n  I hope they don't filibuster our approach and let us have an up-or-\ndown vote and pass this with a majority.\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues very much, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my Senate colleague from California \nfor her remarks and also want to finish one point she was making there \nat the end. But before I do, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the final 20 minutes prior to the vote be equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Levin and Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I want to thank Senator Boxer for her comments on \nbalancing the budget. One of the things we need to understand is that \nwe can do this. It was not that long ago when President Clinton was \nelected and he focused on balancing the budget. He made it a priority \nof his administration. He made it a Democratic priority for the \nDemocratic Party. They passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1993. It \npassed without one Republican vote in this Chamber and without one \nRepublican vote in the House Chamber. But nonetheless it did pass. It \nprobably caused some people some elections a couple years later, but \nnonetheless it was the right thing to do. It got us on the course to \nfiscal stability. It took 4 years, but we did balance the budget.\n  But there is one thing we also need to mention as we talk about that. \nOne advantage Bill Clinton had that we have not had in the last few \nyears is a robust, vibrant, and growing economy. He had the longest \neconomic expansion in U.S. history. That did not happen by accident. \nThat took a lot of work. It took a lot of bipartisan effort here in the \nU.S. Senate, there in the U.S. House of Representatives, and down at \n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It had Governors working together. It had all \nof us working together to try to make sure we got the economy back on \ntrack because if the economy is growing, the revenues improve, and also \nyour safety net programs are not hit nearly as hard.\n  So one of the things we need to focus on as a Congress--certainly as \na Senate--is we need to focus on growing the U.S. economy. That brings \nme to my discussion today about sequestration.\n  When we look at the analysis on what sequestration could do to the \nU.S. economy, there could be 750,000 jobs lost in this economy. That is \na .6 percent shrinkage of the economy by the end of this year. We are \nnot talking about somewhere way down the road, out in the outyears. We \nare talking about at the end of this year it will have a negative \nimpact on the U.S. economy. That is going to continue to hurt our debt \nand deficit problem. We need to do all we can to avoid this and to grow \nthe U.S. economy. We need a growing U.S. economy. There should not be \ngovernment policies that are shrinking the economy. We should be \ngrowing the economy.\n  I wish to say, if you look at the numbers for government employees--\nand I think a lot of the news media has focused on government \nemployees. There has been a lot of discussion in the press conferences \nand there is all the blame game that has been going on, and I want to \ntalk about that in a few moments. But if you look at the numbers in the \npublic sector--the Federal employees who will either be laid off or \nfurloughed or for whatever reason will not be able to function--those \nare big numbers. But that only tells part of the story. In fact, that \nonly tells a small part of the story because this sequester is going to \nharm the private sector much more than it harms the public sector.\n  This is something we should understand, that the American people \nshould understand. I would hope the American people would insist we \nwork together to get something done here in the next few days if \npossible, certainly in the next few weeks to avoid this sequester.\n  In my State of Arkansas, there are 91 poultry and meat processing \nfacilities that will have to close their doors at least at some point \nbecause they do not have meat inspectors and food inspectors on site. \nThat is 91 facilities. That is a lot of employees. We have employees at \n52 Arkansas FSA offices. These are Department of Ag offices that are \nout around the counties to help people in the farming industry, to give \nthem some government resources, advice, et cetera. Fifty-two of those \noffices are not going to close their doors, but they are going to have \nto furlough their employees. There is no doubt they will be at partial \nstrength instead of full strength at a very critical time for farmers \nall over the State of Arkansas.\n  Also, we have an FDA facility there, the National Center for \nToxicological Research, and it is going to be cut by an estimated $3 \nmillion. Well, that facility is a nice little economic engine for that \npart of the State. That means when they cut it, it is going to have a \nnegative ripple effect, an adverse ripple effect in that part of our \nState's economy.\n  I know in this Chamber and in this town there is a lot of discussion \nabout making the government small and how we should cut the government \nand how the government should be lean and all that. Do you know what. A \nlot of that I do not disagree with. But I do think it is important for \nall of us, as responsible policymakers, to understand the reality that \nwhether we like it or not--and many of us have philosophical \ndisagreements on this; and I am not trying to get into that, but \nwhether we like it or not, our government is very intertwined in the \nU.S. economy, our government is a critical part of the U.S. economy.\n\n  So you take something like the food industry--and I am chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture--if you take something \nas basic as agriculture--something that may not be very sexy, that does \nnot get a lot of headlines, that people do not think a lot about \nbecause we take it for granted in this country that we are going to \nhave a good, healthy, robust food supply, but that does not have to be \nthe case. It certainly is not the case in most countries around the \nworld. We are very spoiled. We are very fortunate in this country to \nhave that. But the agricultural sector cannot function without the \ngovernment.\n  Again, we have a safe food supply. We need inspectors out there to \nmake sure that meat and other foods that are being processed get that \nUSDA seal of approval--grade A, whatever it is. That means something. \nIf we cannot know our food is safe, then we have diminished what it \nmeans to live in this country. We do not want to get into that. Let's \navoid that. This is avoidable.\n  I know a lot of Arkansans, when I talk to them, say: Can't you all do \nsomething? Can't you work together? The answer is yes, we can work \ntogether. It is just a matter of political will. We have to make up our \nminds that is what we are going to do, that we are going to work \ntogether.\n  In 2011, we passed the Budget Control Act. Here again, I think the \nnews media has not covered this a lot, has not explained this very well \nto most Americans. But one of the things the Budget Control Act of 2011 \ndid, among other things, is it set spending caps for the Federal \nGovernment. So as back in the 1980s, when people worried about $180 \nbillion deficits--now we have much larger deficits than that, but back \nthen in the 1980s, we put on the Gramm-Rudman spending caps and things \nsuch as that--Gramm-Rudman-Hollings--and there were other efforts over \nthe years.\n  Well, that is what we have done with the Budget Control Act. We have \nspending caps for the next 10 years--now it is for the next 9 years \nwhen it comes to Federal spending. I think people do not always \nappreciate that because what they hear out of Washington--instead of \npeople explaining what is going on and trying to help the American \npeople understand what they get from Washington--is blame, blame, \nblame. I cannot count the number of press conferences we have had where \none side has come out to blame the other side. I know some of the House \nMembers just came out and blamed the Senate. Democrats are blaming \nRepublicans. Republicans are blaming the President. The President is \nblaming the Congress. It goes on and on and on. It never stops. It is a \ndead-end street.\n  The truth is we voted for sequester. I do not care who came up with \nthe idea, we voted for it. As we have talked about many times on this \nfloor, the reason we put sequester in in the first place was because it \nwas such a bad idea; it will be so hard to do; it does not make a lot \nof sense. But, nonetheless, it was to try to force our folks to get to \na budget deal. It did not happen. But I think the important thing is, \nall Americans need to know everybody in Washington owns this. You can \nblame all you want. You can have as many\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\npress conferences as you want, but everybody in Washington owns this. \nWe need to own up to our responsibility as Congressmen and Senators and \nas the President and do what we can to not hurt this country.\n  Let me talk for a few more moments because I see one of my colleagues \nhas arrived here. Let me say the sequestration, again, was an idea that \nwas put together because they wanted it to be so painful that we would \nnever get here. These are arbitrary cuts. You do not take into account \nthe efficiency of programs, the effectiveness of programs. You do not \ntake into account the merits of programs. You just cut across the \nboard.\n  I think we probably will do some more cuts. We probably should do \nsome more cuts. I think if you look at the Simpson-Bowles blueprint--\nthat proposal a lot of us have talked about over the last couple \nyears--they would probably look at that and look at the numbers and say \nwe still need to do some cutting. But we also need some revenue. We \nstill need to do that. But our cuts should be smart and they should be \ndeliberate and they should increase the bang that the taxpayer gets for \ntheir buck. That is not what sequestration does. It does not achieve \nany of those goals.\n  One thing about the Department of Agriculture--here again, people \nneed to understand this; we talk about this here in our committee rooms \nand whatnot, but I think a lot of times the message does not get out--\nagriculture funding has already been cut by 15 percent. There has \nalready been a 15-percent cut to agriculture, starting in 2010 to \ntoday: 15 percent. I think it is unwise for us to cut an industry which \nis one of the core strengths of the U.S. economy.\n  If we look at the U.S. economy, there are a lot of things we do well. \nBut there is no doubt at all we do agriculture better than anyone else \nin the world. There is not even a close second place. You innovate when \nit comes to agriculture. This is where you maximize crops. The United \nStates of America is the gold standard for agricultural productivity \nand new technology and innovation and all these great things to make \nthis country the breadbasket that it is. So why in the world are we \ngoing to cut, cut, cut agriculture? It does not make any sense.\n  Of course, rural America is struggling disproportionately. With the \nrecession and all that has hit rural America, it is tough out there. \nLet me tell you, I come from a very rural State. It is tough. These \ncuts are going to harm rural America much more than they will harm \nurban America and suburban America. It is a fact of life. Again, that \nis another reason why we need to avoid this.\n  So in closing--I know I have one of my colleagues here who wishes to \nspeak--let me get back to the meat inspectors. The Department of \nAgriculture says they may have to be furloughed for up to 15 days. That \nmeans you are going to have to temporarily close--maybe for a day at a \ntime--6,000 processing plants nationwide. There are over 90 of those in \nArkansas. Just in my State, that is going to have an impact on not \nthose few government jobs, it is going to have an impact on 40,000 jobs \nin the private sector--40,000 jobs in the private sector--because of \nthis.\n  It also is going to disrupt the efficiencies we have in the protein \nmarkets in this country. What that means is, prices are going to go up, \npeople are going to pay more for their meat products at the grocery \nstore and at the restaurant. This is not going to be a win for anybody. \nAnd I think you are going to see about $400 million in industry wages \nthat could be lost as a result. That is not going to help the U.S. \neconomy.\n  Then you expand what the U.S. Department of Agriculture does beyond \nrow crop and livestock-type agriculture. They do a lot in the area of \nclean water, fire and rescue vehicles in rural communities. They do \ncommunity building in rural America--things such as hospitals, school \nconstruction. They do rental assistance programs, and a lot of these \nare for the poorest of the poor out there around our country. Again, it \nis going to disproportionately hurt these people who can least afford \nit.\n  I mentioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but also at the FDA, \nit seems to me almost every one of their employees around the country \ncould be subject to these furloughs and these cuts and will be \nadversely affected.\n  Do we want to interrupt the gold standard we have with food and drugs \nin this country through the FDA? I would say no.\n  I think it is time for us to come together, to work together, to find \na solution. I think one of the bits of good news we see in Washington \nis there is nothing wrong here that we cannot fix with some political \nwill. I think that is what this is all about. It is a little bit of a \ntest of wills right now, but I think there is no doubt we can fix this \nwith some political will.\n  Mr. President, with that, I will yield the floor.\n  I see my colleague from Vermont is in the Chamber.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my colleague from Arkansas for yielding.\n  When we talk about sequestration, when we talk about deficit \nreduction, it is important to put that discussion in a broader context. \nThe broader context needs to be, No. 1, what is the fairest way to move \ntoward deficit reduction and what is the best approach in terms of \neconomic policy making our country strong and creating jobs.\n  I fear very much the debate we are currently having has very little \nto do with financial issues. I believe it has a lot to do with \nideology. It is all about economic winners and losers in our country. \nIt is all about the power of big money. It is all about the soul of \nwhat America is supposed to be.\n  You may have noticed there was a poll done. I can't remember who did \nit, but it was consistent with all the other polls I have seen. They \nasked the American people: Are you concerned about deficit reduction? \nDo you think we should cut Social Security and Medicare? \nOverwhelmingly, Democrats said no, Republicans said no.\n  Yet here in the Congress, surrounded by lobbyists and campaign \ncontributors who are very wealthy, that is where we are heading. We are \nheading toward a so-called chained CPI, which very few people outside \nthe beltway understand. This will mean cuts, significant cuts in Social \nSecurity and in benefits for disabled veterans.\n  The American people say we think the wealthiest people in this \ncountry should help us with deficit reduction, protect the safety net.\n  In Congress, there is a fierce attack by the Republicans and some \nDemocrats on the safety net. To a large degree, we are allowing large \ncorporations, that are enjoying very low effective tax rates, to get \naway with what they are doing.\n  When we talk about who should help us with deficit reduction, we need \nto look at what is going on economically in the United States of \nAmerica. We don't discuss this issue enough. We need more people coming \ndown to the floor to talk about it. We have the most unequal \ndistribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth, and \nthe gap between the very wealthy and everyone else is growing wider.\n  Today, the wealthiest 400 individuals in this country own more wealth \nthan the bottom half of American people, 150 million people. You have \n150 million here, you have 400 over there. Who do you think should pick \nup the burden of deficit reduction?\n  Should we go after children who are having a hard time getting the \nnutrition they need or seniors who can't afford prescription drugs? \nYes, we could do that.\n  Is that a moral thing to do? No. Is that good economics? No.\n  Today, one family, the Walton family of Walmart, is probably the most \nmajor welfare beneficiary in America. So many of their low-paid \nemployees are on Medicaid, food stamps or other Federal programs. This \none family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American \npeople.\n  Do you know what we did a couple months ago? We gave the Walton \nfamily a tax break by expanding the estate tax.\n  Today, the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of all financial wealth--1 \npercent owns 38 percent. The bottom 60 percent owns less than 3 percent \nof all wealth.\n  What do we think? Do we want to go after the bottom 60 percent, \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\nwho are making $25,000, $30,000 a year, falling further and further \nbehind? Do we want to take away the educational opportunities and the \nnutrition their kids can get? Yes, we may do it that way. Maybe it \nmakes more sense to go after the top 1 percent who are doing \nphenomenally well.\n  Do you know what. The vast majority of Americans agree with that, but \nthis Congress does not reflect the interests of the vast majority of \nthe American people. It is not the American people who are funding the \ncampaigns for Members of the Senate and the House. It is not the \naverage American who has well-paid lobbyists all over this place.\n  As Warren Buffett has pointed out, the 400 richest Americans are now \nworth a record-breaking $1.7 trillion, more than 5 times what they were \nworth two decades ago.\n  While the wealthiest people are becoming even richer, the Federal \nReserve reported last year that median net worth for middle-class \nfamilies dropped by nearly 40 percent from 2007 to 2010, dropped by 40 \npercent. That is the equivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for \nthe average middle-class family.\n  Whom do we go after? Do we think it makes any economic or moral sense \nto go after a middle class which is disappearing or maybe do we ask the \nwealthiest people in this country--who are doing phenomenally well--to \nhelp us with deficit reduction?\n  As bad as wealth inequality is, the distribution of income, what \npeople make every year is even worse. It is an amazing statistic, and I \nhope everybody pays attention to this.\n  The last study on the subject of income distribution showed that from \n2009 to 2011, the last study we have, 100 percent of all new income \nwent to the top 1 percent, while the bottom 99 percent actually saw a \nloss in their income. In a sense it doesn't matter, given that \nincredible imbalance in income, what kind of economic growth we have. \nAll the gains are going to go to the top 1 percent.\n  I have some friends over in the House, our Republican friends, who \nare saying: No, no, no. We can't ask these people to help us more with \ndeficit reduction. I think that is very wrong.\n  When we are talking about how to reduce the deficit--and we all want \nto do that--we need to understand we can't get blood out of a stone. We \ncan't ask people who are earning less and in many cases working longer \nhours. We can't ask the 14 percent of Americans who are unemployed. If \nwe add people who have given up looking for work and people who are \nworking part-time, we cannot get blood out of a stone. As Willy Sutton \nthe bank robber reminded us, you go where the money is. In this case, \nall the money and all the income gains are with the top 1 percent.\n  The other point that needs to be made is we need to ask the question \nof how we reached the place we are right now. No. 1, we need to ask who \nis best able to help us with deficit reduction. It is surely not the \nstruggling middle class. It is surely not the disabled veterans and \ntheir families. It is surely not elderly people who can't afford \nprescription drugs. It is surely not kids who don't have enough to eat.\n  The second question we need to ask is how did we get to where we are \ntoday. Did this deficit just arrive yesterday?\n  I think we all remember that in the last year of the Clinton \nadministration this country had a $236 billion surplus, a surplus. The \neconomists were projecting that the surplus would expand, expand, and \nexpand.\n  What happened from the year 2000 to 2013 so that we went from a very \nsignificant surplus to a very serious deficit? That needs to be \nunderstood when we talk about sequestration and deficit reduction. The \nanswer is, as everybody knows, we went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nA strange thing happened. We forgot to pay for those two wars. When we \ngo into two wars and we are taking care of all those veterans who have \nbeen hurt, that adds up to something like $3 trillion by the time we \ntake care of the last veteran, as we must.\n  During the Bush administration, we gave huge tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in this country, didn't offset it. That adds up. We \npassed the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, didn't pay for \nthat. That adds up.\n  Most important, because of the greed, recklessness, and illegal \nbehavior on Wall Street, we were plunged into a major recession, high \nunemployment, businesses going under, less tax revenue coming into the \nFederal coffers.\n  I know my Republican friends say cut, cut, cut, cut benefits for \ndisabled vets, cut Social Security, cut Medicaid, cut nutrition, cut \nHead Start. We could do it that way, but we should also understand that \nat 15.8 percent as compared to GDP, the percentage of GDP, our revenue \nis almost the lowest it has been in 60 years.\n  Yes, in the middle of a recession we are spending a lot of money \nmaking sure people don't go hungry, making sure people who lost their \njobs have unemployment benefits, making sure people have affordable \nhousing. It is true. What is also true is that at 15.8 percent, as a \npercentage of GDP, our revenue is less, almost less than it has been in \n60 years.\n  Today, not only are we seeing a growing gap between the very wealthy \nand everybody else, it is important to take a look at large \ncorporations. When we do, we find that corporate profits are at an \nalltime high, while corporate income tax revenue as a percentage of GDP \nis near a record low. Profits are soaring, and the effective tax rate \nis near a record low.\n  In 2011, corporate revenue as a percentage of GDP was just 1.2 \npercent lower than any other major country in the OECD, including Great \nBritain, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, et cetera. Corporate revenue \nas a percentage of GDP is 1.2 percent lower than any other major \ncountry in the OECD. In 2011, corporations paid 12 percent of their \nprofits in taxes, the lowest since 1972.\n  We have a choice. Do we go after the elderly? Do we go after the \nsick? Do we go after the children? Do we go after the poor or maybe do \nwe say that when corporate profits are at a record level and their \neffective tax rate is the lowest since 1972, maybe we say to corporate \nAmerica, hey, help us with deficit reduction.\n  The last figures we have seen on this issue is that in 2005, one out \nof four major corporations paid no income tax at all while they \ncollected over $1 trillion of revenue over that 1-year period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me conclude by simply saying we are losing $100 \nbillion a year from tax havens in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere. \nThere are ways to do deficit reduction without hurting the most \nvulnerable people in this society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before Senator Sanders leaves, let me commend him. I \ndidn't hear all his remarks, but I know the subject of his address, his \nremarks, was the fact corporations now contribute about 10 percent of \nthe total revenue which comes into Uncle Sam. Years ago, it was about \n50 percent, and then gradually it has come down to about where it is \nnow.\n  The reason for that, mainly, is that there are a whole bunch of \ngimmicks and loopholes which have been inserted into our tax laws which \nneed to be closed. If they can be closed, we would be able to avoid \nsequestration. That is how big the loopholes are.\n  I am not talking about deductions, which most people would say serve \na useful purpose. Whether people agree with that purpose, at least \ndeductions, as we generally understand deductions, serve some kind of a \nproductive purpose. For instance, corporations get accelerated \ndepreciation when they buy equipment. That serves a very important \npurpose. It gives an incentive to buy equipment.\n  Even the oil and gas credit, which I don't support, nonetheless, the \npurpose of it is to give an incentive to explore and drill for oil and \ngas. Whether one agrees with that purpose, at least it is a purpose. \nWhen it comes to these loopholes and gimmicks which are used to shift \nrevenues to tax havens, there is no useful purpose. The only purpose is \ntaxable. Those are the loopholes which we can close, and those are the \nloopholes which it seems to me there ought to be broad bipartisan \nsupport to close. If we can close them, we can avoid sequestration. \nAgain, that is how big these loopholes are.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n  I very much appreciate the reference by the Senator from Vermont to \nour Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the work we have been \ndoing, and I very much appreciate the energy he brings to this effort. \nIt ought to be bipartisan. Again, these kinds of loopholes are not what \nmost people consider to be legitimate deductions but are a kind of tax-\navoidance scheme that should not be in the law even if we had no \ndeficit. I guess one of the critical differences between these kinds of \ntax-avoidance gimmicks and the ordinary deductions corporations take is \nthe fact that the use of these and the abuse of these should be \neliminated on a bipartisan basis.\n  So I would like to thank my friend. I wish I had caught the early \npart of his remarks, but that was not to be.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the President's \nnomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense.\n  I know Senator Chuck Hagel well from having served with him for many \nyears in the Senate. We were sworn in as Senators on the same day and \ntraveled to Iraq together in 2003 as part of the first Senate \ndelegation there after the war began.\n  Senator Hagel's courageous military service deserves our praise and \ngratitude, and I know he cares deeply about our servicemembers. His \nexperience as a soldier during the war in Vietnam is significant as the \nSenate considers his nomination to be Secretary of Defense, but, of \ncourse, it is but one factor that we must weigh in our consideration of \nhim for this critical Cabinet post. Senator Hagel and I spent 90 \nminutes in my office discussing a wide range of issues, which I \nappreciated, and I reviewed carefully the lengthy Senate Armed Services \nCommittee hearing on his nomination.\n  The next Secretary of Defense will be responsible for managing a \nmassive bureaucracy, the defense budget, threats emanating from Iran, \nNorth Korea, and Islamist extremism, the withdrawal of United States \ncombat forces from Afghanistan, and an increasingly provocative Chinese \nmilitary as well as personnel issues affecting those serving in \nuniform.\n  With regard to our servicemembers, I am confident that Senator Hagel \nwould devote the necessary attention to address the horrendous rate of \nsexual assault in the military and would work to reduce the \nunacceptable, record high number of suicides among our troops.\n  As the coauthor with former Senator Joe Lieberman of the law that \nrepealed the military's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy that barred \nopenly gay people from serving in the military, I am now satisfied that \nSenator Hagel is committed to implementing this law fully.\n  We also discussed the specter of sequestration, which would lead to \nirresponsible cuts that would cripple our readiness and capability to \nproject power on land, air, and sea. Senator Hagel reiterated Secretary \nLeon Panetta's position that such meat-ax cuts would be disastrous and \ncatastrophic to our national security and economy.\n  In addition, I understand Senator Hagel's overall philosophy on the \nneed to exercise caution before deploying military forces. Such \nrestraint, at times, can provide a valuable voice of caution to temper \nthe impulse to exercise America's significant military edge.\n  Nevertheless, several critical issues loom large as I contemplate the \nthreats facing our national security and consider Senator Hagel's \nnomination. These issues include the proliferation of terrorism, the \nthreat of a nuclear-armed Iran and the reality of a nuclear-armed North \nKorea, an increasingly dangerous and unstable Middle East that \nthreatens our national interests and our ally Israel, and the \npossibility of deep and indiscriminate cuts in the defense budget that \nwould undermine America's strength and security.\n  While Osama bin Laden is dead and al-Qaida has suffered significant \nlosses in Afghanistan and Pakistan, violent Islamist extremism has \nmetastasized to other regions around the world, particularly to the \ncountries in North Africa. The terrorist attack in Benghazi left four \nAmericans dead, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, and an attack \nkilled three Americans at an Algerian gas facility. AQAP's top bomb-\nmaker is still at large, and Hezbollah and Hamas continue to rearm in \nLebanon and Gaza. Hundreds of rockets have been fired from Gaza into \nIsrael, the vast majority fortunately stopped by the highly effective \nIron Dome.\n  Senator Hagel's views on these critical threats are unsettling to me. \nFor example, with regard to Hezbollah, Senator Hagel was unwilling to \nask the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist \norganization in 2006. While 88 other Senators, including then-Senators \nObama and Clinton, supported this reasonable request, Senator Hagel did \nnot. Hezbollah has the blood of more Americans on its hands than any \nother terrorist organization besides al-Qaida, yet Senator Hagel \nrefused to urge the EU to call Hezbollah what it is--a terrorist \norganization.\n  Senator Hagel has explained to me that he had a principle of not \nsending correspondence to foreign leaders because he believes the \nPresident, not Congress, conducts foreign policy. Indeed, in January \n2009, former Senator Hagel did sign an ill-advised letter counseling \nBarack Obama to spearhead direct, unconditional talks with Hamas--a \nposition that President Obama wisely chose to disregard.\n  Senator Hagel's general principle of abstaining from sending letters \nto foreign leaders on policy matters did not, however, preclude him \nfrom signing a 2007 letter to the Prime Minister of Vietnam to \nencourage efforts to bring the Peace Corps to that country. If \nexpanding the Peace Corps' presence warrants an exception to Senator \nHagel's policy of not sending letters to foreign leaders, I cannot \nfathom why a matter as grave and as clear as a request to the EU to \nname Hezbollah a terrorist group would not warrant a similar exception.\n  When it comes to the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran, the American \npeople have been told for several years that Iran is 18 to 24 months \naway from having the capability to build a nuclear weapon. I fear that \nwe are truly within that time window as I speak today. A nuclear-armed \nIran would have grave consequences for the United States and would pose \nan existential threat to the State of Israel. The prospect of a \nnuclear-armed Iran could also fuel the most significant proliferation \nof nuclear weapons in the Middle East since the dawn of the nuclear \nage. Thus, Senator Hagel's votes, statements, and views on this grave \nthreat matter a great deal.\n  What concerns me as much as his repeated reluctance previously to \nleave all options on the table is his past hesitancy to exercise all of \nthe non-military options, such as unilateral sanctions, that are the \nprimary peaceful means of inducing Iran to cease its nuclear weapons \nprogram and allow for International Atomic Energy Agency inspections.\n  Senator Hagel supports multi-lateral sanctions contending that they \nwork better and has opposed unilateral sanctions. Certainly, in an \nideal world, multi-lateral sanctions can be more effective, and I \nwelcome other countries that wish to join the United States in adopting \nsanctions. But the United States' imposition of sanctions--even if we \nwere to act virtually alone--not only helps to disrupt Iran's nuclear \nprogram but also demonstrates moral leadership.\n  In the last Congress, I introduced legislation to make shipping \nclassification societies choose between doing business with Iran or \nwith the United States Coast Guard. It was a unilateral effort. I did \nnot have the authority to make this change at the U.N. Initially, these \norganizations thought it would be business as usual. As the bill moved \nthrough Congress and now that the bill is law, none of them continues \nto work with Iran. That's just one example of an effective unilateral \naction.\n  Particularly concerning to me is a press report that Senator Hagel \nthwarted an effort in 2008 to pass sanctions against Iran that was \nsupported by more than 70 Senators. The Department of Defense contends \nthat Senator Hagel joined other Republican Senators in holding the Iran \nSanctions bill due to concerns they and the Bush administration had on \nhow to impose the most effective sanctions on Iran. According to the \nDepartment, his disagreement was not with the objectives of the bill, \nbut was a vote based on its effectiveness at that time.\n  I am not, however, aware of any other Republican Senator blocking \nthat bill. Furthermore, it does not\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\nmatter who else may have been involved because no one but Senator Hagel \nis the President's nominee to be the Secretary of Defense.\n  We are at a moment in history when there can be no reservation, \nhesitancy, or opposition to enact any and all sanctions that could \nchange Iran's calculus regarding its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  We are seeing a major transformation in the Middle East. The United \nStates' interests in this region are vital: trade through the Suez \nCanal, the availability of energy resources, the security of Israel, \nthe prevention of Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and the future of \nSyria which has the potential to destabilize the region.\n  Will we be resolute and stand by our friends and allies, even during \nthis tumultuous time? In our partnership with Israel, there is an \nopportunity for the United States to demonstrate that we stand by our \nallies even when the neighborhood looks more dangerous than it has in \ndecades.\n  Unfortunately, I am concerned that Senator Hagel's nomination would \nsend the wrong message at the wrong time to our allies and adversaries \naround the world about the resolve of the United States. It is telling \nand disturbing that when I asked Senator Hagel what he believed were \nthe greatest threats facing our country, he identified the resource \nshortage that could result from the addition of two billion more people \nduring the next couple decades as near the top of his list. While there \nno doubt will be tremendous challenges associated with this \ndevelopment, his response concerned me when I consider all of the \nenormous near-term threats facing our country.\n  In my judgment, Islamist terrorism, a nuclear-armed North Korea and \npotentially a nuclear-armed Iran, an unstable and chaotic Middle East, \ncyber attacks, Chinese provocations, and budget constraints will likely \nconsume the attention of our country's national security leaders during \nthe next 4 years. I believe a vote in favor of Senator Hagel would send \nthe wrong signal to our military, the American people, and to the world \nabout America's resolve regarding the most important national security \nchallenges of our era.\n  I am unable to support Senator Hagel to be the next Secretary of \nDefense because I do not believe his past positions, votes, and \nstatements match the challenges of our time, and his presentations at \nhis hearing did nothing to ease my doubts. I regret having to reach \nthat conclusion given our personal relationship and my admiration for \nSenator Hagel's military service. But I have concluded that he is not \nwell-suited for the tremendous challenges our country faces during this \ndangerous era in our history.\n  As I announce my decision to cast my vote in opposition to Senator \nHagel's nomination, let me address one final question: Should this \nnomination, which causes me such great concern, be filibustered? As a \ngeneral rule, I believe a President has the right to choose the members \nof his Cabinet, and only in extraordinary circumstances should such a \nnomination be filibustered. I oppose Senator Hagel's nomination, but I \ncannot join in a filibuster to block each Senator's right to vote for \nor against him.\n  I wish that President Obama had made a different choice for this \ncritical position, but he is entitled to have this nominee receive a \ndirect vote on the Senate floor. And I, for one, will vote against the \nnomination of Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of our former \ncolleague and my friend, Chuck Hagel, to serve as Secretary of Defense.\n  Providing advice and consent on a nomination for the President's \nCabinet is one of the Senate's most significant constitutional \nresponsibilities, particularly in the case of the Secretary of Defense. \nIt is a very serious responsibility because no duty is more important \nthan preserving the safety and security of our Nation and its people.\n  I believe this nominee has the knowledge and ability to carry out the \nduties of this important office. Chuck Hagel feels strongly that the \nUnited States should be the most capable military power in the world. \nHe also believes the United States must continue to be committed to \nIsrael's security and its ability to defend its borders.\n  At a time when our adversaries continue to increase their arsenals of \nrockets and missiles and to develop medium- and long-range ballistic \nmissiles that threaten our security, the security of our deployed \nforces, and the security of our friends and allies, it is imperative \nthat we continue to develop, field, and maintain a robust missile \ndefense capability. I know Senator Hagel is supportive of these \nefforts, and I will be pleased to join with him in further advancing \nthese priorities.\n  Senator Hagel is a decorated Vietnam veteran, a successful \nentrepreneur, Deputy Administrator of the Veterans' Administration, \nPresident and CEO of the USO, and a two-term United States Senator. \nThroughout his distinguished career in public service, Senator Hagel \nhas proven himself to be a fair, intelligent and courageous leader of \ngood character and integrity.\n  I am confident that Senator Hagel will serve with distinction as \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel to be our next Secretary \nof Defense. He is eminently qualified for the position and possesses an \nexemplary record of service to this country. I strongly believe that a \nPresident is entitled to his cabinet selections unless there is \nsomething in an individual's record or background that is \ndisqualifying. And there is nothing in Senator Hagel's background that \nis disqualifying. He is a veteran, he has been a successful CEO, and he \nhas served at highest levels of the legislative and executive branches.\n  I served with Senator Hagel during his two terms in the U.S. Senate--\nincluding his service on the Senate Intelligence Committee from 2003-\n2008. I found him to be a knowledgeable and independent voice with a \nstrong grasp of the pressing national security issues facing our \ncountry. Those of us who served with him know Senator Hagel's story \nwell. His career began as a sergeant in the U.S. Army in Vietnam where \nhe served with distinction and earned two Purple Hearts. Indeed, as an \nenlisted man, he has seen the true costs of war. He understands that \nthe use of military force should always be a last resort and should \nonly be undertaken with a clear strategy, clear mission and the \nresources to get the job done. He understands that we have a solemn \nobligation to take care of our returning veterans and the families and \nloved ones of those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. As we emerge from \nover 10 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan that is the kind of \nleadership we need at the Department of Defense and, more importantly, \nthat is the kind of leadership the men and women in uniform deserve. \nThey will take pride in the fact that Senator Hagel will be the first \nenlisted man and the first Vietnam veteran to head the Department.\n  Chuck also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the USO \nand as the Deputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration during \nthe Reagan administration, where he fought to ensure that our veterans \nreceived the benefits they earned, including assistance for those \nsuffering from Agent Orange. He then went on to the private sector \nwhere he co-founded VANGUARD Cellular Systems, a leading cellular \ncarrier in the U.S. Most recently, he co-chaired the President's \nIntelligence Advisory Board.\n  Now, it is no secret that Senator Hagel has his critics, but let us \ntake a closer look at who has endorsed his nomination.\n  A bi-partisan group of 13 former Secretaries of State, Secretaries of \nDefense, and National Security Advisors from the Reagan, George H.W. \nBush, Clinton, and George W. Bush administrations sent a letter to the \nSenate expressing their support for Senator Hagel to be the next \nSecretary of Defense arguing that he is ``uniquely qualified to meet \nthe challenges facing the Department of Defense and our men and women \nin uniform.'' They continued:\n\n       Our extensive experience working with Senator Hagel over \n     the years has left us confident that he has the necessary \n     background to succeed in the job of leading the largest \n     federal agency.\n\n  He has also received endorsements from 11 senior retired military \nleaders, over fifty Ambassadors and statesmen, and numerous veterans' \norganizations.\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nA group of ten former U.S. Ambassadors--including four former \nAmbassadors to Israel--argued that:\n\n       We can think of few more qualified, more non-partisan, more \n     courageous or better equipped to head the Department of \n     Defense at this critical moment in strengthening America's \n     role in the world.\n\n  The group of retired Generals and Admirals from the Army, Air Force, \nMarines, and Navy--including General Anthony Zinni, General Brent \nScowcroft, and Admiral William Fallon--went even further. In an open \nletter, they argued that Senator Hagel ``would be a strong leader'' as \nthe next Pentagon chief and that he's ``eminently qualified for the \njob.'' But, more importantly, they believe that he understands the \nchallenges that our warfighters face and is the person who can best \nlead the Pentagon.\n  And, even with all the accusations about Senator Hagel's views on \nIsrael, Israeli Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that ``[Senator \nHagel] certainly regards Israel as a true and natural U.S. ally.''\n  Clearly, those of us here in the Senate who support Senator Hagel's \nnomination are not alone in believing he will make a fine Secretary of \nDefense and will serve our nation, once again, with distinction.\n  Make no mistake, difficult challenges lie ahead. We are transitioning \nout of Afghanistan, but its future remains uncertain, and the threat of \nglobal terror endures, particularly in North Africa. We are on the \nverge of seeing massive cuts to the Pentagon's budget due to \nsequestration, which will negatively impact readiness and the defense \nindustrial base. The nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea move \nforward, and new tests and provocations continue, including in areas \nsuch as cybersecurity.\n  In my view, Senator Hagel has the insight, experience, and know-how \nto take on this daunting agenda and help protect American lives and \nU.S. national security interests. I look forward to supporting his \nnomination as the next Secretary of Defense, and I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is the remainder of the time reserved for \nthe Hagel nomination or is it just open?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is. There is 20 minutes, with 10 minutes on \neach side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the vote is to take place at 4:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the time is evenly divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think it is safe to say that is accurate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 5 weeks ago Senator Hagel was warmly \nintroduced at his nomination hearing by two former chairmen of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn and Senator John \nWarner, who represent the best bipartisan tradition of the Senate and \nour committee. As a matter of fact, the Presiding Officer, Senator \nManchin, was present at the time when that presentation was made by \nSenators Nunn and Warner, and he was a witness to how powerful their \ntestimony in support of Senator Hagel was.\n  Senator Nunn told the committee:\n\n       I believe that our Nation is fortunate to have a nominee \n     for Secretary of Defense with the character, the experience, \n     the courage, and the leadership that Chuck Hagel would bring \n     to this position.\n\n  He said:\n\n       There are many essential characteristics and values that a \n     Secretary of Defense should possess in our dangerous and \n     challenging world.\n\n  And he named a few of them, including someone who sets aside fixed \nideology and biases to evaluate all options and then provides his or \nher candid judgment to the President and to the Congress. He also named \nthis characteristic: someone who pays attention to people with the best \nideas regardless of their party affiliation.\n  And then Senator Warner said:\n\n       Folks, there is an old saying in the combat Army infantry \n     and Marine Corps. ``Certain men are asked to take the \n     point,'' which means to get out and lead in the face of the \n     enemy. Chuck Hagel did that as a sergeant in Vietnam. If \n     confirmed, Chuck Hagel will do it again, this time not before \n     a platoon, but before every man and woman and their families \n     in the Armed Services.\n\n  Facing Senator Hagel, he said this:\n\n       You will lead them. And they will know in their hearts we \n     have one of our own.\n\n  Earlier today the Senate acted in a bipartisan fashion in voting to \nend the filibuster of this nomination by a very substantial vote.\n  If confirmed, Senator Hagel would be the first former enlisted man \nand the first veteran of the Vietnam war to serve as Secretary of \nDefense. This background gives Senator Hagel an invaluable perspective \nnot only with respect to the difficult decisions and recommendations a \nSecretary of Defense must make regarding the use of force and the \ncommitment of U.S. troops overseas but also with respect to the day-to-\nday decisions a Secretary must make to ensure that our men and women in \nuniform and their families receive the support and assistance they need \nand deserve.\n  Our country faces major challenges. Abroad, we face challenges from \nAfghanistan, where the Department of Defense faces key decisions about \nthe pace of the drawdown between now and the end of 2014, decisions \nabout the size and the composition of a residual force, and decisions \nabout the terms and conditions for our ongoing presence in Afghanistan \nafter 2014.\n  Elsewhere overseas, we face the ongoing threat of Iran's nuclear \nweapons program, the destruction and instability caused by Syria's \ncivil war, and the outgrowth of al-Qaida affiliates in ungoverned \nregions, including Yemen, Somalia, and north Africa.\n  We also face extremely difficult issues here at home. We have been \nwarned that sequestration and a yearlong continuing resolution risk \ncreating a hollow force and could confront our military leaders with \nthe untenable choice between sending troops into harm's way without \nadequate training and equipment or being unable to take on certain \nmissions at all. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has \ndescribed the impact of this budget crisis on the Department of Defense \nas a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10.\n  Now as much as anytime in the recent past, our men and women in \nuniform need a Secretary of Defense to guide them through difficult \nsituations around the world and to defend their interests here at home. \nThe President needs a Secretary of Defense in whom he has trust, who \nwill give him unvarnished advice, a person of integrity and one who has \na personal understanding of the consequences of decisions relative to \nthe use of military force.\n  It is time to end the uncertainty relative to the leadership at the \nPentagon. The time has come to now confirm Chuck Hagel as our next \nSecretary of Defense, and I hope the Senate will, on a bipartisan \nbasis, soon do exactly that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Charles Timothy Hagel, of Nebraska, to be Secretary of \nDefense.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, one of my colleagues recently said \nsomething that, after a week at home with my constituents, I am sure we \nare all feeling. Referring to the across-the-board cuts from \nsequestration that are just days from going into effect, he said: \n``When it's in your State or your backyard, it's devastating.'' I think \nthat is exactly right. They would be devastating for our families, our \nnational defense, and our economy.\n  But these cuts can be avoided if Congress comes together on a \nbalanced replacement. We should replace the sequestration in a balanced \nway, and then we should move forward on a fair, comprehensive budget \ndeal that provides certainty for our families and businesses.\n  I know my constituents in Washington State want to see a deal because \nif we are unable to find a fair replacement for sequestration, \neverything, from our military bases to our schools, is going to be \naffected. Twenty-nine thousand local civilian defense employees could \nbe furloughed. Thousands of Washington students could lose access to \nHead Start services and basic education resources. One thousand workers \ncleaning up dangerous nuclear material at the Hanford nuclear site \ncould be furloughed for weeks. And Washington State's military bases \ncould face hundreds of millions in cuts to crucial areas such as new \naircraft acquisition, research and development, flying hours, and ship \noperations.\n  We are days away from allowing these kinds of impacts to begin in \nevery one of our home States. We never should have reached this point, \nbut there is no denying that we have. We are days away from \nsequestration because my Republican colleagues continue to insist that \nwhile it is fine to cut programs that families and communities depend \non, the wealthiest Americans shouldn't have to make any further \ncontributions to deficit reduction.\n  The last few years have been very difficult ones for bipartisanship, \nbut I truly believe all of us know there is a smarter way to reduce our \ndebt and deficit. We can do better than throwing up our hands and \npermitting these across-the-board cuts to go into effect. And we know \nthe American people deserve better.\n  That is exactly why Democrats have put forward a credible, \nresponsible plan to replace sequestration. Our legislation builds on \nthe precedent set in the yearend deal, and it is in line with the \nbalanced approach the American people favor. It would replace half of \nthe first year of sequestration with responsible spending cuts and half \nof it with revenue from those who can afford it the most. Our bill \ncalls on the wealthiest Americans to pay at least the same marginal tax \nrate on their income as our middle-income families pay, and it would \neliminate needless tax breaks for oil and gas companies and companies \nshipping jobs overseas. At the same time, our replacement package would \nmake responsible cuts. Our bill would eliminate direct payments to \nfarmers which have been paid out even during good times and for crops \nfarmers weren't even growing. As the drawdown from Afghanistan is \ncompleted, our bill will make adjustments to our military that are in \nline with a strong 21st-century strategy.\n  Our legislation meets the Republicans halfway. It will protect \nfamilies and communities we represent from slower economic growth, \nfewer jobs, and weakened national defense. It would allow us to move \npast sequestration toward working on a fair, comprehensive budget deal \nthat provides certainty for American businesses and families.\n  My Republican colleagues will say that the yearend deal closed the \ndoor on using revenue to bring down the deficit. They will say that all \nwe need is spending cuts. That is not how the American people see it. \nMore than a month after the yearend deal, 76 percent of Americans and \n56 percent of Republicans favored a combination of spending cuts and \nrevenue increases to reduce our deficit. House Republicans have put \nforward a plan that does the exact opposite. They passed a bill--last \nCongress, I might add--that would replace only the automatic defense \ncuts. It would force struggling, hard-working families and seniors to \nbear the burden of deficit reduction. Their bill didn't even include a \npenny of new revenue, and it is unclear if it would even be able to \npass the House this Congress if they brought it up for a vote.\n\n  What the House Republicans offered, in other words, was more of the \nsame extreme and partisan approach that has led American families and \nour economy from one crisis to another crisis to another. It is what we \nsaw actually when Republicans held up funding for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, stalling airport construction projects and putting tens \nof thousands of workers' jobs at risk. It is what we saw during the \ndebt ceiling debate when tea party Republicans held our economy \nhostage, fighting for fiscal policies that economists across the \nspectrum said were hugely irresponsible. It is what we saw less than 2 \nmonths ago when Republicans waited until the very last minute to \nprotect 98 percent of Americans from income tax hikes.\n  This strategy, which puts a wrongheaded ideology above American \nfamilies and our economy, just doesn't work. And Republicans' latest \nstrategy--to just let sequester happen--is even worse. In fact, as tea \nparty Republicans in the House cheer on the sequester, here is what is \nbeing produced by companies in States all across the country. This is \ncalled a ``warn notice,'' but that is just Washington-talk for what it \nreally is. It is a layoff notice or a furlough notice. If Republicans \nchoose to block a balanced approach to replace the sequester, this is \nwhat is going to begin arriving in a matter of days at the doorsteps of \nworkers in our country. This piece of paper, which looks like this, is \ngoing to spell serious economic setbacks for our families, for their \nability to send their kids to college, and for the economy of their \ncommunities. This will be the consequence of Republicans' complete \nunwillingness today to compromise.\n\n  I think we can all agree our workers should not have to worry about \npolitical posturing, putting their jobs at risk. Businesses should not \nhave to think about elected officials holding the economy hostage to \nadvance extreme ideology. And families should not have to wonder one \nmonth what their paychecks will look like the next month, just because \nof a debate here in Washington, DC.\n  So I wish to ask my Republican colleagues to seriously--seriously--\nconsider our proposal. Replacing the sequester with evenly divided \nspending cuts and revenues--a balanced approach that Americans \nsupport--would put us on a path to end this pattern of governing by \ncrisis for all our constituents. That will allow us to get to work\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\non a long-term budget agreement that is fair to the middle class, that \ngets our debt and deficit under control, and reflects the values and \npriorities of the American people.\n  The American people want a balanced deal. They want us to manage our \nfinances. They want us to put together a budget and move forward. We \nwant to do that. We want to get out of this ``crisis by crisis.'' The \nprogram we are offering to replace the sequester for this year will \nallow us to get back to that process and begin to manage our country in \na better way.\n  So I hope our Republican colleagues join us in this and help us move \nto a place where we can assure the American public that we do care \nabout their future and their finances and the fragile economy we are \nnow facing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S848-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RAMONA LESSEN\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I came to the U.S. Senate in 2006, and I \nwas the only new Republican elected to the Senate that year. Many \npeople considered that a great accomplishment. But my greatest \naccomplishment of 2006 was convincing Ramona Lessen--who is sitting \nwith us today--to put off retirement for a few more years and stay on \nas my scheduler and executive assistant. And after 6 years in \nWashington, I know without a doubt that the biggest success of my first \nterm is that Ramona did not fire me--until now.\n  Ramona is retiring this week after 34 years. I am told that she \nviolated child labor laws by starting work when she was 5 years old.\n  Ramona came to the Senate in 1979 to work for Senator Larry Pressler \nfrom her native South Dakota. She worked for Senator Pressler for 16 \nyears, plus 2 more when he was in the House.\n  When Ramona began working in the Senate in 1979, Jimmy Carter was \nPresident, Robert Byrd was the majority leader, and Howard Baker was \nthe Republican leader. And probably most relevant to Ramona, ESPN \nstarted broadcasting, Post-It notes were invented, and one of the most \npopular songs was Gloria Gaynor's ``I Will Survive.'' She has not only \nsurvived but thrived in the U.S. Senate for more than three decades.\n  In 1994, she took another new Tennessee Senator named Bill Frist \nunder her wing. She worked for Senator Frist for 12 years. And then, in \n2006, I convinced her to work in our office for just 1 year. That year \nhas turned into 6.\n  In that time, Ramona has learned a lot about me, but I have learned a \nwhole lot about her. I have learned that Ramona loves music. In fact, \nher first job was as a high school band director. She is a great piano \nplayer. She has played the piano in my home and at staff gatherings. \nShe plays for her church. Ramona loves country music, and I think that \nis a big reason she has adopted Tennessee as her second home State.\n  I have learned that it is not too hard to know where you stand with \nRamona. Occasionally, I will make a request or a suggestion, and Ramona \nresponds with a certain expression--it is a polite term for a look of \ndisapproval. I know exactly where I stand and sometimes--candidly, \noften--I recalibrate my position or request.\n  I have learned that Ramona is a huge sports fan. If the Masters or \nthe U.S. Open is on, I am not going to interrupt her. She also loves \nfootball, and that is appropriate because I have also learned that she \nis a master of the audible.\n  In 2008, I was heavily involved in an effort to bring Volkswagen's \nU.S. production facility to Chattanooga. Just before one of the final \nmeetings in Tennessee, a plane full of decisionmakers was stuck on the \ntarmac in Germany without clearance to land in the United States--some \nkind of paperwork issue. Anybody who has been involved in a major \nrecruitment effort knows that in something like this, even a small \nglitch can be a major setback. The Volkswagen folks called me. I talked \nwith Ramona. I am not entirely sure what she did, but I know it was all \ntotally legal and aboveboard. At one point, she was sitting there \njockeying several phone calls on the switchboard and literally \ntalking the plane off the runway in Germany. What I do know for sure is \nthat the Volkswagen executives landed in the United States highly \nimpressed with Ramona Lessen. And shortly thereafter they chose \nChattanooga for their U.S. production facility.\n\n  That was a home run, no doubt. But I think Ramona's greatest \ncontribution is her ability to make a staff a family and an office a \nhome. Ramona makes sure we are celebrating each other--babies being \nborn, people getting married, and life in general. At Christmastime, \nshe makes sure the office is decorated and filled with Christmas music. \nHer favorite moments in the office are when someone brings in a baby or \na child. That child learns quickly, as we all do, that Ramona keeps a \nbasket of candy on her desk. And there is a good chance that child's \npicture is on Ramona's cherished bulletin board. Her loud, infectious \nlaugh is a staple at staff gatherings. It will be sorely missed.\n  There is a memorable scene in the movie ``The Queen'' where Queen \nElizabeth tells Prime Minister Tony Blair: ``You are my tenth Prime \nMinister, Mr. Blair.'' I am proud to have been Ramona Lessen's third \nSenator. Senators come and go, but for 34 years Ramona Lessen has been \na constant in the Senate. The Senate is better for it. Our country and \nTennessee are better for it. I know Senator Pressler and Senator Frist \nare better for it. Our staffs are better for it. And I am better for \nit.\n  Ramona, I thank you for taking pity on a new Senator and for showing \nme the ropes over the past 6 years. I thank you for your friendship. I \nwish you and Joe the very best in the years to come. I know when the \ntime comes, Tennessee, your second home State, will welcome you to \nretirement with open arms.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Dr. Woodson initiated the weeklong tribute to \nincorporate the legacies, images, and historical contributions of \nAfrican Americans into the greater American story.\n  Today, people throughout the United States celebrate African-American \nHistory Month to ensure all American stories are recognized. Ohio has \nbeen the scene for which many of these chapters were written.\n  In Mount Pleasant, OH, the first antislavery gazette newspaper in the \nUnited States, the Philanthropist, was published in 1817. The Ohio \nAnti-Slavery Society was founded in Zanesville in 1835. My home State \nhas played a rich role in American history, as have so many Ohioans.\n  Every new U.S. passport includes the words of a formerly enslaved \nOberlin College graduate Dr. Anna Julia Cooper.

Madam President, I rise in support of a great sport with a \ngreat tradition in our Nation, especially in Ohio. Unfortunately, the \nsport of wrestling may be put on the sidelines at the Olympic games.\n  Citing ``an effort to ensure the Olympic games remain relevant to \nsports fans of all generations,'' the International Olympic Committee--\nthe organization that controls the Olympics--voted to eliminate \nwrestling from the summer games after the 2016 Olympics. They want to \nend wrestling, one of the original Olympic games, while keeping other \ngames that, frankly, lack the central role wrestling has played in its \naccessibility to all athletes wherever they live.\n  Many of these are young people who lack access. Many of them want and \ndo compete in wrestling at the high school level, the intercollegiate \nlevel or perhaps at the Olympic level but lack access to fancy \nequipment or specialized training. They simply want to compete at a \nsport perhaps almost as old as humanity.\n  Wrestling has opened doors for working and middle-class youngsters \nfrom Ohio and around the country. That is why I recently introduced a \nSenate resolution opposing the elimination of wrestling from the \nOlympics beginning in 2020. On behalf of thousands of high school \nstudents and two 2012 Olympians with Ohio connections, I am asking the \nOlympics committee to reconsider putting a stranglehold on one of the \noriginal Olympic sports.\n  Wrestling has been a sport far longer than the International Olympic \nCommittee has been in existence. In addition to the ancient Egyptians \nand Greeks and Romans, our Nation has a long history with wrestling. \nPresident Lincoln was a wrestler, and two Ohio-born Presidents, Ulysses \nS. Grant and William Howard Taft, were wrestlers. One of our former \ncolleagues--beloved in many ways--my friend Paul Wellstone of Minnesota \nwas inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2000.\n  At the time of his induction, he said:\n\n       Wrestling has always been a big thing for me. I've had a \n     love affair with the sport for most of my life. It helped me \n     as a kid. I got in some trouble, then I found a sport I was \n     good at, and that transferred to better things in other \n     areas.\n\n  The same is true for some 11,000 high school wrestlers and students \nat 4 universities with 17 NCAA wrestling programs in my home State. \nFrom youth wrestling camps to high school meets such as the renowned \nJ.C. Gorman Invitational in my hometown of Mansfield, to the NCAA \ntournaments, students from Ohio learn the strength, the discipline, and \nfocus that allow grapplers to exceed both on the mat and beyond.\n  Wrestling is accessible for working-class athletes, unlike some of \nthe sports protected in the IOC's decision. Wrestling has a proud \ntradition in my State, in the United States, and has a proud tradition \naround the world. The IOC should not ratify this preliminary decision \nby its executive board. It should continue its efforts to remain \nrelevant for all athletes and communities around the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S849-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       S. 388--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel. However, counsel may submit any question in writing \n     to the Committee and request the Committee to propound such \n     question to the counsel's client or to any other witness. The \n     counsel also may suggest the presentation of other evidence \n     or the calling of other witnesses. The Committee may use or \n     dispose of such questions or suggestions as it deems \n     appropriate.\n       8.5. Statements by Witnesses.--Witnesses may make brief and \n     relevant statements at the beginning and conclusion of their \n     testimony. Such statements shall not exceed a reasonable \n     period of time as determined by the Chairman, or other \n     presiding members. Any witness required or desiring to make a \n     prepared or written statement for the record of the \n     proceedings shall file a paper and electronic copy with the \n     Clerk of the Committee, and insofar as practicable and \n     consistent with the notice given, shall do so at least 48 \n     hours in advance of his or her appearance before the \n     Committee.\n       8.6. Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the chair.\n       8.7. Inspection and Correction. --All witnesses testifying \n     before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of \n     their testimony to determine whether such testimony was \n     correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by \n     counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony. Any questions arising with \n     respect to such corrections shall be decided by the Chairman. \n     Upon request, the Committee may provide to a witness those \n     parts of testimony given by that witness in executive session \n     which are subsequently quoted or made part of a public \n     record, at the expense of the witness.\n       8.8. Requests to Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff, may \n     tend to affect adversely that person's reputation, may \n     request to appear personally before the Committee to testify \n     or may file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony, evidence, or comment, or may submit to the \n     Chairman proposed questions in writing for the cross-\n     examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall take such \n     action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9. Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress or that a subpoena be \n     otherwise enforced shall be forwarded to the Senate unless \n     and until the Committee has, upon notice to all its members, \n     met and considered the recommendation, afforded the person an \n     opportunity to oppose such contempt or subpoena enforcement \n     proceeding either in writing or in person, and agreed by \n     majority vote of the Committee to forward such recommendation \n     to the Senate.\n       8.10. Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the \n     Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by \n     the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, \n     appearing before the Committee. Upon authorization by the \n     Chairman to release the name of a witness under this \n     paragraph, the Vice Chairman shall be notified of such \n     authorization as soon as practicable thereafter. No name of \n     any witness shall be released if such release would disclose \n     classified information, unless authorized under Section 8 of \n     S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress or Rule 9.7.\n\n\n   RULE 9. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CLASSIFIED OR COMMITTEE SENSITIVE \n                                MATERIAL\n\n       9.1. Committee staff offices shall operate under strict \n     precautions. At least one United States Capitol Police \n     Officer shall be on duty at all times at the entrance of the \n     Committee to control entry. Before entering the Committee \n     office space all persons shall identify themselves and \n     provide identification as requested.\n       9.2. Classified documents and material shall be stored in \n     authorized security containers located within the Committee's \n     Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Copying, \n     duplicating, or removing from the Committee offices of such \n     documents and other materials is prohibited except as is \n     necessary for the conduct of Committee business, and in \n     conformity with Rule 10.3 hereof. All classified documents or \n     materials removed from the Committee offices for such \n     authorized purposes must be returned to the Committee's SCIF \n     for overnight storage.\n       9.3. ``Committee sensitive'' means information or material \n     that pertains to the confidential business or proceedings of \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence, within the\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\n     meaning of paragraph 5 of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate, and is: (1) in the possession or under the \n     control of the Committee; (2) discussed or presented in an \n     executive session of the Committee; (3) the work product of a \n     Committee member or staff member; (4) properly identified or \n     marked by a Committee member or staff member who authored the \n     document; or (5) designated as such by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman (or by the Staff Director and Minority Staff \n     Director acting on their behalf). Committee sensitive \n     documents and materials that are classified shall be handled \n     in the same manner as classified documents and material in \n     Rule 9.2. Unclassified committee sensitive documents and \n     materials shall be stored in a manner to protect against \n     unauthorized disclosure.\n       9.4. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     document control and accountability registry which will \n     number and identify all classified papers and other \n     classified materials in the possession of the Committee, and \n     such registry shall be available to any member of the \n     Committee.\n       9.5. Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes \n     classified material available to any other committee of the \n     Senate or to any member of the Senate not a member of the \n     Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal or \n     written notice to the recipients advising of their \n     responsibility to protect such materials pursuant to section \n     8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. The Security Director \n     of the Committee shall ensure that such notice is provided \n     and shall maintain a written record identifying the \n     particular information transmitted and the committee or \n     members of the Senate receiving such information.\n       9.6. Access to classified information supplied to the \n     Committee shall be limited to those Committee staff members \n     with appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know, as \n     determined by the Committee, and, under the Committee's \n     direction, the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director.\n       9.7. No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, the \n     contents of any classified or committee sensitive papers, \n     materials, briefings, testimony, or other information in the \n     possession of the Committee to any other person, except as \n     specified in this rule. Committee members and staff do not \n     need prior approval to disclose classified or committee \n     sensitive information to persons in the Executive branch, the \n     members and staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, and the members and staff of the Senate, \n     provided that the following conditions are met: (1) for \n     classified information, the recipients of the information \n     must possess appropriate security clearances (or have access \n     to the information by virtue of their office); (2) for all \n     information, the recipients of the information must have a \n     need-to-know such information for an official governmental \n     purpose; and (3) for all information, the Committee members \n     and staff who provide the information must be engaged in the \n     routine performance of Committee legislative or oversight \n     duties. Otherwise, classified and committee sensitive \n     information may only be disclosed to persons outside the \n     Committee (to include any congressional committee, Member of \n     Congress, congressional staff, or specified non-governmental \n     persons who support intelligence activities) with the prior \n     approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, \n     or the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting on \n     their behalf, consistent with the requirements that \n     classified information may only be disclosed to persons with \n     appropriate security clearances and a need-to-know such \n     information for an official governmental purpose. Public \n     disclosure of classified information in the possession of the \n     Committee may only be authorized in accordance with Section 8 \n     of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       9.8. Failure to abide by Rule 9.7 shall constitute grounds \n     for referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. Prior to a \n     referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400, the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     shall notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader.\n       9.9. Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the \n     disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials \n     presented to it, the Committee members shall have a \n     reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony, \n     papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the \n     members of the Committee or the Committee staff.\n       9.10. Attendance of persons outside the Committee at closed \n     meetings of the Committee shall be kept at a minimum and \n     shall be limited to persons with appropriate security \n     clearance and a need-to-know the information under \n     consideration for the execution of their official duties. The \n     Security Director of the Committee may require that notes \n     taken at such meetings by any person in attendance shall be \n     returned to the secure storage area in the Committee's \n     offices at the conclusion of such meetings, and may be made \n     available to the department, agency, office, committee, or \n     entity concerned only in accordance with the security \n     procedures of the Committee.\n\n\n                             RULE 10. STAFF\n\n       10.1. For purposes of these rules, Committee staff includes \n     employees of the Committee, consultants to the Committee, or \n     any other person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform \n     services for or at the request of the Committee. To the \n     maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall rely on its \n     full-time employees to perform all staff functions. No \n     individual may be retained as staff of the Committee or to \n     perform services for the Committee unless that individual \n     holds appropriate security clearances.\n       10.2. The appointment of Committee staff shall be approved \n     by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or, at the \n     initiative of both or either be confirmed by a majority vote \n     of the Committee. After approval or confirmation, the \n     Chairman shall certify Committee staff appointments to the \n     Financial Clerk of the Senate in writing. No Committee staff \n     shall be given access to any classified information or \n     regular access to the Committee offices until such Committee \n     staff has received an appropriate security clearance as \n     described in Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       10.3. The Committee staff works for the Committee as a \n     whole, under the supervision of the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee. The duties of the Committee staff \n     shall be performed, and Committee staff personnel affairs and \n     day-to-day operations, including security and control of \n     classified documents and material, shall be administered \n     under the direct supervision and control of the Staff \n     Director. All Committee staff shall work exclusively on \n     intelligence oversight issues for the Committee. The Minority \n     Staff Director and the Minority Counsel shall be kept fully \n     informed regarding all matters and shall have access to all \n     material in the files of the Committee.\n       10.4. The Committee staff shall assist the minority as \n     fully as the majority in the expression of minority views, \n     including assistance in the preparation and filing of \n     additional, separate, and minority views, to the end that all \n     points of view may be fully considered by the Committee and \n     the Senate.\n       10.5. The members of the Committee staff shall not discuss \n     either the substance or procedure of the work of the \n     Committee with any person not a member of the Committee or \n     the Committee staff for any purpose or in connection with any \n     proceeding, judicial or otherwise, either during their tenure \n     as a member of the Committee staff or at any time thereafter, \n     except as directed by the Committee in accordance with \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such a manner as may be determined by \n     the Senate. The Chairman may authorize the Staff Director and \n     the Staff Director's designee, and the Vice Chairman may \n     authorize the Minority Staff Director and the Minority Staff \n     Director's designee, to communicate with the media in a \n     manner that does not divulge classified or committee \n     sensitive information.\n       10.6. No member of the Committee staff shall be employed by \n     the Committee unless and until such a member of the Committee \n     staff agrees in writing, as a condition of employment, to \n     abide by the conditions of the nondisclosure agreement \n     promulgated by the Select Committee on Intelligence, pursuant \n     to Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress, and to \n     abide by the Committee's code of conduct.\n       10.7. As a precondition for employment on the Committee \n     staff, each member of the Committee staff must agree in \n     writing to notify the Committee of any request for testimony, \n     either during service as a member of the Committee staff or \n     at any time thereafter with respect to information obtained \n     by virtue of employment as a member of the Committee staff. \n     Such information shall not be disclosed in response to such \n     requests except as directed by the Committee in accordance \n     with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules or, in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such manner as may be determined by the \n     Senate.\n       10.8. The Committee shall immediately consider action to be \n     taken in the case of any member of the Committee staff who \n     fails to conform to any of these Rules. Such disciplinary \n     action may include, but shall not be limited to, immediate \n     dismissal from the Committee staff.\n       10.9. Within the Committee staff shall be an element with \n     the capability to perform audits of programs and activities \n     undertaken by departments and agencies with intelligence \n     functions. The audit element shall conduct audits and \n     oversight projects that have been specifically authorized by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, acting \n     jointly through the Staff Director and Minority Staff \n     Director. Staff shall be assigned to such element jointly by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, and staff with the principal \n     responsibility for the conduct of an audit shall be qualified \n     by training or experience in accordance with accepted \n     auditing standards.\n       10.10. The workplace of the Committee shall be free from \n     illegal use, possession, sale, or distribution of controlled \n     substances by its employees. Any violation of such policy by \n     any member of the Committee staff shall be grounds for \n     termination of employment. Further, any illegal use of \n     controlled substances by a member of the Committee staff, \n     within the workplace or otherwise, shall result in \n     reconsideration of the security clearance of any such staff \n     member and may constitute grounds for termination of \n     employment with the Committee.\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\n       10.11. All personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, \n     or disability.\n\n\n              RULE 11.

Under direction of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman \n     designated Committee staff members shall brief members of the \n     Committee at a time sufficiently prior to any Committee \n     meeting to assist the Committee members in preparation for \n     such meeting and to determine any matter which the Committee \n     member might wish considered during the meeting. Such \n     briefing shall, at the request of a member, include a list of \n     all pertinent papers and other materials that have been \n     obtained by the Committee that bear on matters to be \n     considered at the meeting.\n       11.2. The Staff Director and/or Minority Staff Director \n     shall recommend to the Chairman and the Vice Chairman the \n     testimony, papers, and other materials to be presented to the \n     Committee at any meeting. The determination whether such \n     testimony, papers, and other materials shall be presented in \n     open or executive session shall be made pursuant to the Rules \n     of the Senate and Rules of the Committee.\n       11.3. The Staff Director shall ensure that covert action \n     programs of the U.S. Government receive appropriate \n     consideration by the Committee no less frequently than once a \n     quarter.\n\n\n                     RULE 12. LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR\n\n       12.1. The Clerk of the Committee shall maintain a printed \n     calendar for the information of each Committee member showing \n     the measures introduced and referred to the Committee and the \n     status of such measures; nominations referred to the \n     Committee and their status; and such other matters as the \n     Committee determines shall be included.

The type of security \n     clearance to be required in the case of any such employee or \n     person shall, within the determination of such committee in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, be \n     commensurate with the sensitivity of the classified \n     information to which such employee or person will be given \n     access by such committee.\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates \n     the constitutional rights of such person or persons. \n     Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent such \n     committee from publicly disclosing any such information in \n     any case in which such committee determines the national \n     interest in the disclosure of such information clearly \n     outweighs any infringement on the privacy of any person or \n     persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the Executive branch, and which the \n     Executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall--\n       (A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the Senate of such vote; and\n       (B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader before notifying the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader and the \n     President, unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day \n     period, the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     committee that he objects to the disclosure of such \n     information, provides his reasons therefore, and certifies \n     that the threat to the national interest of the United States \n     posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs \n     any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the \n     Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority Leader \n     and Minority Leader jointly or the select Committee, by \n     majority vote, may refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the Chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed,\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n       Upon conclusion of the consideration of such matter in \n     closed session, which may not extend beyond the close of the \n     ninth day on which the Senate is in session following the day \n     on which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close \n     of the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. \n     Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant \n     to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member \n     of the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within \n     the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule \n     XIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure \n     of such information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which committee or which Members of the Senate received such \n     information. No Member of the Senate who, and no committee \n     which, receives any information under this subsection, shall \n     disclose such information except in a closed session of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on Ethics \n     to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence \n     information by a Member, officer or employee of the Senate in \n     violation of subsection (c) and to report to the Senate \n     concerning any allegation which it finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Ethics shall \n     release to such individual at the conclusion of its \n     investigation a summary of its investigation together with \n     its findings. If, at the conclusion of its investigation, the \n     Select Committee on Ethics determines that there has been a \n     significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized \n     disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, \n     it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend \n     appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee \n     membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a \n     Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment \n     for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10.

Proxies will \n     be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording \n     a Member's position on the question and then only in those \n     instances when the absentee committee Member has been \n     informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that \n     he be recorded. (Paragraph 7(a) (3) of rule XXVI of the \n     Standing Rules.)\n\n\n                               AMENDMENTS\n\n       Rule 16. Provided at least five business days' notice of \n     the agenda is given, and the text of the proposed bill or \n     resolution has been made available at least five business \n     days in advance, it shall not be in order for the Committee \n     to consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee unless such \n     amendment has been delivered to the office of the Committee \n     and circulated via e-mail to each of the offices by at least \n     5:00 p.m. the day prior to the scheduled start of the \n     meeting.\n       Rule 17.

It shall be in order, without prior notice, for a \n     Member to offer a motion to strike a single section of any \n     bill, resolution, or amendment under consideration.\n       Rule 19.

The Chairman is authorized to engage commercial \n     reporters for the preparation of transcripts of committee \n     meetings and hearings.\n       Rule 22.

At the end of that \n     period, the legislation will be restored to the full \n     committee calendar. The period referred to in the preceding \n     sentences should be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event \n     that adjournment or a long recess is imminent.\n       (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval \n     or modification by a majority vote of the committee.\n       (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of \n     those members present discharge a subcommittee from further \n     consideration of a specific piece of legislation.\n       (e) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve \n     as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which \n     they do not serve as voting members.\n       (f) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by \n     any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before \n     that subcommittee.\n       (g) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the \n     staff director to insure that--\n       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee \n     is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;\n       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full \n     committee is holding hearings; and\n       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same \n     time.\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may \n     meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two \n     subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the \n     approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee and subcommittees involved.\n       (h) All nominations shall be considered by the full \n     committee.\n       (i) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably \n     frequent meetings of the full committee to permit \n     consideration of legislation reported favorably to the \n     committee by the subcommittees.\n       Rule 18.

When the Chair finds it \n     necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear \n     the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.\n       (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not \n     such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this \n     paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo \n     such a record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S859-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S859-S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

The vote of the \n     Committee to report a measure or matter shall require the \n     concurrence of a majority of the members of the Committee who \n     are present.\n       Any absent member may affirmatively request that his or her \n     vote to report a matter be cast by proxy.

The proxy shall be in \n     writing and shall be sufficiently clear to identify the \n     subject matter, and to inform the Committee as to how the \n     member wishes his or her vote to be recorded thereon. By \n     written notice to the Chairman any time before the vote on \n     such other matter is taken, the member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies relating to such other matters \n     shall be kept in the files of the Committee.\n\n\n                            Rule 6.--Quorum\n\n       No executive session of the Committee or a Subcommittee \n     shall be called to order unless a majority of the Committee \n     or Subcommittee, as the case may be, are actually present. \n     Unless the Committee otherwise provides or is required by the \n     Rules of the Senate, one member shall constitute a quorum for \n     the receipt of evidence, the swearing in of witnesses, and \n     the taking of testimony.\n\n\n                     Rule 7.--Staff Present on Dais\n\n       Only members and the Clerk of the Committee shall be \n     permitted on the dais during public or executive hearings, \n     except that a member may have one staff person accompany him \n     or her during such public or executive hearing on the dais. \n     If a member desires a second staff person to accompany him or \n     her on the dais he or she must make a request to the Chairman \n     for that purpose.\n\n\n                      Rule 8.--Coinage Legislation\n\n       At least 67 Senators must cosponsor any gold medal or \n     commemorative coin bill or resolution before consideration by \n     the Committee.\n\n             EXTRACTS FROM THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE\n\n\n                     RULE XXV, STANDING COMMITTEES\n\n       1.

If at least three \n     Members of the Committee desire the Chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the Committee \n     shall notify the Chairman of such request. If, within 3 \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the Chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request, \n     a majority of the Committee Members may file in the offices \n     of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     chief clerk shall notify all Committee Members that such \n     special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and \n     hour.

Meeting transcript. The Committee or Subcommittee shall \n     prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic \n     recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each \n     meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is \n     closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee Members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n                            RULE 2. QUORUMS\n\n       A. Reporting measures and matters.

One Member of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(2) and 7(c)(2), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Subcommittee quorums. Subject to the provisions of \n     sections 7(a) (1) and (2) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate, the Subcommittees of this Committee are \n     authorized to establish their own quorums for the transaction \n     of business and the taking of sworn testimony.\n       E. Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies \n     shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                             RULE 3. VOTING\n\n       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a \n     quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually \n     present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee Members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those Members who \n     are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(a) (1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a Member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee Member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he or she is being recorded and has affirmatively requested \n     that he or she be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed \n     with the\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\n     chief clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee thereof, as the \n     case may be. All proxies shall be in writing and shall \n     contain sufficient reference to the pending matter as is \n     necessary to identify it and to inform the Committee or \n     Subcommittee as to how the Member establishes his or her vote \n     to be recorded thereon. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       D. Announcement of vote. (1) Whenever the Committee by roll \n     call vote reports any measure or matter, the report of the \n     Committee upon such a measure or matter shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to such measure or matter by each Member of the \n     Committee. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any \n     measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure \n     or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the \n     Committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by \n     each Member of the Committee who was present at the meeting. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the \n     tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote \n     recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure, \n     amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Polling. (1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, \n     may poll (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters \n     including the Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records \n     and budget; (b) steps in an investigation, including issuance \n     of subpoenas, applications for immunity orders, and requests \n     for documents from agencies; and (c) other Committee or \n     Subcommittee business other than a vote on reporting to the \n     Senate any measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on \n     closing a meeting or hearing to the public.\n       (2) Only the Chairman, or a Committee Member or staff \n     officer designated by him/her, may undertake any poll of the \n     Members of the Committee. If any Member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the Members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee Member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n       F. Naming postal facilities. The Committee will not \n     consider any legislation that would name a postal facility \n     for a living person with the exception of bills naming \n     facilities after former Presidents and Vice Presidents of the \n     United States, former Members of Congress over 70 years of \n     age, former State or local elected officials over 70 years of \n     age, former judges over 70 years of age, or wounded veterans.\n\n\n             RULE 4. CHAIRMANSHIP OF MEETINGS AND HEARINGS\n\n       The Chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he or she shall designate a temporary \n     Chairman to act in his or her place if he or she is unable to \n     be present at a scheduled meeting or hearing. If the Chairman \n     (or his or her designee) is absent 10 minutes after the \n     scheduled time set for a meeting or hearing, the Ranking \n     Majority Member present shall preside until the Chairman's \n     arrival. If there is no Member of the Majority present, the \n     Ranking Minority Member present, with the prior approval of \n     the Chairman, may open and conduct the meeting or hearing \n     until such time as a Member of the Majority arrives.\n\n\n                RULE 5. HEARINGS AND HEARING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open \n     session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     Members when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or \n     hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chairman to enforce \n     order on his or her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the Chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he or she shall have the \n     power to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee \n     may act in closed session for so long as there is doubt of \n     the assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The Chairman, with the \n     approval of the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses at a \n     hearing or deposition or the production of memoranda, \n     documents, records, or any other materials, provided that the \n     Chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the Ranking Minority Member where the Chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him/her has not received \n     notification from the Ranking Minority Member or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her of disapproval of the subpoena \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being \n     notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved by the \n     Ranking Minority Member as provided in this subsection, the \n     subpoena may be authorized by vote of the Members of the \n     Committee. When the Committee or Chairman authorizes \n     subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the signature of the \n     Chairman or any other Member of the Committee designated by \n     the Chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the Government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the Government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the Government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his or her counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself or herself in such manner so as to prevent, impede, \n     disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of the hearings; nor shall this subsection be \n     construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\n     which there have been public reports, tends to impugn his or \n     her character or adversely affect his or her reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide electronically a written statement of his or her \n     proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior to his or her \n     appearance. This requirement may be waived by the Chairman \n     and the Ranking Minority Member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure of compliance. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the Minority Members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the Chairman by a majority of the Minority \n     Members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman, with the approval of \n     the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, provided that \n     the Chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the Ranking Minority Member where the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her has not received notification \n     from the Ranking Minority Member or a staff officer \n     designated by him/her of disapproval of the deposition within \n     72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified \n     of the deposition notice. If a deposition notice is \n     disapproved by the Ranking Minority Member as provided in \n     this subsection, the deposition notice may be authorized by a \n     vote of the Members of the Committee. Committee deposition \n     notices shall specify a time and place for examination, and \n     the name of the Committee Member or Members or staff officer \n     or officers who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise \n     specified, the deposition shall be in private. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or \n     produce unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Committee subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by a Committee Member or \n     Members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee Member or Members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his or her presence, the transcriber shall certify \n     that the transcript is a true record of the testimony, and \n     the transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of \n     the Committee. The Chairman or a staff officer designated by \n     him/her may stipulate with the witness to changes in the \n     procedure; deviations from this procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his or her obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n\n\n                 RULE 6. COMMITTEE REPORTING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported, following final action, the report \n     thereon shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest \n     practicable time. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 10(b), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       B. Supplemental, Minority, and additional views. A Member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his or her intention to \n     file supplemental, Minority, or additional views at the time \n     of final Committee approval of a measure or matter shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee. Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Notice by Subcommittee Chairmen. The Chairman of each \n     Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman in writing whenever \n     any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee \n     and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.\n       D. Draft reports of Subcommittees. All draft reports \n     prepared by Subcommittees of this Committee on any measure or \n     matter referred to it by the Chairman shall be in the form, \n     style, and arrangement required to conform to the applicable \n     provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and shall be \n     in accordance with the established practices followed by the \n     Committee. Upon completion of such draft reports, copies \n     thereof shall be filed with the chief clerk of the Committee \n     at the earliest practicable time.\n       E. Impact statements in reports. All Committee reports, \n     accompanying a bill or joint resolution of a public character \n     reported by the Committee, shall contain (1) an estimate, \n     made by the Committee, of the costs which would be incurred \n     in carrying out the legislation for the then current fiscal \n     year and for each of the next 5 years thereafter (or for the \n     authorized duration of the proposed legislation, if less than \n     5 years); and (2) a comparison of such cost estimates with \n     any made by a Federal agency; or (3) in lieu of such estimate \n     or comparison, or both, a statement of the reasons for \n     failure by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Each such report shall also contain an evaluation, made by \n     the Committee, of the regulatory impact which would be \n     incurred in carrying out the bill or joint resolution. The \n     evaluation shall include (a) an estimate of the numbers of \n     individuals and businesses who would be regulated and a \n     determination of the groups and classes of such individuals \n     and businesses, (b) a determination of the economic impact of \n     such regulation on the individuals, consumers, and businesses \n     affected, (c) a determination of the impact on the personal \n     privacy of the individuals affected, and (d) a determination \n     of the amount of paperwork that will result from the \n     regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint \n     resolution, which determination may include, but need not be \n     limited to, estimates of the amount of time and financial \n     costs required of affected parties, showing whether the \n     effects of the bill or joint resolution could be substantial, \n     as well as reasonable estimates of the recordkeeping \n     requirements that may be associated with the bill or joint \n     resolution. Or, in lieu of the forgoing evaluation, the \n     report shall include a statement of the reasons for failure \n     by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n           RULE 7.

Subcommittee meetings and hearings. Each Subcommittee of \n     this Committee is authorized to establish meeting dates and \n     adopt rules not inconsistent with the rules of the Committee \n     except as provided in Rules 2(D) and 7(E).\n       E. Subcommittee subpoenas. Each Subcommittee is authorized \n     to adopt rules concerning subpoenas which need not be \n     consistent with the rules of the Committee; provided, \n     however, that in the event the Subcommittee authorizes the \n     issuance of a subpoena pursuant to its own rules, a written \n     notice of intent to issue the subpoena shall be provided to \n     the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     Chairman or a staff officer designated by him/her immediately \n     upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be issued for \n     at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from \n     delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member waive the 48-hour waiting period or \n     unless the Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member that, in\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\n     his or her opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena \n     immediately.\n       F. Subcommittee budgets. During the first year of a new \n     Congress, each Subcommittee that requires authorization for \n     the expenditure of funds for the conduct of inquiries and \n     investigations, shall file with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee, by a date and time prescribed by the Chairman, its \n     request for funds for the two (2) 12-month periods beginning \n     on March 1 and extending through and including the last day \n     of February of the 2 following years, which years comprise \n     that Congress.

(Rule XXVI, Sec. 9, Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n             RULE 8. CONFIRMATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Standards. In considering a nomination, the Committee \n     shall inquire into the nominee's experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated. The Committee shall recommend \n     confirmation, upon finding that the nominee has the necessary \n     integrity and is affirmatively qualified by reason of \n     training, education, or experience to carry out the functions \n     of the office to which he or she was nominated.\n       B. Information concerning the Nominee. Each nominee shall \n     submit the following information to the Committee:\n       (1) A detailed biographical resume which contains \n     information relating to education, employment, and \n     achievements;\n       (2) Financial information, in such specificity as the \n     Committee deems necessary, including a list of assets and \n     liabilities of the nominee and tax returns for the 3 years \n     preceding the time of his or her nomination, and copies of \n     other relevant documents requested by the Committee, such as \n     a proposed blind trust agreement, necessary for the \n     Committee's consideration; and,\n       (3) Copies of other relevant documents the Committee may \n     request, such as responses to questions concerning the \n     policies and programs the nominee intends to pursue upon \n     taking office. At the request of the Chairman or the Ranking \n     Minority Member, a nominee shall be required to submit a \n     certified financial statement compiled by an independent \n     auditor. Information received pursuant to this subsection \n     shall be made available for public inspection; provided, \n     however, that tax returns shall, after review by persons \n     designated in subsection (C) of this rule, be placed under \n     seal to ensure confidentiality.\n       C. Procedures for Committee inquiry. The Committee shall \n     conduct an inquiry into the experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity of nominees, and shall give \n     particular attention to the following matters:\n       (1) A review of the biographical information provided by \n     the nominee, including, but not limited to, any professional \n     activities related to the duties of the office to which he or \n     she is nominated;\n       (2) A review of the financial information provided by the \n     nominee, including tax returns for the 3 years preceding the \n     time of his or her nomination;\n       (3) A review of any actions, taken or proposed by the \n     nominee, to remedy conflicts of interest; and\n       (4) A review of any personal or legal matter which may bear \n     upon the nominee's qualifications for the office to which he \n     or she is nominated. For the purpose of assisting the \n     Committee in the conduct of this inquiry, a Majority \n     investigator or investigators shall be designated by the \n     Chairman and a Minority investigator or investigators shall \n     be designated by the Ranking Minority Member. The Chairman, \n     Ranking Minority Member, other Members of the Committee, and \n     designated investigators shall have access to all \n     investigative reports on nominees prepared by any Federal \n     agency, except that only the Chairman, the Ranking Minority \n     Member, or other Members of the Committee, upon request, \n     shall have access to the report of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. The Committee may request the assistance of \n     the U.S. Government Accountability Office and any other such \n     expert opinion as may be necessary in conducting its review \n     of information provided by nominees.\n       D. Report on the Nominee. After a review of all information \n     pertinent to the nomination, a confidential report on the \n     nominee shall be made in the case of judicial nominees and \n     may be made in the case of non-judicial nominees by the \n     designated investigators to the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member and, upon request, to any other Member of the \n     Committee. The report shall summarize the steps taken by the \n     Committee during its investigation of the nominee and the \n     results of the Committee inquiry, including any unresolved \n     matters that have been raised during the course of the \n     inquiry.\n       E. Hearings. The Committee shall conduct a public hearing \n     during which the nominee shall be called to testify under \n     oath on all matters relating to his or her suitability for \n     office, including the policies and programs which he or she \n     will pursue while in that position. No hearing shall be held \n     until at least 72 hours after the following events have \n     occurred: The nominee has responded to prehearing questions \n     submitted by the Committee; and, if applicable, the report \n     described in subsection (D) has been made to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member, and is available to other Members of \n     the Committee, upon request.\n       F. Action on confirmation. A mark-up on a nomination shall \n     not occur on the same day that the hearing on the nominee is \n     held. In order to assist the Committee in reaching a \n     recommendation on confirmation, the staff may make an oral \n     presentation to the Committee at the mark-up, factually \n     summarizing the nominee's background and the steps taken \n     during the pre-hearing inquiry.\n       G. Application. The procedures contained in subsections \n     (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this rule shall apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to positions requiring their full-\n     time service. At the discretion of the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, those procedures may apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to serve on a part-time basis.\n\n\n          RULE 9. PERSONNEL ACTIONS AFFECTING COMMITTEE STAFF\n\n       In accordance with Rule XLII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate and the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (P.L. \n     104-1), all personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, state of \n     physical handicap, or disability.\n\n\n                RULE 10. APPRISAL OF COMMITTEE BUSINESS\n\n       The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member shall keep each \n     other apprised of hearings, investigations, and other \n     Committee business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S865-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S865-S866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the recent testimony of former Secretary of the Navy John \nLehman before the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee of House \nArmed Services Committee. In my view, Secretary Lehman presents \nimportant testimony that highlights the need for maintaining a strong \nmaritime defense capability in an increasingly uncertain international \nsecurity environment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Testimony before the House Seapower and Projection Forces \n     Subcommittee by John Lehman, February 26th, 2013.\n       Mr. Chairman it is a special honor for me to appear today \n     before this historic committee of Congress. In my six years \n     as SecNav I spent hundreds of hours testifying and consulting \n     with Chairman Charlie Bennet and the bi-partisan membership. \n     They were truly equal partners with the Reagan Administration \n     in building the 600 ship Navy and a rejuvenated Marine Corps.\n       Perhaps the greatest among its many accomplishments was the \n     role of the Committee ( then a full committee titled The \n     Naval Affairs Committee) and its legendary chairman, Carl \n     Vinson, in first persuading and then partnering with \n     President Franklin Roosevelt in urgently rebuilding the US \n     Navy through the shipbuilding acts of 1934, 1936, 1938, and \n     1940. Those bills authorized every new capital ship that \n     fought to victory in WWII. Without that Robust leadership of \n     this committee, we could not have won the war.\n       It is with that historic perspective that the Committee \n     should approach its current task.\n       The current administration has called for a 300-ship Navy, \n     up from the current 286. It is their belief that such a \n     number at half the size of the Reagan Navy, is sufficient for \n     our security on the grounds that newer ships are better than \n     the ones they replace.\n       While that is true in some cases, such as submarines, it is \n     not true for other ships such as the new LCS (littoral combat \n     ship), which does not have the capability of the older \n     frigates that they replace. Moreover, our potential \n     adversaries, from North Korea to the Iranian Navy, have \n     improved their technology as well.\n       But most important, numbers still count: The seas are great \n     and our Navy is small. The administrations position that \n     ``the United States Navy will be everywhere in the world that \n     it has been, and it will be as much [present] as the 600-ship \n     navy'' is not persuasive.\n       The size of the Navy in the Reagan administration (it \n     reached 594 ships in 1987) reflected a strategy to deter the \n     Soviet Union's world-wide naval force. Today we face no such \n     powerful naval adversary, but the world is just as large, and \n     there is now greater American dependence on global trade and \n     many more disturbers of the peace.\n       While we do not need 600 ships today, no naval experts \n     believe a 300-ship Navy is large enough to guarantee freedom \n     of the seas for American and allied trade, for supporting \n     threatened allies, for deterring rogue states like Iran from \n     closing vital straits, and for maintaining stability in areas \n     like the western Pacific. For example, the bipartisan \n     Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel led by Stephen \n     Hadley and William Perry last year concluded that the Navy \n     should have at least 346 vessels.\n       The more troubling problem is that the administration goal \n     of 300 is counting ships that won't be built at all. Last \n     year, the president's budget called for cuts of $487 billion \n     over the next decade. The President's proposal for the \n     sequester would mean an additional half-trillion dollars in \n     mandatory defense reductions over the next decade.\n       Naval readiness is already highly fragile. In order to meet \n     current operational requirements, the shrunken fleet stays \n     deployed longer and gets repaired less. There is now a \n     serious shortage of Navy combat aircraft, and for the first \n     time since World War II there are essentially no combat \n     attrition reserves. But the biggest effects of budget cuts \n     will be on drastically curtailing naval operations now and \n     naval shipbuilding for the future.\n       The Navy has cancelled the deployment of one carrier strike \n     group, halving our deterrence in the Mid-East, and the CNO \n     has testified that even more drastic cuts to deployments will \n     immediately result when sequester takes effect. This is the \n     correct policy by Navy leadership. The Navy cannot do more \n     with less, they can only do less with less.\n       Currently the Navy has 286 ships. In order to pay for even \n     drastically reduced current\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\n     operations, the Administration will be retiring a score or \n     more of modern combat ships (cruisers and amphibious vessels \n     and frigates) well before their useful life. In order to \n     reach a 350-ship fleet in our lifetime, we would need to \n     increase shipbuilding to an average of 15 ships every year. \n     The latest budget the administration has advanced proposes \n     buying just 41 ships over five years. It is anything but \n     certain that the administration's budgets will sustain even \n     that rate of only eight ships per year, but even if they do, \n     the United States is headed for a Navy of 240-250 ships at \n     best.\n       So how is the Obama administration getting to a 300-ship \n     Navy? It projects a huge increase in naval shipbuilding \n     beginning years down the road, most of which would come after \n     a second Obama term. In other words, the administration is \n     radically cutting the size and strength of the Navy now, \n     while trying to avoid accountability by assuming that a \n     future president will find the means to fix the problem in \n     the future.\n       This compromises our national security. The Navy is the \n     foundation of America's economic and political presence in \n     the world. Other nations, like China, Russia, North Korea and \n     Iran, are watching what we do--and on the basis of the \n     evidence, they are undoubtedly concluding that America is \n     declining in power and resolution. Russia and China have each \n     embarked on ambitious and enormously expensive naval buildups \n     with weapons designed specifically against American carriers \n     and submarines.\n\n\n                     WHAT SHOULD THE COMMITTEE DO?\n\n       I urge the committee to step up to the challenge of the \n     current crisis just as its former leader Carl Vinson did. \n     That does not just mean adding money and ships to the \n     Administration's request. It means instead providing a new \n     framework of debate based on a sound and simple strategy just \n     as Vinson did. It means focusing the Debate on those key \n     issues where legislation can be determinant.\n       The current fiscal crisis should be harnessed as a catalyst \n     to enable the undertaking of deep changes.\n       The two highest priorities for the Committee should be \n     fundamentally changing the disastrous systemic dysfunction of \n     the DoD procurement process, and completely re-setting the \n     military compensation system.\n\n\n                              PROCUREMENT\n\n       The Department of Defense acquisition process is seriously \n     broken. Under the current system, it takes decades, not \n     years, to develop and field weapons systems. Even worse, an \n     increasing number of acquisition programs are plagued by cost \n     over runs, schedule slips and failures to perform. The many \n     horror stories like the F-35, the Air Force tanker scandal, \n     the Navy shipbuilding failures and the Army armor disasters \n     are only the visible tip of an iceberg. The major cause has \n     been unbridled bureaucratic bloat (e.g. 690,000 DoD \n     civilians, 250 uniformed Joint task forces) resulting in \n     complete loss of line authority and accountability. As the \n     House Armed Services Committee formally concluded:\n       ``Simply put, the Department of Defense acquisition process \n     is broken. The ability of the Department to conduct the large \n     scale acquisitions required to ensure our future national \n     security is a concern of the committee. The rising costs and \n     lengthening schedules of major defense acquisition programs \n     lead to more expensive platforms fielded with fewer \n     numbers.''\n       That is, of course, an understatement. We are really \n     engaged in a form of unilateral disarmament through runaway \n     costs. Unless the acquisition system is fixed it will soon be \n     impossible to maintain a military of sufficient size and \n     sophistication with which to secure our liberties and protect \n     the national interest. The solution is clear and achievable.\n\n\n                         MILITARY COMPENSATION\n\n       Just as entitlements are steadily squeezing out \n     discretionary spending in the Federal budget, personnel costs \n     in the Pentagon are squeezing out operations and \n     modernization. There has not been a comprehensive overhaul of \n     military compensation, retirement, and medical care since the \n     original Gates Commission during the Nixon Administration. It \n     is long overdue. Over the last several years the Pentagon has \n     done the difficult work through the Defense Business Board to \n     establish the hard facts necessary to undertake such an \n     effort. The Independent QDR panel two years ago recommended \n     the establishment of a bi-partisan commission to undertake \n     the task and report to Congress and the President. Now is the \n     time to act on that recommendation.\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       This committee has an historic constitutional \n     responsibility, and in the present fiscal crisis a unique \n     opportunity to put our Navy back on the proper course to \n     secure our future security. The Committee can't do everything \n     and must concentrate its efforts on the highest priorities \n     where its unique power can be decisive. I urge you to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S867-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS OBJECTIONS\n\n\n                           Christopher Meade\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President. I intend to object to proceeding to \nthe nomination of Christopher Meade to be General Counsel to the \nTreasury Department for the following reason: At his confirmation \nhearing, I asked Mr. Meade for the Treasury Department's legal basis \nfor not responding to an oversight request I made regarding the \nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Mr. Meade is \ncurrently the Acting General Counsel and his response appeared to \nindicate that he interpreted a statute which states: ``Nothing in this \nsubsection shall be construed to prevent disclosure to either House of \nCongress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of the \nCongress'' as a limitation on Congress' ability to access information. \nThe plain reading of the statute appears contrary to this \ninterpretation.\n  In addition, Mr. Meade appeared to interpret a statute which requires \nCFIUS to brief certain specified Members of Congress as restricting \nCFIUS' ability to brief anyone except those members. Again, the plain \nreading of the statute appears contrary to this interpretation. There \nis nothing in this statute which restricts Treasury from briefing any \nother Members of Congress.\n  In an attempt to give Mr. Meade an opportunity to clarify his \nstatements and explain his legal reasoning I wrote Mr. Meade another \nletter asking him to explain his logic and legal reasoning. I expect \nhis reply shortly.\n  The most important role a Department General Counsel plays is in the \ninterpretation of statutes passed by Congress. If Congress cannot be \nsatisfied that Mr. Meade will impartially and accurately interpret \nstatutes, this is a grave concern. The issues I have raised appear \nuncontroversial. If a statute says that ``nothing'' in it can be \nconstrued to prevent the disclosure of information to Congress, I do \nnot expect it to be interpreted to limit Congress' ability to access \ninformation. If a statute does not limit CFIUS' ability to brief \nMembers of Congress, I do not expect it to be interpreted to limit \nCFIUS' ability to brief Members of Congress.\n  I strongly believe that Congress' job does not end once it passes a \nstatute. It is our job to ensure that the Executive Branch enforces the \nstatute the way it was written. I will object to proceeding to Mr. \nMeade's nomination until he demonstrates that he will interpret these \nstatutes consistent with their plain meaning.\n\n\n                              Bill Schultz\n\n  Madam President, I would also like to express my opposition to moving \nforward with Bill Schultz as the General Counsel for the Health and \nHuman Services Administration. My objection is due to the agency's \nrefusal to respond to my oversight requests. It is not based on Mr. \nShultz's qualifications or ability to do the job. I have met with Mr. \nSchultz and believe him to be fair and hard working.\n  However, as I mentioned to him during his nomination hearing and when \nI met with him personally--I have many unanswered letters and document \nrequests pending with HHS. Specifically: I have received no response to \nmy December 6, 2011, letter eliminating the age restriction on Plan B; \nI received no response to Chairman Issa and my April 5, 2012, letter to \nFDA regarding the monitoring of FDA employees; I received no response \nto my July 16, 2012, letter to FDA regarding the monitoring of FDA \nemployees; I received no response to my July 24, 2012, letter to FDA \nregarding the monitoring of FDA employees.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  FDA intentionally spied on confidential communication with Congress, \nthe Office of Special Counsel, and the whistleblowers private \nattorneys. Furthermore, in a meeting with my staff you indicated that \none month was too long for letters from Congress to go unanswered. My \nletters have gone unanswered ranging from 7 months to over a year.\n  Until I receive answers to my letters and document requests, I am \nhesitant to agree to any movement on this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S867-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S867-S868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    KALMBACH FEEDS 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, today I wish to congratulate Kalmbach \nFeeds, a family-owned company, on 50 years of serving Ohio farms and \nagribusiness. Kalmbach Farms was founded in 1963 by Milton and Ruth \nKalmbach,\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nand their goal was to ``create a new way of doing business.'' Starting \nthe business with only one truck and one employee, the Kalmbach family \nopened a mix-and-grind plant in Upper Sandusky, OH. That operation has \ngrown into the large commercial farm it is today.\n  Kalmbach Farms has been on the forefront of feed production. The farm \nmanufactures and sells nutritional products for all livestock and \npoultry species and has been devoted to providing customers feed at a \nfair price. The Kalmbach family has been able to expand its business \nmodel to include nutritional products for mink, wildlife, swine, and \npets. With branches in both Michigan and Indiana, Kalmbach Farms' \nproducts are regional leaders in the animal nutrition industry and are \ndistributed in several States, including Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, \nKentucky, West Virginia, Illinois, and New York.\n  Kalmbach Farms is now run by Milton and Ruth's son, Paul Kalmbach. \nThis proud Ohio company employs over 250 people, and since the business \nbegan there has not been a single layoff. Kalmbach Feeds is continuing \nto look to the future by expanding the business and offering more \nemployment opportunities for individuals interested in agriculture. I \nwould like to congratulate the Kalmbach family on their 50 years of \nquality service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S868-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CONGRATULATING THE ROTARY CLUB OF CARSON CITY\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to congratulate one \nof my home State's finest community organizations, the Rotary Club of \nCarson City, for its 75 years of service to the Carson City community.\n  The Rotary Club of Carson City has been committed to their ideal of \n``He Profits Most Who Serves Best'' for three quarters of a century. In \n1937, Hans Jepson and Rev. John L. Harvey formed the Carson City Club \nwith 25 members on their chapter roll. Today, the Rotary Club in Carson \nCity has grown to over 90 members who live by their motto ``Service \nAbove Self'' while providing vitally important community service to the \nCarson City area.\n  In addition, the club has been committed to fostering and promoting \nthe educational pursuits of students in Carson City. Each year, they \naward a 4-year college scholarship to a non-traditional student, as \nwell as sponsor high school students to participate in an international \nyouth exchange program. The Carson Rotary Club also recognizes \nexcellence in the classroom and academic achievement by honoring a \nlocal student of the week and teacher of the month throughout each \nschool year.\n  The Rotarians are an important example of the kind of dedicated \nservice which makes our communities great. Today, I ask my colleagues \nto join me in congratulating the Rotary Club of Carson City for 75 \nyears of service to the people of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S868-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR A. KLEIN\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Arthur A. \nKlein, a veteran of World War II and resident of Billings, MT.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Art's service in World War II, \nbecause no story of bravery--and especially not one from our ``greatest \ngeneration''--should ever be forgotten.\n  Art was born October 17, 1921, in Killam, Canada, to a large and \nhard-working prairie family. Hard times forced Art to move to Spokane, \nWA, to find work, but he soon enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1939 \nfor a chance to proudly serve the Nation he would eventually adopt as \nhis own.\n  In August 1941, the Marine Corps assigned Art to the First Marine \nDefense Battalion on Wake Island: a remote atoll 2,300 miles west of \nHawaii where the U.S. Navy was building a military base. Four hundred \nand forty-nine U.S. marines, 68 U.S. Navy personnel, 6 Army Air Corps \nsoldiers, and 1,221 civilian workers occupied the three islands \ncomprising Wake Atoll.\n  Because of the International Date Line, the Japanese attack on Pearl \nHarbor was December 8, 1941, at Wake Island. Wake Islands naval \ncommander received radio reports of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor \nand ordered the island to full alert. Following the attack on Pearl \nHarbor the Japanese planes attacked Wake Island. While defending the \nisland, Mr. Klein was shot in the leg.\n  U.S. forces on Wake Island fought for many days without \nreinforcements or support, but they couldnt hold against overwhelming \nJapanese forces. To save civilians and military forces, the islands \nU.S. naval commander was forced to surrender the garrison.\n  On January 12, 1942, Mr. Klein was placed aboard the Japanese ship \nNitta Maru and crowded into the ships cargo hold. In the ships cargo \nhold, Mr. Klein endured 7 days before docking in Japan.\n  For the next 4 years, Mr. Klein worked in Japanese coal mines and \ncrude steel mills. Once, a guard clubbed Mr. Klein into unconsciousness \nfor simply picking a small onion to eat.\n  Losing weight and in declining health, Mr. Klein never gave up hope. \nIn September 1945, when Allied forces victoriously liberated Mr. Klein \nand other prisoners in Japan, Mr. Klein weighed 85 pounds.\n  Returning in triumph to America and freedom, Mr. Klein, now a \nsergeant in the Marine Corps, spent weeks in a military hospital to \nrecover from his captivity. Art eventually left the Marine Corps, \nbecame an American citizen, and began a successful business career.\n  Art settled in Billings, MT, and has been active in veterans \norganizations where he continues being a source of inspiration, \ncourage, and patriotism for us all. A fellow veteran recently asked Art \nwhat kept him going during his WWII captivity. In response, Mr. Klein, \nnow 91 years of age, struggled to raise a now frail right arm as high \nas he could, and with a clenched fist and inspiring smile, said, ``The \nUSA.''\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I commend Mr. Klein and his service \nto America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S868-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:46 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 667.

A bill to provide for the partial settlement of certain claims \nunder the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto provide a small interim conveyance of lands to the Sealaska Native \nRegional Corporation of Southeast Alaska, a conveyance designed simply \nto keep Sealaska in business for the next year or so to give this \nCongress sufficient time to consider a more comprehensive solution to \nthe issue of how to complete the Native corporation's land conveyances \nauthorized 42 years ago.\n  Several weeks ago I and my colleague Sen. Mark Begich reintroduced \nlegislation first proposed in 2007 and 2008 to resolve problems with \nland conveyances to Southeast Alaska Natives, S. 340, stemming from \npassage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. Back in the \n110th Congress there was plenty of time to resolve these land \nconveyance issues. Unfortunately as we begin the 113th Congress, the \nSealaska Corporation has nearly exhausted its ability to use its lands \nin Southeast to benefit their shareholders in a socially responsible \nmanner. This bill that we introduce today is a small stop-gap measure \nto give the corporation a one- or two-year additional supply of \naccessible lands to guarantee the continued operations of the \ncorporation in order to give us and the House of Representatives \nadditional time to again consider a more comprehensive settlement of \nSoutheast Alaska Native land issues.\n  Today I am proposing legislation to grant Sealaska quick conveyance \nof the two smallest parcels of lands under consideration for conveyance \nto it as part of a broader land settlement revision. The parcels \ntotaling 3,380 acres of the 68,000 acres proposed in the broader bill, \ninclude 2,000 acres at North Election Creek on central Prince of Wales \nIsland, lands adjacent to existing Sealaska lands on the island, and \n1,380 acres on the west side of the Cleveland Peninsula north of \nKetchikan, lands also adjacent to Sealaska's current holdings. I am \nproposing interim conveyance of just these two tracts within 60 days of \nthe act's passage, because to my knowledge there are few if any \nenvironmental concerns that have been raised with resource development \non either tract. I am proposing to limit the conveyances to just these \ntwo to give Sealaska another year or two of existing operations to give \ntime for the 113th Congress to hold new hearings on\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\nthe Sealaska lands issue and to finalize and pass legislation. But by \nlimiting the selections to just two small tracts, I am not lessening \nthe urgency of the need for all parties to reach an agreement on the \nterms of a broader bill within the 113th Congress. If no agreement is \nreached on a broader bill, Sealaska will again be forced to curtail its \noperations with likely tragic consequences for Southeast's regional \neconomy long before this Administration ends.\n  The bill, in an effort not to limit negotiations on a broader land \nsettlement, makes no other changes, except to guarantee that all \nexisting access provisions to lands required by the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act remain in force on the two parcels proposed for \nconveyance. This bill is purely intended to give this Congress \nsufficient time to consider this issue while maintaining the economic \nstatus quo in the Panhandle--a fact that is vital for a timber \nindustry, but also in order for the U.S. Forest Service to have the \ntime and related infrastructure needed to implement its proposed young-\ngrowth transition strategy in the Tongass National Forest.\n  My hope is that this bill will promptly be considered and passed by \nthis Congress, to give us all the time needed to reach an equitable \nsolution to land issues in America's largest national forest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S873-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 42--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                             ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nArmed Services; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n                               S.

Res. 56\n\n       Whereas Harriet Ross Tubman was born into slavery near \n     Buckstown, Maryland, in or around the year 1820, to her \n     parents Benjamin Ross and Harriet Green, and was named \n     Araminta Ross;\n       Whereas, as a child slave, Tubman checked muskrat traps \n     along the marshes of the Blackwater River in Dorchester \n     County, Maryland, and later worked in the fields and forests \n     surrounding the Brodess Plantation;\n       Whereas, as a teenage slave, Tubman worked as a seamstress \n     on the Cook Plantation in Dorchester County, Maryland, and \n     changed her name to Harriet;\n       Whereas, at the age of 24, Tubman married a free black man \n     named John Tubman, though she remained a slave;\n       Whereas, in 1849, upon hearing news that she was to be sold \n     to settle the debts of her late master, Tubman escaped from \n     slavery to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, marking the first of \n     many expeditions to and from the Eastern Shore of Maryland to \n     lead nearly 70 slaves out of slavery;\n       Whereas, over the course of the next 11 years, from 1849 to \n     1860, Tubman became a famous conductor of the Underground \n     Railroad, proclaiming in her later years, ``I never ran my \n     train off the track and I never lost a passenger.'';\n       Whereas, since the journeys to freedom by Tubman took place \n     over the winter months when the nights were long and dark, \n     her groups made stops along the extensive Underground \n     Railroad, first traveling to the Quaker community of Poplar \n     Neck in Caroline County, Maryland, eventually making stops at \n     the homes of Quaker abolitionist Thomas Garrett in \n     Wilmington, Delaware, and African-American abolitionist and \n     future civil rights activist William Still in Philadelphia, \n     Pennsylvania, before final resettlement in Canada;\n       Whereas, in the late 1850s, Tubman began to speak before \n     abolitionist audiences to share her dedication and unwavering \n     commitment to the abolitionist cause and the emancipation of \n     slaves;\n       Whereas Tubman drew admiration from African-American \n     abolitionist Frederick Douglass, a fellow Eastern Shore \n     native of Talbot County, Maryland, who stated, ``I know of no \n     one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships \n     to serve our enslaved people than you have.'';\n       Whereas the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, \n     located in Cincinnati, Ohio, recognizes Tubman as one the \n     most famous conductors along the Underground Railroad and has \n     dedicated a theater in honor of Tubman;\n       Whereas, in 1859, Tubman purchased a home and several acres \n     of land in Auburn, New York, from William Henry Seward, then \n     United States Senator from New York and future Secretary of \n     State for President Abraham Lincoln;\n       Whereas Tubman attended her first Women's Rights Convention \n     in Boston, Massachusetts in 1860, beginning a lifelong \n     commitment to the suffrage movement;\n       Whereas, at the start of the Civil War in 1861, Tubman \n     believed that a Union victory would be a key stepping stone \n     to the abolition of slavery and vowed to assist the cause, \n     joining abolitionist Bostonians and Philadelphians who \n     traveled to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina to provide aid \n     to the Union war effort;\n       Whereas Tubman used the skills that she learned evading \n     detection and capture on the Underground Railroad to serve as \n     a spy and scout for the Union camp at Port Royal, South \n     Carolina in addition to providing care to Union forces as a \n     nurse and cook;\n       Whereas, in 1863, the same year that the Emancipation \n     Proclamation was issued, Tubman became the first woman to \n     lead an armed assault during the Civil War on the Raid on \n     Combahee Ferry;\n       Whereas Tubman led bands of scouts along the marshes and \n     rivers of Port Royal, similar to those of her native \n     Dorchester County, to map the unfamiliar territory for \n     Colonel James Montgomery, commander of the 2nd Regiment South \n     Carolina Volunteer Infantry (African Descent);\n       Whereas, between June 1 and June 2, 1863, Tubman guided \n     Colonel Montgomery and a detachment of 300 men from the 2nd \n     Regiment South Carolina Volunteer Infantry (African Descent) \n     through the mine-laden waters of the Combahee River in \n     Colleton County, South Carolina, where the Union forces \n     liberated nearly 750 slaves;\n       Whereas Tubman assisted the newly liberated slaves in the \n     years following the raid and tended to wounded soldiers in \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia before returning to Auburn, New \n     York after the conclusion of the Civil War;\n       Whereas Tubman dedicated the later years of her life to \n     promoting the women's suffrage movement, traveling to New \n     York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, \n     District of Columbia, to speak before countless women's \n     groups with fellow suffrage movement leaders Susan B. Anthony \n     and Emily Howland;\n       Whereas, when asked if she believed women deserved the \n     right to vote, Tubman replied, ``I suffered enough to believe \n     it.'';\n       Whereas, in 1903, Tubman deeded her property to the African \n     Methodist Episcopal Zion Church of Auburn, New York, to serve \n     as a home for the ``aged and indigent colored people'', which \n     opened on June 23, 1908, as the Harriet Tubman Home for the \n     Aged; and\n       Whereas, having lived in the home named after her, Tubman \n     passed away on March 10, 1913, at the age of 93: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of the 100th anniversary of \n     the death of Harriet Tubman, whose dedication and unwavering \n     commitment to serving in any capacity necessary to pursue the \n     promise of American ideals and the principles of humanity \n     continue to inspire all individuals who cherish freedom;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to honor and \n     preserve the legacy of Tubman;\n       (3) recognizes the significance of the tireless work of \n     Tubman and the other individuals who bravely served to create \n     the Underground Railroad network to achieve freedom for those \n     individuals enslaved during the Antebellum Era of the United \n     States; and\n       (4) recognizes the dedication and commitment of the Harriet \n     Tubman Organization of Cambridge, Maryland, and the Harriet \n     Tubman Home, Inc. and the Harriet Tubman Boosters Club, both \n     of Auburn, New York, for preserving the heritage of the \n     United States and promoting the rich history of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S878-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 56 RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 100TH \n            ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF HARRIET ROSS TUBMAN\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S878, February 26, 2013, in the first column, the \nfollowing appears: SENATE RESOLUTION 56 RECOGNIZING THE \nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF HARRIET \nTUBMAN\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: SENATE RESOLUTION 56 \nRECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH \nOF HARRIET ROSS TUBMAN\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Portman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \nGillibrand, and Mr. Brown) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Head Island, South Carolina to provide aid \n     to the Union war effort;\n       Whereas Tubman used the skills that she learned evading \n     detection and capture on the Underground Railroad to serve as \n     a spy and scout for the Union camp at Port Royal, South \n     Carolina in addition to providing care to Union forces as a \n     nurse and cook;\n       Whereas, in 1863, the same year that the Emancipation \n     Proclamation was issued, Tubman became the first woman to \n     lead an armed assault during the Civil War on the Raid on \n     Combahee Ferry;\n       Whereas Tubman led bands of scouts along the marshes and \n     rivers of Port Royal, similar to those of her native \n     Dorchester County, to map the unfamiliar territory for \n     Colonel James Montgomery, commander of the 2nd Regiment South \n     Carolina Volunteer Infantry (African Descent);\n       Whereas, between June 1 and June 2, 1863, Tubman guided \n     Colonel Montgomery and a detachment of 300 men from the 2nd \n     Regiment South Carolina Volunteer Infantry (African Descent) \n     through the mine-laden waters of the Combahee River in \n     Colleton County, South Carolina, where the Union forces \n     liberated nearly 750 slaves;\n       Whereas Tubman assisted the newly liberated slaves in the \n     years following the raid and tended to wounded soldiers in \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia before returning to Auburn, New \n     York after the conclusion of the Civil War;\n       Whereas Tubman dedicated the later years of her life to \n     promoting the women's suffrage movement, traveling to New \n     York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, \n     District of Columbia, to speak before countless women's \n     groups with fellow suffrage movement leaders Susan B. Anthony \n     and Emily Howland;\n       Whereas, when asked if she believed women deserved the \n     right to vote, Tubman replied, ``I suffered enough to believe \n     it.'';\n       Whereas, in 1903, Tubman deeded her property to the African \n     Methodist Episcopal Zion Church of Auburn, New York, to serve \n     as a home for the ``aged and indigent colored people'', which \n     opened on June 23, 1908, as the Harriet Tubman Home for the \n     Aged; and\n       Whereas, having lived in the home named after her, Tubman \n     passed away on March 10, 1913, at the age of 93: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of the 100th anniversary of \n     the death of Harriet Tubman, whose dedication and unwavering \n     commitment to serving in any capacity necessary to pursue the \n     promise of American ideals and the principles of humanity \n     continue to inspire all individuals who cherish freedom;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to honor and \n     preserve the legacy of Tubman;\n       (3) recognizes the significance of the tireless work of \n     Tubman and the other individuals who bravely served to create \n     the Underground Railroad network to achieve freedom for those \n     individuals enslaved during the Antebellum Era of the United \n     States; and\n       (4) recognizes the dedication and commitment of the Harriet \n     Tubman Organization of Cambridge, Maryland, and the Harriet \n     Tubman Home, Inc. and the Harriet Tubman Boosters Club, both \n     of Auburn, New York, for preserving the heritage of the \n     United States and promoting the rich history of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/26/senate-section/article/S878-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S878-S879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 57--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 28, 2013, AS ``RARE DISEASE \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Pryor, and \nMrs. Hagan) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                               S.
