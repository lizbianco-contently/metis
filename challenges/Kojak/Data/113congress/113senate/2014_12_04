I wish to take a moment to introduce and thank our guest \nChaplain today.\n  Dr. Calvin French is the pastor emeritus for the Community of Christ \nChurch in Washington, DC, where he served that congregation for 30 \nyears before retiring. He has served as a pastor for 60 years of his \nlife, considerably more than, I would note, my 40 years in Congress.\n  Calvin French, Dr. French, is a native of Iowa. He holds degrees from \nthe University of Iowa, Graceland College, and Drake University in \naddition to his graduate studies at Harvard and Princeton.\n  For the past 25 years he has represented the parent church of his \ndenomination in governmental affairs, providing liaison service to the \nvarious agencies of the government as well as to Congress.\n  I personally have known Dr. French for going on almost 50 years now. \nWhen we first met in Iowa, his now deceased wife LaVon was a great \nfriend of my wife's. They were lawyers together in Iowa. We were close \nfamily friends, and this brings back so many fond memories of our times \ntogether in Iowa and later on.\n  I would note that Dr. French's granddaughter Dr. Kelsey French is \nhere in the gallery today with her husband Vince Bzdek, the news editor \nfor the Washington Post. Their two children are also here today Zola \nand Xavier who is celebrating his birthday today. Xavey is 13 years old \ntoday, so he was able to be here to see his grandfather give the \nopening prayer of the Senate.\n  I also note that in 1975, when I first came to the House of \nRepresentatives, I invited Dr. French to give the opening prayer in the \nHouse. So now, almost 40 years later, I am privileged to have had him \nhere to give the closing prayer before I retire from the Senate.\n  Dr. French, I would say, is someone I have admired for his commitment \nnot only to his church but the broader commitment he has had to \nhumanity, to all that he has done to infuse--and all around him--a \nspirit of kindness, generosity, and a spirit of understanding that \nwhile we may be different in so many ways, we are all the same in our \nhumanity. He is one of the most wonderful human beings I have had the \nprivilege of knowing and being with in my lifetime.\n  I say to my good friend, Dr. Calvin French, thank you. Thank you for \nall your pastoral work. Thank you for your leadership and your guidance \nthrough the past 50 years of my life.\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The data defied \n     critics who had said such growth would not continue for long \n     once the recession ended in mid-2009.\n\n  Health care spending was up last year but only 3.6 percent. It is \nvery remarkable.\n  As I indicated:\n\n       The 3.6 percent increase in 2013 is the lowest increase on \n     record in the national health expenditures going back to \n     1960.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6316-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a truly \noutstanding Senator, who will soon retire from this body after more \nthan 30 years of public service.\n  Of course, I am speaking of Senator Mike Johanns. Mike has had a \nremarkable career. He is the only current Member of this body--besides \nSenator Alexander--who has served as Senator, Governor, and Cabinet \nSecretary.\n  Yet for all he has accomplished, Mike isn't the flashiest Senator. He \ndoesn't hold the most press conferences, he doesn't yell the loudest, \nand you never have to worry about him knocking you over to get to a TV \ncamera, but in his steady and determined style, Mike has proven himself \na remarkably successful Member of this body.\n  That was true in his successful battles to defend Nebraska's rural \ncommunities against government overreach, it was true when he worked \nwith the late Senator Byrd to sink a national energy tax that \nthreatened his constituents, and it was true when he led the first \nsuccessful legislative effort to revisit ObamaCare, working with many \nDemocrats to repeal the so-called 1099 provision.\n  Mike has never looked for drama. He is always aiming for results. So \nit didn't take long for people in the Senate to recognize that Mike was \nmore than just another freshman in the minority. He became the guy you \nwould turn to if you wanted to get an amendment up to 60 votes.\n  That is truly remarkable for a first-term Senator. It is especially \nremarkable when we consider that Mike  came to the Senate at a time \nwhen Republicans were in the deep minority. But then again, Mike  is a \nvery remarkable guy: county commissioner, city councilman, mayor, \nGovernor, Secretary of Agriculture. You name it, Mike  has done it, and \nthat was before he even set foot in the Senate.\n  Some think Mike  must have a secret that allows him to assemble \nbipartisan coalitions on conservative issues, but I don't think it is \nmuch of a secret at all. Mike  works across the aisle. He works in good \nfaith, and he works hard. He doesn't care what party you are from and \nabsolutely no one can outwork him.\n  Mike  makes sure of that by getting up earlier than anyone else. It \nis a habit he learned growing up on a farm in northern Iowa. He would \nget up at 5 a.m. every day and then from age 4 he would work. He would \nshovel muck. He would fill the hog tanks. He would even deliver \npiglets.\n  The point is, Mike  developed an appreciation for hard work and \nresponsibility at an early age. Along with his strong Catholic faith, \nthese are the traits that still define him today, but they don't paint \nthe whole picture, because Mike Johanns may be an accomplished man, he \nmay be one of the smartest and most capable public servants you will \never meet, but he is absolute putty in the hands of his wife Stephanie. \nShe is always by his side. She is his best friend, and they complement \neach other perfectly.\n  Their idea--listen to this--of a perfect night out is a night in \ntogether. They are both Husker fans and, as Mike  put it, ``Steph is \nalmost never in a bad mood.'' He said: ``She jumps out of bed, and \nshe's got a big smile on her face and she thinks this is bound to be \nthe best day of her life.''\n  It is a personality perfectly suited, as one can imagine, to the \ncampaign trail, which is a good thing because the two of them have \nlogged tens of thousands of miles together campaigning across Nebraska, \nusually in matching T-shirts, sometimes in a beat-up old Corsica.\n  They have plenty of stories from the trail, too, but one from Mike  \n's run for Governor stands out particularly. This is what happened: The \nJohanns were driving home after a long day of marching in parades in \nthe hot Sun. They passed a barn on the way, assuming it was a cattle \nsale. They figured they would drop in and press a few palms. Stephanie \nparked the car, Mike  opened the door, and dozens of well-dressed \nNebraskan eyes fell on them.\n  The Johanns, in their sweaty T-shirts, hadn't dropped by a cattle \nsale; they had crashed a wedding. I will give them this, they made the \nbest of it. Mike  ended up dancing with the bride, and of course he \nwent on to win the election as well.\n  This is the sequel: Months later, at an inaugural ball in Lincoln, \ntwo uninvited guests showed up. It was, of course, the bride and her \nhusband.\n  They had a simple message: ``You crashed our wedding, Governor, and \nnow we're crashing your inaugural.''\n  So the senior Senator from Arizona may like to brag about his \nHollywood cameo with Vince Vaughn, but our colleagues know the truth. \nSenator Mike Johanns is the original--the original--wedding crasher.\n  Mike and Stephanie certainly have traveled a long and interesting \nroad from when they first met while serving on the Lancaster County \nBoard in the 1980s, when Mike would draft up walking lists on an old \ntypewriter and they would go out and campaign door to door.\n  A lot has changed. For one thing, Mike isn't a Democrat anymore. But \nmuch is the same too. Mike still cares deeply about mental health \nissues. It is what brought him into politics in the first place. It is \nwhat he considers his crowning achievement as Governor. He still has \nloyal fans on staff who remember all of his efforts on the issue.\n  It is a rare thing, the loyalty Mike inspires in people. This is the \nSenator with staffers who have been with him for many years, some since \nhis days in local politics, and here is what they all say about Mike \nJohanns: Senator Johanns is a man who cares--cares about his family, he \ncares about the people who work for him, and he cares about his \nconstituents. That is why he has given his cell phone out to half of \nNebraska.\n  He has made his mistakes, of course. As mayor of Lincoln, he had to \ncancel Halloween one year. But that is old news. To many Nebraskans he \nis still Governor, to others he is simply Mike. But whatever Nebraskans \ncall Mike Johanns, they respect him, and I know they are going to miss \nhim. And so are we.\n  At least retirement will give Mike more time to pursue his hobbies. \nWe hear he is a voracious window washer. He has even been known to pull \nout the Windex on vacation. Whatever he does, we know this is a \nretirement that is well earned. He has dealt with bird flu, mad cow \ndisease, the farm bill, deficit\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\nreduction, and just about any other issue you can think of over a long \nand distinguished career in public service.\n  We all want to thank Senator Johanns for his loyal and dedicated \nservice to the Senate and to the people of Nebraska. We wish Mike and \nStephanie the best as they look forward to their next adventure \ntogether.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to join in the remarks of the \ndistinguished Republican leader, but add to that that Stephanie is one \nof the funniest people Landra and I have ever known. She has a great \nsense of humor. What the Republican leader laid out is perfect, except \nthis woman has a sense of humor that is really quite remarkable.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, just a word or two to both leaders. Thank \nyou so much for your kind words. I also want to say thank you for \nmentioning my wife Stephanie. This has been a remarkable partnership \nfor a lot of years, and I could not have done what I did without her. \nSo thank you to Senator McConnell. Mr. Leader, thank you. It has been \nan honor to serve in this body. I will have more to say next week in my \nfarewell speech, but I did not want this day to go by without \nexpressing my appreciation. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the holiday rush is underway and millions \nof Americans are decorating, shopping, and preparing to spend \nChristmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa with their loved ones. I want to draw \nattention to one woman from Illinois who is doing something very \ndifferent.\n  Janet Teasley is a registered nurse in Chicago. She has volunteered \nto spend her holiday season in Liberia treating patients with the \npotentially deadly Ebola virus.\n  When Janet Teasley first told her family and coworkers of her plan, \nshe says she encountered some resistance. One doctor with whom she \nworks was only half kidding when he said he thought she was crazy. But \nonce he realized she was serious, the doctor told Teasley he admired \nher. I share that admiration.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates that nearly \n16,000 people have contracted the Ebola virus. Nearly 6,000 have died. \nToday, it is estimated that 7,000 people in Liberia, where Janet \nTeasley is volunteering, have Ebola. She is helping some of the \nneediest patients in that country that has been the hardest hit by this \ndisease.\n  Although Ebola has been contained so far here in the United States, \nthe outbreak is still raging in parts of West Africa. Teasley is part \nof a wave of U.S. health care workers being recruited to help stop the \nspread of the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and now Mali.\n  Teasley got involved through AmericaCares, which is one of about 150 \nnonprofits working with our government to recruit workers nationwide.\n  Teasley has been a nurse for 17 years, working in emergency care and \ninfectious disease units, most recently at Holy Cross Hospital in \nChicago--a hospital which I know well in the inner city, which serves \nsome of the poorest families in our town.\n  Now she will spend 8 weeks in Buchanan, Liberia, training and then \ntreating patients. She explains:\n\n       I came here for a purpose, and I want to see that through. \n     . . . I honestly believe no man is an island; each man's \n     death diminishes me. That's why I became a nurse.\n\n  Teasley's daughter Danica Miller wasn't surprised by her mom. She \nsays for leisure, her mom doesn't read novels but pours over books \nabout infectious diseases.\n  Despite her family's support, Teasley is conscious of the increased \nrisk she faces. In fact, many of those who have fallen ill have been \nhealth care workers themselves. Teasley is just sure she is not going \nto be one of them. She says she is confident in herself and her team \nand that she will be able to come home safely.\n  To stop this epidemic, we need many things. First and foremost we \nneed more people like Nurse Teasley. The Federal Government is seeking \nmedical professionals to work in the 23 Ebola treatment units being \nestablished in Liberia. While the number of volunteers increased \nsteadily this fall, it did drop off a bit when there was confusion over \nquarantine policies for returning medical workers. With time and \nperspective, this confusion seems to be settling. Illinois has brought \nits quarantine policy in line with that of the Centers for Disease \nControl. With a scientifically grounded and carefully measured \napproach, the hope is health care workers with the same passion and \ncourage as Nurse Janet Teasley will volunteer to help those in need.\n\n  I met with Tom Frieden, Director of the CDC, a couple of weeks ago. \nHe and members of the international public health community maintain \nthat the way to control the spread of Ebola is to contain the virus at \nits source.\n  To prepare for the possibility of Ebola patients here in America and \nto help with containment overseas, the Obama administration has \nrequested $6.18 billion in emergency funding, including $1.83 billion \nfor the CDC. I support the President.\n  Janet is a valuable and commendable part of this effort, and I hope \npeople will hear her story and the stories of people like her and \nsupport the efforts of the United States in Liberia.\n\n\n                         Vote on Orr Nomination\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question now occurs on the Orr \nnomination.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Franklin M. Orr, Jr., of California, to be Under Secretary for \nScience, Department of Energy?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6317-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6317-S6318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF JOSEPH S.

The CFO position plays an influential policy \nrole within the DOE, overseeing all financial matters and ensuring the \nsuccessful implementation of Departmentwide policies. Given that Mr. \nHezir, as recently as 2 years ago, lobbied the Obama administration and \nCongress in favor of Yucca\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\nMountain, an issue my State vehemently opposes and I have diligently \nfought to block and defund in Congress, I simply cannot support his \nnomination.\n  I have worked closely with our congressional delegation over the past \n8 years to fight efforts from outsiders to force nuclear waste on the \nState of Nevada. That includes defunding DOE efforts to advance the \nproject and diligently questioning all DOE and Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, NRC, nominees on their perspective regarding long-term \nnuclear waste storage. The 2012 Blue Ribbon Commission Report on \nAmerica's Nuclear Future provides a path forward for safe, responsible \nnuclear waste storage so our Nation can move beyond Yucca Mountain once \nand for all. My litmus test for any nominee involved in nuclear waste \ndisposal programs is support of the consent-based approach recommended \nin that report.\n  Mr. Hezir's nomination comes before the Senate today without one \nhearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It is the unique \nresponsibility we hold as United States Senators to carefully examine \nnominees for influential positions in the executive branch, like the \nCFO at the DOE--providing advice and consent. As a member of the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, that has jurisdiction over \nthis position at the Department of Energy, I take this responsibility \nseriously and deeply regret that I was not afforded that opportunity \ngiven the importance of this position.\n  Nevadans have the right to be safe in their own backyards. I \nrecognize the need to address the problem of spent nuclear fuel, but \nNevada, a State without any nuclear powerplants, should not bear the \nsole burden of long-term storage of the Nation's nuclear waste. I have \nstrong concerns about the high amount of uncertainty that could create \na dangerous situation for the surrounding communities and environment, \nand I simply do not trust the Federal Government to appropriately \nmanage the proposed Yucca Mountain facility.\n  Without the opportunity to carefully question Mr. Hezir in the \nnomination process, I can only assume he will continue his advocacy on \nbehalf of Yucca Mountain within the DOE. For this reason, I oppose Mr. \nHezir's nomination to be Chief Financial Officer at the Department of \nEnergy and encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, all time is \nyielded back.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Joseph S. Hezir, of Virginia, to be Chief Financial Officer, \nDepartment of Energy?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to offer my support \nfor a gentleman for whom cloture was just invoked. We are going to have \nthe confirmation vote this afternoon. I am talking about Mr. Joseph \nLeeson from Pennsylvania. He has been nominated to serve as a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  I wish to start by thanking Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nGrassley for facilitating and moving his candidacy through the process, \nthrough the committee, and Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, our \nrespective leaders, for bringing the nomination to the Senate floor. I \nappreciate that cooperation.\n  I should also point out that I am very grateful for the cooperation \nof my colleague Senator Casey. Senator Casey and I have spent a lot of \ntime and energy making sure we fill the vacancies that occur on the \nFederal bench in Pennsylvania with absolutely the most qualified, \nterrific Pennsylvanians, and we have been blessed that so many \nwonderful Pennsylvanians have offered to serve in this role, to make \nthis sacrifice for public service. In the 4 years I have been in the \nSenate, Senator Casey and I have confirmed 13 district judges. We \nplaced a judge in the Reading courthouse in Berks County, which had \nbeen vacant for 3 years; placed a judge in the Easton courthouse, which \nhad been vacant for 10 years; and when Mr. Leeson is hopefully \nconfirmed this afternoon, that will bring our total to 14.\n  I look forward to Joseph Leeson's speedy confirmation, and here is \nwhy. He is going to be a great Federal judge. Joe Leeson is a graduate \nfrom Catholic University, where he got his law degree. I have known \nJoseph Leeson certainly by his reputation for a very long time. He is a \nvery well-respected attorney in Allentown, PA, and my family and I live \njust outside Allentown and have for a long time.\n  Joe Leeson is a partner in Leeson & Leeson. He has very extensive \ntrial experience. He has counseled people in accidents and injury \ncases. He has represented legislators and mayors. His practice includes \nlitigation, municipal law, nonprofit, and religious law. Across the \nboard he has a very diverse portfolio.\n  He has also had a long and distinguished commitment to public \nservice. Joe Leeson has served as the Bethlehem city solicitor, as a \nmember of the Bethlehem city council, and on the administrative board \nof the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference.\n  If confirmed, he will sit in the Allentown courthouse, and we need a \nFederal judge in the Allentown courthouse. We have an outstanding judge \nthere now, but we need another because the size of the Lehigh Valley \nregion requires that. It will be terrific to have a second Federal \njudge in the Allentown courthouse for what I think will be the first \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by saying there is no question in my \nmind that Mr. Leeson has the experience, the acumen, the temperament, \nand the integrity to be an outstanding Federal judge. He will be a \ngreat addition to the bench, and I urge all my colleagues to support \nhis confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6320-4", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6320-S6321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DIVIDED GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to make some very brief remarks \nabout divided government.\n  Since 1981, there have been more than 25 years in which one party \ncontrolled the White House while the other party controlled at least \none Chamber of the Congress. By comparison, there have been fewer than \n9 years in which one party controlled both the Presidency and all of \nCongress. So as we can see, divided government has been the norm and \nunified government--single-party government--the exception.\n  The truth is I suspect the American people like divided government \nbecause they realize it is another layer of checks and balances on what \nhappens up here in Washington, DC, which are very important to making \nsure we get things done right and give it the kind of deliberation and \nthoughtful consideration they deserve, particularly if we are talking \nabout legislating for a country of about 320 million people or so.\n  It also forces us to do something that maybe isn't our first \ninstinct; that is, rather than to insist on our way, it forces us to \nbuild consensus, which is actually a good thing when we are talking \nabout the American people.\n  So what has it given us in the recent past? It has given us a \nRepublican President and a Democratic House that worked together on \nSocial Security reform in 1983 and tax reform in 1986. Several years \nago it was another Republican President and a fully Democratic Congress \nthat worked together on landmark disability and environmental laws. In \nthe mid-1990s, it was a Democratic President and a Republican Congress \nthat worked together on welfare reform and balanced the budget.\n  This is what can happen when we have divided government and the \nwillingness of the President and the Congress to work together to try \nto solve problems. We can actually do hard things--things that we could \nnever do with a purely one-party government or the other.\n  Then in 2001 a Republican President and Democratic Senate worked \ntogether on education reform--No Child Left Behind. I still remember \nwhen former Governor Bush--then-President Bush as the 43rd President--\nworked together with Teddy Kennedy, the liberal lion of the Senate, on \nNo Child Left Behind. It raised more than a few eyebrows back home in \nTexas, but that demonstrated what can happen when one side of the aisle \nand the other side of the aisle try to work together in the best \ninterests of the American people.\n  Here is the short of it: Divided government does not translate into \ngridlock. It doesn't have to. It can, but it doesn't have to. We \nactually have another choice. Each of the four Presidents who came \ndirectly before President Obama found it possible to sign major \nbipartisan legislation despite having serious philosophical differences \nwith Members of the opposing party.\n  I remember a conversation I had recently with one of my colleagues \nwho was just reelected to the Senate and he is, let's say, from the \nother end of the political spectrum from me. He made the obvious point: \nI am not going to change who I am, I am not going to change what I \nbelieve in, but I am going to look for ways to legislate in the Senate.\n  I thought he stated it very well: I am not going to change who I am \nas a conservative. I am not going to do something which I would view to \nbe unprincipled in order to get an outcome. But I do think that leaves \nan awful lot of room for us to work together to try to legislate in the \ncenter.\n  My impression is--from the Presiding Officer and others I have talked \nto and chatted with and seeing their reported comments--there is a big \nappetite on both sides of the aisle to make this place work again. I \nthink if there is a single message that I heard from November 4, in \nthis last election, it is\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nthat people do not want their government to not function. They may want \nit to function more or less or in some areas and not the others, but \nthey don't want it to be dysfunctional. Indeed, that makes common \nsense.\n  What remains an open question is what path the President is going to \nchoose--whether he is actually going to work with the Republican \nmajorities in the House and the Senate. I was somewhat encouraged the \nPresident had a meeting yesterday with the incoming majority leader \nSenator McConnell. It was reported to me they talked about things they \nthought they could work on together. But we have sort of been led down \nthis pathway before with happy talk, and then the actions did not \nfollow the rhetoric.\n  Unfortunately, I think the President started off on a bad foot after \nthis election on November 4 by issuing this Executive action order. I \nrealize it is very controversial and we can be frustrated at times with \nthe slow pace of actually getting things done around here. But I have \nexpressed myself previously, and I will say it again: I think the \nPresident made a serious mistake in doing it the way he did.\n  No. 1, I don't think he has the authority to do it, something he \nhimself said he didn't have 22 times in published comments, but it \npoisons the well at a time when I think there was a lot of hope that \nmaybe we could turn this place around.\n\n  It is not just my view; it is the view of a number of my Democratic \ncolleagues too. For example, after the President's Executive action on \nimmigration, the senior Senator from Louisiana said:\n\n       We are all frustrated with our broken immigration system, \n     but the way forward is not unilateral action by the \n     President.\n\n  I agree with that comment.\n  Her sentiments were also echoed by the junior Senator from Indiana, \nwho believes President Obama should not be making what he called \n``significant policy changes'' on his own.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri said similarly, ``How this is coming \nabout makes me uncomfortable, and I think it probably makes most \nMissourians uncomfortable.''\n  The reason they feel uncomfortable is that the President's Executive \norder represents a direct affront to the constitutional separation of \npowers. Even if you agree on the substance of what he did, which itself \nis controversial, how he did it was a direct affront to our \nConstitution and the separation of powers, and it is unsustainable. It \nprovokes a response from Congress when it feels left out, and, in fact, \nthe President is going to need Congress to work with him to fix our \nbroken immigration system because Congress remains the possessor of the \npower of the purse.\n  The Senator from Maine put it this way. He said:\n\n       The Framers knew what they were doing, and it doesn't say \n     if the president gets frustrated and Congress doesn't act, he \n     gets to do what he thinks is important for the country [on \n     his own].\n\n  So this is not a partisan issue in the sense that Republicans and \nDemocrats see the world through entirely different lenses. Plenty of \nDemocrats understand that the President's action has made it \nsignificantly harder for us to get off on the right foot in the new \nyear on a number of issues we already agree on by and large.\n  The junior Senator from North Dakota said the immigration order \n``could poison any hope of compromise or bipartisanship in the new \nSenate before it's even started.'' I agree with the sentiment. I hope \nshe is wrong, and I hope we can prove that wrong by saying we are not \ngoing to give up and we are not going to let what the President does \ndetermine what we do. We have to do our job and we have to function, \nand then we are going to have to work with the President hopefully to \ntry to move the country forward in a number of these areas.\n  I hope we can find a way to stop the President from acting on his own \nand to recommit ourselves to the rule of law and particularly the \nConstitution and get about the job of addressing our country's biggest \nchallenges, such as those outlined in the comments from the senior \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, who gave a very noteworthy speech \nat the National Press Club recently. He mentioned issues we should be \nfocused on, such as the needs of the middle class, stagnant wages, mass \nunderemployment, and widespread pessimism about the future of the \nAmerican dream. The last thing we need is a protracted constitutional \ncrisis, and that is really an unfortunate distraction from what we \nought to be doing together.\n  If we recognize these challenges and the message that was sent on \nNovember 4, we ought to be working together to address them. Because of \nthis crisis, it will be more difficult, but we cannot give up. We need \nto work together to overhaul our job-training programs and give \nAmerican workers relief from the burden of government that does not \nwork in their best interests. It will be more difficult for us to pass \nprogrowth tax and regulatory reforms, and it will be more difficult for \nus to do what we need to do to shore up and sustain Social Security and \nMedicare before they go bankrupt. We have reached this point because of \nyet another manufactured crisis--a crisis that was completely and \ntotally unnecessary.\n  I can only hope the President will decide to reverse his desire to do \neverything unilaterally and to work on a more sensible course--one \nwhere he appreciates the possibilities of divided government. Based on \nthe examples I gave earlier, there certainly is reason for hope that \ndivided government can work and address some of our urgent needs. \nUnfortunately, given his record, it is hard to be optimistic, but I am \nan optimist by nature, and hope springs eternal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

Madam President, I come to the floor this morning with my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte, to talk about what \nwe can do together to invest in America's 21st-century manufacturing \nworkforce. As the Presiding Officer well knows, manufacturing is one of \nthe great areas of opportunity for meaningful bipartisan cooperation \nthat will move our country, our economy, and our working families \nforward.\n  Although so many issues here these days seem to fall on partisan \nlines, Senator Ayotte and I are here today because we have come \ntogether on a bipartisan bill called the Manufacturing Skills Act. The \nbill has one simple goal, which we share: to spur reforms in \nmanufacturing skills training across our country. That is it. Our bill \nwould create a competitive grant program to help local and State \ngovernments design and implement manufacturing job-training reforms \nthat fit their own unique local economic needs. Once proposals come in, \na Federal interagency partnership would award the five strongest State \nproposals and the five strongest local government proposals with \nfunding for 3 years to implement their targeted reforms to improve \ntheir manufacturing skills training. The funding doesn't all come from \nthe Federal Government, either. Something Senator Ayotte and I share \nenthusiasm for is getting leverage for Federal investment. The local \nand State government must match Federal support one-to-one.\n  We are focusing on manufacturing specifically because it plays such a \nvital role in building communities and strengthening our middle class. \nLast year, in fact, manufacturing contributed more than $2 trillion to \nour Nation's economy. In many ways manufacturing has long been the \nfoundation of our economy. As we know, manufacturing jobs are high-\nquality jobs. They pay more in wages and benefits. Manufacturing is \nhighly innovative. It is the area that invests the most in R of any \nprivate sector component. Over the last 3 years manufacturing has \nstarted coming back steadily and rapidly, with more than 700,000 new \nmanufacturing jobs created in our country.\n  This is all good news, and I am convinced the United States is poised \nto really compete in the manufacturing economy of this century. But we \nstill face key challenges in the job market for manufacturing. There \nare manufacturers whom I have visited with up and down my State and \nwhom we have\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nheard from across the country who are ready to hire but cannot fill \nopen positions. The problem is only expected to get worse. By 2020, by \nsome estimates, there may be more than 875,000 unfilled manufacturing \njobs. Yet there remains no focused, targeted Federal workforce \ndevelopment program specifically designed to strengthen manufacturing \nskills. I think part of the reason is we often have an outdated view of \nmanufacturing. It conjures up outdated images of dirty factories and \nunsafe working conditions and lower skilled labor. That is not the \nmanufacturing workplace of today at all.\n  I would be curious to hear the thoughts of my colleague from New \nHampshire on how manufacturing has changed and how we can work together \nto strengthen the skills of manufacturing workers in Delaware, New \nHampshire, and across our country.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from Delaware. It has really been an \nhonor to work with him on the Manufacturing Skills Act, and we share \nthe goal to ensure that manufacturing remains vibrant and a vibrant \nsource of jobs in our economy.\n  Training our workforce to have the right skills to address today's \n21st-century manufacturing is quite different from yesteryear. Today as \nwe look at manufacturing, we see the skills our workers need: critical \nthinking and problem-solving abilities, math and writing skills and the \nability to communicate, an understanding of the manufacturing process, \nand an ability to engage workers in improving that process. This wasn't \nnecessarily the case 20 or 30 years ago, but the United States is \npoised and has an opportunity to be the leader in advanced \nmanufacturing.\n  We have a talented workforce, but our workers need the type of \ntraining that is going to address this new type of manufacturing that \nis focused on having the right skills and technology, use of technology \nand problem-solving skills that we know workers in New Hampshire and \nDelaware are quite capable of if we give them the tools they need.\n  A reality of today's world is that although our economy is bigger, we \nare more interconnected than ever before. Job training needs to be \ncustomized to the particular business area--the city, the State, the \nlocal economy. There is no ``one size fits all'' model. This is \nespecially true in manufacturing--and I visited many manufacturers in \nour State--where different companies and places need workers with \nvarying skills.\n  That is one of the reasons I am so enthusiastic about the \nManufacturing Skills Act that Senator Coons and I have introduced \ntogether. Rather than prescribe job-training standards or dictate \nreforms from Washington, our bill allows local officials, business \nleaders, and workers to come together in local communities to build \ntraining plans that fit their needs and help grow jobs in the community \nbecause Wilmington and Newark, DE, have very different workforce \nchallenges, perhaps, than some areas of New Hampshire, whether it is \nNashua or Concord or Berlin. We need to ensure that local officials, \nlocal employers, and the people of our States are using the grants we \nare able to provide under this legislation to design new training \nprograms for those localities to really allow those workers to be \ntrained for 21st-century manufacturing skills.\n  By both targeting manufacturing and giving localities the discretion \nto design the reforms that fit their needs, we have come together on a \nbill that could help our country meet some of its most critical \neconomic challenges and opportunities.\n  I know Senator Coons has a strong background in manufacturing and has \nworked very closely with employers and workers in Delaware to hear from \nthem about what job-training needs they have to ensure Delaware can \nhave that 21st-century workforce. I would love to hear more about some \nof the challenges he has heard about from employers and workers in \nDelaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague from \nNew Hampshire. We are both from small States that are not nationally \nthought of as being leaders in manufacturing, but both New Hampshire \nand Delaware have deep, rich, broad manufacturing histories. \nManufacturing is commonly thought of by America as being associated \nwith Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan or Indiana, but there are dozens of \ncompanies I have visited in Delaware that are small or medium-sized, \nwith 50 or 100 or 150 employees. Many companies are family owned, many \nworking in particular niches of processing or manufacturing. They are \nprofitable, growing, and looking to hire. Having visited New Hampshire \nas well, it also has a proud and strong history of manufacturing. Given \nthe regional experience and the base of knowledge and expertise of \nMembers of this body, it is my hope that we can come together with \nother bipartisan cosponsors to strengthen and build this bill going \nforward.\n  Before I got into public service, I spent 8 years working for a \nmanufacturing company in Delaware, a materials-based science company \nthat manufactures over 1,000 different products, all off the same \nchemical platform. One of the things I did in my work area was I \nvisited the dozens of manufacturing facilities that either the company \nfor which I worked directly operated or many of our partner companies \nthat were licensees or distributors or part of our supply chain.\n  The plant of today, the shop floor of today bears very little \nresemblance to that of previous generations. They are the location of \nrich innovation, an amazing amount of collaboration and teamwork where \nworld-class, cutting-edge quality control and continuous innovation are \nexpected, needed from our workforce, and thus investment in wages and \nin skills is also a critical part of our continuing to be globally \ncompetitive, as Senator Ayotte has explained.\n  As the skills needed for workers vary depending on the product and \nmarket segment in the region, we also need training programs that are \nflexible and meet the exact needs of the region. I will give two \nexamples. I have visited SPI Pharma in Lewes, DE, which manufactures \nthe key component of Maalox and many other antacids, and BASF in \nNewport, which manufactures pigments. I hear similar challenges even \nthough they are in different areas of manufacturing. Their specific \nneeds are for process operators who are skilled at working at a factory \nwhere large amounts of complex suspensions--liquids--are being mixed, \nmoved around, and fashioned into finished products. They need workers \nwho understand programmable logic control systems and can ensure that \ncontinuous improvement in quality control is in place. They know that \nin order to continue to grow, to export and be globally competitive, \nthey need to stay at the top of their game, which means investing in \nworkers and their skills. They are struggling to find young people to \nreplace those who are aging out of their workforces.\n  Our community college, Delaware Technical Community College, a \nnational leader, is helping and is actively engaged. But as the \nequipment and processes of today's manufacturing plants become more \nadvanced and computerized, they will need help in keeping up with \nchanging technologies so the skills they train for today are the actual \nskills that companies, such as SPI Pharma and BASF in Delaware, need in \nthis century.\n  The Manufacturing Skills Act could be a real help in Delaware to many \nof the manufacturers I visited, and it will allow local and State \nofficials partnering with our schools, our Chamber leadership, and our \nmanufacturers to build a system that fits our real needs at the local \nlevel.\n  I think it is exciting--whether someone is from New Hampshire, \nWisconsin, Delaware or Indiana--to know we are willing to come together \nin a strong and bipartisan way to lay a pathway forward for America's \nmanufacturing workforce. It gives me some reason for optimism as we \nbegin to conclude this session of Congress and as we look forward.\n  I wish to close by specifically thanking Senator Ayotte for being \nsuch a positive, forward-looking partner, not only on this bill but on \nmany other issues we have worked on together in the years we have \nserved so far in this body.\n  I would love to hear more from my colleague from New Hampshire about \nthe manufacturing challenges New Hampshire faces and how this bill \nmight address them and what our path forward is for this piece of \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  As I look at the new Congress coming in, I view our bill--the \nManufacturing Skills Act--as an opportunity where we can all work \ntogether to help workers and employers across the country meet the \nchallenges of ensuring that manufacturing continues to thrive and grow \nin this country. These are good-paying jobs where the workers--who are \nexcellent and want the opportunity but just need the skills--need the \ntype of technology training and understanding of process, such as the \nlean process, and how we can improve our manufacturing.\n  The bill Senator Coons and I worked on together will allow the local \ndecisionmakers to put together the best training that will help create \ngood-paying jobs, not only in Delaware, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin \nbut across this country.\n  I hope we can take up this bill very early on in the next session and \nget behind it.\n  In New Hampshire, there are 66,000 jobs that are directly connected \nand related to manufacturing. As I have traveled to visit manufacturing \nemployers throughout our State, I have been hearing about the same \nissues that my colleague from Delaware has heard; that is, that they \nare challenged in actually finding the right workforce for excellent-\npaying jobs and opportunities, but they need partnerships and help to \nget that trained workforce in place.\n  New Hampshire, similar to Delaware, has had some strong partnerships \namong the private sector and community colleges in my State, and we \nneed to do more of that in the future. I believe our bill will allow \nthose local education institutions to partner with private employers \nand State and local officials so the training is valuable and will \nensure that everyone has a stake in the right workforce going forward.\n  I wish to thank some of the businesses I have had the privilege of \nvisiting in our State. So many businesses have told me--whether it is \nBurndy in Littleton or Velcro in Manchester or Codet in Colebrook or \nHypertherm in the Upper Valley--that our private sector is focusing on \nthis issue, and our Manufacturing Skills Act can help companies move \nforward and ensure that our workers have the right skills so we can \ngrow jobs in this country.\n  I thank Senator Coons for his leadership on this issue and the work \nhe has done every single day in this body to ensure that the people of \nDelaware have good-paying jobs and the right workforce training. This \nis a goal I share with the Senator from Delaware.\n  I wish to also thank him for his leadership on other issues, \nincluding the protection of this Nation and many other issues he has \nbecome an expert on in this body.\n  I hope we can all get behind bipartisan solutions, such as that \noffered by my colleague from Delaware, and I hope many of our \ncolleagues will think about joining us on this Manufacturing Skills \nAct. As we go into the new Congress, I hope this will be a priority for \nour leadership so we can bring this bill to the floor for a vote right \naway.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my colleague from Delaware \nfor his leadership and work on this important issue. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work on this until we get it passed.\n  Mr. COONS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TESTER. Are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6323-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6323-S6325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             POSTAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. TESTER. I wish to address the challenges we have at the Postal \nService today.\n  There is an old saying that when you are in a hole, stop digging. \nDon't make things worse. Don't shoot yourself in the foot. It is \nactually quite simple advice that all of us need to follow.\n  Here in Congress we could apply it to a lot of different issues. Our \nbudget and the immigration system come to mind. But that hole grows \nfaster when two parties are digging. When you have two shovels, the \nwalls become higher, the climb out becomes more difficult, and that is \nwhat is happening right now with the Postal Service.\n  On one side we have the Postmaster General and Postal Service \nleadership actively cutting services and mail delivery standards. They \nthink they can cut their way to fiscal solvency, and quite frankly in \nthis case they are wrong. The answer is not more cuts. In fact, if it \nwasn't for the prefunding requirement for retiree health benefits, the \nPostal Service would have made nearly $1 billion in 2012.\n  Clearly, the Postal Service doesn't need to keep shutting down \nfacilities and slowing down delivery. What the Postal Service does need \nis responsible reform legislation, and that is why I am here this \nafternoon.\n  All the Postal Service is doing with its shortsighted cuts is \nweakening trust in the Postal Service. Essentially, Postal Service \nleadership is cutting the legs out from underneath themselves. They are \ndigging the hole deeper.\n  But Congress is in the hole with the Postmaster General. There are a \nlot of folks in Congress who would love to see the Postal Service go \nout of business, but the Postal Service, whether in urban America or \nrural America, delivers the goods America needs. It delivers medicine, \nnewspapers, equipment, letters, and even election ballots. It is a \ncritical part of our daily lives. But the Postal Service is preparing \nto end overnight delivery in all but a few American cities and close 82 \nmail processing facilities starting in January. These facilities route \nmail from New York to California, from Seattle to Sarasota, from a \ngrandmother to her grandson.\n  When these facilities close or consolidate, it costs thousands of \njobs, and more importantly it means mail goes to the remaining \nfacilities and it means packages have to travel longer to get to where \nthey are going. When that happens, more folks will not get the mail \nwhen they need it. It means more delayed credit card payments. It means \nmore needed medicine sitting in a truck for another day. Come next \nelection it might even mean lost ballots.\n  The Postal Service has already stopped overnight delivery in large \nparts of rural America. Even 2-day delivery is now hard to come by. If \nthe Postal Service implements its new plan in January, that will be the \ncase almost nationwide.\n  Congress has the power to stop these closures, and it would make \nsense to keep these facilities open while we work to reform the Postal \nService in a way that treats its employees and its customers and the \ngeneral public fairly. But in the Senate, and in the House, too many \nfolks have their shovels out. So far the proposals coming out of this \nCongress fall far short of what is needed to put the Postal Service on \nsound financial footing.\n  We are here today to urge the House of Representatives and this body, \nthe Senate, to include a provision in the government funding bill that \nwill keep the processing facilities open. There is no point in closing \nmail processing facilities while Congress works on a comprehensive \npostal reform bill. I know we have trouble passing responsible \nlegislation around here, I get that, but there is painstaking--and I do \nmean painstaking--work going on around here to pass a Postal Service \nreform bill.\n  The bill that passed the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nearlier this year needs work--serious work. It does not preserve strong \nrural mail standards. It is opposed by folks in rural America, by \npostal unions, and by mailers. Under the bill--except in the big \ncities--we can kiss 1-day delivery goodbye. With the cuts it proposes, \nthe bill fundamentally prevents the Postal Service from performing its \nconstitutional duty of keeping this Nation stitched together.\n  But along with other members of the committee, and some like-minded \nfolks in the House, we are trying to find a way forward. We are trying \nto reform the Postal Service without putting the burden on rural \nAmerica. A proposal I am working on will give the Postal Service the \nflexibility to raise new revenue while reducing the costly mandate to \nprefund retirement benefits. That requirement is swamping the agency's \nbooks.\n  Other Members of Congress are pushing to allow the Postal Service to \ncontinue its crusade against rural America. My effort, on the other \nhand, is a balanced solution that preserves strong rural mail standards \nwhile putting the Postal Service on the path to fiscal solvency.\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\n  We have been here long enough to know that there is no magic bullet. \nCongress is full of too many interests and too many constituencies, but \nthe least we can do is to stop making things worse. There is no reason \nto keep digging the hole. We have evidence behind our case.\n  The GAO, in its analysis of past closures of the processing \nfacilities, said the Postal Service is already unable to meet its \nreduced service standards--already unable to meet the standards that \nhave already been reduced.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--looking at potential savings from \nfacility closures--didn't take into account the loss of mail volume \nresulting from reducing the quality of service.\n  There are simply way, way, way too many unanswered questions about \nhow these closures would affect mail service, and that is why a \nbipartisan majority of Senators, including myself, have called to stave \noff the closures of these processing facilities. Over 160 House Members \nhave done the same.\n  A moratorium on mail processing facilities is the way to go. It will \nstop the bleeding and stop the digging that Congress and the Postal \nService are doing right now. It will send a signal that the American \npeople's representatives will not sit by as opponents work to privatize \nthe Postal Service.\n  This is the busiest season of the year for the Postal Service. Folks \nsend presents and cards through the mail. We hear from old friends and \nfamilies whom we have not heard from in a long time. It is a busy and \nimportant time but no more critical than any other time of the Postal \nService's year. Mail processing facilities don't just get used for \nmailing Christmas cards and presents, nor do the post offices. Reduced \npost office hours will affect Americans' lives as well.\n  Westby, MT, is in the far northeastern corner of Montana. It is along \nthe border with North Dakota. It is a beautiful little town. The Westby \nPost Office is where Ken Keldsen, a veteran in his ninth decade, goes \nto pick up his prescription medicine. The mail takes a little longer to \nget to Westby these days because the processing plant was closed last \nyear, and the post office is open for a few less hours each day.\n  Ken wrote my office and told me the reduced hours make it harder for \nhim--this veteran in northeastern Montana in his nineties--to get his \nmedication.\n  Here is what it comes down to: We need a reform bill that keeps the \nPostal Service financially viable while maintaining strong mail service \nstandards for people such as Ken. It is not an easy proposition. We \nhave been working on it for quite a while now. But the calls and need \nfor reform are stronger than ever. There is no reason to keep digging. \nThere is still time for Congress to stop the mail processing facility \nclosures scheduled to start in January. That will give us more time to \npass good legislation that sets the Postal Service straight.\n  I urge my colleagues in this body to do just that because this \ncountry needs a viable Postal Service, one that the American people can \ntrust.\n  It is more than just holiday cards and packages. It is about making \nsure payments arrive on time. It is about making sure lease agreements \nget to the proper people, but it is not just about these things. It is \nalso about having faith as a nation that we as a body--as a Senate, as \na House, as a Congress--can make responsible decisions to preserve what \nis important in this country.\n  There has been a lot of talk about working together and getting \nthings done since the election. I wish it could have happened before \nthe election, but we are where we are. We have a great opportunity to \nwork together to keep the Postal Service solvent and keep those \nstandards high for not only urban America but for rural America also. \nWe need to do that today. This is an important effort.\n\n  With that, I would love to hear from the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nSanders.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me begin by thanking Senator Tester \nnot only for being on the floor today but for working on the issue of \nmaking sure that in 50 States in this country--in rural America and in \nurban America--we continue to have a Postal Service of which the \nAmerican people are proud. I wish to acknowledge Senator Baldwin, who \nis presiding, for her strong work on this issue, as well.\n  I represent one of the most rural States in America. I don't know if \nit is more rural than Montana, but it is very rural. Most of our people \nlive in very small towns. The local post office is not just the place \nto pick up mail or to mail letters. It is a symbol of what the town is \nabout. It is an institution that identifies the town. It is where \npeople come together. It is a very important part of rural America.\n  We have been battling on this issue now for a number of years. As \nSenator Tester will remember, it wasn't so many years ago when the \nPostmaster General came up with a proposal that would have led to the \nshutting down of 15,000 mostly rural post offices all over America. To \nmy mind, that was a disastrous proposal. Many of us stood up and fought \nback and worked something out. While the compromise was not all that I \nwanted, at least it prevented the shutdown of 15,000 post offices all \nover this country.\n  Right now--and I think Senator Tester made this point--the Postal \nService has announced that beginning next month, it will be shutting \ndown up to 82 mail processing plants. Those are the plants that move \nthe mail along into areas all over the country. They also want to \nabolish overnight delivery standards and first-class mail. In the \nprocess, at a time when we need to create decent-paying jobs, this \nproposal would eliminate up to 15,000 good-paying, middle-class jobs at \nthe Postal Service.\n  The reason Senator Tester and I and hopefully others have come to the \nfloor today is to send a very loud and clear message to the Postmaster \nGeneral, to our colleagues here in the Senate, to our colleagues in the \nHouse, and to the President of the United States. The message is that \nat a time when the middle class is disappearing and the number of \nAmericans living in poverty is almost at an alltime high, do not \ndestroy decent-paying jobs at the Postal Service. At a time when the \nPostal Service is competing with the instantaneous communication of \nemails and of high speed Internet, do not slow down mail delivery \nservice, but speed it up. Do not dismantle the Postal Service by \nshutting down up to a quarter of the mail processing plants that are \nleft in this country.\n  On August 14, I was delighted to work with Senator Tester and others \non a letter to the Appropriations Committee, urging them to include \nlanguage in the omnibus appropriations bill or the continuing \nresolution to prevent the Postal Service from making these devastating \ncuts and protecting these 15,000 jobs and these 82 processing plants. I \nam happy to say that a majority of the Members of the Senate--51 of \nthem, including Majority Leader Reid, Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, \nand six Republicans--Senator Hatch, Senator Inhofe, Senator Hoeven, \nSenator Blunt, Senator Thune, and Senator Collins--all signed on to \nthis letter. They understand--many of them coming from rural areas--\nthat this is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue; this is an \nissue to protect mail delivery all over this country and especially \nin rural areas.\n\n  Shortly after we sent our letter, 160 Members of the House signed on \nto a similar letter calling for a 1-year moratorium to stop these mail \nprocessing plants from closing, and 23 Republicans signed that letter \nas well. So we are seeing bipartisan support in the House and in the \nSenate saying loudly and clearly: Do not shut down 82 processing \nplants; do not slow down mail delivery service; do not eliminate 15,000 \ndecent-paying jobs.\n  I know Senator Mikulski, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, \nwants to see this happen, but to make it happen, she needs Republican \nsupport. I very much urge my Republican colleagues to stand up for \nrural America, stand up for 15,000 jobs. Let's protect these 82 \nprocessing plants.\n  As Senator Tester has made clear, the beauty of the Postal Service is \nthat it provides universal service 6 days a week to every corner of \nAmerica--no matter how small or how remote. It supports millions of \njobs in virtually every other sector of our economy. It provides \ndecent-paying union jobs to some 500,000 Americans, and, in fact--and I \nsay this as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs--\nit is the largest single employer of veterans. Whether one is a low-\nincome elderly woman living at the end\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nof a dirt road in Pennsylvania or Vermont or a wealthy CEO on Wall \nStreet, people get their mail 6 days a week.\n  The American people, by the way, pay for this service at a cost far, \nfar less than anywhere else in the industrialized world. But if \nCongress doesn't stop the Postmaster General from making these \ndevastating cuts, it will drive more Americans away from the Postal \nService and will lead to what we call a death spiral. The quality of \nservice deteriorates, fewer people use the Postal Service, less revenue \ncomes in, and the process continues to deteriorate.\n  Despite what some in this country have been hearing in the media, and \ndespite what some in the Postal Service have been saying, the Postal \nService is not going broke. We hear that every three months--people \ntelling us the Postal Service is going broke. That is not true. The \nmajor reason the Postal Service is in bad financial shape today is \nbecause of a mandate signed into law by President George W. Bush in \nDecember 2006, during a lameduck session of Congress, that forces the \nPostal Service to prefund 75 years of future retiree health benefits \nover a 10-year period. This burden is unprecedented in any other \ngovernment agency or any private sector company in the United States of \nAmerica. It is a burden that every single year costs the Postal Service \n$5.5 billion, and that one provision--that one provision--is \nresponsible for all of the financial losses posted by the Postal \nService since October 2012--just that one provision.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Postal Service has made an operating \nprofit of nearly $1 billion. Let me repeat that. Over the past 2 years, \nthe Postal Service has made an operating profit of nearly $1 billion, \nexcluding this prefunding mandate that must be gotten rid of. Further, \nbefore this prefunding mandate was signed into law, the Postal Service \nwas also profitable. In fact, from 2003 to 2006, the Postal Service \nmade a combined profit of more than $9 billion. So when we hear that \nthe Postal Service is in financial difficulty, the key reason--the \noverwhelming reason--is this onerous, unprecedented burden of coming up \nwith $5.5 billion every year to pay for future health retirees.\n  Given the improved financial condition of the Postal Service, it \nmakes no sense to me to close down mail plants, destroy jobs, and slow \nmail delivery. Our job right now is to make the Postal Service an \nagency that functions efficiently in the 21st century. We have to give \nthem the tools to effectively compete. But the way we do that is not by \ncutting, cutting, and cutting. That is a path toward disaster.\n  So I hope the Members of the Senate and the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives will stand together and prevent these 82 processing \nplants from shutting down and come up with some legislation which \nexpands the capability of the Postal Service to compete and protects \nthe American people who want high quality Postal Service.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the Senator from Wisconsin, Ms. \nBaldwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the senior Senator \nfrom Montana and the Senator from Vermont on this important topic.\n  The issue of postal processing facility closures greatly impacts my \nState of Wisconsin, and it greatly impact States across the country, I \nmust say.\n  Since 2012 the Postal Service has closed or consolidated 141 \nprocessing facilities throughout the United States. In June the \nPostmaster General announced plans to consolidate up to 82 mail \nprocessing facilities, and eliminate 15,000 jobs in 2015. Four of these \nfacilities are in the State of Wisconsin: Eau Claire, La Crosse, \nMadison, and Rothschild in the Wausau region of the State of Wisconsin.\n  When postal processing facilities close, that impacts service \nstandards, which really boils down to the time it takes for a piece of \nmail to get from point A to point B. At this moment, I can't tell my \nconstituents, my Wisconsinites, how long these delays will be because \nthe Postal Service has yet to study this impact. These closures are set \nto begin within a month. So for small businesses who rely on the Postal \nService to get their goods to market and for seniors such as the \nveteran who was described earlier by the senior Senator from Montana \nwho gets his medicine through the mail, there is really no way for them \nto know at this moment how these closures are going to affect them, and \nsometimes what is in the mail is a lifeline for them.\n  In fact, the inspector general found the Postal Service failed to \nfollow its own rules, which require the Postal Service to study the \nimpacts these consolidations will have on their service standards--\nagain, the time it takes for a piece of mail to get from point A to \npoint B. They are also supposed to inform the public of these impacts \nand, additionally, to allow affected communities to provide input \nbefore a final decision is made. However, this simply didn't happen. \nThat is why I was proud to join Senator McCaskill in a bipartisan \nletter to the Postmaster General requesting that the Postal Service \ndelay these proposed closures and consolidations until they have a \nfair, complete, and transparent process in place.\n  The Postal Service exists to serve all Americans, and my constituents \nand the consumers who fund the Postal Service deserve to have their \nvoices heard in this process. They are stakeholders in this process. \nWhile there are certainly process and transparency problems with these \nclosures, another issue that concerns me is the fact that these \nshortsighted cuts are harming the very thing that makes the Postal \nService unique. The major strength of the U.S. Postal Service is its \nsignificant network which can reach every community in America. Whether \none is in an urban city such as Milwaukee, WI, or in a rural town such \nas Prentice, the Postal Service reaches these Wisconsin \ncommunities. But by continually chipping away at the substantial \nservice network, the Postal Service is developing into an urban package \ndelivery system at the expense of rural Americans and rural \nWisconsinites.\n\n  Proponents of this idea of closures and consolidations say it is \ncounterproductive to delay these closures because they should happen as \nsoon as possible. They say Congress has failed to act and that the \nPostal Service has been left with no alternative but to close more \nprocessing facilities.\n  I agree on one point; that is, that Congress has, indeed, failed to \nact. We must. Congress has failed to act. I do not know how many have \nsort of heard this in relation to bills to try to fix problems. Have \nyou ever seen someone present an idea and they say, look, everybody who \nis a stakeholder hates this so it must be a good bill?\n  Well, I kind of disagree with that proposition, that it has to be \nthat way. I can tell you there is another way forward. That path \ninvolves working with, not against, Postal Service employees and \ncustomers. It relieves the Postal Service of congressionally mandated \noverpayments. It maintains service standards for all communities. It \nprovides Postal Service customers with certainty on postal rates.\n  I am going to continue to fight on this issue. I am delighted and \nproud to be joining my colleagues here today on the floor to raise this \nimmediate issue of postal process facility closures, this pending \nissue, but also to renew our commitment to the longer range, broader \npostal reform that gives our constituents, whether rural, suburban, or \nurban, the confidence and service they deserve.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6325-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6325-S6326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ``ORION'' SPACECRAFT\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to share with the Senate the fact \nthat we are about to do the first flight test of the new NASA human \nspacecraft, called Orion.\n  As a matter of fact, it was attempted earlier this morning. There was \na launch window between 7:05 and 9:44 eastern time. In fact, a \ncombination of some weather concerns plus some questions of valves \nopening on some of the fuel lines in the rocket and trying to rework \nthose valves ultimately led to the decision to scrub the mission today.\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\n  The spacecraft looks like a capsule. If we recall the Apollo capsule \nthat took us to the Moon, it carried three astronauts. It was 12 feet \nin diameter. Orion is 16.5 feet in diameter and is being designed to \ncarry four astronauts. But it is the forerunner to the space systems \nthat will eventually--in 20 years--carry us to the planet Mars.\n  It will be launched today on an existing workhorse. We have two major \nworkhorses in our stable. The Delta--the Delta IV and this, configured \nwith additional boosters, is called the Delta IV Heavy.\n  The other workhorse in the stable getting so many of our payloads \ninto space, including our military satellites, is the Atlas V. Both of \nthem are proven workhorses and have been almost flawless. This \nparticular spacecraft, for its first flight test, is going up on a \nDelta IV Heavy.\n  As such, what it will do is first to put it into low Earth orbit, and \nfrom there it will be projected out 3,600 miles from the Earth and come \nback as if it were on a mission to the Moon or to an asteroid or coming \nback from Mars in a trajectory, coming through the Earth's atmosphere, \ncreating quite a few g's and creating--at about 20,000 miles an hour as \nit is coming back into the Earth's atmosphere--about 4,000 degrees \nFarenheit on the heat shield.\n  So the flight test today is to test the structural integrity of the \nspacecraft as well as to test the viability of the heat shield. That \nhas now been postponed until tomorrow. It was my expectation Senator \nThune would be able to go. As it turns out, he has to go back to South \nDakota. I will be there at the Cape, and we will report on the launch \nlater on to the Senate next week.\n  But it will all be done in 1 day, and it will splash down in the \nPacific, somewhere in the region of the State of the Presiding Officer. \nThey are actually going to have television coverage of the splashdown \nbecause we have a Predator that will be over the Atlantic. That is why \nwe have to have the weather there, as well as the weather at the Cape, \nto be exactly right so we can record the splashdown, because this is a \nflight test.\n  We are developing a new spacecraft to take humans to missions far \nbeyond low Earth orbit. A lot of people think the human space program \nwas shut down after the space shuttle. No, we are just going into the \nnew design of new spacecraft that can take us on a mission out of \nEarth's orbit as we explore the Earth's heavens. I will give a report \nto the Senate next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6326-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6326-S6327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LAND CONSERVATION\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, this is a picture of Wike Brothers' Farm \nin Sharon, CT. Sharon is located in the very northwest portion in the \ngreat State of Connecticut. It has been an active farm held by the same \nfamily, the Wike brothers, for about 150 years. It is about 144 acres. \nIt is a pasture now for free-range chickens, pigs, and cattle.\n  The farm's roadside store, which is used by people from Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, and New York--given that it sits right at the crux of \nthose three States--sells beef, pork, sausages, eggs, apple-smoked \nbacon, and maple syrup, to name a few.\n  We are able to know, confidently, that this piece of iconic farm land \nthat is producing for the neighboring farms and States is going to be \nable to continue as a farm because of something that Congress did.\n  Congress passed, enacted in 2006, a land conservation incentive in \nour Tax Code that gives a small tax incentive to farmers who decide to \nput a conservation easement on their land to make sure it doesn't fall \ninto the hands of developers. Further, we provide a slightly smaller \ndiscount, a slightly smaller tax incentive to private nonfarm, \nnonagricultural landowners who want either to donate their lands or who \nwant also to put a conservation easement on their land to make sure \nthat it doesn't get developed.\n  This has been of enormous benefit in the State of Connecticut. We \nhave preserved 11,000 acres of land in Connecticut just since this tax \nincentive went on the books. That is a 45-percent increase over the \nprevious period of time before we put that tax incentive on the books.\n  It is a wonderful bipartisan policy because we are able, by \ndiscounting people's taxes, to keep land as open space without it, \nfrankly, going into the hands of public land owners, which is often met \nwith resistance from a lot of Members from our Western States.\n  Land stays in the hands of the private landowner or, in this case, in \nthe hands of the Wike brothers, who have been farming it for a century \nand a half. But we know, because of that conservation easement, it will \nbe maintained as open space.\n  As bipartisan as that idea is, the entire genesis of land \nconservation is a bipartisan idea, and maybe even to an extent it is a \npartisan or Republican idea. It was Teddy Roosevelt who quadrupled the \nacreage in our national forests, invented the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem, and proclaimed 18 national monuments. He said in 1910: \n``Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic \nduty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation.''\n  It was Richard Nixon who created the EPA and signed into law the \nClean Water Act. In 1970 he said: ``Clean air, clean water, open \nspaces--these should once again be the birthright of every American.''\n  While there aren't a lot of Democrats coming to the floor and quoting \nRonald Reagan, he had some very impressive things to say about this \ncountry's commitment and his movement's commitment to conservation, as \nwell.\n  Ronald Reagan said:\n\n       What is a conservative after all but one who conserves, one \n     who is committed to protecting and holding close the things \n     by which we live. . . . And we want to protect and conserve \n     the land on which we live--our countryside, our rivers and \n     mountains, our plains and meadows and forests. This is our \n     patrimony. This is what we leave to our children. And our \n     great moral responsibility is to leave it to them either as \n     we found it or better than we found it.\n\n  I am on the floor to speak in favor of the continuance of the land \nconservation tax incentive program that we hope will be in whatever tax \nextension deal gets passed by the Congress, as many proponents of the \nprovision in that tax extension package would like.\n  It would be better if this were permanent. It is very difficult to do \nlong-term planning for owners and operators of big farms such as the \nWike Brothers' Farm if they don't know the tax incentive is going to be \nthere for them. It is very difficult to do this retroactively, but it \nis important, nonetheless, to get this extended because this isn't the \nonly property in our State that has been affected.\n  The Towner Hill Farm in Sherman, CT, is an 80-acre property that \nwould not have been protected if it weren't for the Federal tax \ndeduction which was available to the owner in 2008. He offered it to \nthe town of Sherman at less than the value that he might have gotten at \na private land sale because he knew he was going to be able to get this \ntax incentive. Now it is home to one of the most popular hiking areas \nin all of that area in Sherman, CT.\n  The Vanishing Geese Farm in Durham, CT, the center of the State, has \na 42-acre farm that has been in the Scott family since the 1970s. They \ndesperately wanted to continue farming, but the ability to have a \nconservation easement purchased from them put money in their pockets \nthat allowed them to continue to farm but also gave them piece of mind, \nknowing that this piece of land that they love is going to be able to \nstay as open space.\n  Mr. Scott said, in his own colloquial way: ``Having worked the land, \ncut my firewood from it, raised sheep on it, and hayed it, I have \ndeveloped a lot of affection for it.''\n  In regard to the donation of the easement on his family's property, \nhe said:\n\n       I told my kids that my chest was puffed out a little more \n     and when I walked out in the snow, it was nice to know that \n     this land will never be developed. I feel that I've kind of \n     kept faith with the land and with the critters on it.\n\n  This is a very important tax incentive that, as I said, has resulted \nin tens of thousands of acres being preserved in the State of \nConnecticut. It is maybe the most important legacy that we leave--to \nrecognize that part of the true greatness of this country is the land \nupon which we live, the open spaces that define what it is to be an \nAmerican.\n  I mean, the Industrial Revolution powered us to global greatness but\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nwe--maybe better than any other nation in the world--have found this \nmiraculous way to marry together development and conservation, to \ndecide that there are going to be places that we are going to develop \nfor their natural resources or for their industrial capacity. But then \nthere are going to be these magical places, like this beautiful farm in \nnorthwestern Connecticut, where agriculture is happening and which to \nmany of us defines the character of the place in which we live--\npractical reasons why we should conserve a place such as the Wike \nBrothers' Farm to continue agriculture. But I would also argue there \nare spiritual reasons as well--reasons having to do with what it is to \nbe a citizen and inhabitant of this great Nation.\n  Republicans and Democrats, over the course of our congressional \nhistory, have come together to protect open spaces. Since 2006 \nRepublicans and Democrats have come together to protect this important \ntax incentive; 221 House Members have cosponsored the legislation and \n27 Senators.\n  I will leave with this statement. It is a bipartisan legacy for me as \nwell.\n  I ran a spirited race for the U.S. Congress in 2006, beating a 24-\nyear incumbent, Republican Nancy Johnson. There were places where I \ndeparted from her legacy and there were places where I inherited it. \nNancy Johnson was one of the authors, one of the creators, of this \nimportant conservation tax incentive. So in my corner of the world \nthere is a legacy of standing up for it, which is why I come to the \nfloor today.\n  I thank the body for the time, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6327-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6327-S6329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it has already started. There is being \nreadied today a building in Crystal City, VA, to house the announced \n1,000 workers who will be hired to process the unlawful Executive \namnesty the President has said he intends to execute.\n  The President is already moving forward. He is rushing to impose his \nimmigration views before the Congress can contain it or restrain it; \nbefore the American people fully understand what is happening; and to \nmake it so it can't be stopped.\n  The President's Executive orders violate the laws of Congress--the \nlaws that Congress has passed--in order to implement laws he wishes \nCongress had passed but which Congress has refused to pass. It refused \nin 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014.\n  The American people, through their congressional representatives, \nhave considered these kinds of proposals, they evaluated them, the \nAmerican people expressed their views on them, and Congress said no. \nThe people have been clear on this issue. For decades they have \npleaded, demanded, really, that this Congress create an immigration \nsystem that is lawful; that we end the lawlessness, that it be \nprincipled, that it serve the national interest, and that it serves \ntheir interest and not the special interests. But Congress and \npolitical leaders have refused to do so.\n  It is unfortunate to a degree I don't think I have seen on any other \nissue. Perhaps no other issue defines the gap between the elites in \nthis country and middle Americans who go to work every day, who support \nour country, pay our taxes, and fight our wars. Our people want our \nlaws that are on the books now enforced. If new laws are needed, they \nwant us to pass new laws to end this lawlessness. But this President \nrejects the will of the people. His policies nullify the laws we have. \nHis policies, shockingly, direct Federal agents to ignore their oaths \nand not enforce the laws, which creates the lawlessness that stains our \nlegal system in our country today and is causing so much angst out \nthere. People are not opposed to immigration. People are frustrated \nthat their government refuses to create a lawful system that will work \nand serve them.\n  What I want to say to my colleagues is that the President has gone \neven farther than that. He has gone farther than just saying: I am not \ngoing to enforce the laws, which he, as a President, the Chief \nExecutive Officer, is required to do. He is required to execute the \nlaws of the United States faithfully, which he is absolutely failing to \ndo. But he is moving forward with his immigration agenda, rejected by \nCongress and the American people, and he is moving forward in a lot of \ndifferent ways.\n  This was an issue in the campaign. The people heard about it just a \nfew weeks ago and they cast their ballots. There are nine new Senators \nelected to this Senate, and not one of them said they supported \nPresident Obama's scheme. Not one of them. They steadfastly opposed it. \nSo in this lameduck Congress, the attempt is being made to move this \nnew lawless agenda forward out of fear that it might not be so \npopularly received next year.\n  Is Congress hopeless, helpless, ineffectual? Is it not able to stop \nthis? Absolutely not. Congress has the power to control what the \nPresident does. It has the power to control what he spends money on. \nThe President, the executive branch, cannot spend one dime that has not \nbeen approved by the U.S. Congress. He can't spend more on roads, \nhighways, schools, defense, education, or health care that Congress has \nnot appropriated and not approved. So Congress has a responsibility and \na duty here. Congress should fund no program, should allow no \nPresidential expenditure to be spent on programs it deems are unworthy. \nIt absolutely has a responsibility to ensure this President spends no \nmoney to execute policies that are plainly in violation of existing \nlaw.\n  This Congress has a constitutional duty, no matter what Members may \nfeel about the substance of the issue. I have opinions on that. I \noppose the President's substantive position. But as a matter of law, \nseparation of powers, and constitutional duty, this Congress should \nstop the expenditure of Federal funds for projects that Congress has \nrejected and are not worthy of funding. Congress has deliberated these \nissues. This is not something it has not considered before. It has \nrejected this policy.\n  The special interests have spent, according to one independent group, \n$1.5 billion to try to ram through Congress an immigration plan the \nAmerican people reject and that Congress has refused to pass. The \nPresident hasn't given up, and these special interests haven't given \nup, despite the election and despite the wishes of the American people. \nThey want their policies and they are going to ram them through this \nCongress, if they possibly can, no matter what the people think. That \nis a threat to representative democracy. It is a threat to the laws of \nthis country. And the Congress needs to say no.\n  Let us be specific now. People may think: Well, you may not expend \nmoney if you don't prosecute somebody. So how are we going to complain \nabout that, Senator Sessions? Well, let us look at this. This is from \nthe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, which is charged with \nprocessing the applications of people who wish to enter the country \nlawfully. Broadcast on Monday, December 1--just this week--at 11:52. \nSubject: Today's email news.\n\n       USCIS is taking steps to open a new operational center in \n     Crystal City, a neighborhood in Arlington, Virginia, to \n     accommodate about 1,000 full-time, permanent Federal and \n     contract employees in a variety of positions and grade \n     levels. The initial workload will include cases filed as a \n     result of the executive actions on immigration announced on \n     November 20, 2014. Many job opportunities at the operational \n     center will be announced in the coming days and please \n     continue to monitor USAJOBS if you are interested.\n\n  This is just days from now.\n  Now let's put this little chart up. This briefly continues on what \nthey published. This is right off their email.\n\n       Current vacancies include: Special Assistant GS-12.\n\n  Boy, a lot of people in the country would like to be a GS-12.\n\n       Arlington, Virginia, today. Special Assistant GS-15, \n     Arlington, Virginia. Today. Chief of Staff GS-15, Arlington, \n     Virginia. Today.\n\n  It goes on, today, today, today, today. They are rushing this \nthrough. They are determined to get this done before the American \npeople can find\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\nout what is happening, to raise their voice, to communicate with their \nMembers of Congress and the Senate and stop it. This is not good for \nthis country.\n  You may say: Well, Jeff, surely the President hasn't overreached in \nthese matters. But Congress has stated you cannot enter the country \nunlawfully. That is a fundamental principle of our immigration law that \nhas been on the books for many years. If you enter unlawfully, you are \nnot entitled to work in America. And if you enter unlawfully and \nattempt to work and someone hires you and knows that you are illegally \nhere, the employer is subject to criminal penalties and other \npenalties. That is the basic law. It has been on the books for years. \nThe President is just wiping that off the books, colleagues.\n  Are we going to accept this? Are we going to allow the President to \njust wipe out duly passed laws to create an entirely new system of \nimmigration that Congress refused to establish? Our laws are on the \nbooks today. He has no power to reduce and erase those laws.\n  How serious is this? Last night former Speaker of the House Newt \nGingrich--Ph.D. in history, a student of American government, author of \nquite a number of books--made some dramatic statements about the \nmeaning of this Presidential action, and we should hear it, colleagues. \nThis is the former Speaker of the House, a student of American history \nand government. This is what he says about what is happening today. We \ncannot be oblivious to this, because what happens today will set trends \nand policies for tomorrow. He said:\n\n       Obama funding new staff and offices without congressional \n     approval is step toward kingship or dictatorship. He must be \n     stopped now.\n\n  How much clearer can it be than that? He goes on to say, in another \ntweet here:\n\n       Congress should only approve very short spending bill to \n     set up fight in January on Obama unconstitutional power grab. \n     No long term CR.\n\n  Here is the third one from last night:\n\n       Our entire constitutional structure is at stake. The new \n     Obama power grab is the greatest threat to freedom since King \n     George Third.\n\n  Those are quotes from Newt Gingrich. I am telling you, this is not a \nlittle bitty matter, and we have to fully understand the nature of what \nis happening here. Congress refused to pass what the President is \nenacting right now by Executive order and he has no power to do it. He \nshould not be doing it. He may well be stopped by lawsuits in years to \ncome, but Congress has the power to stop it now. We don't have to allow \nmoney to be spent in Arlington, Crystal City, VA, to hire 1,000 people \nto process these applications.\n  Now, how are things going in our immigration system today? I wish I \ncould report better circumstances than we have. The situation was grave \neven before this action. On May 20, last year, National Citizenship and \nImmigration Services Council president, representing thousands of USCIS \nworkers, issued a statement.\n  Colleagues, we need to know what has happened. It is unbelievable.\n  This is a person directly engaged with the people who do the work \nevery day, the law officers who go out there and try to adjudicate \nthese immigration cases.\n\n       USCIS adjudications officers are pressured to rubber stamp \n     applications instead of conducting diligent case review and \n     investigation. The culture at USCIS encourages all \n     applications to be approved, discouraging proper \n     investigation into red flags and discouraging the denial of \n     any applications. USCIS has been turned into an ``approval \n     machine.''\n\n  This is an absolute abdication of the responsibility the Congress and \nthe American people have given to the President as the Chief Executive \nOfficer and given all the way down to the lowest USCIS officer. They \nare not to be a rubberstamp machine. They are not to be an approval \nmachine. They are to serve the interests of the American people. They \nare to evaluate applications and do so carefully and fairly and \nconsistently. They are to investigate red flags.\n  What is he talking about when he says red flags? He is talking about \nthreats, criminals, terrorists.\n  Even Secretary Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security, testifying a \nfew days ago, acknowledged that of these 4 million or 5 million people \nwho are going to be applying for legal status in America through the \nPresident's program, there is no way their applications are going to be \nevaluated. If they say they came to the country in 1999, nobody is \ngoing to check on that. They are not going to see if they graduated \nfrom some school or had some job somewhere and investigate it. They are \nsimply going to act on the paperwork they have been given. And in many \ncases--in the bill that President Obama supported earlier last year--\nthere would not be any face-to-face meetings. They wouldn't even go \ninto an office and actually see the person. It would all be submitted \nby email and documents, which is highly risky, as the experts told us. \nThey need to see the person because they may not be the person they say \nthey are. They could just submit paperwork, get citizenship status, and \nnobody would have any idea whether they are worthy of being in the \nUnited States.\n  The situation is graver than a lot of people think. It is our duty to \nlegitimately represent the people in our country who believe this \nsystem is supposed to work. They sent us here. We say we have an \nimmigration law in America. Well, good. And then we end up here. It is \nnot so good. It is not working at all.\n  What are we supposed to do? We are sorry, constituents. We are sorry \nyou voted for us. I know we told you we wanted to do stuff to make this \nsystem better and we are going to end all this, but we will worry about \nthat tomorrow--and we are going to do something.\n  For 40 years Congress and Presidents have been promising to fix this \nsystem. The problem is, the special interests have won every time. The \nspecial interests have blocked the kind of reforms that create a system \nthat we know will serve our national interests, will be fair to \nimmigrants who apply, and help the American people live better lives.\n  To make a couple of more points. October 28 of this year, Mr. Kenneth \nPalinkas, the president of the association of 12,000 officers--issued \nthis statement:\n\n       We are still the world's rubber stamp for entry into the \n     United States--regardless of the ramifications of the \n     constant violations to the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n     Whether it's the failure to uphold the public charge law, the \n     abuse of our asylum procedures, the admission of Islamist \n     radicals, or visas for health risks, the taxpayers are being \n     fleeced and public safety is being endangered on a daily \n     basis.\n\n  That is what Mr. Palinkas said. Has anybody ever called him to \ntestify and to lay out these dangers? Certainly not the U.S. Senate. \nPresident Obama has his secret meetings with businesses and activist \ngroups--people with their big money and their contributions. He met \nwith them all summer. Did he meet with Mr. Palinkas? No. Did he meet \nwith the head of the ICE officers association? No. Mr. Palinkas pleaded \nand asked to be admitted so he could lay out the problems they face on \na daily basis, and it was rejected.\n  Mr. Palinkas goes on to say:\n\n       I write today to warn the general public that this \n     situation is about to get exponentially worse--and more \n     dangerous. America dodged a bullet when the Senate \n     immigration package S. 744 was blocked by the House. That \n     legislation would have been a financial security catastrophe. \n     But news reports have leaked information to the public of a \n     USCIS management contract bid for a ``surge'' printing of 34 \n     million green cards and employment authorization documents to \n     be provided to foreign nationals, a bid that predicts the \n     Administration's promised executive amnesty.\n\n  Think about what this officer is telling us. It is true. He goes on \nto say:\n\n       That is why this statement is intended for the public: If \n     you care about your immigration security and your \n     neighborhood security, you must act now to ensure that \n     Congress stops this unilateral amnesty. Let your voice be \n     heard and spread the word to your neighbors. We who serve in \n     our nation's immigration agencies are pleading for your \n     help--don't let this happen. Express your concern to your \n     Senators and Congressmen before it is too late.\n\n  That was October 28 of this year. He also issued this statement on \nMay 20 of last year:\n\n       USCIS officers who identify illegal aliens that, in \n     accordance with law should be placed into immigration removal \n     proceedings before a federal judge, are prevented from \n     exercising their authority and responsibility to issue \n     Notices to Appear.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The attitude of USCIS management--These are the political \n     appointees, appointed\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\n     by the President to execute his views of immigration.\n       The attitude of USCIS management is not that the Agency \n     serves the American public or the laws of the United States, \n     or public safety and national security, but instead that the \n     agency serves illegal aliens and the attorneys which \n     represent them.\n\n  What a statement. Who is the government supposed to represent? We \nrepresent the people of the United States who are lawfully here.\n\n       While we believe in treating all people with respect, we \n     are concerned that this agency tasked with such a vital \n     security mission is too greatly influenced by special \n     interest groups.\n\n  Boy, that is the truth. We had in one day Microsoft--a great \ncompany--demanding that more workers be allowed to come into the \ncountry so that they can work, in the same week they announced laying \noff 18,000.\n  In September of this year, Mr. Palinkas issued this statement:\n\n       Many millions come legally to the U.S. through our wide \n     open immigration policy every year--whether as temporary \n     visitors, lifetime immigrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, \n     foreign students, or recipients of our ``visa waiver \n     program'' which allows people to come and go freely. Yet our \n     government cannot effectively track these foreign visitors \n     and immigrants. And those who defraud authorities will face \n     no consequences at all in most cases. Our caseworkers cannot \n     even do in-person interviews for people seeking citizenship, \n     they cannot enforce restrictions on welfare use, and they \n     even lack the basic office space to properly function. \n     Applications for entry are rubber-stamped, the result of \n     grading agents by speed rather than discretion. We've become \n     a clearinghouse for the world.\n\n  Now that is the truth and anybody who knows what is going on in our \nsystem knows it. The President's action will beget even more \nlawlessness in the future. It is a statement to the world: No matter \nwhat the law says, you come to America, you get to stay. You will not \nbe deported.\n  This is a recipe for disaster. It cannot work. What we need in this \ncountry, and can achieve if Congress and the President will act, is to \ncreate a lawful system and enforce the law. We need to make it a system \nthat we can be proud of and that is fairly applied. We need a system \nthat ends the ability of people to defraud our country and come in \nunlawfully, and to serve the interest of working Americans.\n  That is what it is all about: Are we serving their interest, or are \nwe listening to special interests--political groups and activist \ngroups, politicians who think they gain political advantage, and \ncertain businesses who want more, cheaper labor? Don't we represent the \nvast majority of the people? Isn't there a national interest--an \ninterest of the American people? Somebody needs to defend that \ninterest. It has been lost in this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6329-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the Griggsby nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today we will vote to confirm Lydia \nGriggsby to serve on the Court of Federal Claims.\n  I thank the Majority Leader for filing cloture on her nomination. She \nshould have been confirmed several months ago but Republicans refused \nto consent to a vote on her nomination for no good reason.\n  Lydia was nominated on April 10 of this year. She had a hearing on \nJune 4 and was reported out of committee by a unanimous voice vote on \nJune 12. She is completely noncontroversial and exceptionally well \nqualified to serve on this court.\n  It should not have taken 6 days, let alone 6 months, for the Senate \nto approve her nomination. Despite this unnecessary delay, I am pleased \nthat we finally ended the filibuster and will confirm her today.\n  Lydia has served on my Judiciary Committee staff since 2006 and \ncurrently serves as my chief counsel for Privacy and Information \nPolicy. In this position, she has worked across the aisle on important \nlegislation to\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\npromote accountability and transparency. Before coming to the Judiciary \nCommittee she served on the Senate Ethics Committee.\n  I recommended Lydia to the President for this position because I know \nher intellect and good judgment will make her a fine judge. Before \nLydia came to work in the Senate, she served in the Justice Department \nand tried several matters before the Court of Federal Claims. When she \nis confirmed, it will most certainly be the court's gain and the \nJudiciary Committee's loss.\n  I will miss her wise counsel and I wish her all the best.\n  Madam President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Lydia Kay Griggsby, of Maryland, to be a \nJudge of the United States Court of Federal Claims?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are considered made and laid upon the table and the \nPresident will be immediately notified of the Senate's actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6330-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I know we have a lot to talk about. This \nwill be very quick.\n  I want to point out that is an opening at the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, which is such an important agency because they work on the \nsafety of powerplants, many of which are aging. We voted for Mr. Baran \nfor a short-term seat. He had extensive hearings, 88 questions asked in \nwriting. I feel very strongly that he is very suited for this position. \nHe worked for the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House and worked \nin a very bipartisan fashion.\n  In any case, I think this is a very important position and a very \nqualified individual, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, all time is yielded back.\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Jeffery Martin Baran, of Virginia, to be a Member of the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J.

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Ellen Dudley Williams, of \nMaryland, to be Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-\nEnergy, Department of Energy.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to give my \nremarks while seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. For hours and hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I come today with a spirit of \nreflection and optimism about our future. I am also compelled towards \nan honest assessment of where we are as a body--of the promise of what \nwe can achieve when we don't shy away from compromise and what we can't \nachieve when we refuse to compromise.\n  I also have very much on my mind that the job of public service is \nvery hard work, and it is an extremely noble and honorable calling. \nHere in the U.S. Senate we have the unique ability and responsibility \nto do very big things: ignite innovation in our schools and industries, \ngrow and protect a healthy country, foster global change borne from \npolicies that lead the globe. At the same time, we have the opportunity \nto touch individual lives with case management. One on one, with \ncasework, we often reach people in their darkest hour.\n  I love the Senate. I love the Senate. I love the intensity of the \nwork, the gravity of the issues, and I love fighting for West \nVirginians here. I learned to love this fight, as many of you know, as \na 27-year-old VISTA worker in the tiny coal community of Emmons, WV. It \nwas a place that set my moral compass and gave me direction, where \neverything in my real life actually began. It is where I learned how \nlittle I knew about the problems people faced there and in other places \nin the country, how little I knew, and what a humbling experience that \nwas for me.\n  My time there was transformative. It explains every policy I have \npursued and every vote I have cast. It was where my beliefs were bolted \ndown and where my passions met my principles. Emmons was where I came \nto understand that out of our everyday struggles we can enlarge \nourselves. We can grow greater. Truly making a difference couldn't be \nan afterthought. It never could. Rather, it requires a singular focus \nand relentless effort. It would be hard, but the work mattered. That is \nthe deal here.\n  Important undertakings can't be halfhearted. You have to commit your \nwhole self--almost like pushing a heavy rock uphill. With both of your \nhands you push, because if you let up for a split second with either \nhand, you and the rock go tumbling backwards into the abyss. There is \nalways so much at stake.\n  Even today in West Virginia too many are struggling. They are \nfighting to survive. I called them hardworking\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nwhen I really should say hard-surviving, but they are hardworking and \ntrying to survive. They are wary of the future. They are scared of \ntheir possibilities. Sometimes they are afraid of themselves, which is \npartly a tradition which says that change is bad, that strangers are \nbad. I was bad for quite a long time. But that is the way people are. \nThey don't really want to change. So change comes slowly. We just \nsimply fight twice as hard, and nothing stops us.\n  There is vast dignity and vast honor in helping people. You cannot \nlet go of it. I believe genuinely in the ability of government to do \ngood, to serve, and to right injustices. This is why the Senate must be \na place in which we embrace commitment to be deliberative, passionate, \nand unrelenting. But it must be a place in which we are driven only by \nthe duty and trust bestowed upon us by the people who put us here. This \nis where everything else should be put aside--boxed out, as it were.\n  Yes, politics led us here. But this is where we shed the campaign--or \nshould--and embrace our opportunities to lead, to listen, to dig in, to \nbridge differences, to govern, and to truly make a difference. At our \ncore we must be drawn to the hard, all-consuming policy work that lives \nin briefings, hearing rooms, and roundtables back in our States. Yet \nour North Star must always be the real needs of the people we serve.\n  So policy to me starts with listening. It is seeing the faces of our \nconstituents--not just thinking of a policy in terms of a policy, but a \npolicy in terms of the people whom it would affect. You see your \nconstituents, you hear them out, and you understand their needs and \ntheir problems. You get to know them very well, especially in a small \nState such as West Virginia. Listening to constituents and colleagues \nhere alike is absolutely necessary. Good policy is born out of \ncompromise. Compromise is not easy, but it can happen. If we truly \nlisten to each other, it very well could.\n  We separate our campaign selves from our public service selves. The \ncruelty of perpetual campaigns destroys our ability to fulfill our oath \nof office. It is hard to build a working relationship in this \ninstitution without an honest and open approach with our colleagues--\nRepublican or Democratic. But we must build that relationship because \ntogether we can do so much, and without it, we can do--as we have \nseen--nothing.\n  Listening and compromise were key to the work of the National \nCommission on Children in the 1990s. I was the chair of that \nCommission, which included a bipartisan group of government officials \nand appointed experts in various fields from all backgrounds. There \nwere many of us--32--and we went all over the country for 2 years.\n  I can tell you that reaching consensus was tough, but we listened, we \ndebated, and we came to trust. Even the most liberal and conservative \namong us knew that each of us had the best interests of our party. That \nwas not in dispute.\n  While meeting in Williamsburg, VA, which was where we had been \nmeeting at the time, I had to leave suddenly for an important Senate \nvote on Iraq. I handed over the gavel to our most conservative \nRepublican Member, someone in whom I had trust. That shocked people, \nbut it helped on the consensus.\n  In the end we were proud to vote 32 to 0 in support of the \nlegislation that we put forward and our policy statement as a whole, \nand it included both policies. It included the creation of a new \nRepublican child tax credit for the first time and a major expansion of \nthe earned-income tax credit, which has lifted millions of American \nfamilies out of poverty.\n  It worked because we listened to one another, respected one another, \nand we wanted to come to an agreement. It was clear, it was obvious, \nand there it was--32 to 0. Unbelievable, but it happened.\n  Is that possible these days? My answer is yes, and I believe that we \ncan see that spirit again as we address the future of the bipartisan \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--CHIP, the way it is known. It \ncurrently provides health care to 8.3 million children and pregnant \nwomen nationwide, and 40,000 of those are in West Virginia. CHIP is so \nimportant to me because it offers health care which is tailored to \nchildren; to wit, it has both mental and dental health care tailored to \nchildren. It is, in fact, better coverage than the Affordable Care Act \nprovides children.\n  From those early days at Vista, I have seen the devastating toll that \nlack of medical care can extract from a child's well-being and their \nhealth, their self-esteem--particularly their self-esteem--and even \ntheir will to succeed.\n  Many of you also know the names and faces of children who have gone \nwithout access to proper health care, and those are the ones we fight \nfor. That is why CHIP has always been a bipartisan effort, driven by \nthe needs of real kids and their families. Senators Grassley and Hatch \nwere instrumental in its creation over a period of a couple years and \nlong arguments, and they continue to be strong advocates.\n  The bipartisanship program has opened doors for millions who \ndesperately needed to get into a doctor's office and had never been \nable to do so and now are able to do so.\n  But a warning--every door that CHIP opened will be closed unless we \ncan agree to carry CHIP funding past mid-2015, and I don't know what \nthe prospects for that are. All I know is that if they aren't done \nproperly, those doors close; those kids had access to doctors, but they \ndon't anymore. That is unconscionable to me. We have to look at the \nfaces of those children in our own States and think about that. It is \nthose individual faces that I remember.\n  Remembering for whom we work is paramount. When any corporate CEO \ncomes to my office, I show them a prized birthday gift to my four \nchildren--our four children--my wife is here--a picture of a \nhardworking coal miner whose face is honest but hurting and very proud. \nThat picture means so much to me because it embodies the spirit of \nthose whom I am here to serve, and silently reminds us of why we must \nwork towards a common ground--why this is not about Democrats and \nRepublicans, but it is about the people whom we are here to serve, \nbringing different viewpoints to what that means.\n  Senator Mike Enzi and I are not on the same side of every vote--to \nput it mildly--but we are very, very good friends--a friendship that \nwas made years ago when I was serving on the President's HOPE mission \nand he was the mayor of Gillette, WY, going slightly crazy trying to \nbuild houses for all the people moving in there through coal. He also \nhad sideburns. I say that oftentimes--off the record.\n  On a gray day in January 2006, West Virginia was frozen in disbelief \nwhen we learned that 12 trapped miners were killed in Sago Mine--a mine \nin the north central part of the State.\n  In the days that followed, as we struggled to make sense of what had \nhappened, Senator Enzi and Senator Isakson joined Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Manchin, and myself in West Virginia. The first two did not \nreal merely visit--they came to understand. They came to learn. They \ncame to share in the grief and to offer their support to the community, \nand you could tell that in their faces.\n  Together, out of tragedy--and because they were members of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--we forged a \ncompromise on mine safety legislation that brought about, frankly, the \nstrongest safety improvements in a generation. It was huge for us. Only \n16 States mine coal, but we are one of them.\n  To this day, Senator Isakson carries a picture of one of the Sago \nminers. It is not in the wallet that he is carrying today, but it is in \nthe other wallet back in Atlanta. I don't care where it is, that \npicture is in his wallet every single day. We knew that, as public \nofficials, compromising and really leading, men govern--which is why we \nwere there.\n  Answering the needs of our country is our responsibility, and we do \nthe best when we work shoulder to shoulder. It was working shoulder to \nshoulder when we set our country on a path to future innovation.\n  A few years ago, America's domination in our innovation--our \ninventions and creative problem-solving--was eroding, and we all knew \nit. We needed to act. We needed to reinvigorate our leadership in those \nareas and to keep our jobs and our future more secure.\n  We answered that call with a bipartisan compromise that delivered the\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nAmerica COMPETES Reauthorization Act. I will never forget that. This \nlegislation made historic investments in basic research, science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math education.\n  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who preceded John Thune on the commerce \ncommittee, Senator Alexander, and I sought unanimous consent to get the \nbill passed--because we thought we worked out the details pretty well--\nand do it prior to the recess. Therefore, we had to do it by unanimous \nconsent. But there were five objections holding the bill still.\n  Instead of retreating to party corners and pointing fingers, we \ncompromised right on that center aisle--right there next to Senator \nCollins. We wound it up and down, we added a little money and we took a \nlittle bit of money off. Mostly we took several billion dollars off. We \nremoved a couple of programs that weren't absolutely necessary to \nsatisfy Kay Bailey or Lamar Alexander. And we had ourselves a $44 \nbillion bill over 5 years on which we agreed. We didn't have to have a \nvote. Senator Hutchison and Senator Alexander tenaciously worked to \nclear the holds. It was absolutely beautiful. It was just beautiful--a \n$44 billion program to reinvigorate our Nation, cerebrally and \nproductively. Together we passed a bill to revive our country's \nflagging global performance ranking and catapult us to success. \nReaching moments like those requires persistence. It demands \ncollaboration. It demands trust and compromise, and it is so worth it.\n\n  I am driven by the process of creating policy. I love doing that. It \nis grinding, it is intense, it can be frustrating and sometimes \nheartbreaking--often heartbreaking. But when we accomplish something \nthat is meaningful to the people who have entrusted us to represent \nthem, there is no greater reward.\n  We have to know who and what we must fight for in our work and in our \nown personal views. We have to know and understand those who will \nbenefit and those who will lose. And we have to be ready for it to take \na long time--much longer than we thought--sometimes 5 years, sometimes \n10 years. That makes no difference. You keep at it. You don't let go of \nit, because if you keep at it, somewhere along some combination of \nSenators is going to say, yeah, that is OK. And then we get ourselves a \nbill.\n  Also we keep in our souls the faces of the people we try to help, the \npeople in my case who were all too often left behind. The Senate must \nface serious social and policy issues from health care to cyber \nsecurity, caring for veterans coming home, building up our \ninfrastructure, making our economy work for everyone. These are our \ncore responsibilities. I am proud that we have made some measure of \nprogress. While we seem right now to be at an impasse, I know the \nSenate will rise to the position of addressing our issues and at some \npoint in some way it will happen. As a governing body, we must not \nallow recent failures to take root, to mean too much to us. We must not \nbe focused on episodic ``gotcha'' issues rather than working to address \nbroader, more systemic problem solving. No one else is going to step in \nto do this if we don't.\n  The truth was on full display a few weeks ago when the Senate failed \nto move forward on National Security Administration reforms necessary \nto uphold the mission of protecting our Nation. These are issues on \nwhich I have very strong views. I have taken very seriously my 14 years \non the Intelligence Committee, as a member and as chairman, because the \nglobal threats we face increase daily as the world becomes more \nconnected. We depend on the highly trained professionals at NSA to zero \nin on those threats. There are only 22 of them that make sort of final \ndecisions. They are highly trained. They have taken the oath of office \nto protect our Nation.\n  Now I don't think we have any excuse to outsource our intelligence \nwork to telecommunications firms. I work on the Commerce Committee. I \nhave seen what the telecommunications companies do when they can get \naway with it--you know, everything from cramming to--just all kinds of \nnot very nice things. It is the job of government to address this \nissue. The private sector and the free market alone cannot solve those \nkinds of problems and should not. That is a government responsibility \nbeing carried out with great success.\n  A lot of people say, oh, what if? But the fact is nobody has ever \nbeen able to show me somebody whose privacy has been influenced or \nbroken into by the NSA. Good, hard-working people can be destroyed by \ncircumstances beyond their control. It is our job to not let that \nhappen. It is our job to help to give everyone a fair shot. It is much \neasier to say than to do, but that is our charge.\n  Too many children come into a world where circumstances preclude the \nopportunities they should have. We cannot discount the many challenges \nour society still faces. It is unconscionable in a country like ours \nthat people go without health care or go hungry or have no place to \ncall home.\n  When shareholders and the free market cannot or will not solve our \nproblems, it is government's responsibility to step in every time. \nPeople can decry government all they want, but we are here for a \nreason. When private companies decide there isn't enough profit to \nprovide Internet to rural areas, then we step in and we expand \nbroadband, allowing the E-Rate to go farther and farther out. It now \ncovers 97 percent of all schools in the country.\n  Maybe the private sector decides they cannot make enough by insuring \nthe sickest of our children. We must act. That is our core mission. It \nis who we are as an institution. It is who we must always be.\n  We have worked to give children a fair shot through the E-Rate \nProgram which introduces the most rural classrooms and the smallest \nlibraries to the world through the Internet, access to a foreign \nlanguage class or research, but it gives every child a key to unlock \ntheir potential. It doesn't mean they will, but it means they can.\n  We know health care is fundamental to a fair shot as well. We cannot \nlearn or keep a job if we are sick. But providing that care has not \nalways been as profitable as some companies would like. So we make sure \nmillions of Americans could have the dignity of access to health care \nunder the Affordable Care Act.\n  My friend Sam is one of the faces I will never forget. When he was \nbattling childhood leukemia and hit his lifetime insurance cap--it is a \ntechnical term for a savage consequence--his parents' insurance \ncompanies walked away from this courageous little fighter. His parents, \nboth schoolteachers, were left with heart-wrenching decisions such as \ngetting divorced--which they considered--so Sam could qualify for \nMedicaid. Well, in the end it didn't matter; Sam lost his battle with \ncancer. But today under the Affordable Care Act we have made sure that \nno insurance companies can abandon someone like Sam when they need help \nthe most. Health care reform will never take away the crushing agony of \nparents with sick kids. Heartbreaking situations like Sam's drove us to \nsay no more, and we changed the law. Parents deserve to focus every bit \nof their energy fighting for their kids in every way, not fighting \nprofit-obsessed insurance companies. So we did the right thing. We did \nthe right thing.\n\n  Government also did the right thing when I fought for what I thought \nmy life depended on, because it did, to pass the Coal Act of 1992, long \nforgotten. We had to step in and stop some coal companies from walking \naway from benefits which they had promised by contract to retired coal \nminers and their widows--folks who were mostly in their seventies and \neighties. Passing the Coal Act was enormously important to our country. \nIt not only prevented in absolute terms a national coal strike in 1993, \nbut it delivered on the promise of lifetime health benefits earned by \n200,000 retired coal miners and their widows. They would not have been \ntaken care of if those companies had their way.\n  Nor can we rely on the private sector alone to take care of our \nveterans. It is government's duty to provide the health care they \nearned. We do this through community-based clinics and improved \nservices for PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and family support. It is \nexpensive. Senator Rob Portman and I wanted to pass a bill which would \ncause the Department of Defense to give all people entering the \nmilitary mental health screening--not when they came back from Iraq or \nAfghanistan or somewhere else, but before they\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\nwent in, and then on an annual basis do that again to build a database, \nto make sure we knew that we could take care of them better when they \ncame home.\n  We rightly asked the government to take on some of society's most \nfundamental needs. What I found in Emmons was a community of genuinely \nstrong and incredibly hard-working people who were essentially on their \nown trying to survive. The free market had not made sure that \ncommunities such as Emmons had good roads or any schools or any \nschoolbuses or any clean drinking water or safe jobs. But from my point \nof view they deserved all of those. They deserved to have their shot. \nWorking together on the needs of places such as Emmons speaks to our \ncore human connection and to an aspiration for the greater good.\n  That is what drove me into public service. It was not something I \ncould help. I just had to do it, to help people with everything that I \nhave. Every individual in every community such as Emmons deserves to \nhave public officials who will fight the big fight and the personal \nones, the casework.\n  Extending a hand on those personal challenges is incredibly \nmeaningful work. Our constituents face these fights with Herculean \ncourage but not always the resources to solve the problems in front of \nthem. People like the 8-year-old who needed a bone marrow transplant, a \nprocedure that in 1990 was considered experimental. Our office \nintervened. We helped that boy get that transplant and he still lives \ntoday. As a Senator, you take on those fights with the same vigor as \nany policy or ideological debate and you are equally proud when you win \nand you are equally hurt when you lose.\n  When I came to West Virginia 50 years ago, I was searching for a \nclear purpose for my life's work. I wanted the work to be really hard, \nand what I got was an opportunity to work really hard along with a real \nand utterly spiritual sense of mission. This work demands and deserves \nnothing less than everything that we have to give.\n  I will miss the Senate. Some days I don't want to leave, but it is \ntime, which brings me to some profoundly important notes of gratitude.\n  To my colleagues, I say thank you.\n  I have mentioned some. I could mention so many. You are dedicated, \nyou are brilliant, and you are public servants. I love you for putting \nup with what you have to, particularly the way elections are these \ndays. I respect you for it so much. Thank you for fighting alongside \nme. Thank you for challenging me.\n  To my staff, a Senator is really nothing without his staff or her \nstaff, and there is not a more committed, talented, and deeply \npassionate staff in the United States Senate. To my staff, you live and \nyou breathe your work everyday. You inspire me with your endless \ncapacity for redressing injustice and fighting for people who need you \nand come to you in need. You never turned a single West Virginian away. \nI glory in my gratitude to you.\n  To my family, who has sacrificed so much, I thank you. I have been \nselfish in my devotion to my work, and I have been vastly inept in \nbalancing family and work. Public service is not encouraging of \nbalance.\n  Sharon, you are everything--an extraordinary mother, a remarkable \nbusinesswoman, and you are a public servant. You have been a visionary \nin public broadcasting. Our entire Nation is indebted to your efforts \nto educate and inform us. The impact you continue to make on public \nlife is truly remarkable. Any achievement I am proud of I share with \nyou eternally.\n  (Applause, Senators rising)\n  Our children--John, Valerie, Charles, and Justin--have all been very \nthoughtful and endlessly supportive in my absences. Our grandchildren \nbring me so much joy, and I really hope to see a lot more of them.\n  To West Virginia, thank you for placing your faith in me--I know it \nwas hard at first--and giving me the greatest reward: the chance to \nfight for meaningful and lasting opportunity for those who were too \noften forgotten but absolutely deserve the best.\n  My fellow West Virginians, I am forever inspired by you, and I am \nforever transformed by you.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. There will be many remarks at the end of the year from \nSenators regarding Jay Rockefeller, but at this time I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    ``Zero Dark Thirty'' IG Reports\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \n``Zero Dark Thirty''--not the movie but a report on the movie. The \nreport was supposed to tell us how the movie's producers obtained top-\nsecret information from the Federal Government, but the report never \ntook us there.\n  The Department of Defense inspector general stumbled and fell and \nlost sight of the goal and the need for independence. People were \nexposed to harm, the taxpayers' money got wasted, and alleged \nmisconduct by top officials was shielded by a policy that may have been \nabused. Bureaucratic bungling caused confusion, turmoil, and dissent. \nFor certain, the whole thing was a fiasco.\n  The ``Zero Dark Thirty'' report was driven by the hemorrhage of leaks \nof highly classified information by senior administration officials \nafter the Osama bin Laden raid. It was requested by the chairman of the \nHouse oversight committee, Congressman Peter King--a very good \nCongressman, very good on oversight.\n  He read a column in the New York Times which indicated that Hollywood \nfilmmakers ``received top-level access to the most classified mission \nin history.'' Congressman King was concerned that those disclosures \ncould undermine our ability to successfully conduct covert operations \nin the future, so in August 2011 Congressman King asked the inspectors \ngeneral of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of \nDefense to answer five simple questions. My focus during these remarks \nwill be on the Department of Defense IG's investigation.\n  I became involved, as you might expect, after whistleblowers \ncontacted my office in December 2012 alleging that Acting and Deputy \nInspector General Lynne Halbrooks was sitting on Congressman King's \nreport. They alleged that she--Ms. Halbrooks--was suppressing the \nreport to, No. 1, protect her boss, Secretary of Defense Panetta, and \nother senior officials from disciplinary action or prosecution, and No. \n2, to further her candidacy to be the next inspector general.\n  Her nomination was vetted while the investigation was in progress. \nThe convergence of those potential conflicts of interest grabbed my \nattention. They needed scrutiny. The independence of the Office of \nInspector General could have been jeopardized. So my staff started \ndigging. They interviewed key witnesses and examined documents provided \nby whistleblowers and official sources. Here is what we have found:\n  On December 16, 2011, the Department of Defense Office of Inspector \nGeneral announced that its investigation would begin immediately and \nthat it was to be coordinated with the CIA inspector general. It would \nbe conducted by the Office of Intelligence and Special Program \nAssessments headed by a Mr. James Ives. That investigation took a year.\n  A draft report was submitted for classification review on October 24, \n2012. The allegations were substantiated. No. 1, senior officials, \nincluding Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, his chief of staff Jeremy \nBash, and Under Secretary of Intelligence Michael Vickers, allegedly \nmade unauthorized disclosures of highly classified information on that \nraid. No. 2, these alleged disclosures may have placed special \noperations personnel and their families in harm's way.\n  One month later the draft report containing those allegations was \ndeclared unclassified. A coordination package was then developed. It \nincluded a publicly releasable version, talking points for reporters, \nand transmittal memos to the Defense Secretary and Chairman King.\n  This package was circulated internally for review and clearance. The\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\nnext and final step was submission to Deputy IG Halbrooks as a request \nfor release. Now, by normal standards, the report was ready for issue. \nHowever, there was a major foul-up--a real show stopper. The review \nprocess was bungled from start to finish.\n  All references to unauthorized disclosures of highly classified \ninformation by senior officials had to be stripped from the report \nbefore it could be published. This draconian measure, which gutted the \nreport and made it unfit for publication, was mandated by a \nlongstanding department policy. This long standing department policy \nwas known only to the two leaders of the investigation, Deputies \nHalbrooks and Ives. It was their responsibility to execute it at the \nfront end of the review.\n  I want to make one point crystal clear. I don't support the policy of \ncensoring reports. It is a bad policy that needs to be changed. My \nbeef, though, is if that is the policy, then it should have been \nfollowed, but it wasn't followed until the last possible moment.\n  To make matters far worse, both Ives and Halbrooks failed to \ncommunicate the policy mandate to those who needed the information to \nready the report for publication. Halbrooks and Ives kept the \ninvestigative team in the dark--like a bunch of mushrooms. So they had \nthe mistaken notion the uncensored report was final and ready to go. \nThis caused a great deal of turmoil.\n  Two factors set the stage for the bungled review process. First, the \nofficial assigned to lead the project, Mr. Ives, lacked relevant \nprofessional experience, and top management failed to actively \nsupervise his day-to-day progress on the report to ensure that he \nfollowed established protocols. He needed guidance navigating his way \nthrough an unfamiliar process but received no guidance. Plus, his \nappointment was limited to 4 months on a project that took 2 years.\n  This was a recipe for disaster.\n  Second, the problem was compounded by a failure to coordinate with \nthe CIA inspector general before the investigation got rolling. \nEffective coordination was essential. Congressman King's request \ncrossed jurisdictional lines between two powerful agencies, the CIA and \nthe Department of Defense.\n  The CIA's inspector general was ultimately responsible for the \nalleged misconduct because it occurred while Panetta and his Chief of \nStaff, Jeremy Bash, were CIA employees. The fact that they had moved to \nthe Pentagon after the investigation started was irrelevant.\n  This was a no-brainer, but for inexplicable reasons the Department of \nDefense IG tackled the Panetta-Bash allegations. This was an \nirresponsible and wasteful action. It took over a year of groping down \nblind alleys for the reality to finally sink in. By then it was way too \nlate.\n  The failure of the two agencies to coordinate effectively right up \nfront had disastrous consequence. Just as the report was reaching \ncritical mass in late 2012, the Panetta case had to be referred back to \nthe CIA IG for investigation. Panetta's alleged misconduct was the \nheart and soul of the report.\n  It was suddenly gone, leaving the report hollow and empty. How could \nall this senseless blundering happen unless it was part of a plan to \nslow-roll or even torpedo the report. The blundering was coupled with \nunexplained delays.\n  Between mid-December and early January, Deputy Ives finally completed \nthe mandated substantial review, which gutted the report. However, it \ndid not regain forward motion until after Secretary Panetta retired \nFebruary 27, 2013.\n  Halbrooks claims she did not receive or see a draft until March 25, \n2013. Aside from a few minor edits, there is no record of significant \nedits between Mr. Ives' review and publication of the report. The 3-\nmonth delay in reaching her desk and subsequent delays until June \nremain unexplained and unaccounted for.\n  These facts create the perception that the review process was slowed \nby Halbrooks and others at her direction to shield Department of \nDefense officials from scrutiny. She claims her nomination was dead at \nthat point and no longer a potential conflict, but she offers no \nevidence to back it up.\n  Moreover, this timeline fits with other relevant information. \nAccording to a whistleblower, she stated repeatedly that the report \nwould not be issued until Panetta stepped down--and that is exactly \nwhat happened.\n  Finally, the bungled review process may have triggered \nwhistleblowing. Whistleblowers thought the report was about to be \nissued in late 2012 when media talking points were circulated. When \nthat didn't happen, they perceived a coverup. They contacted my office \nand then they leaked the report to the Project on Government Oversight, \nwhich is normally referred to around this town as POGO.\n\n  The uncensored version of the report appeared on POGO's Web site on \nJune 4, 2013. Ten days later, the IG's office reacted by finally \nissuing a censured version of the report. If POGO had not acted, the \nreport might never have seen the light of day. It might have been \npigeonholed for good.\n  Immediately after the initial report was issued, Halbrooks launched a \nhunt for the mole. She wanted to know who leaked the reports to POGO. \nExtensive interviews were conducted and 33,269 emails were examined, \nbut the leaker was not found.\n  However, during questioning, Mr. Dan Meyer, the DOD OIG Director of \nWhistleblowing and Transparency, admitted to giving a copy of the \nreport to Congress. He was one of the many OIG employees who mistakenly \nbelieved the uncensored version of the report circulated in late 2012 \nfor final review and clearance was, indeed, final.\n  He thought it was ready to go out the door. As the Director of \nWhistleblowing and Transparency, maybe he just thought he was doing his \njob and being--as every government official ought to be--very \ntransparent because the public's business ought to be public. Around \nthis town, however, that is not always the case.\n  Mr. Meyer's admission triggered swift and decisive action. He was \naccused of making false statements, placing his security clearance in \njeopardy. This action had the potential of destroying his career. Now, \nfortunately--and this doesn't happen very often around this town--the \nnew inspector general at the Department of Defense, Jon Rymer, \nintervened in Mr. Meyer's behalf and blocked those efforts.\n  The case against Mr. Meyer was very flimsy, though his clearance is \nstill hanging fire. In the end, Mr. Meyer bore the brunt of blame for \nthe POGO leak. The principal targets of the investigation--Panetta, \nVickers, and Bash--skated. Mr. Meyer exposed their alleged misconduct, \nand yet he got hammered. Justice was turned upside down.\n  What happened during the 22 months between Chairman King's request \nand June 2013, when the report was finally issued, is a tangled \nbureaucratic mess. Despite exhaustive questioning, a satisfactory \nexplanation hasn't been given. What I have presented today is just a \nbrief summary of the facts and analysis laid out in greater detail in a \nstaff report that I released today.\n  In that report my staff identified potential red flags pertaining to \nthe way the Office of the Inspector General handled the ``Zero Dark \nThirty'' report. These were boiled down to nine conclusions that fell \ninto four broad categories: No. 1, impairment of IG independence and \nlack of commitment to the spirit and intent of the IG act; No. 2, weak \nleadership; No. 3, mismanagement; and No. 4, waste of time and \ntaxpayers' money.\n  The staff findings suggest that some corrective action may be \njustified, including an appropriate measure of accountability. If \nmisconduct and/or mismanagement occurred, then Deputies Lynne Halbrooks \nand James Ives, both of whom led the ``Zero Dark Thirty'' project, \nwould appear to be chiefly responsible for whatever happened.\n  It is also recommended that the longstanding department policy--which \nearlier I told you I disagreed with--of censoring sensitive information \nfrom reports not be applied to cases involving alleged misconduct by \ntop officials because agency heads and their senior deputies should be \nheld to a higher standard. They should be subjected to greater public \nscrutiny. This policy needs review and possible modification.\n  When all is said and done, the proof is, of course, in the pudding, \nas they say. What good came from this effort? Its true value is \nreflected in the end product, the highly sanitized report that was \nfinally issued June 14, 2013, 6 months after it was finished. I believe \nthat it is a second-class piece of work\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\nthat is not worth the paper that it is written on.\n  Even Halbrooks seems to agree that the report's face value is close \nto zero. This is what she said during an interview with my staff. She \nsaid that once Ives removed all the derogatory information on Panetta \nand Vickers, the report was no longer interesting or important to me--\nmeaning her--and it just dropped off my radar screen--and words to that \neffect. She was talking about the report issued June 14, 2013.\n  Halbrooks is correct about the value of the report, but she is dead \nwrong about her responsibility as IG for the unfinished report. At that \npoint, she appears to have lost sight of her core mission as the \ninspector general.\n  The report was about alleged misconduct by her boss, the Secretary of \nDefense. It was requested by the chairman of the House oversight \ncommittee, Mr. King.\n  She had a solemn duty to put it back on her radar screen and keep it \nthere--front and center--until it was fixed. Once it was ready and up \nto standard, she should have presented it proudly and enthusiastically \nto the Congress and the Secretary of Defense--and done it properly and \nin restricted format, if necessary.\n  This project was an unmitigated disaster spawned by a series of top-\nlevel missteps and blunders. All the wasted energy and blundering \nproduced nothing better than internal confusion, turmoil, dissent, and \nmore alleged misconduct.\n  Two years's worth of hard work and money was more or less poured down \na rat hole. To make matters far worse, a valued employee was threatened \nwith termination. This person has unique and unparalleled knowledge of \nwhistleblowing and a rock-solid commitment to fair treatment of \nwhistleblowers.\n  Were it not for Inspector General Rymer, he would be out on the \nstreet this very day. Halbrooks' search for the mole was misguided.\n\n  The inspector general's office needs strong leadership that has the \ncourage to tell it like it is and to report wrongdoing promptly to \nagency heads and even Congress with recommendations for corrective \naction. When the Secretary and the Under Secretary stand accused of \nmisconduct, as in this case, the IG should double down and ensure \npublic accountability. Thus far in this matter there has been none \nbecause truth was hidden behind a questionable policy that may have \nbeen abused.\n  There is an excellent case in point from just a few years back. \nDeputy Secretary of Defense and CIA Director John Deutsch allegedly \nmishandled highly classified information and got hammered for doing so. \nHe lost his security clearance for 6 years and came very close to \nprosecution. Unlike this case--the ``Zero Dark Thirty'' leaks--the John \nDeutsch matter was dealt with effectively and it was aired publicly.\n  The ``Zero Dark Thirty'' model was wasteful of the taxpayers' money, \nit was harmful to morale, and harmful to the perceived independence of \nthe IG's office. It should be used as an educational tool to teach \nOffice of Inspector General employees in any department of government \nhow not to conduct investigations of alleged misconduct by senior \nofficials.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           The Extenders Bill\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like to amplify the remarks made \nrecently by my colleague from Utah Senator Hatch, our distinguished \nranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, concerning the year-end \ntax legislation--what is called the tax extenders bill.\n  Senator Hatch was entirely correct, it seems to me, when he said that \ngetting this legislation through the Senate had been an ordeal, an \nunnecessary ordeal not only for the Senate but more particularly for \nevery person in business back home in my State of Kansas and also \nthroughout the country--Utah, Kansas, wherever in the United States. I \nam talking about farmers, ranchers, small business owners, \nmanufacturers and all of their employees; in other words, the backbone \nof our economy.\n  It is a real shame that the longer term extenders deal developed by \nthe chairmen of the tax committees and the leaders in the House and \nSenate--yes, you heard me right, both chairmen in the House and Senate \nand both leaders--have agreed that basically this deal that was reached \nbefore the Thanksgiving holiday has collapsed.\n  The deal included a number of very critical items, including a \npermanent simplification of the research credit that would help \nbusinesses plan and invest in job-creating innovation. The package also \nincluded a number of provisions for which I had worked very hard, \nincluding special depreciation and expensing rules that are very \nimportant to agriculture and small business.\n  The plan also included bipartisan legislation I developed with \nSenator Schumer to modify the research and development tax credit so it \ncould be more easily used by smaller businesses, where the bulk of \ntechnological innovation occurs.\n  The plan also included long-term extension of legislation I have \npushed to make sure smaller businesses are able to access the capital \nthey need to grow and hire new employees.\n  These provisions are not giveaways. They free up capital and cash \nthat can be invested and recycled into economic growth. That is a good \nthing. We should have done that. These provisions do not fit within the \nclass warfare debate--actually, it is not a debate but rather a \ndiversionary tactic that actually took place, that shouldn't have even \nbeen mentioned. A veto should never have even been forthcoming from the \nWhite House.\n  I have heard the complaint the proposal was too business focused. \nSince business today is mired in a swamp of regulation and guessing \ngames and unpredictability, the focus of a so-called tax-extenders bill \nshould have darn well been focused on business. Not every person in \nAmerica works for our growing government.\n  The deal would have also helped individual taxpayers, from teachers \ntaking a deduction for school supplies they purchase with their own \nmoney to help for homeowners who have defaulted on a mortgage or faced \nfinancial hardship, to deductions for college tuition and expenses. \nThese provisions would keep more money in the pocket of taxpayers, a \nbetter place for it.\n  The package represented months of good-faith work by the tax \ncommittees and leadership in both Houses of Congress, something unique \nthat we have not experienced around here for quite a while. Obviously, \nthe deal wasn't perfect by any stretch, but it would have been a great \ndownpayment for true tax reform. Most of all, it would have brought \ncertainty and clarity to tax policy, something we sorely need and which \nis long overdue.\n  Let me give an example of what I mean. Earlier this week I visited \nwith farmers in Kansas at the annual Kansas Farm Bureau meeting--about \n1,000 farmers attended. One farmer, who shared his views so pretty much \neverybody around him could hear, told me he had recently purchased new \nfarm equipment--combines and tractors so his family could step up work \non their land, expand their operation, and he was upset. Actually, he \nwas not upset, he was mad because, according to him, ``we've been \nmessing around in Washington too much with the extenders bill.'' He was \nmad because if the equipment expensing rules aren't extended, he is out \nmany thousands of dollars. That is just a portion of what has been \nspent. But that is money he would have used to buy more equipment or \nmore land--the productive use of capital--and not some trivial amount \nused for a vacation or something else.\n  It is not just this farmer. My phone has been ringing off the hook \nall month with calls from farmers, ranchers, equipment dealers, and \nother businesses that need to know whether this will get extended, and \nthey, too, are upset--make that mad. They are frustrated, and they need \nus to get to work to help them run their businesses and their lives.\n  Yes, even with the recent blowup, we will extend these tax provisions \nbut only for 1 year--a month--and then we will be back at it again next \nyear, and these folks will be in the same position, the same kind of \npurgatory, wondering whether we will ever come to our senses, wondering \nwhether to buy that new tractor or buy the new production line or to \nhire new employees.\n\n  Every day when I visit with business owners and taxpayers in Kansas I \nhear over and over one simple refrain: Senator, we need certainty in \nthe Tax\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\nCode. We need to be able to rely on a stable tax system so we can plan \nand grow our business. Senator Pat, the Congress needs to do something \nabout these tax extenders.\n  I couldn't agree more, and I think most of us, if not all of us on \nthe Senate Finance Committee, couldn't agree more. The lack of \ncertainty about these tax provisions is bad for American families. It \nis bad for business looking to create jobs, and it is bad for our \neconomy. It leaves businesses unable to plan ahead and invest because \nthey are left in the dark about what tax provisions will affect their \noperations.\n  So what happened to the deal? Why are we at this point debating \nanother kick of the can down the road? The imperial Presidency has \nhappened. The President has decided that instituting an Executive \namnesty was the best course of action before the end of the year.\n  President Obama's immigration grenade doomed the tax extenders deal. \nReal negotiations unraveled, a veto threat was issued, and the \nbipartisan compromises were killed. Because of President Obama's my-\nway-or-the-highway approach to leadership and to amnesty, Congress is \nnow forced to once again cobble together a 1-year tax policy patch that \nbasically nobody wants. This hurts families, job creators, farmers, \nranchers, teachers--everyone who needs to plan ahead to succeed.\n  So instead of working with Congress to develop an immigration reform \ncompromise, we have the most arrogant attack on the Constitution I have \never seen. Once again the President placed partisan politics above the \nneeds of the middle class--our workers and business owners, our \nstudents, our teachers, and indeed our entire economy.\n  Without this unprecedented illegal Executive order, we would right \nnow be discussing a long-term extension of these vital tax provisions. \nWe could maybe even have voted on it as of this year--as of this week--\nlaying a strong base for comprehensive tax reform. Instead, the \nPresident has sacrificed job-producing tax policy for the expedience of \nExecutive action.\n  As I have said elsewhere, the President has seemingly no interest in \na constructive working relationship with Congress. He didn't have any \nintention of listening to the will of the American people, and he has \nno respect for the constitutional boundaries of his office. This is \nbeyond troubling, but its spillover into other areas, such as tax \npolicy, does not bode well for the bipartisan development of policy to \nbuild the economy we so desperately need and that we were so close to \nachieving.\n  But let us be hopeful. Maybe something good will come out of this \nwhole situation. Maybe we will recognize the level of dysfunction \nillustrated by the Executive order, and I hope it will point us back to \nregular order. It is critically important that we return to regular \norder in the Senate, in particular with all of the major fiscal issues \nwe face.\n  Bringing the extenders package to the Finance Committee was a strong \nsign that we mean business and that we are ready to move on a \nbipartisan basis to address the fiscal issues that are facing the \ncountry. Sadly, that effort was sabotaged. Without that action, we \nwould be moving toward a more sensible, bipartisan, progrowth extenders \nbill and perhaps well on our way to tax reform. That we are not is a \nshame. It didn't have to be this way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                 Tribute to Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I have a couple of things I wish to do \nbefore I assume the Chair, and I want to express my great gratitude to \nmy friend from Massachusetts for his willingness to sit tight for a \nlittle bit.\n  I was sitting here thinking about the two men I want to talk about, \nand I was thinking about how similar they are; how different their \nbackgrounds are but how similar their goals in life and their interests \nin the people they serve. It is the great irony of our democracy that \nregardless of where you come from, if you come to serve the public, you \ncome to love the public, and you come to believe in the work you do and \nbelieve that every person has to be given an opportunity.\n  So I first want to offer my great condolences to the family of Mayor \nDenny Walaker from our great city of Fargo, ND. It is truly with a \nheavy heart I come to the floor to pay tribute to the mayor of Fargo.\n  Dennis Walaker--to those of us who knew him well, Denny--passed away \nTuesday after a very short but aggressive fight in his battle against \ncancer. His passing I think shocked most of us and certainly saddened \nall of us.\n  Mayor Walaker was a giant in Fargo, not only in stature--he was a big \nguy--but as a leader and fighter for the city he loved. He dedicated \nhis entire life to public service, first serving in the North Dakota \nDepartment of Transportation, later joining the city of Fargo as a \ncivil engineer.\n  For 40 years, Denny has been a fixture in this growing city, from \nleading the city's flood fight in 1997 as chief operations manager for \nthe city and later as mayor. One cannot think of Fargo without thinking \nof Mayor Walaker and seeing in every corner the impact he made, whether \nit was infrastructure investment improvements to providing a strong \nfoundation for a thriving community and city, to the revitalization of \nthe city's downtown, to his focus on those within the city who are less \nfortunate.\n  He led the city through unprecedented growth while always working \ndiligently to make sure the region secured the long-term flood \nprotection that was necessary to sustain that growth. He was always \nwilling to listen and cared deeply for all the people of the city of \nFargo. The people of Fargo always came first for him, no matter what.\n  For many of us, Denny will always be remembered for leading the \ncity's flood-fighting effort, particularly in 1997 and 2009 when the \ncity of Fargo confronted a historic flood. He had keen instincts when \nit came to understanding and predicting the Red River and wasn't afraid \nto push back on the so-called experts. His calm, clear, and decisive \ndecisionmaking in 2009 when he made the decision that the city would \nnot evacuate when facing record-setting flood levels but would instead \nstay and fight together--that image of him building our city and \nbuilding our community will forever be etched in the memories and the \nminds of those of us who knew Denny.\n  However, for all of the discussion about the flood fight, there is so \nmuch more Denny did in addition to his role as chief flood-fighter, but \nmuch of it was under the radar. It was away from the spotlight.\n  Just a few weeks ago I was with the mayor in one of his last public \nappearances. It was an event where we were honored for the work we had \nboth done on affordable housing. At that event he remarked to me and \nthe others who were there how proud he was to receive that award and \nhow proud he was about the work he had done on affordable housing \nbecause, he told all of us, he wanted to make sure that Fargo was a \ncity for every citizen, that every citizen in Fargo had an opportunity \nfor a good home. He was passionate in fighting for those less \nfortunate, and his heart and his personality really were unmatched.\n  People like Mayor Walaker are the unsung heroes of our democracy. He \nstepped up to serve when his city needed him, and he was a friend and \nhero to so many.\n  A few weeks ago I was in Fargo for the College Game Day. Denny \ncouldn't make it because he was recuperating from surgery at his home. \nI had a chance to talk to him on the phone, and I was explaining the \nscene for him in downtown Fargo--the part of Fargo he had revitalized \nand nurtured back to an incredible, healthy center of activity for that \ngreat city. I was telling him how proud he would be to see not only the \ncitizens there enjoying themselves but also the work that had been done \nby the city workforce and the fact that Fargo was able to move that \ngame day effort on such short notice. I think it really is indicative \nof the history of Fargo, and that history was part of the history Denny \nbuilt.\n  He will always have a place in my heart. He will always have a place \nin the hearts of so many in Fargo and the surrounding areas and \nthroughout the State of North Dakota.\n  I love Denny. I am pretty sure he was the only public official in \nNorth Dakota who had a picture of Barack Obama on his wall. He had met \nthe\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\nPresident. He believed in a lot of what the President had said--\nobviously not on everything, but he believed in public service, and he \nbelieved in the challenges and respecting people who stepped up.\n  We mourn Denny's loss, but we celebrate his life as an incredible \nexample of a leader. He was one of a kind. I offer my sincerest \ncondolences to his wife Mary, his daughters, grandchildren, and his \nentire family. I also extend my sincerest condolences on the loss of a \ngreat mayor, a great public servant, and a great friend to a great \ncity, the city of Fargo.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Mr. President, I have only known Jay for a couple of years. When I \nfirst started, I would go home to North Dakota and people would ask me \nkind of consistently: So whom do you meet? To whom do you listen? What \nhas been a big surprise? Who are your favorite people?\n  This may come as a surprise because I didn't come with the idea that \nI would have an opportunity to work with or spend time with Senator \nRockefeller, but I said: The one person who impressed me the most when \nI first got here was Senator Jay Rockefeller.\n  For so many of us, he is a giant--not only physically.\n  They would say: What about him?\n  One of my finest moments was watching Senator Rockefeller stand and \nvisit with Barbara Mikulski. I am pretty sure she might be the shortest \nperson in the Senate, and I am pretty sure Jay might be the tallest.\n  I would say: What you don't know about Senator Rockefeller is that \nnot only in intellectual stature but in physical stature he is a giant \nof a man.\n  But it is not the intellectual stature of Senator Rockefeller that \nimpressed me. It certainly wasn't his size that impressed me. It was \nthe size of his heart and how much he cared for the people he served in \nWest Virginia.\n  I had a chance this year to travel to West Virginia and spend time \nwith the folks of his great State. As they were looking at this \ntransition, they would tell me stories about Senator Rockefeller. They \nwould tell me stories about what he meant to them and the things he had \ngone out of his way to do--things that were beyond maybe even what the \nexpectations of a populous would ever be, but Jay was there for them, \nand they knew that every day when he woke up, in his heart were the \npeople of West Virginia. I think we heard that today with his floor \nspeech, as he talked about the impact of coming to West Virginia as a \nyoung VISTA worker, the impact it had on him that changed his life and \ncreated the man we see today.\n  So I celebrate a Senator with an enormous intellect and an enormous \ncapacity for facts and data and public policy, but that wasn't what \nmade him a great Senator. What made Jay Rockefeller a great Senator was \nhis enormous heart for the people he served.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n       Enhanced Tax Incentive for Conservation Easement Donations\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I begin by echoing the wonderful \nanalysis of my colleague Senator Heitkamp relative to how much we are \nall going to miss Senator Jay Rockefeller. As she pointed out, he \nreminded us today why we all are here, and that is to try to make a \ndifference for our constituents and for the people we serve. No one did \nthat better than Jay Rockefeller. He was always a voice for those most \nin need and never stopped fighting for the people he served. We will \ncertainly miss him.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about a provision that I \nthink we need to make sure is included as we continue to negotiate and \ndebate the tax extenders package, a commonsense, bipartisan, bicameral \nprovision that enjoys a lot of support and one that I think should be \nincluded in any reform or extension effort; that is, the enhanced tax \nincentive for conservation easement donations.\n  Conservation easements are a critical component of modern-day efforts \nto preserve our outdoor treasures. That is something which means a lot \nto us in New Hampshire, where we have so many wonderful natural \nresources and historic resources, and we want to try to preserve them.\n  One of the things that conservation easements do is provide a \nflexible, voluntary, nongovernmental, and nonregulatory approach to \nprotecting our Nation's natural places. Conservation easements and tax \nincentives for their donations allow landowners to exchange development \nrights in order to protect a property's conservation values. That then \nallows them to pass on those conservation values to future generations. \nEasements keep the land in its natural state and ensure that these \noutdoor treasures aren't subdivided and exploited. Just as important, \nlands placed in conservation easements can continue to be farmed, \ngrazed, hunted, or used for outdoor recreation and wildlife \nconservation. Equally important, they remain on the tax rolls, which \nmakes a huge difference to local communities.\n  In 2006 Congress recognized the importance of promoting conservation \neasements by enacting the enhanced tax incentive for conservation \neasement donations. That was done with bipartisan, bicameral support \nbecause it is an idea that makes sense.\n  This tax incentive provided working and middle-class landowners with \nthe ability to donate their land for conservation as opposed to simply \nselling off the land to the highest bidder, allowing it to be developed \nand partitioned off. The great thing about this incentive is that it \nworked. It is directly responsible for the conservation of more than 2 \nmillion acres of our Nation's natural outdoor heritage.\n  Unfortunately, as with so many provisions in the tax extenders bill, \nthis tax incentive lapsed at the end of 2013. As a result, landowners \nwho want to donate their land for conservation but need this enhanced \ndeduction to make it work financially are left in limbo.\n  Making this incentive permanent will provide much needed certainty to \nlandowners because the decision of whether to donate conservation \neasements on land--and land is often a family's most valuable asset--\nrequires careful planning and consideration, and it often takes years \nfrom the initial conversations with the landowner before conservation \neasement is executed. Understandably, many landowners will never begin \nthis process without the assurance of a permanent incentive.\n  In New Hampshire we have seen firsthand how valuable the enhanced \nconservation easement tax credit is when it comes to making sure we are \nprotecting our special outdoor places for generations to come. For \nexample, take Henry Brooks, Jr., and his sister Linda Brown. They \ndonated two conservation easements on about 200 acres of land in \nSullivan, NH, which is down in the western part of our State in what we \ncall the Monadnock Region, not too far from the Vermont border. The \nland had been in their family since the time of the town's founding--\nover 200 years. It is open fields with expansive views all the way to \nVermont. The fields are pasture and hay lands that are used for Henry's \nbeef cattle. The forests, streams, and wetlands also provide excellent \nwildlife habitat.\n  The enhanced conservation easement tax incentive was very persuasive \nin the decision to move forward and finish the project by the end of \n2013. In particular, the ability to take that deduction over the course \nof 16 years is going to make a significant difference for Henry, who is \nreally of modest means. As his sister Linda said, the enhanced \nincentive is a win-win situation.\n  Another example that I think is significant is the Squam Lakes \nwatershed. The Squam watershed is renowned for its conservation ethos, \nand it is the only watershed that is listed on the National Register of \nHistoric Places. Organizations, such as the Squam Lake Conservation \nSociety, have used conservation easements to protect 25 percent of the \nwatershed, and, thanks to tax deductions, 91 percent of these easements \nwere donated. Think about that--25 percent of the watershed and 91 \npercent of it has been donated.\n  Projects like these in New Hampshire are great examples of the need \nto renew the enhanced conservation easement deduction. Protecting these \nspaces isn't just good for the environment. Certainly that is the case, \nbut it is also critical to New Hampshire's economy, and I know that is \ntrue in other States as well. Our economy depends on tourism, on \noutdoor\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\nrecreation. We have thousands of jobs that are created in those \nindustries that bring millions of dollars into our State, and if we can \npreserve our landscape and protect our national resources, it makes a \nhuge difference in ensuring that those industries are successful, that \ntourists want to continue to come and visit.\n\n  Right now we have families who are making decisions about what they \nare going to do about conservation easements, and they are in limbo \nbecause Congress has not yet acted on this issue. We haven't determined \nif we are going to pass that forward. So people don't know whether they \nare going to have any certainty about taking a tax deduction on a \nconservation easement. It is time for us to provide some certainty to \nencourage people to make those contributions to protect these national \ntreasures. It is important not only in New Hampshire, I am sure it is \nimportant in North Dakota and across this country.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we are continuing to look at a tax extenders \nbill, that we support this legislation that will make smart incentives \nto help our local economies grow stronger and help the middle class.\n  Thank you very much. I hope we can make some progress on this next \nweek. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Summer Mersinger\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise to recognize the end of an era in \nmy office in Washington, DC, because at the end of the year, Summer \nMersinger will be leaving my office. She has been in my office for 15 \nyears. She comes from a small town in Central South Dakota called \nOnida. The town is about an hour and a half away from where I grew up. \nOur towns are similar in size with similar backgrounds when it comes to \nthe area in which we were raised and growing up in Onida, SD. Obviously \nshe had a lot of the same experiences I did growing up in a small town. \nShe took those experiences and has used them now for the past 15 years \nin my office.\n  Before she got to my office she went to the University of Minnesota \nand got her degree there in 1999, came to Washington, DC, worked as an \nintern, and then shortly after that became a full-time employee in my \nHouse office at the time. For the past 15 years, through thick and \nthin, through the ups and downs, the good days and the bad days, Summer \nhas been the rock in our office. She has been the glue that holds \nthings together. I have described her as the center of gravity. I have \ndescribed her as a mama bear, lots of different things, but people in \nour office know she is the go-to person. If you want to get something \ndone in our office, you go through Summer.\n  So when it comes time for her to move on to a different opportunity, \nobviously, it is a time that we want to recognize and pay tribute to \nher great service in our office. Usually around here--I think most \npeople know this--it is the Members themselves, the Senators whose \nnames are in the press releases, whose names get to be on the door, but \nit is the staff who really gets things done in the Senate, and I have \nbeen very blessed and fortunate to have people such as Summer Mersinger \nwork in our office. I think of all the people who work in the Senate \nand the hard jobs they have trying to balance the hours we have to put \nin, the sacrifices that come with that, the time away from family, \nalways being on call on weekends, always having to put out fires, \nwhatever that might be--well, that is the role Summer has served in our \noffice for a very long time.\n  Not only is she very skilled at what she does, but she brings so many \nother attributes to the job. Summer is somebody who has a powerful work \nethic. She is somebody who has over the years expressed a calming \ndemeanor in our office, as somebody who always is able to deal with \npeople, all personalities, and somebody who most importantly has \nabsolute integrity. Her wise counsel is something from which I have \nbenefitted enormously over the years. One of the great attributes is \nshe is intensely loyal when I don't deserve it. She has been somebody \nwho has been an ally and I couldn't have a better ally than she.\n  So as she departs to do something else and moves on with her life, we \nwant to wish her well. I had the opportunity to see a lot of transition \nand a lot of change in her life over the years from the time she \nstarted working for me, particularly when we got to the Senate. She not \nonly worked full time but earned a law degree at the same time. She met \na great guy here in Washington, got married, and has four children. At \nthe same time she continued to work full time and handle all the \ndifficult responsibilities that come with working and leading and \nrunning a Senate office. There aren't many people who could pull that \noff, and she has tirelessly dedicated herself to public service, to \nserving the people of South Dakota, to serving the Senate and serving \nin our office. There will be a very big void indeed when she leaves.\n  We are grateful for that outstanding service and the time we had to \nwork with her. I thank her for her outstanding work for the people of \nSouth Dakota and for the Senate and for our office, but more \nimportantly for her friendship and her always wise counsel.\n  We will miss her, but we know that whatever she does, she will be out \nthere making a difference because that is the kind of person she is. So \nwe say farewell to her at the end of the year and wish her and her \nfamily well and look forward to seeing her around the neighborhood and \nmaybe even someday back in the small town of Onida, SD.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                      Secretary of Defense Nominee\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, it is widely anticipated that the \nPresident intends to nominate Dr. Ashton Carter to be the next \nSecretary of Defense, perhaps as early as tomorrow, and I welcome that \nnomination. Should Dr. Carter take over the helm at the Defense \nDepartment, it would coincide with an ominous development on a national \nsecurity issue that he and I have dealt with together in the past, and \nthat issue is the growing danger that Iran will soon be able to develop \nnuclear weapons and the inability of prolonged negotiations with Iran \nto prevent them from doing so.\n  In 2008 Ash Carter and I participated in coauthoring a report by the \nBipartisan Policy Center entitled ``Meeting the Challenge: U.S. Policy \nToward Iranian Nuclear Development.'' In that report we acknowledged \nthat Iran's nuclear program would pose ``the most significant strategic \nthreat to the United States during the next administration.'' That \ngroup, which was cochaired by former Senator Chuck Robb and myself, \nincluded many with long and well-respected credentials on foreign \npolicy matters.\n  That report also emphasized what was at stake and what the \nconsequences would be if Iran was allowed to achieve nuclear weapons \ncapability. I want to quote from what we said and concluded.\n\n       A nuclear-ready or nuclear-armed Islamic Republic ruled by \n     the clerical regime could threaten the Persian Gulf region \n     and its vast energy resources, spark nuclear proliferation \n     throughout the Middle East, inject additional volatility into \n     global energy markets, embolden extremists in the region and \n     destabilize states such as Saudi Arabia and others in the \n     region, provide nuclear technology to other radical regimes \n     and terrorists . . . and seek to make good on its threats to \n     eradicate Israel.\n\n  That is why this threat has been labeled by most in the intelligence \ncommunity, if not all, as the most significant long-term threat to the \nUnited States. This was written in 2008. Now, 6 years later into this \ncurrent administration, we can see the truth of those judgments. \nUnfortunately, what we have also seen is that this administration has \nnot dealt effectively with this growing threat.\n  In our Bipartisan Policy Center report Ash Carter and I called for \ndirect negotiations with Iran, but on the condition that these \nnegotiations were backed by strong economic sanctions and the threat of \nmilitary force as a last resort if all other efforts failed to achieve \nthe stated goal of preventing Iran from attaining the capability of \nproducing nuclear weapons. We did not come to this conclusion easily. \nWe debated it for months. We debated each\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\nphase of the potential negotiation with Iran through diplomacy, through \nthe imposition of sanctions, through the potential threat of military \nforce, and ultimately the need to use military force if we could not \nachieve the desired objective. We obviously made that the last resort, \nand only if all other efforts failed. As I said, it was written in \n2008.\n\n  Most relevant at this moment was our insistence--and I quote from the \nreport again--``that any U.S.-Iranian talks will not be open-ended, but \nwill be limited to a predetermined time period so that Tehran does not \ntry to `run out the clock.' ''\n  Our deepest concern with the failure to move forward with an ever-\nratcheting and tightening combination of diplomacy, sanctions, and \nthreat of force was that Iran would run out the clock, and in the \nmeantime, continue to spin the centrifuges and add to those methods \nwhich were producing the ability for them to obtain nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  Now, more than 6 years later, after prolonged negotiations and yet \nanother extension of talks without achieving the stated goal of ending \nthe regime's quest, it is time to reassess where we currently stand.\n  President Obama is not only ignoring the clear and present danger of \nIranian ambitions, he is abetting those ambitions by surrendering key \npositions first and then pursuing negotiations that confirm our \nweakness. For 8 years U.S. policy, backed by six United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions, insisted that Iran abandon its program to \nenrich uranium because of the mortal danger that it would arm itself \nwith nuclear weapons. That policy was discarded virtually at the start \nof the negotiations with Iran--a year and a half or so ago--indeed, \nbefore the negotiations began.\n  Although the subjects of uranium enrichment, weapons programs, \ninspections, and nuclear power are highly complex and the discussions \nhave been lengthy, they all lead now to a very simple question: How \nmuch ability will Iran have to enrich uranium and how many centrifuges \nwill it be permitted to operate in reaching its goal?\n  When the U.N. Security Council passed its first resolution demanding \nthat Iran cease enriching uranium, Iran had 800 centrifuges doing that \nillegal work. Today, after 2 years of direct negotiations on this \nspecific issue, Iran has 19,000 centrifuges. I will repeat that: After \n2 years of direct negotiations, Iran has moved from 800 centrifuges to \n19,000 centrifuges. Any negotiated agreement that gives Iran the \nability to retain so much uranium capability is completely \nunacceptable, and the Senate should prevent such failure from being \nratified or otherwise accepted by this Congress.\n  When it comes to negotiation strategy, we should learn from past \nfailures. This is not the first time we have been through something \nlike this. An instructional example comes from our experience with \nNorth Korea.\n  When I first served in the Senate, we were dealing with this very \nsubject. Starting with the so-called ``Agreed Framework'' in 1994, we \ntried to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem by cycles of \nnegotiations salted with incentives. Does that sound familiar?\n  At various times we have relieved international economic sanctions \npressure in return for promises of improved behavior from the North \nKoreans. As we pursued inconsistent and diffident strategies, the North \nKoreans responded with bouts of hostility, cynical manipulation, and \nthreats.\n  They have repeatedly tested missiles with nuclear capability, \nrevealed a vast new uranium enrichment facility previously undetected \nby the International Atomic Energy Association and our own services, \ntested nuclear weapons, intimidated and threatened their neighbors, and \ncontinued to build their nuclear weapons arsenal.\n  I distinctly remember being on this floor and questioning our ability \nto verify that the Koreans would live up to what they promised to do, \nand that was to not develop nuclear weapon capability.\n  Oh, we have this all wired in. We have their promise. We have \nprovided aid to them in the nature of food and in the nature of a \nnumber of financial incentives, and we have the verification procedures \nin place.\n  We know that none of that worked. We know we were rope-a-doped by the \nNorth Koreans, just as we are being rope-a-doped by the Iranians. We \nhave a precedent on which we ought to be basing our decisions in terms \nof how we go forward.\n  Maintaining the status quo is not the way to diffuse a critical \nthreat to our national security. This is a view, by the way, that Ash \nCarter has expressed emphatically and one of the major reasons why I \nwill so strongly urge for his confirmation to be Secretary of Defense.\n  To the contrary, Secretary Kerry, who energetically leads the current \nnegotiation strategy with Iran, should surely have learned from the \nfallacies of the North Korea agreed framework example, which was that \nstrategy's predecessor.\n  When Senator Kerry and I were both in the Senate, he strongly \nsupported the North Korea strategy and was harshly critical of the Bush \nadministration for not doing the same.\n  In March 2001, then-Senator Kerry said:\n\n       The Clinton administration left a framework on the table \n     which could, if pursued aggressively by the Bush \n     administration, go a long way toward reducing the threat \n     posed by North Korean missiles and missile exports . . . two \n     days ago Secretary of State Colin Powell stated that the Bush \n     administration would ``pick up'' where the Clinton \n     administration left off.\n\n  Secretary Kerry went on to say:\n\n       Apparently not. Yesterday, President Bush told . . . \n     President Kim . . . that the administration would not resume \n     missile talks with North Korea any time soon. I believe this \n     was a serious mistake in judgment.\n\n  Now, after the clear and massive failure of negotiations with North \nKorea, Secretary Kerry is pursuing a Groundhog Day strategy for dealing \nwith Iran. We now know for certain that North Korea was simply using \nnegotiations to lead us down that garden path to cynical noncompliance. \nSo why do Secretary Kerry and President Obama continue to believe \nblindly in hopeful talks rather than hard-edged compulsion?\n  This unguided blindness leads us to a second problem: The \nadministration has ignored not only the United Nations Security \nCouncil, but the U.S. Congress as well. The administration has been \nclear about its intention to circumvent congressional scrutiny and \nagreement of any deal because of widespread bipartisan opposition. I \nbelieve that is a serious mistake.\n  Any settlement of issues regarding Iran's nuclear program is of \nparamount importance to the security of the American people, not to \nmention the security and stability of the world. Any proposed agreement \nrequires thorough review and deliberation by this Congress. An \nagreement on an issue of such vast significance requires a bipartisan, \nbicameral consensus and mutual support and agreement by both the \nexecutive and legislative branches of government. Anything less than \nthat should not be acceptable.\n  This is the most significant national security issue of our age, and \nit is being mishandled apparently to secure a legacy for the \nadministration. Thus, it is all the more important to assert a vigorous \ncongressional role before we are burdened with a bad agreement that \ndoes little to prevent a nuclear Iran.\n  These negotiations with Iran began by yielding on the central issue. \nThey now continue, while ignoring the proper, essential role of \nCongress, and it appears they are aimed at achieving a legacy for the \nObama administration rather than enhancing national security.\n  Most serious and dangerous of all is the strategic vacuum in which \nthese Iran negotiations are taking place. Their failure will force us \nto face that void, and when we do, we must then return to the world \nthat existed before these misguided negotiations began.\n  We will have to renew and reinforce our efforts to impose crippling \nsanctions on Iran. We will have to redouble our efforts to bring our \nallies and friends along with us, preventing the carefully constructed \ninternational sanctions regimes from slipping. And now we must find \nways to limit the damage being done by an irresponsible Russia, already \nsigning deals with Iran worth billions of dollars.\n  Unfortunately, and most challenging of all, we must find a way to \nmake the threat of using military force as a last resort credible, but \nthat will not be\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\neasy. Our Nation is militarily, politically, economically, and \nemotionally exhausted by wars, and now we have been forced to embark on \nyet another.\n  Americans are justifiably repulsed by and fixated on the more \nimmediate chaos of televised beheadings. A more abstract future threat \nof a nuclear Iran is beyond the horizon of most Americans, and the \nayatollahs are counting on that. It is one of the many ways that the \nconflicts in Iraq and Syria are connected to our Iranian dilemma.\n  Coping with all of that at once is what leadership is all about. Four \nAmerican Presidents, including our current President, have declared \nthat a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran is unacceptable. I will repeat \nthat: Four American Presidents, including this current President, have \ndeclared that a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran is unacceptable.\n  To give meaning to that repeated commitment and to do whatever is \nnecessary to prevent Iran from getting that dangerous capability is the \nmost urgent matter facing the United States and international security. \nA robust uranium-enrichment industry in Iran means a capability to \nproduce nuclear weapons within an unacceptably brief amount of time.\n  The consequences of a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran are not tolerable, \nnot acceptable, and must motivate the most powerful and effective \nefforts possible to prevent it from happening. That is our challenge. \nThat is the role of the Senate. So we must insist on playing a \nsignificant role in the examination of whatever is being done and \nwhatever might be put before us so we can examine it carefully and not \nrepeat the mistakes of the past as we have with the North Koreans.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday evening Senator Inhofe and I \nannounced that we had reached an agreement with the chairman and the \nranking member of the House Armed Services Committee on a new national \ndefense authorization bill for fiscal year 2015. The text of the bill \nand report were published on the Web site of the House Rules Committee \nthat evening, and on Wednesday morning we put out a press release \ndetailing the provisions of the bill.\n  The bill passed the House earlier this afternoon by a vote of 300 to \n119, and we expect to take it up in the Senate next week.\n  Our bill includes hundreds of important provisions to authorize the \nactivities of the Department of Defense and provide for the well-being \nof our men in uniform and their families. The bill will enable the \nmilitary services to continue paying special pays and bonuses which are \nneeded for recruitment and retention of key personnel. It provides \ncontinued impact aid to support military families and local school \ndistricts. It strengthens survivor benefits for disabled children of \nservicemembers. It includes provisions addressing the employment of \nmilitary spouses, job placement for veterans, and military child \ncustody disputes. It addresses military hazing, military suicides, \npost-traumatic stress disorder, and mental health problems in the \nmilitary. And it includes 20 provisions to continue to build on the \nprogress we are starting to make in addressing the scourge of sexual \nassault in the military.\n\n  The bill provides continued funding and authorities for ongoing \noperations in Afghanistan and for our forces conducting operations \nagainst the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, so-called ISIS. As \nrequested by the administration, it authorizes the Department of \nDefense to train and equip vetted members of the moderate Syrian \nopposition and to train and equip national and local forces who are \nactively fighting ISIS in Iraq. It establishes a counterterrorism \npartnership fund to provide the administration new flexibility in \naddressing emerging terrorist threats around the world.\n  In addition, the bill extends the Afghanistan Special Immigrant Visa \nProgram, providing for 4,000 new visas, and addresses a legal glitch \nthat precluded members of the ruling parties in Kurdistan from \nreceiving visas under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  Our bill takes steps to respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine by \nauthorizing $1 billion for a European reassurance initiative to enhance \nthe U.S. military presence in Europe and build partner capacity to \nrespond to security threats of which no less than $75 million would be \ncommitted for activities and assistance to support Ukraine, by \nrequiring a review of the U.S. and NATO force posture, readiness, and \ncontingency plans in Europe, and by expressing support for both lethal \nand nonlethal military assistance to Ukraine.\n  The bill adds hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to improve \nthe readiness of our Armed Forces across all branches--Active, Guard, \nand Reserve--to help blunt some of the negative effects of \nsequestration. It includes provisions addressing the threat of cyber \nwarfare, providing woman-owned small businesses the same sole-source \ncontracting authority that is already available to other categories of \nsmall businesses, expanding the No Contracting With the Enemy Act to \nall government agencies, and requiring governmentwide reform of \ninformation technology acquisition. And although we were unable to \nbring the Senate-reported bill--a bill that was reported by our \ncommittee--to the floor for amendment, we established an informal \nclearing process, pursuant to which we were able to clear 44 Senate \namendments--roughly an equal number on each side of the aisle--and to \ninclude them in our new bill.\n  When the bill comes to the floor, I will have a lot more to say about \nsome of the more difficult issues in the bill, such as provisions \naddressing military compensation reform, Army force structure, and \nGuantanamo detainees, as well as the so-called lands package that we \nincluded in our bill based on a bipartisan, bicameral request of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction.\n  I hope our colleagues will take the opportunity to review our bill. \nIt is obviously a long bill. There are going to be enough days, we \nbelieve, to review the bill so our colleagues can have a fair \nopportunity to see what is in our bill. We are proud of the bill. We \nthink it is a good bill. It would be the 42nd or 43rd straight year we \nwill have passed a military authorization bill, a Defense authorization \nbill, if we are able to pass the bill next week.\n  I hope our colleagues will take the opportunity over the next few \ndays to review the bill and hopefully give it the kind of broad support \nit deserves and that it received today in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6341-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have long worked to pass legislation to \nbring additional transparency and accountability to the government. I \ndo so again today by calling on all Senators to support the Death in \nCustody Reporting Act, a bill that has moved multiple times through the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and should pass the Senate without further \ndelay.\n  This is about an open and fair government. The Death in Custody \nReporting Act requires that local and Federal law enforcement officials \nreport deaths that occur while people are held in their custody, \nincluding those that occur during arrest. Nothing more. Just yesterday \nthe Wall Street Journal reported that hundreds of police-related deaths \nare unaccounted for in Federal statistics. I ask that the article, \n``Hundreds of Police Killings Are\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nUncounted in Federal Stats,'' be made part of the Record. The details \nof the article are unacceptable. The Justice Department should have an \nopportunity to analyze the data and see what we can learn from it. And \nthe American people deserve the same.\n  This important opportunity for needed transparency comes at a time \nwhen many Americans are losing faith in our justice system. We are \nhaving an important conversation about the loss of human life in \ncommunities across the country. Here we have an opportunity to instill \nsome measure of accountability, and hopefully begin to restore some \nmeasure of trust in these communities.\n  This legislation, sponsored by Congressman Bobby Scott, \noverwhelmingly passed the House last year in a bipartisan vote. We \nreported the bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a similarly \nstrong bipartisan vote, with Ranking Member Grassley speaking in strong \nsupport of the legislation. Currently, every single Senate Democrat is \nin support of its passage, but a handful of Senate Republicans are not \nyet convinced. It is my hope that they soon reconsider, and we can send \nthis legislation to the President for signature without delay. The \nAmerican people would expect as much.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 3, 2014]\n\n       Hundreds of Police Killings Are Uncounted in Federal Stats\n\n\n      FBI Data Differs from Local Counts on Justifiable Homicides\n\n                    (By Rob Barry and Coulter Jones)\n\n       Washington--When 24-year-old Albert Jermaine Payton wielded \n     a knife in front of the police in this city's southeast \n     corner, officers opened fire and killed him.\n       Yet according to national statistics intended to track \n     police killings, Mr. Payton's death in August 2012 never \n     happened. It is one of hundreds of homicides by law-\n     enforcement agencies between 2007 and 2012 that aren't \n     included in records kept by the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation.\n       A Wall Street Journal analysis of the latest data from 105 \n     of the country's largest police agencies found more than 550 \n     police killings during those years were missing from the \n     national tally or, in a few dozen cases, not attributed to \n     the agency involved. The result: It is nearly impossible to \n     determine how many people are killed by the police each year.\n       Public demands for transparency on such killings have \n     increased since the August shooting death of 18-year-old \n     Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Mo. The Ferguson Police \n     Department has reported to the FBI one justifiable homicide \n     by police between 1976 and 2012.\n       Law-enforcement experts long have lamented the lack of \n     information about killings by police. ``When cops are killed, \n     there is a very careful account and there's a national \n     database,'' said Jeffrey Fagan, a law professor at Columbia \n     University. ``Why not the other side of the ledger?''\n       Police can use data about killings to improve tactics, \n     particularly when dealing with people who are mentally ill, \n     said Paco Balderrama, a spokesman for the Oklahoma City \n     Police Department. ``It's great to recognize that, because 30 \n     years ago we used to not do that. We used to just show up and \n     handle the situation.''\n       Three sources of information about deaths caused by \n     police--the FBI numbers, figures from the Centers for Disease \n     Control and data at the Bureau of Justice Statistics--differ \n     from one another widely in any given year or state, according \n     to a 2012 report by David Klinger, a criminologist with the \n     University of Missouri-St. Louis and a onetime police \n     officer.\n       To analyze the accuracy of the FBI data, the Journal \n     requested internal records on killings by officers from the \n     nation's 110 largest police departments. One-hundred-five of \n     them provided figures.\n       Those internal figures show at least 1,800 police killings \n     in those 105 departments between 2007 and 2012, about 45% \n     more than the FBI's tally for justifiable homicides in those \n     departments' jurisdictions, which was 1,242, according to the \n     Journal's analysis. Nearly all police killings are deemed by \n     the departments or other authorities to be justifiable.\n       The full national scope of the underreporting can't be \n     quantified. In the period analyzed by the Journal, 753 police \n     entities reported about 2,400 killings by police. The large \n     majority of the nation's roughly 18,000 law-enforcement \n     agencies didn't report any. ``Does the FBI know every agency \n     in the U.S. that could report but has chosen not to? The \n     answer is no,'' said Alexia Cooper, a statistician with the \n     Bureau of Justice Statistics who studies the FBI's data. \n     ``What we know is that some places have chosen not to report \n     these, for whatever reason.''\n       FBI spokesman Stephen G. Fischer said the agency uses \n     ``established statistical methodologies and norms'' when \n     reviewing data submitted by agencies. FBI staffers check the \n     information, then ask agencies ``to correct or verify \n     questionable data,'' he said.\n       The reports to the FBI are part of its uniform crime \n     reporting program. Local law-enforcement agencies aren't \n     required to participate. Some localities turn over crime \n     statistics, but not detailed records describing each \n     homicide, which is the only way particular kinds of killings, \n     including those by police, are tracked by the FBI. The \n     records, which are supposed to document every homicide, are \n     sent from local police agencies to state reporting bodies, \n     which forward the data to the FBI.\n       The Journal's analysis identified several holes in the FBI \n     data.\n       Justifiable police homicides from 35 of the 105 large \n     agencies contacted by the Journal didn't appear in the FBI \n     records at all. Some agencies said they didn't view \n     justifiable homicides by law-enforcement officers as events \n     that should be reported. The Fairfax County Police Department \n     in Virginia, for example, said it didn't consider such cases \n     to be an ``actual offense,'' and thus doesn't report them to \n     the FBI.\n       For 28 of the remaining 70 agencies, the FBI was missing \n     records of police killings in at least one year. Two \n     departments said their officers didn't kill anyone during the \n     period analyzed by the Journal.\n       About a dozen agencies said their police-homicides tallies \n     didn't match the FBI's because of a quirk in the reporting \n     requirements: Incidents are supposed to be reported by the \n     jurisdiction where the event occurred, even if the officer \n     involved was from elsewhere. For example, the California \n     Highway Patrol said there were 16 instances in which one of \n     its officers killed someone in a city or other local \n     jurisdiction responsible for reporting the death to the FBI. \n     In some instances reviewed by the Journal, an agency believed \n     its officers' justifiable homicides had been reported by \n     other departments, but they hadn't.\n       Also missing from the FBI data are killings involving \n     federal officers.\n       Police in Washington, D.C., didn't report to the FBI \n     details about any homicides for an entire decade beginning \n     with 1998--the year the Washington Post found the city had \n     one of the highest rates of officer-involved killings in the \n     country. In 2011, the agency reported five killings by \n     police. In 2012, the year Mr. Payton was killed, there are \n     again no records on homicides from the agency.\n       D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said she \n     doesn't know why the agency stopped reporting the numbers in \n     1998. ``I wasn't the chief and had no role in decision \n     making'' back then, said Ms. Lanier, who was a captain at the \n     time. When she took over in 2007, she said, reporting the \n     statistics ``was a nightmare and a very tedious process.''\n       Ms. Lanier said her agency resumed its reports in 2009. In \n     2012, the agency turned over the detailed homicide records, \n     she said, but the data had an error in it and was rejected by \n     the FBI. She referred questions about why the department \n     stopped reporting homicides in 1998 to former Chief Charles \n     H. Ramsey, now head of the Philadelphia Police Department. \n     Mr. Ramsey declined to comment.\n       In recent years, police departments have tried to rely more \n     on statistics to develop better tactics. ``You want to get \n     the data right,'' said Mike McCabe, the undersheriff of the \n     Oakland County Sheriff's Office in Michigan. It is ``really \n     important in terms of how you deploy your resources.''\n       A total of 100 agencies provided the Journal with numbers \n     of people killed by police each year from 2007 through 2012; \n     five more provided statistics for some years. Several, \n     including the police departments in New York City, Los \n     Angeles, Philadelphia and Austin, Texas, post detailed use-\n     of-force reports online.\n       Five of the 110 agencies the Journal contacted, including \n     the Michigan State Police, didn't provide internal figures. A \n     spokeswoman for the Michigan State Police said the agency had \n     records of police shootings, but ``not in tally form.''\n       Big increases in the numbers of officer-involved killings \n     can be a red flag about problems inside a police department, \n     said Mike White, a criminologist at Arizona State University. \n     ``Sometimes that can be tied to poor leadership and problems \n     with accountability,'' he said.\n       The FBI has almost no records of police shootings from \n     departments in three of the most populous states in the \n     country--Florida, New York and Illinois.\n       In Florida, available reports from the Florida Department \n     of Law Enforcement don't conform to FBI requirements and \n     haven't been included in the national tally since 1996. A \n     spokeswoman for the state agency said in an email that \n     Florida was ``unable'' to meet the FBI's reporting \n     requirements because its tracking software was outdated.\n       New York revamped its reporting system in 2002 and 2006, \n     but isn't able to track information about justifiable police \n     homicides, said a spokeswoman for the New York State Division \n     of Criminal Justice Services. She said the agency was \n     ``looking to modify our technology so we can reflect these \n     numbers.''\n       In 1987, a commission created by then- Governor Mario Cuomo \n     to investigate abuse of force by police found that New York's \n     reports to the FBI were ``inadequate and incomplete,'' and \n     urged reforms to ``hold government accountable for the use of \n     force.'' The spokeswoman for the state criminal-justice \n     agency said it isn't clear what the agency did in response \n     back then.\n       Illinois only began reporting crime statistics to the FBI \n     in 2010 and hasn't phased in\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\n     the detailed homicide reports. ``We cannot begin adding \n     additional pieces because we are newcomers to the federal \n     program,'' said Tern Hickman, director of the Illinois State \n     Police's crime-reporting program. Two agencies in Illinois \n     deliver data to the FBI: Chicago and Rockford.\n       In Washington, D.C., councilman Tommy Wells held two \n     hearings this fall on police oversight. He said he was \n     surprised that the department hadn't reported details of \n     police killings to the FBI. ``That should not be a \n     challenge,'' he said.\n       More than two years after the knife-carrying Mr. Payton was \n     shot and killed by D.C. police, his mother, who witnessed the \n     killing, said she is still looking for answers. Helena \n     Payton, 59, said her son had many interactions with local \n     police because of what she said was his mental illness. ``All \n     the cops in the Seventh District knew him, just about,'' she \n     said.\n       The officers who arrived that Friday afternoon in August, \n     in response to a call from Mr. Payton's girlfriend, had never \n     dealt with her son, she said. According to Ms. Payton, her \n     son walked outside holding a small utility knife. As he \n     approached the officers, they fired dozens of bullets at him, \n     she said. He died soon after.\n       The U.S. attorney's office is reviewing the incident, as is \n     customary in all police shootings in Washington. A spokesman \n     for the office declined to comment on the status of the case. \n     The Washington police department, citing the continuing \n     investigation, declined to provide the officers' names, a \n     narrative of what happened, or basic information usually \n     included in the reports to the FBI, such as the number of \n     officers involved in the shooting.\n       The officers involved are back on duty, according to D.C. \n     authorities, but the case isn't closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6343-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Freedom of Information Act is one of \nour Nation's most important laws. James Madison said the people ``must \narm themselves with the power knowledge gives.'' For nearly 50 years, \nFOIA has given Americans a way to access government information \nensuring their right to know what their government doing. The FOIA \nImprovement Act advances this fundamental democratic principle. It is \nwhy I urge all Senators to support the FOIA Improvement Act of 2014, \nwithout delay.\n  This legislation builds on what the President laid out in his \nhistoric Executive order in 2009 by requiring Federal agencies to adopt \na ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of \ngovernment information under FOIA. Prioritizing the people's interest \nin what their government is doing, our bill will reduce the overuse of \nexemptions to withhold information where there is no foreseeable harm. \nIt will make information available for public inspection and frequently \nrequested documents available online. It will provide the Office of \nGovernment Information Services, OGIS, with additional independence and \nauthority to carry out its work. I believe this legislation reaffirms \nthe fundamental premise of FOIA, that government information belongs to \nall Americans.\n  Supporting these commonsense reforms will help open the government to \nthe 300 million Americans it serves. The bill is supported by more than \n70 public interest groups that advocate for government transparency. \nThe Sunshine in Government Initiative, said the Leahy-Cornyn bill \n``strengthens government transparency by limiting the ability of \nagencies to hide decades old documents from the public.'' At the \nJudiciary Committee's business meeting to consider this legislation, \nwhich was reported to the full Senate with unanimous support, Ranking \nMember Grassley said the FOIA Improvement Act ``opens wide the curtains \nand provides more sunlight on the Federal government.'' Senator Cornyn, \nmy partner for many years on government transparency, noted our \nbipartisan efforts ``to open up the government and make it more \nconsumer and customer friendly.'' I thank both Senators for their work \non this legislation.\n  We often talk about the need for government transparency, and many \nalso note how rare it is that Democrats and Republicans can come \ntogether on any legislation. We have accomplished both with the FOIA \nImprovement Act. It was drafted in a bipartisan fashion after a long \nand thoughtful process of consultation. This week, we can pass this \nbill in the Senate and send it over to the House, where I am confident \nthat it will pass, and send it to the President to sign before the end \nof the year. There is no reason to delay this legislation, which has \nbroad support from a range of stakeholders, costs very little to \nimplement and will improve access to government for all Americans. I \nurge the Senate to pass the FOIA Improvement Act now, without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6343-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6343-S6345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTES TO JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Scripture tells us that to those whom much \nis given, much is required. My friend, Senator Jay Rockefeller, can \nrest well knowing that he has passed that biblical test.\n  John Davison Rockefeller, IV, is the eldest son of the eldest son of \nthe eldest son of the founder of Standard Oil--America's first \nbillionaire. Senator Rockefeller grew up amid wealth in Manhattan and \nWestchester County, NY. He prepped at Exeter and graduated from \nHarvard. He was destined for a life of comfort and privilege far \nremoved from the struggle of the poor. But this man, this Rockefeller, \nconsciously chose a different path in life. And he has spent 50 years--\ntwo-thirds of his life--working to try to make life better for people \nwho too often have precious little.\n  He has been a Member of this Senate for 30 years. You can see his \nlegacy throughout West Virginia and across America. You can see it in \nchildren who have better schools, miners who have safer working \nconditions and seniors who have retired with greater dignity. You can \nsee his legacy in the 8 million American children who receive health \ncare through CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, which Jay \nRockefeller authored.\n  You can see his formidable legacy in the additional millions of \nAmericans who--because of the Affordable Care Act--now have reliable \nhealth insurance, many of them for the first time in their lives. No \none--no one--in this Senate has worked longer than he for affordable \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  Unlike some Senators, Jay Rockefeller did not grow up dreaming of \nbeing a Senator. As a young man at Harvard, he had planned a career in \ndiplomacy, focusing on Asia. He even took time off from college to live \nfor a while in Japan. But something momentous happened when he \ngraduated from college in 1961. America had just elected a hopeful, \nyoung President who made Americans believe, as Senator Rockefeller \nwould later say, ``that America could achieve anything.''\n  Senator Rockefeller called his father and his Uncle Nelson, then the \nGovernor of New York, to let them know he had switched from Rockefeller \nRepublican to Kennedy Democrat. The family took the news surprisingly \nwell.\n  Soon after, Senator Rockefeller was asked by Robert Kennedy to help \nestablish the Peace Corps; he worked for 2 years as a chief assistant \nto Sargent Shriver, the first Peace Corps director.\n  In 1964 a friend told him that he did not need to travel halfway \naround the world to help people in need. There were people here in \nAmerica, in his friend's home State of West Virginia, living on the \noutskirts of hope. So Jay Rockefeller asked Bobby Kennedy to send him \nto West Virginia as a volunteer for VISTA, the precursor to Americorps.\n  He planned to spend a year in West Virginia. He has never left.\n  At age 27, in the tiny Appalachian coal-mining town of Emmons, WV--\npopulation 346--Jay Rockefeller discovered his defining purpose. He saw \nthat people working together and a caring government could transform \nlives and communities for the better.\n  In 1966, he was elected to West Virginia's House of Delegates.\n  In 1968 he was running for West Virginia secretary of state when his \nlast great hero, Bobby Kennedy, was murdered. His Uncle Nelson, \nGovernor of New York, offered repeatedly to appoint his nephew to fill \nout Senator Kennedy's term in the U.S. Senate--but Jay Rockefeller \nrefused. He told his uncle that if he were going to serve in this \nSenate, he wanted to earn his seat.\n  He won that race for secretary of state and went on to serve two \nterms as West Virginia's Governor.\n  In 30 years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Rockefeller has been a \npassionate advocate for his State, for America's children, for seniors, \ncoal\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nminers and others. He not only earned his seat in this body, he \ndistinguished it with his thoughtful, compassionate, dedicated service.\n  Five years ago, during a late-night Senate Finance Committee markup \nof the bill that would become the Affordable Care Act, Senator \nRockefeller recalled some of the people from that little mining town of \nEmmons, WV, who he met 50 years ago. It was close to midnight on a \nFriday night. His voice broke with emotion as he spoke about the \nhardships and unfairness that pervaded the lives of many of the people \nin Emmons. He also spoke about the hope that good government programs, \nlike Medicare and Medicaid, had brought to their lives.\n  He said that he had kept a journal during his VISTA years in Emmons \nand written detailed notes in it each night. He said that, in 43 years, \nhe had never been able to bring himself to open that book. It was too \npainful to look back.\n  When Senator Rockefeller looks back on his years in the Senate, I \nhope that he will feel a deserved sense of pride in the great and \npositive changes he helped make possible during his time here. I wish \nhim, his wonderful and accomplished wife Sharon--the daughter of former \nIllinois Senator Charles Percy--and their family all the best in their \nfuture endeavors.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in his three decades in the Senate, Jay \nRockefeller established a strong reputation as a leader who offered \ninnovative, common-sense solutions. He has served the people of West \nVirginia and of America with distinction. To me, he has been an admired \ncolleague. He will always be a good friend.\n  To fully understand Senator Rockefeller's dedication during his 30 \nyears of service in the Senate, it is necessary to go back 50 years, to \n1964, when he travelled to West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer. Like \nMaine, West Virginia is a large rural state with many low-income \nresidents and an aging population. From strengthening our rural \nhospitals to fighting the scourge of prescription drug abuse, I have \nbeen fortunate to work with a leader who sees access to affordable, \nquality health care not as just a series of issues to address but as \nhis life's work.\n  One of our greatest achievements together was the inclusion of our \nlanguage in the 2003 tax bill to provide temporary, targeted fiscal \nrelief to the States--which, at the time, were awash in red ink due to \na severe economic downturn driven in large part by the terrorist \nattacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Senator Rockefeller and I worked with then-\nSenator Ben Nelson on legislation to provide $20 billion in short-term \nfiscal relief to States, half of which was used to provide health \ninsurance to low-income citizens through the Medicaid program. In \nSenator Rockefeller's words, ``No government program more fully \nembodies our nation's tradition of community and mutual obligation than \nMedicaid,'' and he has consistently demonstrated national leadership to \nprovide essential health care services to the most vulnerable among us.\n  As co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I \nhave greatly appreciated Senator Rockefeller's leadership on \nlegislative initiatives to combat Alzheimer's, as well as the \ncontributions the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute makes \nto our understanding and eventual conquest of this devastating illness.\n  From VISTA volunteer to governor and senator, Senator Rockefeller has \ndevoted a half-century of intellect, energy, and compassion to others. \nThere is no better way to sum up his contributions than the words the \nSenator himself chose when he announced his retirement: ``Public \nservice demands and very much deserves nothing less than every single \nthing that you have to bring to bear.'' That is precisely what Senator \nJay Rockefeller has given his State and our country, and I thank him \nfor his commitment, integrity, and friendship.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, It is one of the Senate's great traditions \nthat each retiring Senator is given some time on the floor to share \nwith us what they have learned during their service in the Senate and \ntheir thoughts about our future as a Nation as the chapter of this \ngreat adventure in their life comes to a close. Then, we, their \ncolleagues, take a moment to share with them what we have learned from \nthem from their service in the Senate and what lessons we will take \nwith us in the days and months to come from our work together here in \nthe Capitol.\n  That is why I greatly appreciate having the opportunity to be here \nfor Jay's final speech on the Senate floor. It is one of those moments \nthat I will long remember, another moment in which Jay has not only \nbeen a witness to our Nation's history, but in this case, it's another \ntime when he has written it with his well-chosen words.\n  This moment is one of those I call an instant replay memory. It means \nso much to me because I have known Jay Rockefeller for a longer time \nthan I have known any other member of the Senate. In fact, when we \nfirst met, serving in Washington, DC, here in the Senate, was the \nfurthest thing from our minds.\n  When I first had the chance to get to know Jay he was the governor of \nWest Virginia and I was the mayor of Gillette. Coal was a great part of \nthe day-to-day life of my hometown and his home State and together we \nwere serving on the Energy Council. I remember when Jay came to \nGillette for a visit. I had the chance to give him a tour of the mines \nof the Gillette area. As we were traveling around the site Jay said to \nme, ``You don't mine coal. You just back up the trains and load them \nup!'' I knew immediately what point he was making about the difference \nbetween the mines of Gillette and the mines of West Virginia. While the \npeople of my State were working to keep up coal production by removing \nthe surface coal facing one set of hazards, West Virginia miners were \nheading deep into the earth to face a different kind of challenge.\n  Make no mistake, mining is both a difficult and a dangerous \noccupation for all who have dedicated their lives to working the mines. \nIt is labor intensive and every miner who makes it down the shafts to \nbegin work knows there is always a chance they might not be coming home \nagain.\n  It was a lesson we were reminded of in 2006 when the mine tragedies \noccurred at the Alma and Sago mines in West Virginia. Those were \ndifficult days for his State. Jay's leadership came to the front as we \nwent as a delegation to console the families of those miners from the \nSago mines who had lost their lives and listened to their concerns. \nThey shared their great loss with us, but as they did there was another \nmessage that seemed to come to us from all those with whom we spoke--\n``Don't let this happen to another family.'' It was clear. Something \nneeded to be done to bring mine safety up to more modern standards. \nAfter meeting with the families we returned to Washington committed to \nget something done to honor the memory of those lost miners and make \nmining a safer occupation. As I thought about the beginnings of a \nlegislative response to this issue, I remembered Jay's remarks to me \nthat day in Gillette as he pointed out the different mining standards \nand the need for different approaches to mining safety. It was clear \nthat a safety policy for our Nation's mines would have to address every \nfacet of the industry and bring more modern technologies to accident \nprevention and rescue efforts.\n  Soon after we returned from West Virginia the entire delegation \njoined together to begin the work that needed to be done to minimize \nthe danger and increase our ability to respond whenever a problem or \nhazard threatened the miners. The result was the Mine Improvement and \nNew Emergency Response (MINER) Act. It was the first major advance in \nmining safety that had been legislated in 30 years. That law will \nalways be remembered as a part of Jay's legacy of service to the people \nof West Virginia. It was a change in our mining communities and \nbusinesses that will continue to have an impact in the years to come in \nour ability to protect the lives of miners all over this Nation. It is \nalso a warning--as use of coal plunges, there is less incentive for \nsafety inventors.\n  That is just one moment in which Jay made a difference in the present \nand future of our nation. If you look at Jay's impressive legislative \nrecord throughout his career you will note that he has been productive \nand effective in promoting his legislative agenda no matter which party \nwas in control of the Congress. That is because\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\nJay has always been willing to work with members from both sides of the \naisle and all sides of an issue. That is why he has been able to \naccomplish so very much for West Virginia and the Nation.\n  As we have heard, Jay has quite a remarkable story to tell. It truly \nbegan years ago when a younger--but equally committed--Jay Rockefeller \ncame to work in a small town in West Virginia as a part of the VISTA \nprogram. The plan was for him to work with the people of the area for \nabout a year. As the old adage says so well, ``God had other plans.'' \nThat experience changed his life and his goals for the future. It led \nhim to run for office and then progress in opportunity and service to \nthe people of West Virginia as he worked his way to the United States \nSenate and this moment on the Senate Floor.\n  So, that is what I have learned from you, Jay. As I mentioned, there \nare times when we are sure what we want to do with our lives, but ``God \nhas other plans'' which often leads to something better for us and the \nworld around us than what we were planning on. If Jay hadn't made that \ndecision back when he first arrived in West Virginia to do whatever he \ncould to make life better for the people of that State it might never \nhave been accomplished quite the way he has been able to do it. I have \nalways suspected that God gives us all a mission in life, a chance to \nrespond to a higher calling and make that inspired moment the beginning \nof our life's work. Jay Rockefeller did that and that is the lesson I \nhave learned from him.\n  Thanks for your service in the Senate, Jay, and for all you have done \nfor West Virginia and our Nation. Thanks, too, for your friendship. \nFortunately, you will never be more than a phone call away. Keep in \ntouch. Your comments, suggestions and West Virginia common sense ideas \nwill always be welcome. Diana joins in sending our best wishes to you. \nWe will look forward to seeing you in the days and months to come.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today we honor the distinguished career \nof my dear friend and colleague, Senator Jay Rockefeller of West \nVirginia.\n  As a young man, with all his talents--and coming from a prominent \nfamily--there were many things Jay Rockefeller could have done with his \nlife.\n  His choice says more about him than any speech in the Senate ever \ncould: He chose to devote himself to serving others.\n  So he volunteered for the Peace Corps, and then the AmeriCorps VISTA \nprogram, which brought him to the small mining town of Emmons, WV.\n  That is where he discovered the purpose that would define his \ncareer--and his life.\n  From that day forward, he took a personal stake in the issues that \naffected West Virginians.\n  That passion became stronger as he climbed the ranks of government, \nfrom Secretary of State, to Governor, and finally to U.S. Senator. \nThrough it all, he remained grounded by a sensibility of what was best \nfor the people he met in Emmons--and throughout the Mountain State.\n  He met West Virginians who could not afford basic health care--and so \nSenator Rockefeller became a champion for reform that made health care \na right, not a privilege.\n  He met West Virginians who were hurt in mining accidents, or made ill \nfrom the air they breathed, and he fought for reforms that improved \ntheir safety.\n  He has always understood that our Nation is best when we have jobs \nthat make the middle class strong, like manufacturing. The coal, steel \nand chemical industries in West Virginia have all relied on his \nsupport.\n  He believed that government should fight for those who were least \nable to fight for themselves.\n  This compelled him to go to work on behalf of children whose families \ndid not qualify for Medicaid--and yet could not afford private \ninsurance. In 1997, he was a leader in creating the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, known as CHIP, and ever since, those children would \nnot be allowed to slip through the cracks in our health care system.\n  Senator Rockefeller's impulse to speak up for those who did not have \na voice led him to seek improvements for the care of foster children, \nworking to expand incentives for parents to adopt so that foster \nchildren could have a permanent home.\n  On the other end of the spectrum, he was compelled to fight to keep \nMedicare strong, so that it had the funding it needed to make good on \nits promise to our Nation's seniors. He was committed to making sure \nthat all safety net programs stayed true to their founding principles, \nwhich is why he has resisted efforts to privatize Social Security and \npromoted programs that increase seniors' access to affordable \nprescription drugs.\n  Even as he tackled the tough issues, Senator Rockefeller's charm and \nsincerity were key to bridging partisan gaps and building consensus \nnecessary to get bills passed.\n  Senator Rockefeller leaves the Senate, after a distinguished career. \nFortunately for us, his legacy of compassionate and conscientious \nservice will endure long into the future.\n  I know how hard it is for Senator Rockefeller to leave this Chamber. \nI hope he knows that it is hard for us to watch him go.\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller, for his tireless service to this \ncountry, and for his faithful service to the people of West Virginia.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller's nearly 50 years of \npublic service has left West Virginia and our country a better place. \nWhether it is promoting health care, education, economic growth, or \nveterans, Senator Rockefeller has led the way, acting to improve the \nlives of hardworking Americans.\n  When it comes to protecting consumers and children, Senator \nRockefeller has been a legislative partner and a national leader. I \nwant to especially point out his tireless efforts to increase \neducational opportunities for children around the country.\n  The E-Rate has proved essential and exceptional in linking up schools \nand libraries to the Internet. The E-Rate has democratized access to \nbrighter futures and better technology. The E-Rate is the only \ntechnology that has been deployed as fast in poor neighborhoods as it \nhas in rich ones.\n  Chairman Rockefeller, your legacy will live on for decades to come. \nWhether in rural areas, or urban ones, affluent, or low-income \ncommunities, all corners of our great Nation will continue to feel your \nimpact.\n  Finally, I want to personally thank you for your friendship \nthroughout my tenure in Congress.\n  These walls will feel emptier without you next year.\n  I wish you, your wife Sharon, and the rest of your family many more \nyears of fulfillment in your next endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6345-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6345-S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE AGAINST ISRAEL MUST BE CHALLENGED\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as we hope for peace in the Middle East, \nsome parties in the region are making peace less likely by inciting \nviolence against Israel. It is imperative to recognize these words and \nactions for the poisons they are to achieving peace. An excellent \nNovember 23, 2014, opinion piece by Jeffrey Robbins in the Boston \nHerald entitled ``U.S. mute as Abbas incites violence'' articulates why \nsilence is the wrong response to the anti-Israeli rhetoric and ideology \nthat encourage further violence and terror. Jeff is a former delegate \nfrom the United States to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, \nand I believe my colleagues and the American people would benefit from \nreading the entire piece, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Boston Herald, Nov. 23, 2014]\n\n              Robbins: U.S. Mute as Abbas Incites Violence\n\n                           (By Jeff Robbins)\n\n       At a meeting in Jerusalem last December, a State Department \n     official was asked about the unremitting anti-Semitism \n     emanating from Palestinian officials, their continuing \n     celebration of the murderers of Israeli civilians and what \n     the United States was doing about it. It was ``a challenge,'' \n     she said, adding that it was ``our position'' that \n     Palestinian incitement of violence was ``unhelpful'' to \n     peace. Beyond this banality, she had nothing to offer.\n       This week's massacre of worshippers in a Jerusalem \n     synagogue--following the Palestinian murders of Israelis in \n     recent days by\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\n     stabbing them and by running them over--raises yet again the \n     disquieting question: has the Obama administration's \n     fecklessness about confronting Palestinian incitement of \n     terror served to enable it?\n       In the last few weeks alone, the Palestinian Authority has \n     posted cartoons of an Israeli pulling down his pants and \n     preparing to ``rape'' an Arab woman representing a Muslim \n     holy site. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas praised the \n     Palestinian shot while attempting to assassinate an Israeli \n     as a ``martyr'' who was destined for heaven. A new hit song \n     on Palestinian social media calls for listeners to ``destroy, \n     annihilate [and] blow up'' Israelis. Al-Quds University has \n     created the ``Martyr Ibrahim Al-Akhari Tournament'' to honor \n     the man who recently murdered two Israelis and injured 13 \n     others by running them over with his car.\n       Despite the fact that American taxpayers provide $500 \n     million to the Palestinian Authority annually, the Obama \n     administration has failed to use that leverage to pressure \n     the recipients of American aid to stop its incitement. Though \n     then-U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton warned back in 2007 of the \n     need to ``stop the propaganda to which Palestinian children \n     are being exposed,'' the administration has declined to \n     demand that the Palestinians cut it out.\n       It is bad enough that the president has not lifted a finger \n     to pressure the Palestinian Authority to put an end to \n     incitement to murder. Even worse, his administration has \n     conducted itself in a way which, however unintended it may \n     be, has effectively green-lighted anti-Israelism of the most \n     vicious sort--which in turn fuels the kind of violence that \n     has left European Jews fearful for their lives and Israelis \n     reeling.\n       This has included years of publicly derisive treatment of \n     Israel that has conveyed to Israel's enemies and others that \n     it stands alone, encouraging the conclusion that attacks on \n     Israel--political and physical--have no consequences as far \n     as the United States is concerned.\n       Earlier this month the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, told the Carnegie Council for \n     Ethics in International Affairs that Israel deserved credit \n     for having gone to ``extraordinary lengths to limit \n     collateral damage and civilian casualties'' in trying to \n     defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza. Dempsey's \n     praise placed the administration's scornful, damaging \n     criticism of what were obviously unintended deaths of \n     civilians in Gaza during this summer's wholly defensive war \n     in stark relief.\n       Whether by giving interviews witheringly critical of \n     Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at particularly \n     sensitive moments or by using obscenities to castigate him, \n     the White House has encouraged the impression that Israel is \n     a fair target for those who wish it ill.\n       The administration's scornful treatment of Israel has \n     registered deeply with Israel's enemies, who have been \n     encouraged to believe that America's ally is being cut loose. \n     And it has registered with particular force in the Middle \n     East, where the intensity of anti-Semitic incitement has \n     grown steadily.\n       No serious person can claim that the administration wants \n     an upsurge of terror. But it is hard to deny that it bears a \n     share of responsibility for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6346-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE ELIJAH MOMENT CAMPAIGN\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we have recently returned from \nthe Thanksgiving holiday, when Americans from all walks of life come \ntogether with family and friends to express gratitude for our good \nfortune and great blessings. The weekend following Thanksgiving was \ndevoted by many to holiday shopping--a good opportunity to support \nlocal businesses but also too often a spectacle of commercialization \nthat threatens to obscure the true meaning of the holiday season.\n  Today, I would like to honor the work of two Connecticut community \nleaders for their laudable efforts to remind us of the holiday's true \nmeaning. Rabbi Daniel Cohen of Congregation Agudath Sholom in Stamford \nand Pastor Greg Doll of Noroton Presbyterian Church in Darien have \ntogether launched the Elijah Moment Campaign. Named after a figure in \nJewish tradition who appears spontaneously to help those in need, this \ninterfaith campaign seeks to encourage simple acts of kindness between \nfriends and strangers alike. Each recipient of an act of generosity \ngoes on to ``pay it forward'' by helping someone else. Even seemingly \nminor gifts like buying a stranger's cup of coffee, as occurred en \nmasse during a campaign-organized kindness event at a Stamford \nStarbucks last week, can motivate significant acts of charity and \npromote a prevailing spirit of benevolence.\n  I am grateful to Rabbi Cohen and Pastor Doll for coming together to \nremind us, in their words, that ``an act of generosity as simple as a \nkind word can transform a fleeting moment into an eternal one.'' The \nsimplest acts of giving highlights the strong connections we all share, \neven as divisive rhetoric at home and violent acts abroad threaten our \nsolidarity and safety. I honor and admire the spirit of the Elijah \nMoment Campaign, and I encourage all to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6346-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING GLEN HURT\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize an outstanding \npublic servant of Western Maryland, Al Feldstein, who will be retiring \nat the end of this year after 42 years of public service. As \nAppalachian Regional Commission, ARC, State Program Manager for \nMaryland, Al has played a critical role in the success of countless \nprojects and initiatives aimed at advancing economic progress and \nimproving the lives of the residents of Maryland's three Appalachian \ncounties. His passion for his community is boundless, and his careful \nstewardship of public resources has consistently set a high standard to \nwhich we can--and should--all aspire.\n  An exemplary leader in public service, Al's positions as grants \nadministrator with Tri-County Council for Western Maryland and ARC \nState program manager at the Maryland Department of Planning enabled \nhim to realize the importance of investing in Federal, State, private, \nand local economic development projects. He was committed to creating \nconditions for economic growth, many of which strengthened parts of the \nAppalachian region by constructing and improving basic public \ninfrastructure.\n  Under Al's leadership, several rural counties in Western Maryland \nhave benefited from carefully targeted ARC investments in economic \ndevelopment--including the financing of high-speed telecommunications \ninfrastructure to increase local and regional connectivity and \naffordability. These accomplishments have leveraged far greater support \nfor workforce development and job creation in a region that continues \nto battle economic distress, high unemployment rates, and severe \neducational disparities.\n  ARC's regional development roles--as advocate, knowledge builder, \npartner, investor, and catalyst--underlie the commission's strategy to \ninvest in people, basic infrastructures, and job creation and \nretention. ARC helps create economic opportunities by making its funds \navailable for seed capital, gap funding, and investments in innovative \nprograms. Although the Appalachian region has not fully achieved \nsocioeconomic party with the rest of the Nation, greater involvement in \nthe region--not only through funding but also public service like \nAl's--will continue to help Appalachia's communities take advantage of \nemerging economic opportunities and diversification.\n  Knowing that accomplishing the four goals of ARC's strategic plan \nrequires intense collaboration and civic engagement, Al was steadfast \nin working to achieve these objectives: to increase job opportunities \nand per capita income, strengthen the capacity of Appalachia's citizens \nto compete in the\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nglobal economy, improve the region's infrastructure, and build the \nAppalachian Development Highway System.\n  In working to make the region more economically competitive, ARC's \nmodel of development, based on community support, creates sustainable, \nlifelong solutions that likewise stress the value of service at all \nlevels. The hundreds of annual projects funded by ARC, all of which \naddress one or more of the strategic plan's goals, further demonstrate \nthe intrinsic significance of public service and its vital role in \nplanning for a better future.\n  ARC approves funding for more than 400 projects annually throughout \nthe 13-State region, including both highway projects and access road \nprojects. The projects have invested funding and resources in a range \nof sectors that directly impact economic development in the Appalachian \nregion, including child development, community infrastructure, \ntransportation, arts and culture, career and technical education.\n  Maryland's projects have included the formation of Allegany County \nConnect 2 Compete, created to boost educational achievement and \nattainment, and increasing health-care access through Allegany County \nPublic Health Accreditation. Another federally funded program in \nMaryland, HRDC Head Start Facility, provides services to low-income \nfamilies with small children, promoting school readiness, health, and \nparent involvement in an educational environment. In Frostburg, a \nproject called Frostburg Grows: Grow it Local Greenhouse involves \nconversion of unused mined land into an innovative five-acre greenhouse \nand shade house complex, designed to create additional job \nopportunities, reduce food insecurity, and provide local and healthy \nfood to the residents of Western Maryland.\n  As Hillary Clinton once remarked, ``Aid chases need; investment \nchases opportunity.'' Al internalized this message, focusing on the \nimplementation and improvement of reforms to foster, protect, and fully \nbenefit the lives of Marylanders. This dedication to public service \nhelped define and differentiate the various communities he served, and \nillustrates the many, varied possibilities of public service--not \nlimited to elected office. Serving on scores of local, State, and \nnational committees only cemented Al's involvement in civic life.\n  While Al championed community involvement and public service, ARC's \nstructure also ensures an active Federal-State-local partnership rooted \nin cooperation. One of ARC's guiding principles is to support inclusive \nlocal decisionmaking, and to cultivate a collaborative problem-solving \nculture in which community achievements are made possible through \ncollective efforts and investments. ARC's development of new strategic \nplans relies heavily on obtaining citizen input on high-priority \nregional issues, promoting homegrown solutions. ARC awards program \ngrants to State and local agencies, governmental entities, local \ngoverning boards, and nonprofit organizations: targeting the region's \nspecific needs, and executing plans that reinforce the necessity of \nteamwork and commitment.\n  Al, too, recognized the fundamental importance of working together to \nstrengthen the capacity of interdependent elements: individual leaders, \norganizations, and the community as a whole. Working in tandem, broad-\nbased leadership structures and institutions not only spur change but \nalso encourage the establishment of new business and economic \nopportunities that can strengthen a community while diversifying its \nbase.\n  Just as ARC's strategy creates a framework for building on past \naccomplishments to help move Appalachia forward, so, too, did Al bridge \nhis vision of the rich, fruitful past with his present--capitalizing on \nexisting assets and acknowledging the importance of public service in \nimproving communities. I ask my colleagues to join me today in \nrecognizing the contributions Al made to the State of Maryland and to \nour Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6347-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING BOB CASHELL\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mayor Bob \nCashell, of Reno, on his retirement. After serving as the mayor of Reno \nfor 12 years, Mayor Cashell presided over his last city council meeting \non November 12, 2014. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate him \nnot only as a colleague but also as a friend on his retirement after \nmore than 35 years of hard work and dedication to the Silver State.\n  A devoted husband and proud father of four, Mayor Cashell stands as a \nshining example of someone who has dedicated his life to serving his \ncommunity. Upon graduating from the Stephen F. Austin State University \nin Nacogdoches, TX, with a bachelor's degree in business, Mayor Cashell \nmoved to Reno to work as a truckdriver and salesman for a small \nrefining company in 1961. Several years after moving to Nevada, Mayor \nCashell and his colleagues were able to purchase a small casino-\nrestaurant in 1967, which would later become known as Boomtown Casino \nand Hotel. His impressive business expertise has allowed him to \ncontinue on to manage and own several large properties across Nevada \nand the United States. Serving as the chairman of the board for his \nbusiness, Cashell Enterprises, a hotel casino and management company, \nhe quickly became a business leader within the local gaming community. \nAfter a long and distinguished career in gaming, Mayor Cashell decided \nthat he also wanted to pursue a new endeavor and give back to his \ncommunity.\n  Mayor Cashell's public career began in 1979 when he ran for the \nUniversity of Nevada System Board of Regents and was subsequently \nelected chairman by his peers. After his tenure as a respected member \nof the board, Mayor Cashell was then elected Lieutenant Governor for \nthe State of Nevada in 1982. In his role as Lieutenant Governor, he was \ninstrumental in the founding of the Nevada Commission on Economic \nDevelopment and the Nevada Commission on Tourism--both of which he \nserved on as chairman. Upon being sworn in as mayor on November 13, \n2002, Mayor Cashell worked diligently to ensure the city continues to \nthrive and to make Reno the renowned place for gaming that it is today. \nHis roles in establishing the Truckee River Whitewater Park, opening \nthe Community Assistance Center for the homeless, helping to extend the \nReno Bowler's Convention contract, and founding the YMCA Youth Soccer \nLeague are just a few of the accomplishments that exemplify the legacy \nthat Mayor Cashell will leave behind upon his retirement.\n  His service to the Reno community goes far beyond the many positions \nhe has held in the Silver State over the years. Mayor Cashell also \nserved his country in the U.S. Air Force. I extend my deepest gratitude \nto Mayor Cashell for his courageous contributions to the United States \nof America and to freedom-loving nations around the world. His service \nto his country and his bravery and dedication to his family and \ncommunity earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who have \nvaliantly defended our Nation. As a member of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility not \nonly to honor these brave individuals who serve America but also to \nensure they are cared for when they return home.\n  I am grateful for his dedication and commitment to the people of Reno \nand to the State of Nevada. He personifies the highest standards of \nleadership and community service and should be proud of his long and \nmeaningful career. Today, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating Mayor Cashell on his retirement, and I offer my deepest \nappreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada an even better \nplace. I offer my best wishes to Mayor Cashell and his wife Nancy for \nmany successful and fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6347-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6347-S6348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GENERAL CHARLES H. JACOBY, JR.\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in a few short weeks a \nthoughtful and inspirational military leader will retire after serving \nhis country proudly for 36 years. Today I recognize and commend my good \nfriend GEN Charles H. Jacoby, Jr., of the U.S. Army for his exceptional \nleadership over those 36 years, most recently in his role as commander \nof the North American Aerospace Defense Command and United States \nNorthern Command. It has been a tremendous pleasure to work closely \nwith General Jacoby. I know many of my\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\ncolleagues join me in congratulating him on a job well done and in \nwishing him well as he begins a well-deserved retirement.\n  General Jacoby graduated from the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point in 1978 and received his commission into the infantry as a \nsecond lieutenant. His command experience include Commander, A Company, \n2d Battalion, Airborne, 325th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division, Fort \nBragg, NC, and Operation URGENT FURY, Grenada; commander, 1st \nBattalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, \nFort Bragg, NC; commander, Joint Task Force-Bravo, United States \nSouthern Command, Honduras and Operation FUERTE APOYO, Strong Support, \nHurricane Mitch; commanding general, U.S. Army Alaska and deputy \ncommander, United States Alaskan Command; and commanding general, I \nCorps, including a combat tour in Iraq serving as the commanding \ngeneral, Multi-National Corps-Iraq. Prior to his current assignment, he \nserved as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's director, \nStrategic Plans and Policy (J5) and as senior member, U.S. Delegation \nto the United Nations Military Staff Committee, the Joint Staff.\n  It was during General Jacoby's assignments as commanding general, \nUnited States Army Alaska, and deputy commander, United States Alaskan \nCommand, that we forged an enduring friendship based on trust and \nmutual respect. We have worked tough issues over the years, and I have \nalways known him to be a man of his word. He is a great friend of mine \nand a true friend to Alaska.\n  General Jacoby has served as the commander of NORAD and USNORTHCOM \nfor the past 3\\1/2\\ years with great distinction. He provided inspired \nvision, strategic focus and priorities, consistent operational and \norganizational excellence, and exceptional hands-on leadership not only \nfor the people of his two commands but also in support of the commands' \nmany international, interagency, nongovernmental organization, State, \nlocal, and private sector partners. Further, he honed important working \nrelationships between USNORTHCOM and the National Guard, especially in \nimplementation and execution of the dual status commander concept.\n  Perhaps most importantly, he was recognized earlier this year for his \nefforts to strengthen military ties between the United States and \nMexico by General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, Secretary of the National \nDefense Forces, and Admiral Vidal Francisco Soberon Sanz, Secretary of \nthe Navy. They honored General Jacoby in a formal military ceremony \nattended by thousands of the Mexican military as the only U.S. military \nofficer ever to receive the Mexican Military Merit 1st Class Award and \nthe Mexican Naval Award, the highest awards possible for a non-Mexican, \nfor his many contributions in support of the Mexican armed forces.\n  General Jacoby's unique combination of experience, charismatic \nleadership, and intelligence served him well as the commander during \ndifficult times overseas and at home with some tough decisions about \nthe future of our country. His long and distinguished record of \nexceptional service to our country serves as the gold standard for \ngeneral officers, and we wish him and his family all the best. To this \nbattle-hardened infantry paratrooper, we say a fond ``keep your feet \nand knees together'' as you jump into the next exciting chapter of your \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6348-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REMEMBERING SERGEANT FIRST CLASS RICHARD DEMERS\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

Sergeant Demers was born in Manchester on December 31, \n1966 and spent his young life there, graduating from Manchester \nMemorial High School in 1985. His lengthy career in the Army spanned 22 \nyears, including a tour of duty in Iraq, as well as tours in Germany, \nColorado, Texas, Hawaii and most recently Missouri.\n  Sergeant Demers' choice to dedicate his career to protecting our \nfreedom and security is the essence of American patriotism. It is my \nhope that during this extremely difficult time, Richard's family and \nfriends will find comfort in knowing that Americans everywhere \nappreciate deeply his selfless service in defense of our country.\n  Sergeant Demers is survived by his wife of 28 years, Karen, Gagne, \nDemers, of Laquey, MO; their two sons, Jonathan Demers and his wife \nMegan, of Georgia, and Shawn Demers and his wife Nadine, of Washington; \nfive grandchildren; two siblings, Michelle Champagne and her husband \nRoland, of Allenstown, NH, and David Demers and his wife, Marcia, of \nFlorida; and many nieces and nephews. This patriot will be missed by \nall.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join me in honoring the life and service of this brave \nAmerican, Richard Demers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6348-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING SERGEANT FIRST CLASS MARK GULEZIAN\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness I rise \ntoday to honor the life and service of SFC Mark Gerald Gulezian, a New \nHampshire native who died on October 10. Mark was born on December 28, \n1978 in Manchester, NH and was raised in nearby Londonderry, where he \nwas a graduate of Londonderry High School. He joined the U.S. Army in \n1998, and over the course of his career served two tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, in addition to a tour in Korea. Sergeant Gulezian was most \nrecently stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina with the Army's \ndistinguished 3rd Special Forces Group, Airborne.\n  Mark will forever be a member of the special community of Americans \nwho bravely and selflessly vow to defend our country so that the rest \nof us may continue to live in peace and freedom. It is my hope that \nduring this extremely difficult time, Mark's family and friends will \nfind comfort in knowing that Americans everywhere deeply appreciate his \ncommitment and service to our nation.\n  Mark is survived by his parents Jerry and Dotty of Londonderry, NH; \nhis wife, Blair Anastasia Gulezian, of Raeford, NC; children Amira \nGulezin and Dylan Gulezian, both of Richmond, VA; a stepson, \nChristopher, of Pennsylvania; his brother, Steven Gulezian of \nLondonderry and his girlfriend, Sara Hickey; and niece, Ambree Page \n``S.J.'' Gulezian; also his two dogs, Whiskey and Lucic. This patriot \nwill be missed by all.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join me in honoring the life and service of this brave \nAmerican, Mark Gulezian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6348-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6348-S6349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:31 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2673.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to specify how clearing requirements \napply to certain affiliate transactions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today Senator Klobuchar and I are \nintroducing legislation to clarify that commercial companies that \nexecute swaps to manage their business risk through ``centralized \ntreasury units'' are entitled to the end-user clearing exemption \nprovided by Congress as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  The Dodd-Frank Act requires financial entities to clear and trade \ntheir derivatives contracts on regulated exchanges. The point of this \nreform is to cut down on the systemic risk posed by financial \nspeculators who invest in volatile derivatives contracts. It was not \nintended to restrict the ability of non-financial ``end-users'' to \nhedge commercial risks that are part of their normal business \noperations. For that reason, the Dodd-Frank Act provided end-users with \nan exemption from the act's clearing requirements.\n  Many non-financial end-users use subsidiaries called ``centralized \ntreasury units'' to manage their derivatives contracts. These \ncentralized treasury units allow corporations to consolidate their \nhedging expertise in one subsidiary. Unfortunately, because these \nsubsidiaries are not technically ``end-users'' themselves, the end-user \nexemption provided by Dodd-Frank does not\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\napply to them, even though they execute derivatives for other end-users \nwithin the corporate family, and are considered a best-practice among \ncorporate treasurers.\n  Our legislation fixes the end-user exemption to clarify that it \napplies to swaps between a centralized treasury unit and an external \ncounterparty, so long as the swap hedges the risks of a commercial \naffiliate. The language of our bill is substantially the same as that \nof H.R. 5471, offered by Representatives Moore, Stivers, Gibson, and \nFudge, that passed the House by voice vote yesterday.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the common sense clarification \nproposed in this bipartisan legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6352-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 594--CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL YEAR OF THE BIRTH OF \n     JAN KARSKI AND HONORING HIS EXTRAORDINARY AND COURAGEOUS LIFE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today, the Senate has acted to ensure that \nlaw school students can gain valuable experience providing legal \nassistance to inventors before the United States Patent and Trademark \nOffice--USPTO. This legislation is a clear win-win: students will gain \ntangible, hands-on experience in a vital area of the law, and inventors \nand small businesses will receive valuable legal assistance with their \npatent and trademark applications. By promoting innovation and helping \ncreators turn their inventions into reality, the American public \nbenefits from the results.\n  The USPTO plays a key role in driving the engine of our economy. \nClose to 600,000 patent applications and 450,000 trademark class \napplications are filed with the Office each year. I am proud that \nVermont routinely ranks among the most innovative States that have the \nhighest patents per capita each year. By serving America's innovators, \nthe USPTO helps Vermonters and citizens across the country build their \nbusinesses and bring their inventions to the global marketplace.\n  Three years ago, Congress came together to pass the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act of 2011, the greatest transformation to our patent \nsystem in over 60 years. We worked for 6 years to pass this legislation \nto bring our patent system into the 21st Century. It helped simplify \nthe process for patent approval, reduced backlogs at the USPTO, \nharmonized the U.S. patent system with the rest of the world, and \nimproved patent quality.\n  Importantly, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act also contained key \nprovisions to help inventors when they appear before the USPTO; \nsomething this law school clinic legislation builds on today. Because \nof the America Invents Act, the USPTO now has four satellite offices \naround the country to make the Office more accessible to inventors and \nbusinesses. The USPTO's pro bono program is expanding nationwide to \nprovide resources to individuals who appear before the Office without \ncounsel. The Patent Ombudsman for Small Businesses provides patent \nfiling support and services.\n  The Law School Clinic Certification Program established by this \nlegislation expands the USPTO's strong efforts to support inventors and \nsmall businesses, while training our next generation of lawyers in how \nthis important agency operates. After 6 years of a successful pilot \nprogram run by the USPTO, it is time to pass this legislation and make \nthe program permanent. Representative Hakeem Jeffries should be \ncongratulated for his work on this bill in the House. I thank my fellow \nSenators for joining me in support of this sensible program and \ncontinuing our work to support innovators in our home States and across \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, and there be no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 594.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Mr. President, today, I join with my colleague, Mr. \nKirk, in introducing a resolution honoring the heroic life of Jan \nKarski.\n  Jan Karski was born in Lodz, Poland, on April 24, 1914. He began his \nlife of service in the Polish diplomatic service before he enlisted in \nthe military, serving in the Polish army when German soldiers invaded \nPoland in 1939. He was subsequently captured and sent to a prisoner \ncamp.\n  In 1940, Jan Karski fled to Warsaw and joined the Polish underground \nresistance movement, where he served as a courier delivering messages \ndetailing the horrific brutality of the Nazis to the Polish government-\nin-exile. Mr. Karski played a key role in providing some of the first \neye witness accounts of the Holocaust to governments of other nations. \nIn July of 1943, Mr. Karski came to the U.S. and met with President \nRoosevelt to describe the horrors of the Nazi genocide he had \nwitnessed. He became a U.S. citizen in 1954.\n  Throughout his life, Jan Karski remained committed to providing \nglobal awareness of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. \nAfter World War II, Mr. Karski became a student at Georgetown \nUniversity, where he earned a Ph.D. in 1952. He went on to teach, \ncalling on his own experiences, at Georgetown's Edmund A. Walsh School \nof Foreign Service for 35 years until he retired in 1984.\n  Jan Karski has been honored on multiple occasions for his courageous \nefforts to open the world's eyes to the atrocities of the Holocaust. In \n2012, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded him the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, and more recently, the Parliament of the Republic of \nPoland designated 2014 as ``The Year of Jan Karski.''\n  One hundred years after his birth, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the courageous life and lasting legacy of Mr. Karski, a truly \nhonorable Polish American, by celebrating the centennial year of Jan \nKarski's birth.\n  Mr. REID.

We have certain imperative things we have \nto do. Everyone knows we have to do a spending bill. Everyone knows we \nhave to do a defense bill. Everyone knows we are trying to do some tax \nextenders. We hope we can do that, but we will see, and there are other \nthings we need to do. So everyone should be prepared. Next week isn't \ngoing to be as easy as this weekend is.\n  For the information of all Senators, there will be three rollcall \nvotes at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, December 8, 2014, on confirmation of the \nBaran, McFerran, and Williams nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/04/senate-section/article/S6357-4", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2014, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
