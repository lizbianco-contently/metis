Mr. President, I have been following very closely reports \non irregularities in the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of \napplications for nonprofit status. These allegations, of course, are \nvery troubling, and I intend to take a close look at the inspector \ngeneral's report when it is released.\n  Concerns such as these are why we have inspectors general. They are \ntasked with finding and preventing waste, fraud, and abuse, identifying \nbreaches of law and protocol, and promoting efficiency in government. \nOur inspectors general have an excellent record of responsibility, and \nspecifically Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration, has an exceptionally strong reputation as a watchdog at \nthe IRS. Of course, watching the IRS is also watching the IRS for the \nAmerican people. I am confident he is examining this issue and doing it \nvery well, as he has done in the past. I look forward to his report.\n  The alleged actions of IRS employees in the Cincinnati field office \nwould be a terrible breach of the public's trust. Whether they are \ninvestigating conservative groups or liberal groups, they should not be \ninvolved. Targeting any group based on its political status is \ncompletely inappropriate. We need to get to the bottom of what \nhappened, and the inspector general will get to the bottom of this. In \nthe meantime no one should jump to conclusions, but we should all rest \nassured as soon as we have the inspector general's report the Senate \nwill quickly take appropriate action.\n  I have spoken today to the senior Senator from Montana, the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Max Baucus, and he is looking into this \nmatter in his role as chairman of the Finance Committee. If the \ninspector general's report indicates further investigation is needed, I \nhave full confidence in the ability of Senator Baucus and the Finance \nCommittee to get to the bottom of this matter and recommend appropriate \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3355-7", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3355-S3356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as indicated in this chart, 51 days ago the \nSenate passed its budget. It has now been 51 days. So why are \nRepublicans standing in the way? A picture is worth a thousand words, \nand that is the picture.\n  Common sense and more than two centuries of history dictate the next \nstep would be to go to conference and try to find common ground between \nour budget and the budget passed by the House of Representatives. The \nconference committee is one of the oldest traditions of the entire \nAmerican Government. In fact, during the first session of Congress--No. \n1--on April 7, 1789, the day after a quorum had been secured and the \nfirst meeting of Congress was held, the Senate charged a committee with \nsetting out the rules for such conferences. During that first Congress, \nthe two Houses convened many times on conference committees to consider \nmany different issues they disagreed on, including differences of \nopinion over amendments to the Constitution, differences of opinion \nover\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\nlegislating as to what the courts should do, and looking at bills that \ncreated a post office and the Treasury Department. All those were \nbills, one passed by the House and one passed by the Senate, and they \ngot together to work out the differences.\n  In this esteemed tradition, Democrats now wish to resolve our \ndifferences over the budget in a conference committee subject to the \ndisinfectant of public scrutiny, instead of behind closed doors, as we \nhave done for more than two centuries. A number of Republican Senators \nhave joined Democrats in calling for such a conference. It has now been \n51 days since the Senate passed its budget. Even Republicans are asking \nwhy can't we go to conference?\n  This is what the senior Senator from Arizona, a Republican, said last \nweek:\n\n       I'm very much in favor of it, and I think we ought to do it \n     right away. . . . After 4 years of complaining about Harry \n     Reid's failure to bring up a budget and then we do one and \n     block conference . . . is incomprehensible.\n\n  That was a quote from John McCain.\n  After 3 years of Republican yearning for such regular order, \nDemocrats assumed every Republican Senator would be enthusiastic to go \nto conference. But although a few Republicans, such as Senator McCain, \nhave called for a conference committee, Republican leaders have refused \nfor weeks to name conferees, flouting more than 200 years of tradition.\n  Republican leaders have also refused to explain why they won't go to \nconference. But the longer the Republicans delay, the more transparent \nthis partisan political tactic is becoming. It is transparent they \noppose transparency. They do not want openness in government.\n  Republicans continue to put off a fiscal compromise until our backs \nare up against yet another manufactured crisis--a catastrophic default \non the financial obligations we have as a country. Republicans hope to \nuse the threat of default as a bargaining chip to extract concessions \nfor tax breaks for the wealthy, extract concessions for drastic cuts to \nMedicare, extract concessions for more Draconian cuts to programs that \nkeep the elderly, the sick, the disabled, and the most vulnerable \nAmericans from slipping further into poverty.\n  Even though Republicans caused themselves and the country immense \npolitical harm by pursuing this wrongheaded strategy last summer, they \nare at it again, and this time Republicans aren't even hiding their \ndesire to cause a first-of-its-kind default on our Nation's financial \nobligations.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives passed a bill called the \n``Full Faith and Credit Act.'' If there were ever an Orwellian name, \nthis is it. In their lexicon, up is down, down is up; east is west, \nnorth is south. A bill called the Full Faith and Credit Act? Come on.\n  This legislation ranks the Nation's debts in order of priority--their \npriority, a Republican-dominated, tea party-driven House of \nRepresentatives. Listen to this. Here is what the legislation says:\n  In the event of a Republican-forced default, the Nation would stop \npayments to Medicare, veterans, active-duty military servicemembers, \nnational security personnel, and you name it--everything except paying \nthe debt to China.\n  In addition to threatening the full faith and credit of the United \nStates, this legislation would cost American jobs, hurt businesses, and \ntank the economy. And it wouldn't prevent default. If an American \nfamily has a mortgage payment, a car payment, and credit card payment, \nbut pays only three of those bills, the family is still in default. The \nFederal Government lives by the same rules. If we pay China but default \non obligations to our veterans, we are still in default. If we pay \nChina but not our Border Patrol, not our FBI, not our law enforcement \nofficers, including drug enforcement, we are in default. If we pay \nChina but not our troops overseas, we are in default.\n  The Republican approach to default is totally irresponsible. The \nRepublicans know this risky measure is a nonstarter in the Senate. Even \nif it could pass the Senate--which it won't--President Obama would veto \nit.\n  Americans are tired of these protracted fights over the budget caused \nby the tea party-driven Republicans in Congress. It is through \ncompromise, not through hostage taking or political blackmail, that we \ncan set the Nation on the road to fiscal responsibility. That \ncompromise begins by going to conference on the budget. Americans agree \nthe path to economic prosperity runs through the regular order of this \nlegislative body--a process that honors more than two centuries of \nwork.\n  Finally, I had hoped we would have an opportunity for the Republican \nleader to explain why he objects to going to conference on the budget. \nWe informed the Republican side we would ask this consent today, \ntomorrow, the next day, and every day. Let us hope we don't get to day \n62, 63, 64, 65, 75, but the way they are going, I guess they are never \ngoing to go to conference.\n  We informed the Republican side we would ask consent today and every \nday we are in session. While the Republican cloakroom informed us there \nwas an objection, no Republican was available to explain that objection \nin person. I did this last week, and again they had no one here. I did \nthe same thing I am going to do here. I am asking for consent, but I \nwill withdraw my request out of respect for the long tradition of \ncomity. This is not comedy but comity.\n  It is outrageous, first of all, that they block this and then don't \nhave the courage for somebody to stand and object. It speaks volumes \nthat no Republican Senator was available or willing to explain the \nbizarre objection to a perfectly reasonable request to go to conference \nand work out the differences. The only explanation we have had so far \ncame from the junior Senator from Texas where he said: We will go to \nconference, but you have to agree to what we want before we go to \nconference. How is that for a deal?\n  The junior Senator from Texas was not available today, and no other \nRepublican Senator appears willing to stand and explain why Senate \nRepublicans are now standing in the way of a budget. So I will ask this \nand then I will withdraw it.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that \nthe amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate, all with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  I would elaborate. This is a process that started being developed in \nthe first Congress that was ever held in this country--1789. My \nRepublican colleagues for years complained about not following regular \norder. They said we didn't have a budget. We didn't need one, but they \nsaid we didn't have one. We didn't do one by resolution, we did one by \npassing a law. But regardless of that, they came and talked about that.\n  This is out of line. It is ridiculous. It is unfair to the American \npeople, but it is very obvious what is going on.\n  I withdraw my request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The request is withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3356-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3356-S3357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SANDY HOOK\n\n  Mr. REID.

They are not going to let \nthis fade from our minds. Keep in mind, I\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\nmet with the Sandy Hook people on several occasions. They are not \nasking for anything that is outrageous. Their first step is to say that \nsomeone who is crazy--I am sorry, that is not a good term of art--\nsomeone who has extreme mental problems should not be able to buy a \ngun. Someone who is a criminal should not be able to buy a gun. That is \nall we want. We will settle for that. The people of Sandy Hook will \nsettle for that.\n  I admire what the Presiding Officer has done and what Senator \nBlumenthal has done.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will continue the markup on \nthe Gang of 8 immigration bill. They have been meeting with \nbusinesspeople and special interest groups trying to craft a piece of \nlegislation they can agree to, that they think is good. They didn't \nhave anybody representing mainstream America. They didn't have anyone \nrepresenting the law enforcement community who would explain how this \nsystem ought to work. As a result, their bill doesn't have any kind of \nimprovements in our law enforcement that would be effective.\n  I wanted to talk today, because we will be going into it tomorrow, \nabout the fundamental question on the nature of our immigration; how \nmuch this country would be able to sustain in a healthy way for \nimmigrants, as well as American workers.\n  I have been concerned for some time that the numbers are just too \nlarge. We are not able to effectively assimilate people in these large \nnumbers. Significantly, we don't have sufficient jobs to allow us to \nemploy them. As the bill stands now, it would have only a negative \nimpact on American workers.\n  People say: You need to be positive, Sessions. We are growth \noriented. We are just going to grow this economy, and there will be \nplenty of jobs out there. Be like Ronald Reagan, would you? Be sunny \nall the time. Don't talk negatively. Don't worry about this.\n  I am looking at some numbers, and I think it is wise for America to \nbe prudent, smart, and careful, before we establish policies we can't \nsustain, before we establish policies that create more unemployment in \nAmerica and damage our economy. That could happen.\n  I asked one of the sponsors of the bill, Senator Schumer, how many \npeople would be admitted under the bill. Well, he wouldn't say.\n  I said: It looks like it might be 30 million; is that correct?\n  He said: No.\n  I said: Well, how many is it, Senator Schumer?\n  He didn't say. They have yet to say how many people would be admitted \nunder the biggest change in immigration we have had since at least \n1986, and really it is larger in its impact than 1986.\n  This is an odd thing. Frankly, we ought not to proceed another day in \nthe Judiciary Committee until the sponsors of the bill--and their great \nadvisers who have been meeting for months, aided by the administration \nand all the staffs they have in Homeland Security and the Department of \nJustice--can tell us how many people would be admitted. They don't do \nthat, I think, fundamentally because they don't want us to know. They \nreally don't want to acknowledge what a huge alteration in our policies \nthis will have in terms of economics and so forth.\n  Let's think about it. Here are some of the things we know: We know 11 \nmillion people are here illegally--some say 12 million--and they would \nall be given a legal status. Virtually all would be given a legal \nstatus immediately.\n  They would then immediately be allowed to pursue any job they would \nlike to take. They could go down and apply for the county government, \nthe city government, trucking firms, coal mining companies, oil \ncompanies, any good job out there they would like to apply for. That is \nnot happening now because many of them have no identification and \naren't able to take anything other than jobs off the books. Some have \nestimated--supporters of the bill--that at least half of the people \nhere illegally are working off the books in some form or fashion. These \nnumbers are big. We have those numbers.\n  In addition, there is a plan over the next years to legalize 4.5 \nmillion additional individuals in the so-called backlog. They are \nreally not backlogged in the sense the immigration service isn't \nprocessing their papers fast enough, they are backlogged because we had \ncaps on how many in these categories could come in and people apply \nuntil they reach the number. Well, they would remove the caps on those. \nThat would be another 4.5 million that would come in.\n  Then they have a future flow that we are working hard on to analyze \nwith my staff. I don't have the entire immigration service. I don't \nhave the immigration lawyers association. I don't have the chamber of \ncommerce or Richard Trumka to come in and do all the work for me, but \nwe think there will be quite a number of immigrants coming in the \nfuture.\n  The Los Angeles Times--and I will use their number; it seems to be \nthe number others have come up with and may be in the ballpark--they \nhave increased the annual flow by 50 percent. That would be a 50-\npercent increase. We are supposed to be at about 1 million a year now, \nand this would increase the legal flow by 50 percent. It could be \nconsiderably more. So we estimate that something like 30 million people \nwill be given legal status in the next 10 years, when, if the law were \nfaithfully applied, there would be about 10 or 11 million over the next \n10 years given legal status. Yes, of that 30 million, about 10 or so--\n10-plus--will be those who are already here, but many of those are \nreally not effectively competing for jobs with the American worker, who \nby a large degree is out of work and needing a job.\n\n  First and foremost we are a nation of immigrants. We have always had \na generous immigration policy. A million immigrants a year exceeds that \nof any other country in the world ever, and we are about to absorb a \nhuge number of new people--15 million--and then we are going to \nincrease the flow by 50 percent. So I am asking, can we handle this? \nThat is all I am asking at this point on this subject, and we really \nshould think about that. Don't we owe it to our workers to ask those \nquestions?\n  Professor Borjas, at Harvard--himself an immigrant and the most \nserious student of immigration and wages and jobs in America, and he \nwrote a book on it a number of years ago and still writes papers in \ncontributing to the debate--has demonstrated absolutely, through \nintense, high-level economic studies, that increases in workers \nproduces reduced wages. Surprise--more workers reduces wages. It allows \na business to find a worker without having to pay more money. They \nwould be able to get more people to work for less, and they like that. \nThat is great--for them.\n  My Democratic colleagues have been pointing out for a long time--and, \nsadly, there is too much truth in their complaints--that the average \nwage of the American worker since at least\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\n2000--and some say as far back as 1970--has not kept up with inflation.\n  Profit is going pretty well for a lot of companies, but workers' \nsalaries haven't even kept up with inflation, and our unemployment rate \nis exceedingly high today. That is a fact. Professor Borjas attributes \na good bit of that to the immigration we have had over these years, \nwhich is at a level that, he said some years ago--and I remember when \nhe wrote this--was higher than the country really ought to have then.\n  What is our current situation? Well, we looked at the analysis of the \nCongressional Budget Office in the budget study they present to \nCongress every year. And they work hard at this. Nobody knows the \nanswers to all of these questions, but CBO's is as good and objective a \nnumber as one normally gets, and this is what they predict. They are \npredicting that what experts are saying is correct; that is, the \neconomic growth in mature economies, such as the United States, Europe, \nand Japan, is not going to reach the peaks of growth we have had in \nsome of the go-go eras of the past. Bill Gross, head of one of the \nbiggest bond firms in the world--PIMCO--has called it a new normal. We \nare going to have lower growth. It will be steady, hopefully, but it is \ngoing to be lower and it will create fewer jobs. That is what the \nprojections are for the future.\n  In February of this year, the CBO projected that job growth per \nmonth--the number of jobs employers expect to add to their workforce--\nin the second 5 years of their 10-year budget analysis, years 2019 \nthrough 2023, would average only 75,000 a month. Isn't that something? \nHopefully we can do something better than that. This is a 10-year-plus \nplan of immigration policy from this Gang of 8. Have they talked to Mr. \nElmendorf? Have they talked to anybody about how many jobs we are \nactually going to need, other than some of the Silicon Valley gurus, \nthe chamber of commerce, some of the big agricultural industries, and \nsome of those folks? Is that all the people they are talking to?\n  What about the Blue Chip forecast? This is a forecast that is watched \nvery closely. They make forecasts on a lot of different issues. It is \nthe average of 55 private economic forecasters. So what do the Blue \nChippers say the growth will be? They say that there will be 2.8 \npercent growth between 2016 and 2019 and that will drop to only 2.5 \npercent between 2020 and 2024. In short, they agree with CBO that \neconomic growth will slow down over the next 10 years and not really \npick up from the slow growth we are in now to any significant degree.\n  A number of academic economists--Robert Gordon at Northwestern \nUniversity and Tyler Cowen at George Mason--argue that the U.S. economy \nhas entered a long period of slower economic growth that is not likely \nto improve dramatically anytime soon.\n  Today the Wall Street Journal published its latest survey of 52 \neconomists, who predict steady but slow economic growth in the near \nterm. Slow growth means slow job creation. It means job caution.\n  Here is what the Brookings Institution says:\n\n       Adjust for population growth, and it will take 9 more years \n     to return to the prerecession level of unemployment at the \n     current rate of growth.\n\n  That is a liberal think tank, and they are saying it is going to take \n9 more years just to get the unemployment we have now down to a more \nnormal historic level in the United States. At the same time, job \nparticipation, labor force participation is at a record low. Not since \nthe 1970s, when not many women were working, have we gone that low. \nPeople are giving up on looking for work.\n  It was 2 months ago that we had 88,000 jobs created in this country \nin 1 month--88,000 people got employment--while 486,000 left the \nworkforce. Imagine that. In 1 month we only created 88,000 jobs, while \n486,000 left the workforce. We checked those numbers, and about one-\nfifth of those were retirements--I am sure some early, or at least \nearlier than they wanted, and they started drawing Social Security \nearlier than they intended to draw it because they couldn't find work--\nbut a little less than 400,000, one-fifth, dropped out, gave up, \ncouldn't find work. So that is troubling, and it is pulling down wages \nof American citizens who have lost their jobs and can't find good work.\n  The Labor Department reported earlier this month that 4.4 million \nAmericans have been out of work for more than 27 weeks and that the \nbroadest measure of unemployment--that includes part-time employment \nand other things--stands at 13.9 percent, which is very high.\n  So first, I would say, do we want to tell somebody to come to \nAmerica, but we don't have a job for them or it will only be temporary, \nand then they will be laid off? We can't expect to be able to maintain \na workforce.\n  There is no doubt that those who want large and ready supplies of \nlabor and who don't want to have to pay more money or provide more \nbenefits to get that labor are happy with the steady, large flow coming \ninto the country. It might even make them have a little better profit. \nBut Professor Borjas at Harvard makes clear that by maybe $1,600 a \nyear--low-income people making $20,000 or so a year will have their \nwages brought down that much as a result of an influx of large amounts \nof low-skilled labor.\n\n  So it is not helpful to immigrants who came lawfully and who are \nlooking for work and having their wages pulled down, and it is not \nhelpful for our native born who are looking for work and can't get on \nthat ladder of success where someone starts working as a carpenter's \nhelper and one day ends up as a carpenter and then a foreman, and they \nhave saved a little money and have a retirement plan and health care \nfor their family. That is what we would like to see happen in America. \nSo I am worried about those numbers.\n  Mr. President, we had a hearing--kind of hard to keep up with this, \nbut I believe this was the hearing on high-tech workers--and I would \nlike to highlight the testimony of Professor Ron Hira. He has written \nfor the Economic Policy Institute, which is a liberal think tank. He \nhas done an op-ed at BusinessWeek and has presented at the Brookings \nInstitution and printed academic papers on this subject. He testified \nbefore our committee that he has been studying our high-skilled \nimmigration policy for more than a decade.\n  Most of the people entering the country under the Gang of 8 bill will \nnot be highly skilled. Most of them will not enter through the more \nmerit-based point system we have heard about. It looks pretty clear \nthat those entering on the point-based system, where there is some sort \nof competitive process--although an individual gets extra points if \nthey have family connections--represent less than 10 percent of those \nwho would be admitted under the legislation.\n  So this is what Mr. Hira says about the way our high-skilled \nimmigration policy is being operated. He says the U.S. policy, as \ncurrently designed and administered, does more harm than good. To meet \nthe needs of the U.S. economy and U.S. workers, our guest worker and \npermanent resident programs need immediate and substantial overhaul, \nand we don't have that kind of reform in this legislation. The \nprincipal goal of these programs is to bring in foreign workers who are \nsupposed to complement American workers, making American workers more \neffective. But loopholes have made it too easy to bring in cheaper, \nforeign workers with ordinary skills who directly substitute rather \nthan complement workers already in America.\n  We have all heard of this complementary idea--that we bring in \nforeign labor, and that helps American workers be more efficient and it \nwill make everybody better. But according to Mr. Hira, the workers who \nare being brought in under the H-1B and similar programs--J-1, L-1--are \nnot doing that. They are bringing in people through a loophole where \nthey actually compete with Americans for jobs. He says many of these \nindividuals have ordinary skills, and they substitute for American \nworkers.\n  He also said that loopholes in these programs provide an unfair \ncompetitive advantage to companies that are specializing in offshore \noutsourcing, speeding up the process of shipping high-wage, high-tech \nAmerican jobs overseas, which has disadvantaged companies in the United \nStates that hire mainly American workers.\n  Essentially, as I understood his testimony, people would come from a \nforeign country. They live here and train and work here. Then they go \nback to\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\ntheir foreign country and set up a plant or business and the company, \nU.S. company, outsources the work, costing American jobs. He has done \nstudies on this. This is not just a theory he came up with.\n  He further testified that the actual H-1B and L-1 visa use has become \nantithetical to policymakers' goals due to four fundamental flaws: The \nwork permits are held by the employer, so basically these individuals \ncome as indentured servants and are able to be controlled in a way that \ngives the employer the advantage over an American worker. No. 2, he \nsays that the visa period is far too long for them to come and, in \naddition to the inherent design flaws, there is little oversight or \nenforcement on these programs. Nobody is watching them. According to \nProfessor Hira, by closing H-1B and L-1 loopholes, Congress would \ncreate and retain tens of thousands of high-wage American jobs and \nensure our labor market works fairly for American and foreign workers \nalike.\n  I am summarizing now. In his opinion, the following needs to be done: \ninstitute an effective labor market test--make sure we actually need \nthese workers, pay workers true market wages--he asserts they are not \nbeing paid true market wages; limit the visa to a maximum of 3 years--\nfor a lot of reasons I suggest that is very important--with no renewal. \nIf they come for longer periods of time and they can renew and renew, \nthen we end up with somebody who is married here, their children are in \njunior high school, maybe they are American citizens by now--and we are \ngoing to ask them to leave even though the law says for them to leave? \nIt is not likely.\n  That is how 40 percent of the people here illegally have come to \nAmerica. They have come legally but overstayed the visa they had.\n  We should eliminate access to additional H-1B and L-1 visas for any \ndependent firm. Those that are dependent on these programs to maintain \ntheir basic workforce, those are the ones who should get their numbers \nreduced, rather than getting more visas. We should shine a light on the \nprocess, institute sensible oversight, establish a clear single \nobjective for the programs. Also other programs, he notes, are badly in \nneed of an overhaul and are being used to circumvent the annual \nnumerical limit on H-1Bs and the regulatory controls on the L-1 \nprogram.\n  Given the widespread use of H-1B and L-1 visas by offshore \noutsourcing firms--people who are truly moving jobs out of the United \nStates--Congress should take affirmative steps to make clear that most \nguest worker programs and permanent residents are immigration issues, \nnot trade and policy issues.\n  Finally, we heard over and over again from our good friends in \nSilicon Valley all the great things they have done. We are proud of \nthem and they have been great for America. He talks about some of that. \nHe contested the assertion by Mr. Brad Smith of Microsoft. Microsoft \nhas been aggressive in pushing this program. He pushes back and \ncontests the assertion that the United States does not have enough \nhigh-skilled workers. We have heard we don't have enough high-skilled \nworkers. He says no. He studied it. According to Professor Hira, the \nunemployment rate for STEM graduates--science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics--is higher than that of regular college graduates.\n  Goodness. He noted that in the petroleum engineering field things \nhave gone better. Wages have increased prompting an increase in the \nenrollment in such programs by American college students who almost \nexclusively have filled the petroleum engineering jobs. That is the way \nthe system is supposed to work. Wages start going up, there is a \nshortage of petroleum engineers and workers, people start majoring in \nthat, and they go out and find jobs. That is the way the system is \nsupposed to work. This example, he says, shows that markets do work \nwhen they are allowed to work. But he said H-1B and L-1 programs are \nintervening in labor markets. With that privilege should come \naccountability.\n  I will conclude by saying I urge my colleagues, before we rush out \nand sign on to an immigration proposal that has all kinds of special \ninterests and political interests, somebody has to question what it is \ndoing to recent college graduates as well as low-skilled workers. The \nactual statistical data from experts indicate these workers are \nstruggling today and many are unemployed and in much need of work.\n  The Civil Rights Commissioner, Abigail Thernstrom, also wrote a \nletter to the Commission and the Congress that said we don't have a \nshortage of low-skilled workers in America. We have a glut of them. We \nhave more low-skilled workers looking for jobs than we have jobs. But \nto read the papers, one would think just the opposite; that we have \nthis crisis with high unemployment, high numbers of people dropped out \nof the labor force, and we have to bring in more workers to do basic \nAmerican work.\n  All I am saying is that immigration policy needs to allow the right \nflow to come into America. It needs to be faithfully enforced. It needs \nto serve the national interest, not the special interest. It needs to \nremember the dutiful workers out there who lawfully entered the country \nthrough immigration or native born, and their interests need to be \nprotected in this process. I do not believe they are being protected \nproperly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN.

Mr. President, late last week we learned of the apology by \nthe Internal Revenue Service official about the targeting of certain \ninformation and applications for 501(c)(4) organizations in this \ncountry. Certainly the indication is that because of certain words \ngenerally considered to suggest that organization has conservative \nleanings, those organizations were targeted for different or additional \ntreatment at the Internal Revenue Service. It was indicated there was \nan apology offered. This became a significant topic of conversation \nover the weekend by certain elected officials, certainly by my \ncolleagues in the Senate but by the American people as well.\n  Last Wednesday, May 8, before this revelation was known, the \nAppropriations Subcommittee for Financial Services was holding its \nhearing--usually an annual affair--in which we were discussing the \nappropriations request in the President's budget for the Treasury \nDepartment. That gave me the opportunity to visit with Secretary Lew. \nOf course, the Internal Revenue Service is a component of the Treasury \nDepartment. My conversation with Secretary Lew during that hearing \ndealt with a related topic.\n  While I have great objection to targeting any group--liberal, \nconservative, Republican, Democratic-leaning--certainly the ability for \nus to examine an application is important. But none of us would expect \nor consider it to be appropriate that the Internal Revenue Service \nwould treat one application different from another based upon its \napparent political leanings.\n  While that is terrible enough, I also want to point out the topic I \nraised with the Secretary, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, last Wednesday. \nThis comes from media reports and from complaints by organizations. The \nreason this seems so important is the admission that conservative \ngroups were treated differently or one group was treated differently \nfrom another within the Internal Revenue Service lends credibility to \npress reports and to complaints by organizations across the country \nabout their treatment by the IRS.\n  My questions to Secretary Lew, some of them that day but also \nsubmitted in writing since then, deal with a number of instances in \nwhich it was reported by an organization or a press report that the \nInternal Revenue Service improperly disclosed information about donors \nto 501(c)(4) organizations. Last April, the IRS apparently improperly \ndisclosed schedule B donor lists on the form 990 of an organization \ncalled National Organizations for Marriage. It is an a 501(c)(4) group. \nWhile the form 990 is publicly available, tax laws and IRS regulations \nmake clear that the schedule B--that is the donor list on the 990 is \nnot to be released for 501(c)(3)s or (c)(4)s.\n  The issue was raised. The organization complained. It was reported in \nthe\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\npress. Part of my inquiry to Secretary Lew is what has transpired since \nthat point in time. Have the employees at the Internal Revenue Service \nwho released this information been challenged for their actions? Have \nthey been admonished? Have they been treated appropriately for what \nclearly seems to be an inappropriate release of private taxpayer \ninformation?\n  The second example was the IRS turned over several applications for \nnonprofit status, including the pending applications for tax-exempt \nstatus, for several groups. They were released and ended up in the \nhands of an organization called ProPublica. Again, while the \napplications for nonprofit status are available to the public after an \nexemption is granted, they are protected as tax return information \nwhile that application is pending. This organization then published \nthat information, despite that that is what I understand to be a \nfelony. Publishing unauthorized tax returns or return information is a \nfelony punishable by up to 5 years in prison or a fine up to $5,000 or \nboth. Again, my question of the Treasury Secretary is that I have not \nbeen able to confirm any action has been taken, any recommendation from \nthe Treasury Department, the Justice Department, that anybody be \nprosecuted for publishing private taxpayer information.\n  Finally, we learned earlier this year, again, of something described \nas an inadvertent IRS disclosure related to releasing one page of the \nschedule B showing donors to the Republican Governors Association. \nThese are alarming in and of themselves and become more significant to \nme, having learned that there is a bias, a treatment different of one \ntaxpayer over another at the IRS. While it is important for us to \ndetermine, and I am anxious to read the inspector general's report as \nto the findings about what occurred with the singling out of certain \norganizations for a different kind of treatment at the IRS, I also \nthink it is important for us to pursue the issue of the release of \ninformation that comes from one organization's filing that is \ninappropriate to release and ultimately its being used by an \norganization that apparently has a different political perspective than \nthe one whose application is pending.\n  Again, I would raise this issue that now we know something is wrong \nat the IRS, there is more to be discovered as we look at how this \ninformation was released. Were people who released it punished? Is \nthere any pending criminal action against the individuals who published \nthis information?\n  I am surprised by the circumstance we find ourselves in. I never \nwould have expected this from the Internal Revenue Service, which must \nbe, needs to be, and has to be above the political fray.\n  The IRS can never be an instrument of any political party, of any \nadministration, or of any political philosophy. All Americans have the \nright to assume that the IRS, which has great powers and consequences \nupon the taxpayers of this country, is operating in a neutral, fair, \nand appropriate manner.\n  The circumstances now present themselves in a way that we have to \nwonder about more than just these three examples. These three examples \nare ones now worthy of additional concern by Members of the Senate, \nand, even more importantly, by the IRS and individuals within the \nadministration who are responsible for the management and governance of \nthe Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department.\n  I have submitted a series of questions to Secretary Lew. As a member \nof the Appropriations Committee responsible for the Internal Revenue \nService's appropriations, I look forward to seeing what those answers \nare and to make certain appropriate action is taken in regard to \nindividuals who apparently have violated the public trust, with the \nunderstanding that all of us expect the privacy the Internal Revenue \nService is to provide.\n  Once again I want to outline that while we learned something over the \nweekend that is very troublesome, there may be much more to this story \nthat has yet to be told, and I am anxious to see the answers that come \nfrom the Treasury Department in regard to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  In fact, I encourage all Members of the Senate to reach the same \nconclusion--no matter their political leaning or philosophical bent, \nwhether Republican or Democrat--that the Internal Revenue Service with \nits tremendous enforcement capabilities and the tremendous consequences \nit has to the American people in the decisions it makes always be above \nthe political fray.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to be on the Senate \nfloor today to outline an extended concern I have about actions at the \nInternal Revenue Service. I anxiously wait for the Treasury Department \nto respond and provide answers to our subcommittee, committee, and the \nfull Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on December 14 of last year the world \nwatched in horror as we received news that in Sandy Hook, CT, 20 6- and \n7-year-olds as well as 6 of their teachers and professionals who were \ncharged with caring for them were killed at the hands of a gunman \nwielding a semi-automatic rifle armed with multiple 30-round clips. \nTwenty-six people died in that school that day, and the world has not \nbeen the same since.\n  The State of Connecticut, as well as many other States, including New \nYork and Colorado, passed some of the strongest gun laws in trying to \nbring some common sense to our gun laws in a generation. However, this \nbody, in the days since Sandy Hook, has done nothing.\n  We debated a bill which was supported by 90 percent of Americans that \nwould extend background checks to most all gun sales in this country so \nwe could make sure criminals and people with serious mental illness \ndidn't have their hands on guns. Even though the measure received 55 \nvotes here in the Senate, it didn't become a law because of a strange \nrule we have requiring 60 votes for most everything that comes through \nthis place.\n  While everything we have done here has been driven by the memory of \nwhat happened to those 20 beautiful little first-graders in our State, \nthe fact is 28 people died that day--including the gunman and his \nmother--but that is still less than those who die every day in this \ncountry at the hands of gun violence.\n  The everyday deaths that occur in our cities and suburbs throughout \nour country have become like raindrops in this Nation. We have become \ncallously used to the fact that people die due to guns in our country \nat a greater rate than almost anywhere else in the world.\n  I intend to come down to this floor week after week until we get our \nact together and do what the American public wants us to do, which is \nto keep guns out of the hands of criminals and try to get the most \ndangerous weapons back into the hands of law enforcement and the \nmilitary. I am going to come down here week after week and tell the \nsimple stories of the dozens of people who lose their lives every day \ndue to gun violence.\n  Since December 14--that awful, terrible day--3,966 people have died \nat the hands of a gun. By the end of today--depending on how tonight \ngoes across this country--that number could be 4,000. We are averaging \nabout 30 a day all across this country.\n  While people have gotten to know the people in Sandy Hook due to some \namazing reporting that has taken place, people don't know the stories \nof the people who die every day. So I am going to come down here every \nweek and tell the stories of those people to give voice to these \nvictims.\n  First I will focus on Hartford, CT, where a few days ago--May 8--\nFelix Jesus III was killed when he was simply going to sell a Samsung \nelectric tablet to someone who agreed to buy it over craigslist. His \nfather said this guy kept calling and calling. The guy arranged for my \nson to meet him, and he said he would be right back.\n  At around 8 p.m. on May 8, police received a 911 call, and they found \nhim dead in his car suffering from a single gunshot wound.\n  His father said:\n\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\n\n       They took my son, my only son. Now his kids are left alone \n     with nobody except for us, that's just not right.\n\n  Felix had two sons, a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old. He was going to \nsell a tablet computer, and he was shot in the head and died, leaving a \n1-year-old and 2-year-old behind. He was doing everything he was \nsupposed to do. He graduated from high school, and he worked at a local \nhotel. He was engaged to be married and left behind two children.\n  The day before, on May 7, out in northern California, a 45-year-old \nman fatally shot his wife and their two young daughters in their home, \nand he got away. His wife Sandy and their two daughters, Shelby, who \nwas 8, and Shasta, who was 4, had been shot multiple times.\n\n  There had been calls out to the home for domestic disturbances in the \nrecent weeks. The kids were pulled out of school. Something was clearly \ngoing on in that house. This guy was a dangerous guy. In 2002 he had \nbeen charged with distribution of drugs, felony possession of a \nfirearm, and possessing a machine gun, and he pleaded guilty. He had \nbeen in prison for 10 months.\n  We are still trying to figure out, only about a week later, if this \nguy was supposed to have weapons in the first place. We know, even if \nhe was banned from buying weapons, it would not have been that hard for \nhim to get them. We cannot say for certain how he came across the \nweapons that killed his wife and two kids. Even if he was, as a \ncriminal, on one of these lists, it would not have been that hard for \nhim to simply go to a local gun show or go on the Internet and buy a \nweapon. If he went either of those routes, according to current law, it \nis likely he never would have been checked to see if he was a criminal.\n  Sandy, 34, Shelby, 8, and Shasta, 4, were killed on May 7.\n  Steven Jones was killed that same day. He was a lifelong resident of \nCharlestown, MA. He was 21 years old. His friends said everybody loved \nhim. No one would ever expect something like this to happen to him. He \nwasn't in the streets. He was into sports and partying. This was a \nshock. Steven Jones was breaking up a fight when a gun went off, and he \nwas killed. His uncle said he was the definition of a good kid. He was \nthere trying to break up a fight, and he ended up getting shot. He was \n21 years old.\n  By now everybody knows what happened over the weekend in New Orleans. \nA gunman opened fire on people who were marching in a neighborhood \nMother's Day parade. The FBI described it as a flareup of street \nviolence which resulted in 19 people being wounded, 10 men, 7 women, a \nboy, and a girl. The children were both 10 years old. Luckily they were \njust grazed by the bullets, and they were reported to be in good \ncondition.\n  There are so many weapons on our streets today, and most of them are \nillegal. These shootings happen day in and day out. Mostly it is not \nthe same situation as what happened in New Orleans. Mostly it is not 19 \npeople being shot at a parade. Mostly it is just one-on-one gun \nviolence, but we refuse to do anything about it.\n  Since the tragedy in Newtown, CT, 3,966 have died from guns, and our \nresponse is nothing. It was awful enough to read about the violence at \nthat Mother's Day parade, but I want everybody to know what kind of \nMother's Day Nicole Hockley, the mother of Dylan, had on Sunday, what \nkind of Mother's Day it was for Nelba Marquez-Greene, the mother of \nAna, what kind of Mother's Day Francine Wheeler had without her son Ben \nor Jackie Barden had without her son Daniel.\n  As awful as it was to think of 19 people being shot in New Orleans at \na Mother's Day parade, it was just as horrifying to read an op-ed these \nfour mothers submitted yesterday on Mother's Day. They wrote:\n\n       The gravity of the moment that comes with holding your \n     child for the first time--looking into their eyes, rocking \n     them to sleep, allowing their breath to fill your heart, \n     marveling at how nature has taken a part of you and a part of \n     your husband to create someone uniquely beautiful--the \n     seriousness of that moment is only eclipsed by the moment you \n     discover that your little boy or little girl is forever gone, \n     just a few hours after watching them wave at you from the \n     school bus window.\n\n  These mothers said:\n\n       We are constantly asked, ``How do you go on?'' The answer \n     lies in the promise we made to our children when they were \n     born, and perhaps more important, the promise we made when \n     they were so senselessly taken from us.\n\n  That promise for those four mothers is to do something and try to \nmake sure that never ever happens again. The promise they made was \nbigger than that. They are trying to do something for the 4,000 \nfamilies who have lost sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, husbands, and \nwives since Sandy Hook happened.\n  Nicole, Nelba, Francine, and Jackie came to Washington, DC, day after \nday, week after week, and pleaded with this place to do something. They \nwere joined over that period of time by hundreds of other family \nmembers also representing the 3,966 families who have been grieving \nsince then.\n  There has been some level of optimism that we have the capacity here \nto revisit this legislation; that sometime later this year we can take \nanother shot at trying to make sure another Sandy Hook doesn't happen. \nWe can take another moment to reflect on whether it is OK that \nthousands of criminals can go onto the Internet or walk into a gun show \nand get a gun without ever having to show they have the legal capacity \nto do that. I hope that is the case.\n  As a means to getting people to that moment where we can try to have \nsome coming together on behalf of all of these families, I encourage \neverybody to read this op-ed written by Nicole and Nelba and Francine \nand Jackie. It is called ``Keeping A Mother's Promise.'' Because if, \nafter reading this, people in this Chamber can look these mothers in \nthe eye and say that in the wake of Sandy Hook and in the wake of 4,000 \nother deaths since then, our answer in the Senate is to do nothing, \nthen what on Earth are we here for?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington \nPost article following my remarks.\n  The article further said that the ``unusual fundraising push'' comes \nafter Congress has repeatedly rejected the administration's requests \nfor additional funds to set up the Affordable Health Care Act. The \narticle said many of the Secretary's calls have recruited support for \nEnroll America, described as the most prominent nonprofit working on \nthe health care law's implementation. Its president, Anne Filipic--the \narticle goes on to say--joined the group in January after serving as \nWhite House deputy director for public engagement.\n  Today, the New York Times included an article by Robert Pear: \n``Cabinet Secretary Solicits Large Donations to Publicize Health Care \nLaw.'' I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. In the article, it said:\n\n       . . . Ms. Sebelius had made calls soliciting support from \n     the health care industry, including insurance and \n     pharmaceutical executives.\n       . . . . a spokesman for Ms. Sebelius, said she had \n     suggested that health care executives and others support the \n     work of Enroll America, a private nonprofit group that shares \n     the president's goal of securing coverage for people without \n     insurance.\n       An insurance executive said that some insurers had been \n     asked for $1 million [in] donations, and that ``bigger \n     companies have been asked for a lot more.''\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\n       Administration officials said private donations were needed \n     because Congress had provided much less money than Mr. Obama \n     requested to publicize the new law and get people enrolled in \n     health plans subsidized by the government.\n\n  The article further talks about Ms. Filipic. She worked on Mr. \nObama's 2008 campaign. She was deputy executive director of the \nDemocratic National Committee. She worked in the Obama White House as \ndeputy director of the Office of Public Engagement. She said her time \nis not political in her work for enroll America.\n  She says:\n\n       We are thrilled to be working with Secretary Sebelius and \n     to have her support.\n\n  Several executives who received these calls for money said ``they \nwere uncomfortable with the discussions because the federal government \nhas the power to approve or reject the health plans they want to sell \nin insurance markets that will be run by federal officials in more than \n30 states.''\n  Secretary Sebelius's fundraising for and coordinating with private \nentities helping to implement the new health care law may be illegal, \nshould cease immediately, and should be fully investigated by Congress.\n  Later this week, I will be sending a letter, with several of my \ncolleagues, to the Government Accountability Office asking them to \nexamine the issue. We will be asking the GAO to examine the amount of \ncoordination between the Department of Health and Human Services and \nEnroll America and whether Secretary Sebelius is trying to do through a \nprivate entity activities that Congress has refused to allow the \nDepartment to do.\n  Such private fundraising, as these articles describe, circumvents the \nconstitutional requirement that only Congress may appropriate funds. If \nthe Secretary and others in her Department are closely coordinating \nwith the activities of Enroll America, which is headed by the former \nWhite House aide, then those actions may be in violation of the Anti-\nDeficiency Act.\n  The limits of the Anti-Deficiency Act were fully explored by Congress \nduring the Iran-Contra incident, when Reagan administration official \nOliver North raised funds and directed their spending through private \nentities in support of Nicaraguan rebels even though Congress had \nrefused to appropriate such funds.\n  This produced a select joint committee of the Congress, including \nmany of its most distinguished Members--the Iran-Contra joint select \ncommittee. The Senate ranking members were Senator Inouye and Senator \nWarren Rudman of New Hampshire. The House leaders were Lee Hamilton and \nDick Cheney, who was the ranking Republican.\n  The report of the Iran-Contra Joint Select Committee--Senate Report \nNo. 100-216--at page 413 said:\n\n       The constitutional plan--\n\n  Referring to the U.S. Constitution--\n\n     did not prohibit the President from urging other countries to \n     give money directly to the Contras.\n\n  The rebel group in Nicaragua.\n\n       But the Constitution does prohibit receipt and expenditure \n     of such funds by this government absent an appropriation. \n     This prohibition may not lawfully be evaded by use of a \n     nominally private entity, if the entity is in reality an arm \n     of the government and the government is able to direct how \n     the money is spent.\n\n  The report also said:\n\n       Congress's exclusive control over the expenditure of funds \n     cannot legally be evaded through the use of gifts or \n     donations to the executive branch. Were it otherwise, a \n     president whose appropriation requests were rejected by \n     Congress could raise money through private sources or third \n     countries for armies, military actions, arms systems or even \n     domestic programs.\n\n  Let me read this again. This is the joint committee:\n\n       Were it otherwise, a president whose appropriation requests \n     were rejected by Congress could raise money through private \n     sources or from third countries for armies, military actions, \n     arms systems or even domestic programs.\n\n  That is page 412, page 413 of the Iran-Contra joint select committee \nreport.\n  Friday's Washington Post reported that the Secretary's spokesman said \nSebelius is working with private entities on ``our mission'' of \nimplementing health care law activities, although Congress has refused \nto appropriate more funds. If the Department of Health and Human \nServices closely coordinates with Enroll America and with other such \nentities, then the analogy with Iran-Contra is strong.\n  It is hard for me to see the difference. There is a difference in \nwhere Oliver North got his money in 1985, 1986, and 1987 with Iran-\nContra. Some of it came from the hostages-for-arms sale. But the \nquestion is not as much where the money comes from--although in this \ncase the Secretary may be raising it from people she regulates, which \ncould also be illegal--the question is where the money is going. In the \ncase of Iran-Contra, the money was going to a private entity, \nsupporting a rebel army in Nicaragua, in contravention of the Boland \namendment passed by Congress. In other words, Congress had said no, and \nthe administration did it anyway.\n  That is precisely, it seems to me, what is happening here. Congress \nhas said: No, we are not going to appropriate any more money--or as \nmuch as you want--to implement the health care law. And the Secretary \nappears to be raising money from people she regulates, to give it to \nprivate entities with whom she coordinates, to do what Congress has \nrefused to do.\n  The problem with that, first, is the Constitution of the United \nStates gives the power of the purse to the U.S. Congress, in Article I. \nNo. 2, there is a Federal law that says you cannot do through private \nentities what Congress has refused to do. That is called the Anti-\nDeficiency law. And, No. 3, there are some Federal laws about raising \nmoney from people you regulate for whatever purpose.\n  The Secretary's activities may violate those Federal laws prohibiting \nraising private funds from those she regulates. Federal law permits a \nnarrow band of private fundraising activities, but this has always been \ninterpreted very narrowly.\n  This would not be the first violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act by \nthe Secretary's HHS. The General Accountability Office found HHS in \nviolation of the Anti-Deficiency Act three times last year.\n  I am most concerned that the Secretary's actions reflect a deep \ndisregard, running throughout the administration, for the \nconstitutional role of the elected representatives in the legislative \nbranch.\n  We saw it in the President's decision in January of 2012 to bypass \nthe Senate's role of advice and consent and make appointments--recess \nappointments, which are authorized by the Constitution--at a time when \nthe Senate said it was not in recess. A Federal court quickly ruled \nthese appointments were unconstitutional, because the Senate was not in \nrecess, but the individuals continue to show up at the National Labor \nRelations Board and pretend they have the authority to issue decisions.\n  We see this in a number of executive orders the President has used to \ncircumvent Congress on issues as important as immigration enforcement \nand in the number of czars whose responsibilities are intended for \nroles that need the Senate's advice and consent.\n  We see it at the Department of Education, where the Secretary is \nturning a simple waiver authority in No Child Left Behind into a \nconditional waiver with the Secretary using his authority to make \ndecisions that should be made by Congress or should be made locally by \nState and local governments.\n  The HHS Secretary's actions may follow an administration pattern, but \nin this case it is in a pattern that appears it may be illegal and it \ndemands investigation.\n  So I will be, as I said, with other Members of Congress, later this \nweek, sending a letter to the Government Accountability Office, asking \nthem to look at these facts.\n  Mr. President, I wish to read a few paragraphs from the Iran-Contra \nreport that was issued by the Joint Select Committee in the late 1980s:\n\n       The Constitution contemplates that the Government will \n     conduct its affairs only with funds appropriated by Congress. \n     By resorting to funds not appropriated by Congress--indeed \n     funds denied the executive branch by Congress--Administration \n     officials committed a transgression far more basic than a \n     violation of the Boland Amendment.\n\n  That was the amendment that said you cannot use Federal dollars to \nsupport rebels in Nicaragua.\n\n       The power of the purse--\n\n  Continued the joint select committee. This was written at a time when \nwe had a Democratic Congress.\n\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\n\n       The power of the purse, which the Framers vested in \n     Congress, has long been recognized as ``the most important \n     simple curb in the Constitution on Presidential Power.'' The \n     Framers were determined not to combine the power of the purse \n     and the power of the sword in the same branch of government. \n     . . . The constitutional process that lodges control of \n     government expenditures exclusively in Congress is the \n     Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits an officer of the \n     United States from authorizing an expenditure that has not \n     been the subject of a Congressional appropriation or that \n     exceeds the amount of any applicable appropriation.\n\n  Thus, the Anti-Deficiency Act provides:\n\n       An officer or employee of the United States Government may \n     not make or authorize an expenditure or authorization \n     exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for \n     the expenditure or obligation; or involve [the] government in \n     a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an \n     appropriation is made unless authorized by law.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks these excerpts from the joint committee's report; and I refer \nthe Record to Article I, Section 8 and Article 1, Section 9 of the \nConstitution, which says:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . .\n\n  Then two other things. One is the purported authority that the \nSecretary's spokesman is citing for her actions in raising money. I \nhave not seen the authority for raising money from people she \nregulates. But 42 U.S.C. section 300u-1(a) talks about grants and \ncontracts for research programs, and says:\n\n       The Secretary is authorized to conduct and support by grant \n     or contract (and encourage others to support) research in \n     health information and health promotion, preventive health \n     services, and education in the appropriate use of health \n     care. Applications for grants and contracts under this \n     section shall be subject to appropriate peer review.\n\n  This small section relates to support for contracts for research and \ninformation programs in the form of grants or contracts. The \nparenthetical, ``encourage others to support'' has to be read as \nencouraging others to support such programs. It is far-fetched to say \nit gives the Secretary authority to encourage third parties to give \nmoney to nonprofits providing ObamaCare information that the Department \nof Health and Human Services cannot fund directly because Congress has \nrefused to appropriate.\n  This small section and the words in parenthesis cannot amend the \nConstitution of the United States and invalidate Article I. This \nsection cannot supersede the Anti-Deficiency Act, according to the \nlanguage of the Joint Committee. There is obviously a way to have \nappropriate public-private contracts. We have them all throughout \ngovernment, public-private associations to try to improve our country. \nWe do that with HIV/AIDS, we do it with a whole variety of things.\n  When I was Education Secretary, I worked with the first President \nBush to set up the New American Schools Development Corporation, which \nencouraged a private corporation headed by former New Jersey Governor \nTom Kean, which would raise money to create models for private schools.\n  Then later on President Bush 1 asked Congress to do some things in \nsupport of those schools. All of us encouraged that, but that was quite \ndifferent. That was an effort that would be typical of many public-\nprivate partnerships in which the Federal Government is involved, where \nin this case we said we want to encourage the support of model schools. \nHere is a private corporation that is doing that. We encourage that. \nCongress was not objecting to that. Congress has not said: You cannot \ndo that. Congress has not been asked to vote on an appropriation for \nthe New American Schools Development Corporation. Congress had not \nsaid: You cannot do that.\n  So that would be true with dozens, may be hundreds of public-private \npartnerships between the Federal Government and private organizations \nfor the same goal. But what we are talking about, and why the analogy \nbetween what Secretary Sebelius is doing and what Oliver North was \ndoing in the Reagan administration in the late 1980s is so strong, is \nbecause in each case the money seems to be raised privately and spent \nthrough private entities for a function for which Congress has refused \nto appropriate money.\n  It is not so much where the money came from, it is more where the \nmoney is going. The Constitution itself, in Article I, makes it \nabsolutely clear no one can appropriate dollars for a Federal program \nother than the Congress of the United States. A subterfuge that goes \naround that, seeks to go around that by raising private money, putting \nit in private entities for the same purpose that Congress has either \nrefused to appropriate money for or said that you cannot do, that is \noutside the Constitution. It is not allowed by the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and it is against the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n  Then there is the separate question of whether it is appropriate to \nraise money from people the Secretary regulates. I am deeply concerned \nabout this. I hope the Secretary will stop this action. I hope the \npublic-private partnerships we have throughout government will continue \nwhere they are appropriate, but we need for the executive branch of \ngovernment to show proper respect to the people of this country who \nelect their Members of Congress.\n  We are Article I. They are Article II. The purpose of the power of \nappropriations is to put a curb on the executive branch. If the \nCongress says no, then the executive cannot spend money, nor can the \nexecutive go through a subterfuge of private organizations and private \nfundraising in support of the very same objective that Congress has \nrefused to approve.\n  In this case, the Secretary seems to say the reason they are doing \nthat is because Congress has refused to appropriate more money to \nimplement the health care law. That seems to me to be just admitting a \nviolation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, admitting a violation of the \nproper division of responsibilities in the Constitution.\n  Yes, Congress has refused to do that, but that is the Congress's \nprivilege to do that. When the Congress does that, the administration \nmay not proceed to spend the money the Congress has not authorized, \nwhether directly through the government or indirectly through private \nentities.\n  Later this week we will be asking the Government Accountability \nOffice to look into these facts. I am sure we will be hearing more \nabout it. I would hope in the meantime the Secretary will stop making \nthe phone calls, stop coordinating with private entities to do things \nthat Congress has specifically refused to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks an article published July 8, 1991, ``Bush Sets Up Foundation \nto Start Model Schools'' as an example of an appropriate way to have a \npublic-private partnership or a private enterprise that is encouraged \nby the government but not in a way that seeks to do something Congress \nhas refused to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to also have printed in the \nRecord the names of the members of the Iran-Contra select committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Washington Post, May 10, 2013]\n\n Budget Request Denied, Sebelius Turns to Health Executives To Finance \n                               Obamacare\n\n                            (By Sarah Kliff)\n\n       Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has \n     gone, hat in hand, to health industry officials, asking them \n     to make large financial donations to help with the effort to \n     implement President Obama's landmark health-care law, two \n     people familiar with the outreach said.\n       Her unusual fundraising push comes after Congress \n     repeatedly rejected the Obama administration's requests for \n     additional funds to set up the Affordable Care Act, leaving \n     HHS to implement the president's signature legislative \n     accomplishment on what officials have described as a \n     shoestring budget.\n       Over the past three months, Sebelius has made multiple \n     phone calls to health industry executives, community \n     organizations and church groups and asked that they \n     contribute whatever they can to nonprofit groups that are \n     working to enroll uninsured Americans and increase awareness \n     of the law, according to an HHS official and an industry \n     person familiar with the secretary's\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\n     activities. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk \n     openly about private discussions.\n       An HHS spokesperson said Sebelius was within the bounds of \n     her authority in asking for help.\n       But Republicans charged that Sebelius's outreach was \n     improper because it pressured private companies and other \n     groups to support the Affordable Care Act. The latest \n     controversy has emerged as the law faces a string of \n     challenges from GOP lawmakers in Washington and skepticism \n     from many state officials across the country.\n       ``To solicit funds from health-care executives to help pay \n     for the implementation of the President's $2.6 trillion \n     health spending law is absurd,'' Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) \n     said in a statement. ``I will be seeking more information \n     from the Administration about these actions to help better \n     understand whether there are conflicts of interest and if it \n     violated federal law.''\n       Federal regulations do not allow department officials to \n     fundraise in their professional capacity. They do, however, \n     allow Cabinet members to solicit donations as private \n     citizens ``if you do not solicit funds from a subordinate or \n     from someone who has or seeks business with the Department, \n     and you do not use your official title,'' according to \n     Justice Department regulations.\n       HHS spokesman Jason Young added that a special section in \n     the Public Health Service Act allows the secretary to support \n     and encourage others to support nonprofit groups working to \n     provide health information and conduct other public-health \n     activities.\n       Sebelius is working ``with a full range of stakeholders who \n     share in the mission of getting Americans the help they need \n     and deserve,'' Young said. ``Part of our mission is to help \n     uninsured Americans take advantage of new, quality affordable \n     insurance options that are coming thanks to the health law.''\n       Young said that Sebelius did not solicit for funds directly \n     from industries that HHS regulates, such as insurance \n     companies and hospitals, but rather asked them to contribute \n     in whatever way they can.\n       But the industry official who had knowledge of the calls \n     but did not participate directly in them said there was a \n     clear insinuation by the administration that the insurers \n     should give financially to the nonprofits.\n       Meredith McGehee, policy director for the nonpartisan \n     Campaign Legal Center, which researches government ethics \n     issues, said she was troubled by Sebelius's activities \n     because the secretary seemed to be ``using the power of \n     government to compel giving or insinuate that giving is \n     going to be looked at favorably by the government.''\n       The success of the Affordable Care Act largely hinges on \n     whether enough people sign up for insurance coverage. If only \n     a small number of sick people participate, premiums would \n     spike.\n       But spreading information about the law to the 30 million \n     uninsured Americans has been a struggle, partly because there \n     isn't enough money to fund the effort, HHS officials have \n     argued.\n       The Affordable Care Act included $1 billion to be used in \n     overall implementation of the law. Congressional Budget \n     Office projections, however, estimated that federal agencies \n     will need between $5 billion and $10 billion to get the law \n     up and running over the next decade. And because many states \n     have refused to partner with the federal government in \n     setting up the law, the burden on HHS has grown.\n       HHS has repeatedly requested additional funds from Congress \n     to assist in the implementing but has been turned down.\n       After Congress rejected a request in March for nearly $1 \n     billion in additional spending for fiscal 2013, the White \n     House asked for $1.5 billion for fiscal 2015 to set up and \n     run dozens of exchanges that will provide Americans options \n     for health insurance. The new marketplaces will launch in \n     October for open enrollment.\n       ``We requested additional money . . . but we didn't receive \n     any additional funding for the exchanges,'' Ellen Murray, \n     HHS's assistant secretary for financial resources, said last \n     month at a budget briefing. ``So we've had to come up with a \n     Plan B. We've been working very hard to develop that.''\n       In 2012, budget documents show that HHS pulled hundreds of \n     millions of dollars from programs not specifically earmarked \n     for the Affordable Care Act's implementation.\n       On top of that, the agency announced Thursday that it would \n     use $150 million in Affordable Care Act funds meant to build \n     additional community health centers to train thousands of \n     health-care outreach workers at facilities that already \n     exist.\n       ``Investing in health centers for outreach and enrollment \n     assistance provides one more way the Obama administration is \n     helping consumers understand their options and enroll in \n     affordable coverage,'' Secretary Sebelius said in a \n     statement.\n       Many of Sebelius's calls have gone to current supporters of \n     Enroll America, the most prominent nonprofit group working on \n     the health care law's implementation, an HHS official said. \n     Its president, Anne Filipic, joined the group in January \n     after serving as the White House's deputy director for public \n     engagement.\n       ``We all have a lot of work to do between now and the \n     Marketplace opening in October,'' Filipic said in a \n     statement. ``That's why it's so important that the public, \n     private and non-profit sectors are coming together to educate \n     consumers about the opportunities that will be available to \n     them later this year. Secretary Sebelius recognizes how \n     important the work Enroll America is doing and we're thrilled \n     to be working with her.''\n       Health insurers plan to run their own outreach campaigns \n     alongside the work of the Obama administration. They have a \n     vested interest in recruiting Americans to enroll in their \n     specific products rather than those of their competitors.\n       ``As open enrollment gets closer, health plans will be \n     engaged in a variety of innovative outreach activities,'' \n     spokesman Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the trade \n     association America's Health Insurance Plans, said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From The New York Times, May 12, 2013]\n\nCabinet Secretary Solicits Large Donations To Publicize Health Care Law\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington--Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and \n     human services, has solicited sizable donations from the \n     Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and H Block, the tax \n     preparation service, as part of a multimillion-dollar \n     campaign to ensure the success of President Obama's health \n     care law, administration officials said Sunday, even as a \n     leading Senate Republican raised questions about the legality \n     of her efforts.\n       The foundation is expected to contribute as much as $10 \n     million, while H Block is expected to make a smaller \n     donation of about $500,000, the officials said.\n       The senior Republican on the Senate health committee, \n     Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said the fund-raising \n     ``may be illegal.'' He likened it to efforts by the Reagan \n     administration to raise money for rebels fighting the leftist \n     government of Nicaragua in the 1980s, after Congress had \n     restricted the use of federal money. Aides to Mr. Alexander \n     said Sunday that he would ask the Government Accountability \n     Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to examine the \n     propriety of the Obama administration's fund-raising efforts.\n       The Department of Health and Human Services said that Ms. \n     Sebelius's actions to supplement money appropriated by \n     Congress were proper and would continue, despite criticism \n     from Republicans. After first denying that administration \n     officials had engaged in fund-raising, the department \n     confirmed Friday that Ms. Sebelius had made calls soliciting \n     support from the health care industry, including insurance \n     and pharmaceutical executives.\n       Jason Young, a spokesman for Ms. Sebelius, said she had \n     suggested that health care executives and others support the \n     work of Enroll America, a private nonprofit group that shares \n     the president's goal of securing coverage for people without \n     insurance. Several people who received solicitations said \n     that current and former administration officials had \n     suggested seven-figure donations.\n       An insurance executive said that some insurers had been \n     asked for $1 million donations, and that ``bigger companies \n     have been asked for a lot more.''\n       Administration officials said private donations were needed \n     because Congress had provided much less money than Mr. Obama \n     requested to publicize the new law and get people enrolled in \n     health plans subsidized by the government.\n       The Johnson Foundation describes itself as the largest \n     philanthropy devoted exclusively to public health. H Block \n     sees a large role for itself in helping low- and middle-\n     income people apply for tax credits that can be used to buy \n     private health insurance.\n       While Ms. Sebelius asked for support from health care \n     executives, she did not make ``a direct fund-raising appeal'' \n     to entities regulated by the government, Mr. Young said. In \n     any event, he said, under a decades-old federal law, the \n     secretary can encourage support for private nonprofit \n     entities promoting public health.\n       The president of Enroll America, Anne Filipic, worked on \n     Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign, became an aide to Ms. Sebelius, \n     was later deputy executive director of the Democratic \n     National Committee and then worked in the Obama White House \n     as deputy director of the Office of Public Engagement. But a \n     former Obama administration official, who spends time raising \n     money or Enroll America, said its work was ``not political.''\n       In an interview, Ms. Filipic said, ``We are thrilled to be \n     working with Secretary Sebelius and to have her support.'' \n     Ms. Filipic refused to say how mut money had-been raised \n     through the efforts of Ms. Sebelius, refused to disclose the \n     budget of Enroll America, and refused to say if the group had \n     been requesting million-dollar donations. Mr. Young, the \n     spokesman for Ms. Sebelius, said that her fund-raising \n     efforts began in March, around the third anniversary of the \n     signing of the health care law.\n       Insurance executives said they supported the president's \n     goal of maximizing enrollment in the new health care program \n     and encouraging healthy people under 40 to sign up, so \n     insurers would not be stuck with a pool of older, less \n     healthy subscribers. But several executives said they were \n     uncomfortable with the discussions because the federal \n     government has the power to approve or reject the health \n     plans they want to sell in insurance markets that will be run \n     by federal officials in more than 30 states.\n       Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, \n     a liberal-leaning consumer group, is the founder and chairman \n     of Enroll America. He said that he raised $7 million for the \n     organization in the last two years, and that the group had \n     collected substantially more than $7 million in more \n     donations this year. He confirmed that ``there\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\n     have been solicitations in excess of $1 million.''\n       Health care executives said they were reluctant to make big \n     contributions for several reasons, including the fact that \n     insurers are required to pay more than $100 billion in new \n     taxes over the next 10 years to help defray the cost of \n     expanded coverage. Drug companies must pay new fees totaling \n     $34 billion over the same period.\n                                  ____\n\n       Excerpts of report of the Congressional Committees \n     Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair, Chapter 27, pp 411-413\n       ``The Constitution contemplates that the Government will \n     conduct its affairs only with funds appropriated by Congress. \n     By resorting to funds not appropriated by Congress--indeed \n     funds denied the executive branch by Congress--Administration \n     officials committed a transgression far more basic than a \n     violation of the Boland Amendment.\n       The power of the purse, which the Framers vested in \n     Congress, has long been recognized as ``the most important \n     simple curb in the Constitution on Presidential Power.'' The \n     Framers were determined not to combine the power of the purse \n     and the power of the sword in the same branch of government. \n     . . .\n       When members of the executive branch raised money from \n     third countries and private citizens, took control over that \n     money through the Enterprise, and used it to support the \n     Contras' war in Nicaragua, they bypassed this crucial \n     safeguard in the Constitution. . . .\n       The appropriations clause was intended to give Congress \n     exclusive control of funds spent by the Government, and to \n     give the democratically elected representatives of the people \n     an absolute check on Executive action requiring the \n     expenditure of funds. . . .\n       Congress' exclusive control over the expenditure of funds \n     cannot legally be evaded through the use of gifts or \n     donations made to the executive branch. Were it otherwise, a \n     President whose appropriation requests were rejected by \n     Congress could raise money from private sources or third \n     countries for armies, military actions, arms systems, and \n     even domestic programs. . . .\n       The Constitutional process that lodges control of \n     Government expenditures exclusively in Congress is the Anti-\n     Deficiency Act (31 USC Section 1341) which prohibits an \n     officer of the United States from authorizing an expenditure \n     that has not been the subject of a Congressional \n     appropriation, or that exceeds the amount of any applicable \n     appropriation. Thus it provides:\n       ``An officer or employee of the United States Government \n     may not make or authorize an expenditure or obligation \n     exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for \n     the expenditure or obligation; or involve [the] government in \n     a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an \n     appropriation is made unless authorized by law.''\n       . . . The Constitutional plan did not prohibit the \n     President from urging other countries to give money directly \n     to the Contras. But the Constitution does prohibit receipt \n     and expenditure of such funds by this Government absent an \n     appropriation. This prohibition may not lawfully be evaded by \n     use of a nominally private entity, if the private entity is \n     in reality an arm of the Government and the Government is \n     able to direct how the money is spent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Bush Sets Up Foundation To Start Model Schools\n\n                    (By Karen De Witt, July 9, 1991)\n\n       In a move he described as a milestone in the ``educational \n     revolution'' he outlined in April, President Bush today \n     announced the establishment of a foundation to foster the \n     creation of model schools.\n       In a Rose Garden ceremony, Mr. Bush, who was accompanied by \n     Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, introduced 18 business, \n     education and political leaders as members of the board of \n     the New American Schools Development Corporation, saying they \n     would help ``set aside stale preconceptions'' about how \n     schools should work and ``seek nothing less than a new \n     generation of schools.''\n       Mr. Bush has said he hopes the private, nonprofit \n     corporation will persuade businesses to donate as much as \n     $200 million for the creation of 535 experimental schools \n     intended to be models of reform for the nation. The schools, \n     one in each Congressional district and two more for each \n     state, are part of Mr. Bush's education legislation now being \n     considered by Congress.\n       ``We want to encourage and experiment,'' Mr. Bush said. \n     ``No one will conduct our educational revolution for us. \n     We've got to do it ourselves. We've done enough hand-wringing \n     about the state of our schools and now let's act.''\n       The Rand Corporation's Institute on Education and Training \n     will serve as the research arm for the new corporation. An \n     advisory panel of educators is to assist the corporation.\n       Thomas H. Kean, the former New Jersey Governor and chairman \n     of the corporation, said the group had already received $30 \n     million in donations. Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher and \n     former diplomat, is a member of the board and donated a $10 \n     million ``challenge'' grant to encourage other corporations \n     to help.\n       But with a recession, some companies that plan to \n     contribute to the new program are cutting back on financial \n     commitments to existing education projects.\n       The Exxon Corporation, for example, told Theodore R. Sizer, \n     a professor of education at Brown University, that it would \n     give him one year's worth of financial aid instead of the \n     five years he had requested for his Coalition of Essential \n     Schools, a nationwide group of schools that have been \n     promoting innovative teaching and learning techniques.\n       Edward F. Ahnert, executive director of the Exxon Education \n     Foundation, said, ``We have not made a decision to cut back \n     our longer-term funding but rather to review our long-term \n     commitments to his program in the light of the New American \n     School Program.''\n       Here is complete list of members of the board of the New \n     American Schools Development Corporation.

Mr. President, Vermonters are fiercely proud of those who \nserve in our National Guard. For decades--and never more so than in the \nlast decade--when the Nation sounded the call to service, the Vermont \nNational Guard has answered. Today, I would like to pay tribute to Ed \nand Karen Matayka, two Vermont National Guard soldiers whose \nperseverance in the face of huge odds is an inspiration to all.\n  The Army brought Ed and Karen together--they met at combat medic \ntraining in Texas--and they have been an Army family ever since. The \nMataykas deployed twice together, once to Kuwait immediately following \ntheir wedding, and a second time to Afghanistan with Vermont's 86th \nInfantry Brigade Combat Team in 2010. It was during that second \ndeployment when tragedy struck.\n  While running a convoy mission in Afghanistan, Ed's vehicle was hit \nby an improvised explosive device, leaving him with multiple injuries, \nincluding the amputation of his legs. Some doctors questioned whether \nEd would survive.\n  Yet he never gave up. With Karen's support and the assistance of \nskilled Army doctors, Ed is well on the road to recovery. Not only is \nEd making great strides in his personal health, with newly authorized \nassistance for in\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\nvitro fertilization for service members, Ed and Karen recently welcomed \nthe arrival of twins: Ryan David and Alana Marie. They are the first \nArmy family to have used the technique after Congress passed a law \nauthorizing TRICARE coverage of reproductive therapies for military \nfamilies dealing with the consequences of catastrophic injury.\n  As a Vermonter, I am proud of Ed and Karen. Ryan and Alana are surely \nlucky to have them as parents.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent U.S. Army article \nentitled ``Double amputee gets another chance of starting family'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n             [From the United States Army, April 24, 2013]\n\n         Double Amputee Gets Another Chance of Starting Family\n\n            (By Maria Gallegos, Brooke Army Medical Center)\n\n       San Antonio.--The only thing he remembered was waking up \n     five weeks later in Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in \n     Germany--from a tragedy that nearly cost him his life and the \n     chance of starting a family.\n\n\n                             THE BEGINNING\n\n       Thirteen years ago, Ed and Karen Matayka, both combat \n     medics with the Vermont National Guard, met and fell in love \n     during their advanced training course at what is now Joint \n     Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n       Soon after, they married in 2004 and deployed together six \n     months later to Kuwait in 2005.\n       ``We honeymooned in Kuwait,'' said Karen.\n       They returned to Vermont a year later and were activated \n     again in 2010 to go to Afghanistan, but this time they \n     promised each other they would start a family after their \n     deployment. Just after four months in theater, those plans \n     looked to be lost.\n       In July 2010, Ed was on a convoy mission in Afghanistan \n     when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device \n     that caused multiple injuries to his body, including the loss \n     of his legs, fractures to his spinal cord, a traumatic brain \n     injury, and two strokes that caused nerve damage to his left \n     side of the body. The blast also killed his driver, Spc. Ryan \n     Grady, and wounded four other Vermont Soldiers.\n       ``The doctors told me he probably won't survive,'' Karen \n     recalled.\n       Because of the severity of his multiple injuries, he was \n     treated and transferred to several military medical centers \n     across the country before he was transferred to Brooke Army \n     Medical Center, or BAMC. At BAMC, he receives inpatient care \n     at the San Antonio Military Medical Center, or SAMMC and \n     specialty rehabilitation care at the Center for the Intrepid.\n       ``BAMC is the best place for amputee rehab, (so) we needed \n     to get Ed here,'' Karen said.\n       Ed has been rehabilitating at the CFI, BAMC's outpatient \n     rehab center, since August 2011. He is now learning to walk \n     again.\n\n\n                         IN VITRO FERTILIZATION\n\n       Even though their plans of starting a family were \n     temporarily on hold, their desire to start a family was never \n     in question.\n       ``We really wanted to have a family long before this \n     happened, and we are not going to let his injuries change our \n     plans,'' said Karen.\n       ``We had decided together that we wanted kids--we just \n     wanted to share some love, help guide the next generation,'' \n     Ed added.\n       They turned to in vitro fertilization in hopes of making \n     their dreams of a family a reality. The IVF process is a \n     procedure in which eggs are removed and joined with a sperm \n     outside of the body to fertilize and the resulting embryo is \n     then placed back into the uterus.\n       They first started the IVF process, at the Boston's veteran \n     hospital where Ed was receiving his spinal cord rehab--but \n     because of the complexity of the injuries, the procedure was \n     not successful.\n       After eight months of rehab at BAMC, and with Ed gaining \n     more strength and independence, they decided to try again.\n       ``We were initially told we had to pay for it ourselves, \n     which we were fine with, and we didn't care. We wanted to do \n     it, and then we were told that TRICARE was working on a \n     policy that would change its IVF coverage for service members \n     with severe injuries,'' Karen said.\n       A week before their IVF transfer, a bill was passed to \n     cover reproductive services to active service members who \n     have suffered from catastrophic injuries resulting in \n     infertility. Since 2003, more than 1,800 U.S. military \n     members have suffered injuries in Iraq or Afghanistan that \n     impact their reproductive tract.\n       ``TRICARE rules changed and we were 100 percent covered,'' \n     said Karen.\n       After their first attempt of the IVF transfer process, \n     Karen became pregnant.\n       Their twins, Ryan David and Alana Marie, were born March \n     21, at 28 weeks.\n       ``The babies were born ahead of time but are doing very \n     well here (SAMMC neonatal intensive care unit),'' Karen said.\n       Ed is the first wounded warrior, nationwide, who has \n     successfully had the IVF transfer procedure since the new \n     TRICARE policy was implemented.\n       ``It was an honor to help the Mataykas achieve their dream \n     of having a family. They are true American heroes and having \n     the opportunity to directly help our wounded warriors \n     represents the most rewarding aspect of our profession,'' \n     said Maj. (Dr.) Jeremy King, director of IVF, who performed \n     their transfer.\n       Although their desire of starting a family was finally \n     complete, they will never forget the tragedy that happened \n     almost two years ago.\n       ``We named our boy after Ryan, the driver who passed away \n     from the blast and David who saved Ed's life by applying \n     tourniquets to his legs,'' Karen said. ``They are our true \n     heroes.''\n       Both praised the care they received throughout the \n     procedure.\n       ``The care here is great. The reproductive and \n     endocrinology staff is phenomenal,'' Karen added, as Ed also \n     agreed. ``The entire staff is extremely caring and we all \n     bonded throughout the whole process. We greatly appreciate \n     everyone's care.''\n       ``We have already referred two other warriors of the \n     services here at SAMMC,'' Ed said.\n       ``The Mataykas were a pleasure to work with,'' said King. \n     ``IVF process is physically and emotionally challenging, but \n     their attitude was always upbeat, positive and optimistic. \n     That, I believe, helped them get through the obstacles and \n     also lifted up our spirits whenever we saw them.''\n\n\n                              THE SERVICE\n\n       The In Vitro Fertilization and Reproductive Endocrinology \n     services had been offered at Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical \n     Center since 1996. The program relocated to SAMMC in June \n     2011 due to the Base Realignment and Closure law.\n       SAMMC's IVF program offers the full gamut of diagnostic \n     testing and infertility therapy treatments in the same \n     location.\n       ``We have over 1,000 babies as a result of our IVF program \n     and it is the only onsite full service IVF center staffed \n     solely by active duty physicians in Department of Defense,'' \n     said Col. (Dr.) Matthew Retzloff, Reproductive Endocrinology \n     chief. ``We offer this service to active duty members and \n     their dependents, on site at SAMMC, from start to finish.''\n       Reproductive endocrinologists provide full evaluation and \n     treatment of all forms of infertility, polycystic ovarian \n     disease, premature ovarian failure, hirsutism, recurrent \n     pregnancy loss, reproductive tract anatomic abnormalities, \n     endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome and complicated \n     menopausal problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3366-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3366-S3367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORECES\n\n\nArmy Staff Sergeant Rex Schad, Air Force Staff Sergeant Daniel Fannin, \n  Army Private First Class Charles P.

The 26- \nyear-old squad leader was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor \nRegiment, 1st Armor Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, out of \nFort Stewart, GA. Rex was killed in Jalrez District, Afghanistan, after \na member of the Afghan security forces opened fire on Rex and his \nfellow soldiers. Also killed was Army CPT Andrew Pedersen-Keel. Family \nand friends of Rex said that he took the idea of serving seriously and \nunderstood that it could require him to make the ultimate sacrifice for \nhis country. He also had many family members serve in various branches \nof the military including his mother, brother, an uncle, and his \ngrandfather. Rex is survived by his mother, Ms. Colleen Whipple, of \nEdmond, OK.\n  Air Force SSgt Daniel Fannin, of Morehead, KY, died on April 28, \n2013, in the crash of an MC-12 aircraft near Kandahar Airfield, \nAfghanistan. Also killed in the incident were Capt. Brandon L. Cyr, \nCapt. Reid K. Nishizuka, and SSgt Richard A. Dickson. Daniel, who had \njust turned 30 three weeks prior, was assigned to the Air Force's 552nd \nOperations Support Squadron at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. \nIn addition to being a 12-year veteran of the Air Force, Daniel also \nlived for several years in Oklahoma with his wife Sonya of Oklahoma \nCity. As his family recently said, Daniel died just as he lived--\nserving God and others. He died honorably serving his country so that \nwe may continue to enjoy the freedoms that many of us take for granted.\n  Army PFC Charles P.

He was among five soldiers who died on May 4, 2013, after \nthey were attacked by an enemy IED in Maiwand, Afghanistan. Brandon and \nhis soldiers were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 36th Infantry, 1st \nBrigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, at Fort Bliss, TX. Brandon \nenlisted in the Army in 2005 and deployed to Iraq 3 years later. Upon \nreceiving his commission in May 2011, he graduated the Infantry Basic \nOfficer Leaders Course and Airborne School. First Lieutenant Landrum is \nsurvived by his wife, one son, and one daughter.\n  Our soldiers and airmen demonstrated courage and honor by \nvolunteering for service in the Army and Air Force. While the deaths of \nthese brave men are tragic, their lives encourage all of us to \ndemonstrate courage and honor commensurate with their sacrifice. The \nfact that these men died alongside their fellow warriors is a reminder \nfor us to stick by our men and women in uniform who continue to fight \nthe enemies of our country.

However, we \nhave suffered three since the beginning of 2013, and I would like to \ntake this opportunity to remember the three Alaskans who have paid the \nultimate sacrifice for the heroes they are.\n  Today I recognize three men, each of different backgrounds but all \nunited in their bravery and willingness to go the extra step. John \n15:13 says: ``There is no greater love than this, that a man lay down \nhis life for his friend.'' In Alaska, where we treat strangers in need \nof a helping hand as friends, these three individuals demonstrated a \nspirit not only worthy of their profession but that of a State and a \npeople forever grateful for their sacrifice.\n\n\n                             Thomas Madole\n\n  In law enforcement there is spirited debate over who walks the \ntoughest beat in America. The men and women of corrections think they \nhave won that debate hands down, but I would suggest that Alaska's \nvillage public safety officers, or VPSOs, our first responders in the \nlast frontier, are formidable contenders.\n  Alaska's VPSOs wear all four hats of first response. They are at the \nsame time police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, \nand search-and-rescue coordinators. They are the sole first responders \nin the bush villages of Alaska--villages with populations that might \nnumber 400 to 600 people--and carry out their dangerous work with no \nbackup in the immediate community. The closest backup is often an \nAlaska State trooper in a rural hub, who must fly in to the village by \nair--assuming weather conditions allow the troopers to fly. I would \nsubmit to you that our village public safety officers, who patrol \nunarmed, in fact walk the toughest beat in America.\n  Thomas Madole, age 54, was the village public safety officer in \nManakotak, AK. Manakotak has a population of about 400. It is in \nAlaska's Bristol Bay region. Ninety-four percent of its residents are \nAlaska Native descendants of the original people to occupy the area. \nOfficer Madole was killed on March 19, 2013 while responding to a \nreport of a possibly suicidal person. He was unarmed. His assailant was \nnot.\n  There is much to say for how Officer Madole lived his life. He will \nbe remembered as a man of peace. An ordained minister of the Assemblies \nof God Church, he preached and mentored in the Yupik hub community of \nBethel Alaska for 6 years before moving to Manakotak.\n  Patricia Zulkosky, a board member of the Bethel Assemblies of God \nChurch, referred to Madole in this way: ``He was a man of God, he \nwalked his talk.'' And in the community of Manakotak, Madole is \nremembered as a friend and a role model for the youth as much as a cop.\n\n\n                        Mel Nading and Tage Toll\n\n  Alaska is remarkable for many reasons, among which that the \nwilderness begins literally beyond the backyards of our homes. The \nAlaska State troopers rely extensively on aviation resources to get \nwhere they need to go and their pilots are some of the best in the \nworld.\n  Mel Nading, originally a Hawkeye from Manchester, IA, was hired in \nDecember 2000 to be the primary pilot for the Alaska Department of \nPublic Safety's Helo-1. Helo-1 bore the tail number ``N911AA.''\n  During Mel's 13 year career, he was the primary search-and-rescue \npilot for the department and interacted with other agencies to \ncoordinate search and rescue efforts, going on almost-weekly missions. \nMel also provided air support for law enforcement missions. In 2012 \nalone, Mel flew over 200 hours logging 73 rescues and 13 medical \nevacuations. He recovered eight bodies and assisted with two arrests.\n  In 2008, Mel and trooper Sergeant Bryan Barlow shared the Governors \nDenali Award Peak Performance for saving the life of a kayaker caught \nin a bore tide. During that daring rescue, Mel was able to hold the \nhelicopter steady and close to the waters as Barlow leaned out and \npulled the kayaker from Turnagain Arm, saving the man's life. This act \nwas but one of many saves he made in his career.\n  These remarkable numbers, however, are just a small part of what made \nMel a valued member of the team. He was well known and well respected \namong the search and rescue community and was known for his attention \nto safety.\n  Trooper Tage Toll, of Talkeetna, joined the Alaska State troopers in \n2003 after spending 2 years with the Kansas Highway Patrol. He served \nin Fairbanks, Glennallen, and Northway. Then in September of 2009, he \ntransferred to Talkeetna at the gateway to Denali National Park. He was \nan expert marksman and a member of the regional SWAT team what we in \nAlaska refer to as the SERT. Like Mel, Tage was also a pilot and loved \nto fly his Super Cub.\n  On March 30, the Alaska State troopers dispatched Helo-1 to rescue a \nsnowmachiner who crashed near Larson Lake, 7 miles east of Talkeetna. \nMel flew from Anchorage to Talkeetna, picked up Tage and began a \nsearch. The pair found the snowmachiner around 10 p.m. They intended to \nfly to a nearby gas station to rendezvous with EMS personnel. The \nhelicopter crashed a little over an hour later, and there were no \nsurvivors.\n  This National Police Week, as America focuses on the daily sacrifices \nof what those in law enforcement refer to as the ``Thin Blue Line,'' I \nam honored to share the stories of these three outstanding Alaskans, \nwho paid the ultimate sacrifice, with the Senate. In valor, there is \nhope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3367-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3367-S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WWII VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. TESTER.

This journey will no doubt bring about a lot of \nmemories. I hope it will give them a deep sense of pride as well.\n  What they achieved together almost 70 years ago was remarkable. That \nmemorial is a testament to the fact that a grateful nation will never \nforget\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\nwhat they did or what they sacrificed. To us, they were our greatest \ngeneration.

They enlisted in \nunprecedented numbers to defend our freedoms and our values. They \nrepresented the very best of us and made us proud.\n  From a young age I remember playing the bugle at the memorial \nservices of veterans of the first two World Wars. It instilled in me a \nprofound sense of respect that I will never forget.\n  Honoring the service of every generation of American veterans is a \nMontana value.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of Stepping Stones Center, which serves the needs of people \nwith disabilities in Greater Cincinnati and inspires independence and \npathways to helping people achieve their potential. I have visited \nStepping Stones on several occasions and have always been impressed by \ntheir work.\n  Stepping Stones Center was founded in 1963 when a handful of parents \nand friends of children with disabilities established Cincinnati's \nfirst day camp for children with disabilities. These passionate and \nloving parents wanted their children to have opportunities like those \nof their siblings, friends and neighbors.\n  Over the years, Stepping Stones has continued to expand, broadening \nthe scope of services and the ability to reach more families. In the \nearly years, Stepping Stones' services focused on traditional day camp \nopportunities, which were enhanced to provide therapeutic benefits \nincluding outdoor activities, arts and crafts, swimming and games.\n  In 1971, the region's first on-site infant stimulation program was \ndeveloped and Stepping Stones helped launch Cincinnati Mothers of \nSpecial Children in 1974.\n  Partnering with the Rotary Club of Cincinnati, programming for a \nsecond campus was developed for Camp Allyn in Batavia, augmenting \nsummer programs with year-round educational programs, overnight camps \nand initiating services for adults.\n  In response to the growing needs of children with autism, Stepping \nStones launched its innovative Step-Up program as Greater Cincinnati's \nfirst alternative education program for students with severe autism and \nextreme behaviors in 2004. Today, Step-Up serves students from 14 \nschool districts in the region. In 2013, Stepping Stones launched the \nregion's first sensory needs respite and support program for children \nwith autism and other sensory needs and extreme behaviors, filling a \ncritical need for ongoing overnight recreational respites.\n  Since its founding, thousands of high school students in Greater \nCincinnati have been trained and have served as volunteer camp \ncounselors, learning the benefits of giving back to their communities \nand gaining an understanding of occupations that serve those with \nspecial needs. Many special education teachers, therapists and \ndisabilities professionals in Greater Cincinnati can trace their \nvocations to summers volunteering at Stepping Stones.\n  On this occasion I would like to recognize Stepping Stones Center and \nhonor the founders, Margaret--Peggy--Geier, Minor LeBlond and Mary T. \nSchloss, the trailblazers who identified a need, envisioned a solution, \nand then worked tirelessly to make Stepping Stones happen. I salute the \nvolunteers, staff members, donors and parents who carry on their sprit \nevery day, continuing to build pathways to independence for people with \ndisabilities. It is a privilege to recognize this 50 year anniversary, \nand I wish Stepping Stones all the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3368-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3368-S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Sergeant Tristan Mykal Wade\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of SGT Tristan Mykal Wade, \nof Indianapolis, IN. Sergeant Wade was serving in the U.S. Army, \nassigned to the 573rd Clearance Company at White Sands Missile Range in \nAfghanistan. He was serving a 9-month deployment and his unit was \nscheduled to return to White Sands in April.\n  On Friday, March 22, while serving in Qarah Bagh District, Ghazni \nProvince, Afghanistan, enemy forces attacked Sergeant Wade's unit with \nan improvised explosive device and he was killed. Command Sgt. Major \nJoe Medlin of Rock Hill, the ranking enlisted man for the task force, \nstated Sergeant Wade was:\n\n       An outstanding soldier and a true hero. He will certainly \n     be missed by his unit and all of us in Task Force Prowler.\n\n  White Sands Missile Range Commander BG Gen. Gwen Bingham said:\n\n       We thank him for his outstanding service and sacrifice. We \n     will never forget him. Our brave men and women perform a \n     multitude of missions in a magnanimous way in Afghanistan and \n     all places around the globe. They do so selflessly without \n     any expectation of anything in return.\n\n  Certainly, Sergeant Wade is a shining example of this selflessness \nand patriotism.\n  An Indianapolis native, Sergeant Wade attended three different high \nschools while a freshman. He enrolled at Southport High School at the \nbeginning of his sophomore year and joined the football program, which \nhad endured a 10-year plus stretch of losing seasons. Head football \ncoach Bill Peebles remembered Tristan as a cocky young kid who wanted \nto catch touchdown passes and become a Friday-night star. Although \nCoach Peebles didn't expect much from Wade, Tristan represented the \nepitome of the program's goal--exceling in the classroom, in training \nand on the field. Over the following 3 years, Coach Peebles watched \nTristan grow into a leader who helped turn the football program into a \nwinning program. ``He went from wanting to be a Friday-night hero as a \nskinny sophomore, to being a Friday-night hero.'' Peebles said. \nSergeant Wade graduated from Southport High School in 2009.\n  He carried into the Army his enthusiasm for sports where he was a \nmember of the Army volleyball team. Friends and family remember how he \nenjoyed practical jokes and dancing. But most important to Sergeant \nWade was his precious daughter Skylynn of whom he wrote, ``She is my \nworld and I'll truly miss her while in Afghanistan.''\n  While still in high school, Tristan volunteered for the U.S. Army, \nfollowing in the footsteps of his father SGT Daniel L. Wade who had \nbeen to Afghanistan in 2004, and his uncles. He knew he would likely be \ndeployed to active combat zones, but as he was known to do all his \nlife, he demonstrated courage and conviction. ``No matter how scared he \nwas, he never showed it,'' his mother Tisa Wade said.\n  Sergeant Wade was respected and appreciated by his fellow soldiers \nfor his professionalism as well as his personal qualities. As LTC Andre \nBalyoz pointed out in his eulogy, Sergeant Wade was:\n\n       A natural leader, the type who took charge and made things \n     happen. He always took care of and protected his Soldiers.\n\n  And although the gravity of his mission was always with him, \nLieutenant Colonel Balyoz said that:\n\n       Tristan was someone who was always happy, always in a good \n     mood and he could very quickly cheer up those around him. His \n     positive attitude was certainly contagious.\n\n  Prior to his service in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, \nSergeant Wade served in Iraq. During those deployments he earned the \nArmy Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraqi Army \nGood Conduct Medal and the Combat Action Badge. On April 6, 2013, \nSergeant Wade's family was presented the Bronze Star and Purple Heart \nin honor of the supreme sacrifice he made for his fellow Americans and \nthe United States.\n  Sergeant Wade is survived and mourned by his wife, Alisha Morales of \nLas Cruces, NM, his mother Tisa Wade and father Daniel Wade, Jr., both \nof Indianapolis, and his daughter Skylynn\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\nMarie Wade. In addition, he is survived by his brothers Cory Alan Lee, \nZachary Daniel Wade and his fiance Victoria Lloyd; his niece Molly \nDiane Wade; maternal grandmother Denise Webb; maternal grandfather, \nGerald Lee, Sr.; paternal grandmother Betsy Brown and her husband Tommy \nBrown; paternal grandfather, Daniel Lee Wade, Sr., and his wife Linda \nas well as several aunts, uncles, cousins and close friends. He was \npreceded in death by his brother Adrian David Wade.\n  Sergeant Tristan Mykal Wade is a quintessential Hoosier, and true \nAmerican hero. Let us always remember and treasure the memory of this \nstalwart, brave man and honor him for protecting our treasured country. \nMay God welcome him home and give comfort to his family and friends. \nThank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3369-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL CHARLES McGEE\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to join the Columbia \nCollege Alumni Association in recognizing one of the college's most \nprestigious alumni. Colonel Charles McGee is among the most decorated \nand accomplished Air Force aviators, holding an Air Force record of 409 \nfighter combat missions flown in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. I am \nproud to applaud him for his invaluable service and contributions to \nthe Air Force, Kansas City, and to our country.\n  Charles E. McGee was one of the renowned Tuskegee Airmen of World War \nII and continued his service as a career officer in the U.S. Air Force \nfor 30 years. He was born in Cleveland, OH on December 7, 1919, and as \na young man, McGee was a member of the Boy Scouts of America, BSA, \nachieving the rank of Eagle Scout on August 9, 1940. He later served in \ndistrict and regional positions in the BSA. At the 2010 National Scout \nJamboree, he was recognized with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.\n  During the Vietnam War, as a Lieutenant Colonel, McGee flew 172 \ncombat missions in a McDonnell RF-4 photo-reconnaissance aircraft. \nAfter a series of other appointments in the United States, Italy and \nGermany and promotion to Colonel, McGee retired on January 31, 1973. He \nended his military career with an impressive 6,308 flying hours. \nFollowing his military service, McGee has held many prestigious \nfunctional and honorary positions within the field of aviation.\n  In 1978, at the age of 58, he completed his college degree at \nColumbia College in Kansas City, over 30 years after his initial \nenrollment at the University of Illinois. Though interrupted by World \nWar II, attaining a college degree had been a lifelong goal. I am \nhonored to have the opportunity to congratulate Colonel McGee for this \ngreat achievement and am proud that he chose to complete his studies \nand continue his impressive career in the great State of Missouri.\n  In his civilian life, McGee served as the director of the Kansas City \ndowntown airport and as a member of the Aviation Advisory Commission. \nFor 30 years, he has been an ambassador of the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., \nserving three times as national president. He has shared his story in \nnumerous public addresses and has received many accolades, including \nthe National Aeronautical Association's Elder Statesman of Aviation.\n  In 2005, McGee was part of a group of former Tuskegee Airmen who flew \nto Balad, Iraq to speak to active duty airmen serving in the 332nd Air \nExpeditionary Wing, the current incarnation of the 332nd Fighter Group.\n  McGee has been recognized for his combat and military service with a \nnumber of awards including: Distinguished Flying Cross with two Oak \nLeaf Clusters, Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star, \nAir Medal with 25 Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Commendation Medal, \nPresidential Unit Citation, Korean Presidential Unit Citation, Hellenic \nRepublic World War II Commemorative Medal, along with related campaign \nand service ribbons.\n  In 2007, President George W. Bush awarded him and the surviving \nTuskegee Airmen the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, the Nation's \nhighest civilian award, and in 2011, he was inducted into the National \nAviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, OH.\n  I am honored to join Columbia College in celebrating Colonel Charles \nMcGee's accomplishments and service, from which we have all greatly \nbenefited. I want to thank Colonel McGee for his leadership in the \nfield of aviation, in our military, and in his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3369-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL NORBERT CZECH\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Nevada \neducator and veteran, Lieutenant Colonel Norbert Czech, for his \nretirement as the District Army Instructor, DAI. His selfless work for \nthe District JROTC Program and with the veterans of Northern Nevada \nmake him truly deserving of our appreciation.\n  LTC Czech received his commission through the U.S. Army Officer \nCandidate School in 1970. He served honorably with the 11th Armored \nCavalry Regiment along the East/West German border as the Regimental \nAdjutant and Executive Officer. His final assignment was as the \nProfessor of Military Science at the University of Nevada, Reno, UNR, \nwhere he was responsible for the recruitment, training, and \ncommissioning of more than 100 Army Second Lieutenants.\n  Following his retirement from the U.S. Army, LTC Czech established \nthe Army JROTC Program at Galena High School. He went on to serve as \nthe Director of the Washoe County JROTC Programs for 5 years. Last year \nhe was honored as the Nation's best District Army Instructor.\n  Not only has LTC Czech had a lasting impact on the young students of \nNevada through the JROTC program, but he has helped his fellow military \nveterans in Northern Nevada. He is an active member of the 82nd \nAssociation, the Westmoreland Chapter of Association of the United \nStates Army--AUSA--and the Veterans Guest House, which was created as a \nplace for military veterans and their families to stay when they are \nreceiving treatments at area hospitals.\n  I am continually humbled by the sacrifices made by the brave men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces who fight to preserve freedom in the United \nStates. They faced dangerous situations in order to protect Americans \nfrom harm and deserve our utmost respect. As a member of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, I will continue fighting for veterans' \nbenefits and supporting all of our men and women in uniform.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating LTC Norbert \nCzech for his accomplishments and expressing my sincere gratitude to \nhim for his service and contributions to Nevada's students and military \nveterans. He is a true American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3369-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3369-S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KATY SIMON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Katy \nSimon as she retires from the position of Washoe County Manager, a \ntitle which she proudly held for 15 years. Ms. Simon's diligence and \ndetermination has made her an extraordinary leader to the people of \nWashoe County.\n  Ms. Simon was appointed Washoe County Manager in 1998 after serving 2 \nyears as assistant county manager for Finance and 1 year as deputy \ncounty manager. Prior to her appointments, she was the owner and \nprincipal consultant for Simon and Associates Management Consulting, \nproviding services both here in the United States and overseas. She \nalso served executive positions with Washoe Health System.\n  Ms. Simon's dedication to the people of Northern Nevada has not gone \nwithout notice. During her implementation of the employee \nclassification and compensation system, she was recognized twice by the \nState legislature for objectivity and fairness. Additionally, she was \naccountable for the successful startup of the Truckee Meadows Fire \nProtection District. These are just a few examples of Ms. Simon's \nefforts to promote the growth and development within her community and \nthe State.\n  Resilience and persistence aided Ms. Simon as she helped Washoe \nCounty through 5 years of the toughest economic times this great county \nhad ever seen. She took Washoe County from a\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\nstrong, well-managed county to being one of the very best local \ngovernments in the Nation.

In 1951, \nGeorge was deployed to Korea where he fought for 2 years. He was \nwounded three times and eventually was flown to a military hospital in \nJapan. George did not talk much about his time in Korea but did show \nhis daughter a flag he had made when he was in the hospital in Japan. \nThe flag had a map on it which showed all of the places in Korea where \nhe had fought.\n  When he returned home, George spent 16 years as a military police \nofficer in El Paso, TX.\n  In 1971, he moved to Montana and served as the sheriff of Sweet Grass \nCounty in Big Timber for 20 years.\n  George was one of the first sheriffs in Montana to bring the Drug \nAbuse Resistance Education--DARE--program to his county schools. He \nalso was one of the first sheriffs to bring the FBI's Child Find \nprogram to help schools put kids' fingerprints and pictures into a \nbooklet for parents.\n  George passed away in 2011, but it was my honor to present the honors \nhe earned to his widow Clara and his granddaughter Meggin.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor PO1 Michael \nMerrill, a sailor who fought in Vietnam.\n  Michael grew up in Outlook, MT, and went to Butte in 1961 to enlist \nin the U.S. Navy. He was sent to Millington, TN, for training at the \nNaval Support Activity Mid-South base. In Tennessee, he met his future \nbride, Barbara, whom he married in 1964. Barbara said she always wanted \nto be in the service, and for her, helping take care of Michael was her \nway of contributing to our country.\n  Michael traveled back and forth between San Diego and Millington \nuntil 1969 when he received orders to deploy to the aircraft carrier \nUSS Shangri-La as a jet mechanic. The Shangri-La was posted in the \nSouth China Sea during the Vietnam War.\n  For his service during the war, Michael earned the Vietnam Service \nMedal with four Bronze Service Stars.\n  After Vietnam, Michael and Barbara headed back to Miramar Naval Air \nStation before a tour on the USS Midway in Japan. Michael's last \nposting was to Whidbey Island in Washington where he worked with a \nhelicopter squadron.\n  In 1981, after 20 years in the Navy, Michael retired and moved home. \nIn Billings, he worked various jobs, including working at a tire supply \ncompany.\n  Michael passed away in 2009, but it was my honor to present the \nhonors he earned to his widow Barbara. On behalf of a grateful nation, \nI presented PO1 Michael Merrill's Navy Good Conduct Medal, National \nDefense Service Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal with four Bronze \nService Stars.\n  I also had the honor of presenting to Michael's widow Barbara, the \nMeritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon, the Navy ``E'' Ribbon, and the \nVietnam Campaign Medal with the 1960 device.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism. Sacrifice. And dedication to service.\n  They are presented on behalf of a nation that will never forget \nMichael Merrill's heroism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3370-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3370-5", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3370-6", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 807.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to extend the authorization of the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program through fiscal year 2018; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, each and every day, thousands of men and \nwomen in law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect our \ncities and towns, enforce our laws, and keep us safe. Just last month, \nwe witnessed the superb investigative efforts of the Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement officers who helped bring the Boston Marathon \nbombing suspect to face justice. Yet the senseless murder of MIT police \nofficer Sean Collier was a reminder of the danger that our law \nenforcement professionals routinely face. This week, which has come to \nbe known as National Police Week, provides us with the opportunity not \nonly to remember those law enforcement officers who lost their lives in \nthe line of duty, but also to honor their memories by better equipping \nthose officers who continue to serve our communities. Today I am proud \nto introduce two measures that will do just that.\n  More than 50 years ago, President Kennedy designated May 15 as \nNational Peace Officers Memorial Day, to recognize the sacrifices of \nlaw enforcement officers who had died in the course of their duties. \nDespite the progress that has been made in improving officer safety, \nthere is still much work to be done. Last year, 120 local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement officers tragically lost their lives in the \nline of duty.\n  As they do every year, law enforcement officers and their families \nfrom across the United States will come to Washington this week to pay \ntribute to their fallen colleagues. And as I do each year, I will stand \nwith them. Once again I am proud to submit a resolution officially \nrecognizing the designation of May 15 as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day, and I am pleased to be joined in sponsoring this \nresolution by Senator Grassley, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  We can also honor the memories of the officers who lost their lives \nby taking concrete action to help protect and equip those officers who \ncontinue to serve. That is why I am pleased that Senator Coons, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Klobuchar have joined me in introducing today the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act Reauthorization of 2013. Once enacted, this \nlegislation will continue for another five years the lifesaving grant \nprogram that Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I authored in 1998. \nThis measure will continue Congress' strong commitment to the safety \nand security of our Nation's law enforcement officers, by helping to \nprovide them with vital bulletproof vests and body armor.\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program has had a tremendous impact \non the ability of States and localities to give our law enforcement \nofficers the protection they deserve while serving the needs of our \ncommunities. Since 1999, the program has assisted state and local \njurisdictions with the purchase of over one million bulletproof vests, \nand since 1987 body armor has saved the lives of 3,000 law enforcement \nofficers. That is 3,000 men and women who may not otherwise have made \nit home to their families and loved ones.\n  As a Nation, we ask much of our law enforcement officers. The men and \nwomen who serve face constant and unknown risks, and too often make the \nultimate sacrifice. These are the men and women who we ask to keep our \nstreets safe and to protect our communities. These are the men and \nwomen who approach a car at 3 a.m. during a traffic stop, not knowing \nwho is behind the wheel or what might happen next. And these are the \nmen and women who are the first ones to respond when there is a \nshooting at a school, or an attack in our community. As citizens and as \nSenators, the least we can do is to equip these officers with the \nprotection they need to give them a better sense of security--a better \nchance of survival. Reauthorizing and funding this program is the right \nthing to do, and it is something I hope all Senators will support.\n  Every additional officer who is able to put on a vest today as a \nresult of this program is one more officer who has a far better chance \nof surviving a violent attack. Protecting the men and women who protect \nall Americans should be a priority for Congress and we have a chance to \nadvance that priority with the continuation of this program.\n  I hope all Senators will join me. The safety of law enforcement \nofficers across the United States should be something on which we can \nall agree.\n  I look forward to the enactment of these two important measures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 139\n\n       Whereas February 5, 2013, marks the 20th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 \n     U.S.C. 2611 et seq.), which was signed by President Bill \n     Clinton;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act is a landmark law, \n     and the first significant law to address the need of families \n     to balance work with family and health responsibilities;\n       Whereas prior to the passage of the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act, employees often did not have access to leave from \n     work, or feared losing their jobs if they took leave, when \n     the employee or an immediate family member faced a serious \n     health condition, or when recovering from giving birth or \n     bonding with a new child;\n       Whereas prior to the passage of the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act, women often faced employment discrimination based \n     on caregiving responsibilities and men often faced \n     discrimination in accessing family leave;\n       Whereas the responsibility to care for seriously ill family \n     members and to bond with a newborn or newly adopted child is \n     recognized, respected, and expected throughout the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to craft the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act was the \n     culmination of years of hard work and is a lasting legacy for \n     Senators Chris Dodd and Kit Bond and Representatives Pat \n     Schroeder and Marge Roukema, among many others;\n       Whereas the purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     are--\n       (1) to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs \n     of families;\n       (2) to promote the stability and economic security of \n     families;\n       (3) to promote national interests in preserving family \n     integrity;\n       (4) to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for \n     medical reasons, the birth or adoption of a child, and the \n     care of a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health \n     condition;\n       (5) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) in a manner that accommodates the legitimate \n     interests of employers and minimizes the potential for\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex; and\n       (6) to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for \n     women and men;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act allows an employee \n     to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to bond with a newborn \n     or newly adopted child, to care for a child, spouse, or \n     parent with a serious health condition, and to tend to a \n     serious health condition of the employee;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act benefits newborn \n     or newly adopted children by creating strong family bonds, \n     allowing families time to make arrangements for future \n     caregiving, and promoting the establishment of healthy \n     practices such as breastfeeding;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act provides job \n     security and peace of mind for individuals and families \n     struggling with a difficult diagnosis or other serious health \n     condition;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act allows individuals \n     to provide care for family members directly, strengthening \n     families and benefitting society by reducing costs to \n     taxpayer-funded programs;\n       Whereas Congress recognized the unique family needs of \n     military families and acted with bipartisan support in \n     enacting the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 3) and the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law \n     111-84; 123 Stat. 2190) to expand the protections of the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act to meet the needs of military \n     families;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act allows leave to \n     deal with qualifying exigencies arising from the deployment \n     of a family member to covered active duty in the United \n     States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act provides up to 26 \n     weeks of leave to care for a member of the Armed Forces or \n     recent veteran who was seriously injured or became seriously \n     ill because of active duty in the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act helps the United \n     States to fulfill the responsibility to support military \n     families and care for wounded warriors; and\n       Whereas the Family and Medical Leave Act has been invoked \n     more than 100,000,000 times, allowing millions of families to \n     attend to both work and family responsibilities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 20th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 \n     U.S.C. 2611 et seq.);\n       (2) salutes all of the individuals who contributed to the \n     enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act;\n       (3) encourages all individuals in the United States to \n     celebrate the advance of workplace protections and \n     opportunities made possible by the enactment of the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act; and\n       (4) pledges to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to \n     ensure that all individuals in the United States are able to \n     balance work and family responsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/13/senate-section/article/S3375-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 890.
