Mr. President, there are no words that can ease the pain of \nthe rampage and certainly the deaths involving a dozen human beings who \nwere killed yesterday at the Navy Yard. I hope it is some small comfort \nthat this city, this institution, the U.S. Senate, and a whole Nation, \nmourn alongside them. To my knowledge, there is no explanation for the \nviolence that occurred yesterday. My thoughts are with those who are \nsuffering as a result of the loss of their loved ones as well as those \npeople who are recovering from their wounds, and some of them are very \nserious. We wish them a speedy recovery. My heart goes out to all of \nthe 16,000 military and civilian employees who work at the Navy Yard \ncomplex, as well as their friends and family members who were affected \nby this tragedy.\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\n  It was only a few days ago--and the Presiding Officer was here on \nthat occasion also--when we as Members of Congress marked the \nanniversary of September 11, 2001, during a ceremony on the steps of \nthe Capitol. We had a moment of silence here in the Senate. Yesterday's \nshootings were the worst loss of life in the Capitol region since those \nSeptember 11, 2011, attacks which were centered around the Pentagon.\n  Last week's significant anniversary and yesterday's terrible violence \nare a reminder that life is fragile and precious. They are a reminder \nof the debt we owe to those who protect our freedom and our safety, \nwhether they serve in the military or as first responders. The Sergeant \nat Arms, who is responsible for our safety, was certainly on the job \nyesterday. He is a dedicated police officer. That is his goal. I still \nrefer to him as Chief Gainer. He was chief of the Capitol Police force \nbefore he took responsibility as the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate. He \nhas been a street officer for a long time. He could have done other \nthings--he has a law degree; he is a well-educated man--but his \nresponsibility is to take care of the Senate, and he does that very \nwell.\n  I appreciate very much--I speak for the entire Senate--those \ndedicated police, fire, and rescue personnel who put their lives on the \nline to prevent a lot more loss of life on Monday. In particular, the \ncity owes a debt of gratitude to a K-9 officer, a 24-year veteran of \nthe Metropolitan Police force, a man by the name of Scott Williams who \nwas hurt very badly in the shootings. I wish him a full recovery and \nthank him for his selflessness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6478-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6478-S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have to return to the business at hand. \nSince the moment President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, making \nit the law of the land and ensuring every American has access to \nquality health insurance at a price they can afford, Republicans have \nbeen on an absurd quest to undo this progress.\n  Republican Members of Congress were horrified when the U.S. Supreme \nCourt said the law we call ``ObamaCare''--the Affordable Care Act--is \nconstitutional. That is what the Supreme Court said. In spite of this \nbeing the law of the land--and it is the law of the land--House \nRepublicans alone have voted more than 40 times to repeal ObamaCare and \nare now threatening to shut down the entire government unless this \nCongress denies funding to implement this very constitutional law.\n  Under ObamaCare, Members of Congress and their staffs will be covered \nby exactly the same plans that will extend health insurance to millions \nof Americans next year. Five hundred thirty-five Members of Congress \nand 16,000 staff members are treated the same as other employees across \nAmerica under the law. They are treated that way under ObamaCare, and \nrightfully so. Just as 150 million other Americans who get their health \ninsurance through their jobs; that is, their employer, the Federal \nGovernment will share a part of the cost of that health care for us, \nfor the 16,000 who work in the Capitol complex--as it has for all \nFederal employees for many decades. These are the people in Carson \nCity, NV, Reno, NV, and Las Vegas, NV, who answer the phones and help \npeople with problems involving Social Security, veterans' benefits, \nwhether they can be buried at the beautiful cemetery we have in Fernley \nfor veterans or the one in Boulder City where every day we bury lots \nand lots of people who are veterans.\n  These are the sorts of inquiries we get around the State of Nevada, \nand people work long hard hours to respond to those requests. They are \ndedicated public servants. That is to whom the junior Senator from \nLouisiana said, No thanks; they are not entitled to anything as far as \nbeing treated as everybody else is treated.\n  Even more directly to the point, Members of Congress and our staffs \nwill live by the same rules and get their health care from the same \nexchanges as other Americans. But the junior Senator from Louisiana, I \nrepeat, and a number of other misguided Republicans want to force \nMembers of Congress and their staffs to live by a different set of \nrules. Although Senator Vitter has happily allowed the Federal \nGovernment to pay for a portion of his health insurance for many years \nas a Member of the House of Representatives and as a Member of the \nSenate, now he wants these 16,000 congressional workers to cover the \nfull cost of health insurance.\n  With this background, one must ask: If Senator Vitter opposes the \nemployer contribution for congressional staffers, does he oppose it \nalso for the 150 million other Americans whose employers help pay their \nhealth insurance premiums? Does he want to discourage private employers \nfrom doing the right thing and providing their employees with \naffordable health insurance coverage? Is it what he wants, to do away \nwith the insurance 150 million Americans have in America? Millions, I \nrepeat, millions and millions of employers rely on this important \nbenefit to attract the best and brightest and hardest working people \nthey can find. Ending the employer contribution would effectively slap \n150 million Americans with a big pay cut. Is that Senator Vitter's \nintention?\n  If Republican Senators believe they should bear the full cost of \ntheir own health insurance, they can, without any change in the law, \ndecline Federal Government support in contributions and pay their own \nway. They can even encourage their own staffs to do so. Why they would \nwant to do that, I don't understand, but they could do it. But for \nSenator Vitter and his Republican allies to end the contribution for \n16,000 hard-working Federal employees--even after years of accepting \nthe subsidy themselves--is hypocritical and mean-spirited.\n  In truth, this is only the latest Republican aim to derail the \nsuccessful implementation of ObamaCare. Last November there was a big \npoll taken--it is called an election--where Americans overwhelmingly \nvoted to reelect President Obama and to keep ObamaCare as the law of \nthe land. That was the issue of the campaign. Who won that? The \nAmerican people won, and President Obama won. As for ObamaCare--the \nconstitutional law of the land--the American people said, Let's go \nahead and do it. Americans have spoken very loudly and very clearly. It \nis time to move on to something else. It is the law and has been.\n  On October 1, about 25 million Americans who have no health insurance \nwill--for the first time, most of them in their entire lifetime--be \nable to get insurance. What we have found in New York alone is that the \ninsurance is going to save 50 percent of what it did before--it is 50 \npercent cheaper. In Nevada it is cheaper. It is the way it is all over \nthe country.\n  According to the voters and according to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States of America, ObamaCare is the law of the land. It is time \nfor Republicans to mature--I guess you could say it a different way: to \ngrow up--and recognize this is the law in America and has been for \nyears. It is time for Republicans to stop denying reality.\n  The Senate should be passing other legislation. We should be passing \nan energy efficiency bill that will save taxpayers money, creating \ngood-paying jobs--we need that--rebuilding roads and bridges. I have \nsaid here before 70,000 bridges are in a state of disrepair. Yesterday \na report came out that 8,000 of them are near collapse--8,000. We are \nnot spending money to take care of that problem. Our highways, our \nroads, our dams need money. This is not money that goes to the Federal \nGovernment so you can have a truck that says: Federal Government \nbuilding a road or fixing a dam. The money goes to the private sector. \nThat is what we should be doing. For every $1 billion we spend doing \nsomething about the highways, bridges, roads, dams, water systems, \nsewer systems, we create 47,500 high-paying jobs, and thousands of \nother jobs spin off from that. That is what we should be doing.\n  We should be facing the reality of climate change. Look what happened \nin Colorado. I talked to Senator Bennet yesterday. He said the floods \nwere Biblical. In one part of Colorado, it rained 12 inches in 2 hours. \nI cannot imagine that. Fires all over the West. Climate change is here. \nI met with the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh. They do not know what \nthey are going to do with the rise of the sea which is taking place. In \nthat country there is no high ground. It is that way all over the\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nworld. The Marshall Islands--a thousand islands make up the Marshall \nIslands--55,000 people live there. These islands are being washed away \nwith the new waves they have never seen before.\n  Climate change is here. We are doing nothing about it. They are \nspending all of our time, the American taxpayers' time, trying to \nrepeal a law that has been in effect for 4 years.\n  We should be doing something about immigration reform. They talk \nabout wanting to do something for the economy. Try passing immigration \nreform. It creates to the positive $1 trillion. It would reduce our \ndebt by $1 trillion. Let's do that. Let's fix our broken tax system.\n  We should be doing those things, not relitigating 4-year-old policy \nbattles. But instead of working with Democrats to effectively implement \nObamaCare or to pass new laws that benefit middle-class families, \nRepublicans are obsessed with fighting a real old battle, and they are \ndoing it at taxpayer expense.\n  Instead of standing with millions of Americans who are already \nbenefiting from ObamaCare, Republicans are standing with insurance \ncompanies that would return us to a time when profits came before \npeople. That is the way it works.\n  Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, \ninsurance companies can no longer discriminate against children with \npreexisting conditions. That is a good deal. If you have a child with \ndiabetes, that boy or girl cannot be denied insurance. If they have \nepilepsy, they cannot be denied insurance. And in a short few months \nall Americans will no longer be able to be denied insurance coverage \nbecause of a preexisting illness. They can no longer raise your rates \nfor no reason. They can no longer drop your coverage if you get sick. \nThat is the law today.\n  Today children can no longer be denied insurance, as I have \nindicated, because they are born with a disease or a disability. And \nthat, I repeat, will soon be extended to all Americans no matter their \nage. And listen to this one: Very soon being a woman will no longer be \nconsidered a preexisting condition, as it was before ObamaCare passed.\n  In my relatively sparsely populated State of Nevada, tens of \nthousands of seniors have saved tens of millions of dollars on \nmedicines because the Affordable Care Act has helped close the gap on \nprescription drug coverage.\n  More than 3 million young people, including 33,000 young Nevadans, \nhave been able to stay on their parents' health policies until they are \n26 years old--3 million. Hundreds of thousands of businesses that \nalready offer their employees health insurance are getting tax credits \nfor doing the right thing.\n  In a few months almost 130 million Americans with preexisting \nconditions--and what are some of these preexisting conditions; I talked \nabout it generally a minute ago: high blood pressure, all kinds of \nthings that happen as you get older--will have access to reasonably \npriced coverage, no matter their high blood pressure or their heart \ncondition or whatever the situation might be. And 25 million Americans \nwho cannot afford health insurance today will be offered health \ninsurance through the exchanges.\n  Republicans have been trying for years to erase these gains and force \nmillions of American families once again to rely on the most expensive \ncare in America today, which is where? It is emergency rooms. Hospitals \nhate it because their bad debt goes up, and all it does is drive up the \ncost of insurance. The care is not as good as it would be if they could \ngo when they first get sick. They go there out of desperation, and that \nis what I assume the Republicans want everyone to do. Everyone can go \nto an emergency room, but it is so expensive and does not do the trick.\n  So punishing hard-working congressional staff, who put in long hours \nbecause they believe in public service--that is, the work we do here in \nCongress--will not roll back the benefits of ObamaCare. Punishing \ncongressional staffers will not prevent millions of Americans from \ngaining the health insurance they need and deserve next year. But it \nwill hurt thousands of men and women, including Senator Vitter's \ncolleagues and his own staff.\n  Instead of willfully denying that ObamaCare is the law or purposely \ntrying to derail its implementation, it is time for Senator Vitter to \nhelp us improve the law of the land and ensure every American has \naccess to the kind of care Members of Congress enjoy already, as do 150 \nmillion other Americans who get health care through their employers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6479-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 226 years ago today about three dozen \npatriots helped form a more perfect union when they signed their names \nto a document that guides us still. The U.S. Constitution and the \ntimeless principles that inform it have endured, ensuring liberty and \nfreedom for the people of this country through war and peace, turmoil \nand prosperity.\n  So on this September 17, like every Constitution Day, we take a \nmoment to reflect on just how fortunate we are to live in a nation \nthat, unlike any other before or since, was founded on an idea. A big \npart of that idea is the fact that our rights come not from men but \nfrom the Creator, and that for this reason they cannot be taken away.\n  That is the context in which our Constitution was written, and it is \nthe context of the Bill of Rights that was added to it, and it is just \none of the things that makes America exceptional.\n  The first thing that every Senator, Congressman, or President does \nupon assuming office is take an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution. \nOn this Constitution Day I join my fellow lawmakers in recommitting \nmyself to that solemn oath, to doing everything I can to ensure that \nthe principles of constitutional self-government are adhered to and \ndefended in Washington.

Mr. President, flags across America are being flown at \nhalf-mast this morning because of the terrible tragedy which occurred \nout that door 1\\1/2\\ miles away yesterday.\n  Men and women who worked for our Department of Defense to keep \nAmerica safe reported to work as usual on a\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nMonday morning, and then tragedy struck. A gunman appeared with an \nassault rifle, several other weapons. At the end of it, 12 innocent \npeople died, another dozen or so seriously injured.\n  This Capitol was in shock. It was locked down at some point to ward \noff the possibility there were other shooters and more danger outside. \nWe watched as the people who worked at the Navy Yard and those who \nworked in adjoining buildings waited patiently for the police to do \ntheir important and courageous work. At the end of the day, they showed \ntelevision footage of these employees being bused away from the Navy \nYard to a safe metro location to return home--all but 12 of them who, \nsadly, lost their lives through this senseless gun tragedy.\n  We read the papers this morning trying to understand what could \npossibly motivate a person to do this. As we read the background of the \nshooter, it was clear there were moments in his life when he had used a \nfirearm to shoot the tires of a car that he thought should not be \nparked in his driveway, shooting a gun in his own apartment that went \nthrough the ceiling to an adjoining apartment. Those sorts of things \nmight have been warning signals. Questions are raised--How could a man \nwith that kind of a background end up getting the necessary security \nclearance for a military contractor to go into this Navy Yard, to be \npermitted to go into this Navy Yard? How did he get these weapons into \nthis Navy Yard; an assault rifle and other firearms--questions that \nstill remain to be answered.\n  God forbid we go on with business as usual today and not understand \nwhat happened yesterday.\n  What happened yesterday brings into question some important values in \nAmerica. If we value our right for ourselves and our families and our \nchildren to be safe, if we value this Constitution, if we value the \nright of every American to enjoy their liberties with reasonable \nlimitations, then we need to return to issues that are of importance.\n  There was an issue before the Senate several months ago--a bipartisan \namendment offered by Senators Manchin and Toomey that would have taken \nan extra step to keep guns out of the hands of those who have a history \nof felonies or people who are mentally unstable. The vast majority of \nAmericans think this is common sense. We can protect the right of law-\nabiding citizens to use guns in a responsible, legal way for sporting, \nhunting, self-defense, but we have to do everything we can to keep guns \nout of the hands of those who would misuse them: felons who have a \nhistory of misusing firearms; the mentally unstable who cannot be \ntrusted to have a firearm.\n  But today we pause and reflect on the lives lost, I hope the lessons \nlearned. I had a hearing scheduled this morning before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on a controversial issue involving firearms. In \nlight of what happened yesterday, in light of the uncertainty of our \nschedule today, I am rescheduling that hearing. It is an important one, \nand I want to say to those who are following it that it will be \nrescheduled. But at this point in time we have decided to postpone it \nfor today, to another day in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6480-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6480-S6482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let's talk for a minute about the Vitter \namendment that is on the floor. One-half of all Americans have a common \nexperience. The experience is this: They get health insurance where \nthey work--one-half of all Americans. For virtually all of them, their \nemployer pays for part of their health insurance premium and the \nemployer gets a tax break. If you own a company and offer health \ninsurance to your employees, we have what we call the employer's \nexclusion for health care benefits. In other words, what you pay for \nyour employees' health insurance is excluded from your income for tax \npurposes. It is one of the most expensive exclusions in the Tax Code, \nbut it is a valuable one because it encourages businesses to offer \nhealth insurance to their employees, which is important for those \nfamilies, important for our Nation.\n  Of course, when it comes to the Federal Government, the same rule \napplies. The employer--the Federal Government--offers health insurance \nto its employees under what is known as the Federal Employees' Health \nBenefits Program. Eight million Americans, representing Federal \nemployees and their families, get their health insurance through the \nFederal Employees' Health Benefits Program. It includes Members of \nCongress. We do not have a special health insurance plan. We have the \nsame plan that millions of Federal employees have. And our staff enjoy \nthose same privileges.\n  Well, now we are in a period of transition because of the new \nAffordable Care Act.\n  This Affordable Care Act says that from this point forward Members of \nCongress as well as their staff members will no longer be insured by \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program but instead will become \npart of the insurance exchanges that were created. These exchanges, \nwhich are going to be in virtually every State because of State \nsponsorship, Federal sponsorship, or shared responsibility, will offer \nhealth insurance plans across America so that those who currently do \nnot have health insurance today will be able to apply for a plan under \nthe insurance exchange. If they are extremely low-income individuals, \nthey will get help--subsidies and tax treatment that will help them pay \nfor their premiums. The notion is that no matter where you live you \nwill have access to health insurance.\n  The health insurance offered by these exchanges and by every other \ncompany in America will change because this law--change for the better. \nSenator Reid spoke about it earlier.\n  Preexisting conditions. How many of us do not have a preexisting \ncondition or somebody in our family with a preexisting condition? \nPerhaps someone in our family was treated for cancer or diabetes or \neven a mental illness. In the past health insurance companies could \ndiscriminate against you and say: Sorry, we do not offer health care \nplans to cancer survivors. Well, that is no longer the case. This new \nlaw, the Affordable Care Act--so-called ObamaCare--says that health \ninsurance policies from this point forward have to cover preexisting \nconditions not just in children but adults as well. The Republicans are \nsaying: We want to repeal that. We do not want to put that new \nprovision in the law. We do not want to require insurance companies to \ncover those with preexisting conditions.\n  There is another change in the law. Some insurance policies today \nhave limits on how much they will pay. Well, I can tell you, be \ncareful. If your health insurance plan says: We will cover your bills, \nsay, up to $100,000, be careful. You could go in tomorrow--or someone \nin your family--and be diagnosed with a cancer condition requiring \nextensive medical care that far exceeds the $100,000. Under ObamaCare \nthere are no limits on health insurance protection. If you have a \nterrible illness or if someone in your family does, the insurance \npolicy will cover you. The Republicans want to repeal this provision so \nthat they can set limits on health insurance policy limits, which could \nliterally bankrupt a family with a terrible medical condition with \nwhich they are trying to deal. That is one of the provisions in \nObamaCare that the Republicans want to repeal.\n  The issue on the floor today is the Vitter amendment. Senator Vitter \nis from Louisiana. He came to the floor last week and he said: Since \nMembers of Congress and their staffs are now going into these insurance \nexchanges, it is time for us to eliminate the employer contribution for \nMembers of Congress and their staffs. They have to pay it all, 100 \npercent of the premium, unlike 150 million Americans who get insurance \nthrough their employer and the employee pays a portion of it.\n  When it comes to congressional staff and Members of Congress, no \nemployer contribution, pay it all. Well, it turns out that is exactly \nthe opposite of the way Senator Vitter voted on the floor of the Senate \non an amendment offered by Senator Grassley, No. 3564 on the Affordable \nCare Act. Senator Vitter voted, during the debate on this issue, to \nprotect the right of congressional employees and others on the employer \ncontributions. Now he has reversed himself. Now he says: No employer \ncontribution. This is unfair. It is unfair to do this to the employees \nof the Senate as well as the Members. All we are asking is that this \ngroup of individuals be\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\ntreated the same as every other American with health insurance through \ntheir employment.\n  My fear is that this is not the end of Senator Vitter's crusade \nagainst health insurance by employers. I think this is a first step. \nThe next step could be to eliminate the employers' contribution for \nhealth insurance across the board. That would be devastating, \nabsolutely devastating and fundamentally unfair to see workers across \nAmerica--not just congressional employees, Federal workers, workers in \nthe private sector--paying the entire premium with no employer \ncontribution. That is a good way to eliminate coverage, not to expand \nit. We should be expanding health insurance coverage.\n  I listened to the Senator from Louisiana describe the employer \ncontribution to health insurance as a Federal subsidy--a Federal \nsubsidy. Well, I guess technically he is right because the Tax Code \nsays to employers: We will give you special positive tax treatment if \nyou offer health insurance. So the Tax Code does, in fact, give a \nsubsidy to all employers who offer to pay a part of their employees' \nhealth insurance premiums.\n  OK. I will accept that definition. But that is a worthy subsidy. Even \nthough it is the most expensive provision in the Tax Code, it is a \nworthy subsidy because it encourages more health insurance. It makes it \nmore affordable for working families in Louisiana, Illinois, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, and across the United States.\n  If Senator Vitter is going to attack an employer's contribution to \nhealth insurance as a Federal subsidy we can no longer afford, then say \nit on the floor of the Senate. Let's have an up-or-down vote. I \nchallenge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for \nworking families across America--in the private sector, in the public \nsector, our congressional employees, even Members of Congress--to be \ntreated the same. No special preference for Members of Congress but \nhave employer contributions protected under the law regardless of \nwhether you buy the plan in the private sector or in the public sector.\n  This is an important vote. I think some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are so determined to end ObamaCare, so determined to \nput an end to this effort to reduce the cost of health insurance \npremiums and to make health insurance more available to people across \nAmerica and basically a sound investment for your health insurance \nfuture--I think those Republicans who are determined to eliminate that \nhave some questions to answer.\n  They want to eliminate the provision in ObamaCare that says parents \ncan keep their kid under their health insurance policy until that young \nman or woman reaches the age of 26. Is it important? Well, do you have \na son or daughter graduating college soon who cannot find a full-time \njob? Are you worried about whether they are going to have health \ninsurance? They can stay on your policy, mom and dad, until they reach \nthe age of 26. The Republicans want to repeal it.\n\n  Also, we have a prescription drug program for seniors. It is very \npopular. Part D says: We are going to help seniors pay for medicine so \nthey can stay well and healthy and independent and strong and not end \nup in a hospital or convalescent senior center or a nursing home. In \nthe ObamaCare bill, we extend the protection of this prescription \nprogram for Medicare recipients. The Republicans want to repeal that. \nHow in the world can that be in our best interest for seniors--many of \nthem on fixed incomes with limited savings--to have to pay more for \ntheir prescription drugs? Is that the Republican answer? It is not a \ngood one if that is what they are proposing.\n  When it comes to quality health insurance that will not discriminate \nagainst people with preexisting conditions, when it comes to quality \nhealth insurance that has to offer maternity benefits--hard to believe, \nisn't it, that health insurance plans before ObamaCare could exclude \nmaternity benefits? One of our Senators this morning said that up to 60 \npercent of the policies do not cover the birth of a child. They have to \nnow under ObamaCare. But the Republicans would repeal that requirement, \nleaving more women in a situation where they have to pay out of pocket \nfor prenatal care and the delivery of a child. How can that be in the \ninterest of a healthy America? We want moms, as soon as they know they \nare pregnant, to go see a doctor, go through ordinary prenatal care, \nhave those healthy, happy babies who make such a difference in their \nlives. Is it important? I think it is. It is in ObamaCare. The \nRepublicans want to repeal it. Why?\n  If they want to change some provisions, if they want to debate them \nand amend them, let's do it. You know, when it gets down to it, there \nis not a perfect law that has ever been passed. We can always change it \nfor the better if we do it in good faith and in the democratic way. \nThat is the way it should happen. But, instead, the House of \nRepresentatives--which the Presiding Officer served in before joining \nus here in the Senate--has voted 41 times to repeal ObamaCare--41 \ntimes. One time the Republican leader over there tried to change one \nprovision, perhaps even improve it. His own Republican caucus turned on \nhim and said: No, we do not want to improve it.\n  The last thing I want to say is this: Those who ignore history are \ncondemned to repeat it. That is etched on the side of one of our \nbuildings downtown here. The year was 1935. Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nlooked around America and saw that the poorest group of Americans \nturned out to be elderly people, people who could no longer work and \nhad nowhere to turn. Sadly, many of them had no choice--they went to \nlive among poor people in a poorhouse or if they were lucky enough, \ntheir kids took them in. If you hear the story of your own family, they \ncan remember back when grandma and grandpa moved in that spare bedroom \nbecause they could not work anymore and they had nowhere to turn.\n  So in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt said: Let's do something about it. \nLet's create an insurance plan. Here is what it says: You pay into this \ninsurance plan while you are working. When you reach the age of 65, we \nwill pay you at least some money each month to get by. They called this \ninsurance plan Social Security. It was part of the New Deal under \nFranklin Roosevelt. It was pretty sensible but controversial too.\n  Do you know what the Republican reaction was to Social Security in \n1935? Here on the floor of the Senate, there was a Republican \nfilibuster to stop Roosevelt from implementing Social Security. They \nwould not let him open the Social Security offices he needed across \nAmerica nor give him the staff. A Republican filibuster stopped it.\n  In 1936 the Republican candidate for President was Alf Landon, a \nprogressive Republican Governor from Kansas. Alf Landon said: If I am \nelected President of the United States in 1936, my first act of office \nwill be to repeal Social Security.\n  Then, when they started implementing it, the chamber of commerce here \nin Washington sent out notices to employers across America to put a \nnotice in the pay envelope. It said: The 1 percent you are paying into \nSocial Security, Mr. Worker, is never going to help you. You are never \ngoing to see a penny of it. The only way to stop it is to vote against \nthis fellow named Roosevelt.\n  Does any of this sound familiar? Does this playbook sound like \nsomething you have seen recently? That is exactly what the Republicans \nare doing to the Affordable Care Act, to the effort by this Congress \nand this President to make health insurance more affordable, to make \nthe policies more valuable, to help working families, and to try to \nmake sure those who are uninsured have a chance to buy insurance \nbecause uninsured people get sick too. They go to the hospital. They \nget treated. When they cannot pay, we pay for it. We pay for it. \nEverybody in the health insurance plan pays more because those people \nin the hospital cannot afford to. If we bring more and more people into \ninsurance coverage under ObamaCare, it is going to mean they accept the \npersonal responsibility to buy insurance and their bills do not become \nour bills. Republicans want to repeal that. They are replaying the same \nscript and same scenario we saw when they tried to abolish Social \nSecurity. Let's not let it happen. Let's move forward in a positive way \non health insurance as more than just some privilege. From my point of \nview, it is one of the most basic rights of this country.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n  If you have ever been in a situation with a serious illness in your \nfamily and you had no health insurance, you will never forget it. It \nhappened to me and my wife. We will never forget it as long as we live. \nI do not want to see another family in that situation. Repealing \nObamaCare could create it. I hope we have the good sense to vote down \nthe Vitter amendment and stand for good, affordable health insurance \nfor working families whether they work in the private sector, the \npublic sector, or Congress, and to make sure they have an employer \ncontribution so that health insurance is affordable.\n  The Vitter amendment is a step back in time. It is a step back in \ntime that will eliminate the protection of health insurance for \nliterally thousands if not millions of Americans. That is not the way \nto go. I would say to the Senator from Louisiana it makes no sense to \nthe working families of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to discuss \nanother senseless act of violence and our Nation's response.\n  In the early morning hours of August 21, the Syrian military began \nfiring artillery rockets into the suburbs east of Damascus, hitting \nneighborhoods held by opposition forces that had been fighting to end \nthe brutal dictatorship of Bashar al Assad.\n  We know from the accounts of independent observers such as Human \nRights Watch, the work of our intelligence services, and those of our \nallies, that many of these rockets were armed with warheads carrying \nsarin, a deadly nerve gas. We know these rockets were launched from \nareas under the control of Assad's regime, using munitions known to be \npart of Assad's arsenal, and into areas held by opposition forces. We \nknow from the report of the U.N. weapons inspectors released yesterday \nthat the weapons used, both the rockets and the chemicals themselves, \nwere of professional manufacture, including weapons known to be in the \nSyrian Government's arsenal. There is no other source of this deadly \ngas except the Syrian Government. Nothing else makes any sense \nwhatsoever.\n  President Obama declared that the United States would act in response \nto this threat to global security. He determined it was necessary to \nuse American military force to degrade Assad's chemical capability and \ndeter future use of such weapons by Assad or others. He did so because \na failure to act would weaken the international prohibition on chemical \nweapons use. He did so because the failure to act could lead to greater \nproliferation of these weapons of mass destruction, including the \npotential that they could fall into the hands of terrorists and used \nagainst our people. He did so because if the use of chemical weapons \nbecomes routine, our troops could pay a huge price in future conflicts.\n  On September 4, a bipartisan majority of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee approved the President's request for an authorization of the \nlimited use of military force.\n  Faced with this credible threat of the use of force and in response \nto a diplomatic probe by Secretary Kerry, Russia--which had for more \nthan 2 years blocked every diplomatic initiative to hold Assad \naccountable for the violent repression of his people--announced that \nAssad's chemical arsenal should be eliminated.\n  The agreement that followed requires Syria to give up its chemical \narsenal on a historically rapid timetable.\n  Within a week Syria must fully account for its chemical weapons \nstockpiles and infrastructure. By the end of November, U.N. inspectors \nmust be allowed to complete their assessments and key equipment used to \nproduce chemical agents must be destroyed. All of Syria's chemical \nstocks, materials and equipment must be destroyed by the end of next \nyear.\n  Any failure to abide by the terms of the agreement would lead to \nconsideration of penalties under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, under \nwhich the U.N. Security Council may authorize among other steps \n``action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or \nrestore international peace and security.'' Regardless of U.N. action \nor inaction, the President retains the option of using force if Assad \nfails to fully comply.\n  This agreement is a significant step toward a goal we could not have \nachieved with the use of force. The authorization approved by the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee had the stated purpose of degrading \nAssad's chemical capability and deterring the use of chemical weapons \nby Assad or by others. What can now be achieved is more than degrading \nand deterring. We may be able to eliminate one of the world's largest \nstockpiles of chemical weapons.\n  We should have no illusions that achieving this outcome will be easy. \nFirst are the technical and logistical challenges. Many have expressed \nconcern about the likelihood that Assad's stockpiles can be secured and \ndisposed of as quickly as this agreement provides--by the end of 2014--\nespecially given the dangerous security environment in Syria. I share \nthese concerns. But accepting and addressing these challenges is a \nbetter course than not acting against the certain danger of leaving \nthese weapons in the hands of a brutal dictator allied with Hezbollah, \na dictator who has demonstrated a willingness to use them against \ncivilians.\n  Some have expressed doubts that Assad and Russia will follow through \non the agreement which was reached in Geneva. To address these doubts, \nwe must inspect, verify, and continue to hold open the option of a \nstrike against Assad's chemical capability if he fails to fully abide \nby the Geneva agreement.\n  What I do not understand is why some of the same voices who called \nfor the United States to get Russia to end its obstructionism now \ncriticize the President for getting the Russians involved. I was \ndisappointed to hear my Michigan colleague, Congressman Mike Rogers, \nmake the irresponsible claim that this agreement amounts to ``being led \nby the nose'' by Russia. This contradicts his previous statements that \nwe need to put pressure on Russia to get involved in a solution to the \nSyrian threat.\n  Chairman Rogers has also said: ``What keeps me up at night: We know \nof at least a dozen or so sites that have serious chemical weapons \ncaches'' in Syria, and stressed the urgency that ``all the right steps \nare taken so that we don't lose these weapons caches and something more \nhorrific happens.''\n  Thanks to U.S. pressure and a threat to take military action in \nresponse to Assad's use of chemicals, the Russians are finally getting \ninvolved in getting Syria to respond. We have taken a major step toward \nsecuring these chemical weapons as Chairman Rogers himself so strongly \nurged.\n  We need not rely on good intentions from those who have not shown \ngood intentions in the past. It was the credible threat of the use of \nmilitary force that brought Russia and Syria to the bargaining table. \nIt is a continued credible threat of military force that will keep them \non track to uphold the provisions of that agreement.\n  The President has made it clear, and rightfully so, that ``if \ndiplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act.''\n  Secretary Kerry, standing right beside his Russian counterpart in \nGeneva, emphasized this agreement in no way limits President Obama's \noption to use force if it becomes necessary.\n  Many of our colleagues have stressed repeatedly in recent weeks that \nthe credible force, the credible threat of military force, is essential \nto reining in Assad. I strongly agree. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand why those who have taken that position would now argue, as \nsome of those same colleagues are arguing, that the Geneva agreement is \nsomehow of little or no\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nuse because they say it somehow removes the option to use force. The \nGeneva agreement says nothing of that sort.\n  Their argument isn't just inaccurate, it is damaging to our efforts. \nWhy would those who believe the threat of force is essential to keeping \npressure on Syria and Russia want to argue it is no longer available? \nWhy would those who have accurately said the United States does not \nneed international approval to use its military forces now argue the \nGeneva agreement leaves us in the position of needing to get \ninternational approval to use force in this case when the Geneva \nagreement does nothing of the sort?\n  Some have criticized the Geneva agreement for not doing more to aid \nthe Syrian opposition. Russia and Syria tried to get an agreement from \nus to not support the opposition, but they failed to get that agreement \nfrom us in the Geneva agreement or anywhere else. Indeed, the \nadministration is seeking ways to facilitate the additional support for \nthe opposition that so many of us believe is essential.\n  I believe we should facilitate the provision of additional military \naid to the opposition, particularly the vetted elements of Syria's \nopposition forces, including antitank weapons. Such aid will help the \nSyrian people defend themselves from the brutal Assad regime, \nfurthering our goal of bringing a negotiated end to his rule.\n  I find it troubling that so much of the commentary on this topic has \nnot dealt with substance and policy. Washington has been and always \nwill be a political town, but we now reach the point where politics \nseems to be the only lens through which so many people around here view \nthe most important and serious matters of the day, including national \nsecurity.\n  Speculation as to motives, or about potential winners or losers, or \nwho is up and who is down, misses the point. This is not an ice-skating \ncontest with points awarded for style. What is important is our \nnational security and whether this agreement advances it. Removing \nweapons of mass destruction from the hands of a brutal dictator--a \npreliminary outcome, yes, but real and tangible--is the direct result \nof American leadership.\n  A month, a year, or 5 years ago, an agreement to eliminate Assad's \nchemical weapons would have been seen as a significant gain for our \nsecurity and for the world's security, not just for the President who \nachieved it but far more importantly, again, for the safety of our \npeople, of our troops, and the entire world.\n  I hope as we continue with the hard work of implementing this \nagreement and as we seek an end to Bashar al Assad's rule, we can keep \nour eyes on those goals and skip the superficial political scorekeeping \nand inaccurate potshots that distract us from achieving those goals.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Mr. President, as I rise today, I wish to talk about the \neconomy and the need to create an economic climate that strengthens the \nmiddle class.\n  Before I do, I wish to acknowledge, as have many of my colleagues, \nand to comment on the tragedy that occurred here at the Washington Navy \nYard yesterday.\n  We are going to debate a lot of issues. The business of the country \ngoes on and the business of the Senate goes on, but for the families of \nthe victims of that tragedy yesterday, things stand still. It is \nimportant for all of us to take a moment to mourn with them the loss \nthey have experienced and to extend our thoughts and prayers to their \nfamilies and their loved ones. It is a horrible tragedy. As we continue \nthe back-and-forth we have on the issues of the day, we will remember \nand keep those families in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the economy. The \nPresident has yet again this week--in fact, he gave a speech yesterday \nwhere he was pivoting back to the economy, a topic that millions of \nunemployed Americans haven't had the luxury of pivoting away from.\n  For most Americans, they are living this economy every single day in \ntheir personal lives. When the President talks about pivoting back to \nthe economy, this has been a repivot, and a repivot many times. He \ntalks about something else for a while and then talks about coming back \nto the economy. For the American people, the American economy is, was, \nhas been, and will continue to be the issue for them and their \nfamilies.\n  As the President steps up his rhetoric to try and convince a \nskeptical public that his policies have somehow helped our economy, I \nthink it is important to point out that the President's policies, \naccording to facts, simply aren't working.\n  The reality is participation in the labor force continues to decline. \nThe August job numbers report a labor participation rate of 63.2 \npercent. This is the lowest participation rate since August of 1978, 35 \nyears ago when President Carter was President.\n  What this means is if thousands of Americans haven't given up looking \nfor work, the unemployment rate would be over 10 percent. We talk about \nthe reported unemployment rate, which is 7.3 or 7.4--it has hovered \naround that range for a long time--but the real unemployment rate \nshould include those who have quit looking for work. When you add that \nnumber in, the unemployment goes up to 10.6 percent.\n  In August the number of long-term unemployed--those people who have \nbeen jobless for 27 weeks or more--remained roughly at 4.3 million \npeople. Those individuals accounted for 37.9 percent of the unemployed. \nWe are not seeing any improvement in the area of people who have been \nwithout jobs for a long period of time.\n  Worse yet, 60 percent of the jobs created this year were part-time \njobs. We continue to see evidence that the President's policies, \nPresident Obama's policies, are leading to not the creation of full-\ntime jobs but the creation of part-time jobs. In other words, Americans \nare having to work more than one job to make ends meet, therefore \nreducing the take-home pay for them and their families. This is another \nthing we have seen. Take-home pay has gone down in this President's \ntime in office.\n  The American people understand the President's economic policies have \nfallen short. That is why, as you look at these various polls, most \nAmericans--the majority of Americans--disapprove of the President's \nhandling of the economy. The reality remains that this administration's \npolicies are hurting jobs in our economy. The President's signature \nhealth care law is probably as much to blame for that as anything else.\n  As I talk to employers in my State of South Dakota and across the \ncountry, the recurring theme is the mandates, the requirements, all the \nnew redtape associated--and the higher taxes with the President's \nhealth care law--are meaning higher taxes and fewer hours for American \nworkers. According to Americans for Tax Reform, there are 20 new or \nhigher taxes in ObamaCare that will hit American families and small \nbusinesses. As a result of these taxes and other policies in ObamaCare, \nthe President's signature health care law significantly impacts what \nmatters most to people, and that is their jobs and their ability to \nprovide for their families. It is no secret that a good job is a \ncritical part of the American dream, but this President's policies are \nputting that dream farther and farther out of reach for many Americans.\n  In fact, in selling the law, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \ndeclared at the time:\n\n       This bill is not only about the health security of America, \n     it's about jobs. In its life, it will create 4 million jobs--\n     400,000 jobs almost immediately.\n\n  The former Speaker's claims run completely contrary and counter to \nwhat we are seeing. People are working fewer hours. As the numbers I \nhave presented before demonstrate, fewer people are actually even \nparticipating in the labor force. Americans are discouraged by the lack \nof economic growth and by ObamaCare's impact on\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\nemployers. Their ability to offer quality jobs is taking its toll on \nour investment.\n  Only last week Investor's Business Daily reported that due to \nObamaCare at least 258 employers cut work hours or jobs so far. \nMeanwhile, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 71 percent of \nsmall businesses say the law makes it harder to hire workers.\n  According to the July Fed Beige Book, the health care law has been \ncited as a job market concern. They quote from that report: ``Several \nretailers reported that the Affordable Care Act would lead to more \npart-time and temporary versus full-time hiring.''\n  The President's health care law is smothering employers in \nbureaucratic redtape, uncertainty, and taxes. Already more than 20,000 \npages of regulations have come from the 2,700-page law. The time and \ncost of complying with these regulations places a serious burden on the \nability to spend time and energy creating new jobs. Time and money that \nwould be spent opening a new store, increasing hours, upgrading \nequipment, which would create more jobs, is instead being spent on \nlawyers and consultants who have to help small businesses interpret all \nof the regulations, all the requirements, and all the mandates created \nby this administration's health care law.\n\n  Poll after poll has shown that ObamaCare is extremely unpopular among \na majority of Americans. According to a recent CNN poll conducted by \nORC International, nearly 60 percent of Americans said they oppose the \nDemocratic signature law. I would hope the President would begin to be \nhonest with the American people about what this law truly means for \njobs and our economy, and I would hope he would begin to listen to \nAmericans. If he does, he will find what most of us have discovered a \nlong time ago; that is, the American people don't want this and \nAmerican employers and small businesses believe it will lead to fewer \njobs and lower take-home pay for the people they employ.\n  I hope in the days ahead, as we focus on the economy--and if the \nPresident is sincere about his pivot back to the economy, he will take \ninto consideration what really ails the economy; that is, excessive \ntaxes, regulations, redtape, bureaucracy, mandates and requirements, \nmany of which are associated with his signature achievement, which is \nthe ObamaCare health care legislation.\n  What the country does not need right now is another tax increase. \nWhat the country needs right now is policies that will expand and grow \nthe economy, that will reform our Tax Code in a way that lowers rates \nand makes us more competitive in the global marketplace and unleashes \nAmerican energy in a way that gives us a competitive advantage over our \nforeign competitors. We can do all of that. All the President has to do \nis sign off, for example, on the Keystone Pipeline, which would create \nthousands of jobs immediately and many more once it is fully built and \nworking.\n  It would also mean we do away with the onerous, burdensome \nrequirements of the ObamaCare legislation and replace it with policies \nthat make sense, that actually focus on what will give Americans more \naccess to affordable health care in this country.\n  We need to reduce spending here in Washington, DC, and quit looking \nat every problem as an opportunity to raise taxes. That seems to be the \nDemocratic solution for everything. Their budget proposed a $1 trillion \ntax increase. The leader of the Democrats here in the Senate has said \ntax reform has to include $1 trillion in new taxes. It is not revenue \nthat is the problem here in Washington, it is spending. If we look at \nrevenues, they are up $284 billion in the first 11 months of this year. \nWe don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. We don't \nneed another tax increase, we need policies that will lower the rates, \nthat will get rid of the redtape and the regulations that are \nstrangling our economy and allow our small businesses to create jobs \nthat will make lives better for middle-class Americans and improve the \ntake-home pay for every family in the country.\n  The job-killing mandates in ObamaCare are harmful to our economy, \nthey are harmful to jobs, and it is time we delay or repeal it and \nreplace it with commonsense alternatives. We believe that discussion \nneeds to occur, and I hope the President will allow it to occur. It is \ntime to focus on comprehensive, revenue neutral tax reform of our \nbroken tax system, repeal the mandates in Obamacare, and get rid of a \nlot of the government redtape and regulations that are making it more \ndifficult and more expensive for employers in this country--for small \nbusinesses--to grow jobs.\n  Those are the types of things that will get the economy unleashed, \nthat will expand and grow the economy and create more jobs for ordinary \nworking-class Americans who are out of work and will raise the take-\nhome pay for families in this country, which would allow the quality of \nlife and the standard of living to improve for every American family.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JOHN D. KNOX, JR.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, tonight in Marietta, GA, my hometown, \nthere will be a celebration I cannot attend. There will be a \ncelebration to honor 50 years of medical service to our community by \nDr. John D. Knox, Jr. I hate it that I can't be there because he has \nbeen an important part of my life, but I would like to take a minute on \nthe floor of the Senate to pay tribute to Dr. Knox and all those \nphysicians who deliver health care to our people, our citizens in our \nStates, our districts, and our country.\n  As I pondered what I would say about John Knox on the floor this \nmorning, I was sitting in my office looking at the plaques and \ncertificates all of us receive for various works we have done in public \nlife, and it occurred to me, when you go into a doctor's office you \nwill see a diploma and you might see a Norman Rockwell painting, but \nreally the trophies and tributes to doctors are people walking around \nwith two feet in our communities who have survived a terrible injury or \na terrible disease and who are living a normal life because a \nphysician, with his or her training, brought them back to life or cured \na terrible problem.\n  Dr. John Knox has done that for 50 years in my community--50 years as \nan orthopedic specialist and orthopedic surgeon with Resurgens \nOrthopaedics, which is one of the largest orthopedic practices in the \nSoutheast. In fact, one of those great trophies to John D. Knox, Jr., \nis my son Kevin, who in 1989 went through the windshield of a pickup \ntruck on a rural road in south Georgia. He had a double compound \nfracture of his lower right leg. He landed in a ditch full of dirty \nwater and lay there for 2 hours before help came. Fortunately, he \ndidn't sever an artery, but he was in bad shape.\n  I got the call at 4 a.m. that no parent ever wants to get--the call \nthat paramedics had my son, that they were on the interstate and did I \nwant them to take him to Augusta Medical College or to Atlanta, GA, for \ntreatment because nobody in rural Georgia had the facility to treat his \ninjuries. I immediately asked them to bring him to Marietta, GA, to \nKennestone Hospital, and to immediately call John D. Knox and ask him \nif he would meet my son at the emergency room. The next 6 weeks my son \nhad four surgeries, all performed by John D. Knox. He had antibiotic \ntherapy to make sure his bone marrow did not get infected from lying in \nthe ditch. For 8 months he got psychiatric and psychological help and\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\nhome recovery with his mom, myself, doctors, and those physicians \nrecommended by John Knox.\n  The great story is that the night before my son was injured, he \nstarted as defensive end for Walton High School. One year later, after \nthis terrible wreck and recovery, he again started as defensive end for \nWalton High School. The miracle of medicine put my son back together, \nbut if it wasn't for John D. Knox, my son might not be here today.\n  I wanted John D. Knox, a great doctor in Marietta, GA, to know that \nwhat he did in 1989 for my son and what he has done for countless \nthousands of citizens in my community for years and years never will go \nunappreciated and will always be recognized. I am glad my family was a \npart of his 50 years of service as a physician. God bless John D. Knox, \nand congratulations on his service to our great community of Cobb \nCounty, GA.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6485-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6485-S6486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FISCAL ISSUES\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, yesterday the President indicated that we \nneed to pivot back to the fiscal issues facing this country and facing \nCongress. This comes after a year with little sense of urgency on \nperhaps the most pressing and challenging domestic issue before us. Of \ncourse, issues such as Syria and foreign policy have to be addressed, \nbut we have had a year in this Congress to address our fiscal issues \nknowing we were moving toward a drop-dead date fiscally of September \n30, and here we are now, more than halfway through September, just \nbeginning to take up these issues that will direct the fiscal future of \nthis country. The clock is ticking away, and we have spent little time \npreparing for what is coming. But here we are once again careening \ntoward another fiscal cliff.\n  The American people are sick and tired of this. I think the Senate \nand the Congress are sick and tired of doing this. Yet we find \nourselves once again careening up against a deadline to provide funding \nto keep our economy moving forward and to keep our government providing \nessential services.\n  Clearly, we could all argue there are a number of things that don't \nneed to be funded or can be postponed, but there are essential \nfunctions of the Federal Government that can't be handled any other way \nand must be funded. National security is one of those top priorities, \nalong with homeland security. We continue to have issues in terms of \nproviding safety for American workers in the workplace, such as the \ntragedy that occurred yesterday at the Naval Yard, and these all come \nunder the rubric of providing law enforcement and homeland security \nenforcement for our people.\n  These are essential functions of government, and unless we come to \nsome agreement by the end of this month, we are going to shut all that \ndown. Our troops won't get paid, our homeland security personnel won't \nget paid, and a whole number of other essential functions will not be \nable to take place. So we have a lot of work before us and very little \ntime to do it.\n  We also know that very quickly--shortly after the end of this month--\nif we don't pass an ongoing resolution to provide funding while we work \nout some of our differences, we will also reach the national debt \nlimit. We are going to have to address whether or not to raise it and, \nif so, how much to raise the current borrowing limit. Today we are \nlooking at an unimaginable national debt of $16.7 trillion, and it is \ngrowing every day. All of us who have seen the debt clock ticking away \nare astounded at the rate we spend and how much we have to borrow in \norder to cover our spending because the revenues do not match the \nspending. Washington has had this spending addiction for decades, as if \nmoney just falls from trees or can just be printed down at the Fed and \nwe won't have to pay any financial consequences.\n  We have had 5 years of stagnant growth in our economy, timid progress \nthat is not putting people back to work. Our economy is not working \nwell. Yet we are still spending way beyond our means. That also has to \nbe addressed. In the last 20 years Federal spending has grown 63 \npercent faster than inflation. So it is clear that without changes, \nmandatory spending, including net interest, is going to consume three-\nfourths of the Federal budget in just one decade. Almost half of that \nFederal spending will go toward Social Security and health care \nentitlements. In 2002 that percentage was 25 percent, and now it is 45 \npercent.\n  Far too little has been done to address this runaway spending train. \nInstead of waiting for a crisis to hit, instead of governing from one \nfiscal cliff to another, isn't it time we worked together on a plan to \nreduce our debt and curb the rate of mandatory spending? This is a \nmatter of extreme importance. It can't be solved with a deal at the \neleventh hour.\n  There has been a lot of talk around here about putting us on a path \nto fiscal solvency but no real action, and the clock continues to tick. \nI would like to ask the President and the Senate majority leader at \nwhat point they think we should start acting on a plan to reduce our \ndebt--$17 trillion, $20 trillion, $25 trillion? At what point, Mr. \nPresident, do we say this is unsustainable? This is driving us toward \ninsolvency. We need to take action. How much red ink is too much?\n  When will the President draw a redline on debt and borrowing? When \npressed, the President says he actually has a fiscal plan: just \ncontinue to raise taxes, pass another one of his stimulus spending \nplans--the last one didn't work too well--and adopt his budget proposal \nthat doesn't even have the support of his own party.\n  Clearly, the President is unwilling to lead on addressing our fiscal \ncrisis. Absent his leadership, I am urging my colleagues in the Senate, \nRepublican and Democratic, to focus on this important issue. Let's put \nsomething on the President's desk and ask him to either sign it or \nreject it. But let's stop waiting for the White House to come forward \nwith a plan because their plan is going nowhere. It doesn't have the \nsupport of either side of this body, Republicans or Democrats. I am \nurging the majority leader to focus the Senate's attention on reducing \nour debt, growing our economy, and getting Americans back to work.\n  The best way to grow the economy and secure our country's fiscal \nfuture is by creating a long-term budget plan that focuses on \nrestructuring mandatory spending programs, reforming our Tax Code, and \ncutting unnecessary Federal spending. This has been a mantra of mine \never since I came back to the Senate. I came back for this very reason, \nand here we are 3 years after the 2010 election, when the public was \nurging us to address this issue, and we still have not accomplished \nthis task. It is because we have not had leadership from this President \nto address the underlying issues that are so plain, that are so \nevident, that are so consequential to our fiscal future. When we boil \nit down to what it means to American families, whether it be saving \nmoney to send their kids to college, getting a decent job after they \ngraduate with a huge debt and being able to pay that back or getting \nmiddle-class people back to work who have been laid off for years, \ngetting our economy moving again at more than a timid 1.8 percent or \n1.5 percent, stumbling along after 5 years of recession--the policies, \nwhether we think they are right, frankly, haven't worked. Isn't it time \nto deal with something everyone knows we need to deal with; that is, \nexcessive spending, this addiction to spending, the plunging into debt \nthat is holding us back from doing what we need to do.\n  I am committed to working toward a solution to address our debt, to \nstrengthen our economy, and help provide full-time jobs for the \nmillions of Americans who are without those jobs. It is time to stop \nprocrastinating. It is time to start acting. It is time that the \nPresident and this Congress stop delaying the hard choices and start \nrepresenting the American people who sent us.\n  It is so unfortunate that we cannot rely on the President--the leader \nof our country--to act. He has announced he would not even discuss this \nincredibly important issue that determines the financial viability of \nour country. The President says: I will not negotiate with Congress on \nthe debt limit. I will not negotiate with Congress on the resolution \ncoming before us to fund the government going forward.\n  How does this provide results to the American people? How can we work \non a plan to reduce the debt if the President refuses to even negotiate \nit? He is\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nwilling to negotiate with President Putin of Russia, but he refuses to \nnegotiate with Congress on how we can address our rising debt. This \nisn't leadership. We can't rely on Putin to pull us out of this one.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

KAPLAN TO BE A JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES COURT \n                           OF FEDERAL CLAIMS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of Patricia E. Campbell-Smith, of \nthe District of Columbia, to be a Judge of the United States Court of \nFederal Claims, and Elaine D. Kaplan, of the District of Columbia, to \nbe a Judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we are voting on 2 nominees to serve \n15-year terms in the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court \nof Federal Claims is an Article I court that is authorized to hear \nmonetary claims that arise from the Constitution, Federal statutes, \nexecutive regulations, or contracts with the United States. We are \nfinally voting on two well-qualified nominees for these positions, but \nwe should also be voting on any of the 9 other Article III judicial \nnominees that are pending on the Executive Calendar.\n  As I have consistently noted, Senate Republicans have unnecessarily \nand persistently delayed nominees on the floor throughout this \nPresident's tenure and today's vote is another example. Rather than \nmoving these two uncontroversial Article I nominees by unanimous \nconsent, we are forced to take up scarce time on the Senate Floor, when \nwe know that both of these nominees will be confirmed by overwhelming \nmargins. There is no good reason why we could not also vote to confirm \nthe consensus and noncontroversial Article III nominees on the \nCalendar. One effect of these unnecessary delays is that for the first \ntime in nearly 2 years, our Federal district courts are again facing \nwhat the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service calls \n``historically high'' vacancies. This means that there are now more \nseats empty on the districts courts than there were during 90 percent \nof the time during the 34 years after the Ford Administration. Despite \nthis, judicial nominees languish on the Executive Calendar.\n  The two women we are considering today for the Court of Federal \nClaims are highly qualified, and their nominations have been stalled \nunnecessarily. Patricia Campbell-Smith has served as a Special Master \nfor the United States Court of Federal Claims since 2005 and as Chief \nSpecial Master since 2011. Ms. Campbell-Smith previously served as a \nlaw clerk to Emily Hewitt, chief judge of the United States Court of \nFederal Claims, from 1998 to 2005, as an associate in private practice \nat the firm of Liskow & Lewis from 1993 to 1996, and again from 1997 to \n1998. She served as a law clerk for Judge Sarah Vance of the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana from 1996 to 1997, and for Judge Martin Feldman \nof the same court from 1992 to 1993.\n  Elaine Kaplan is currently the General Counsel for the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management, and has served as the Acting Director of the \nOffice of Personnel Management since April 2013. She previously served \nas Senior Deputy General Counsel and in other legal capacities for the \nNational Treasury Employees Union from 2004 to 2009, and as the Senate-\nconfirmed head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel from 1998 to 2003. \nFrom 2003 to 2004, Ms. Kaplan served in private practice as a counsel \nat Bernabei and Katz PLLC. She has also served as a staff attorney for \nthe State and Local Legal Center in Washington, D.C., and as an \nattorney with the Office of the Solicitor of the U.S. Department of \nLabor. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported these nominations to the \nSenate by voice vote on June 6, 2013.\n  As we vote on these nominees today, it is also important that we \nbegin taking steps to address the urgent needs of our Federal \njudiciary. Last week, Senator Coons chaired a hearing before the \nSubcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts to consider these urgent \nneeds. At that hearing, we heard testimony from a Federal judge from \nthe District of Delaware, who stated that while she loved her job, she \nfelt sorry for the judges who were just coming on because of the \ndaunting caseload that many of these judges would be facing. A law firm \npartner testifying on behalf of the American Bar Association explained \nthat the shortage of judges and resources were leading to harmful \ndelays in resolving cases brought by individual civil litigants and \nbusinesses.\n  These delays have a real life impact on the American people and the \neconomy. It does not benefit anyone if litigants have their cases \ndelayed for months and months because our Federal courts are \nunderstaffed. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of \nhis or her medical expenses, or when two small business owners disagree \nover a contract, they should not have to wait years for a court to \nresolve their dispute. Americans are rightly proud of our legal system \nand its promise of access to justice and speedy trials. This promise is \nembedded in our Constitution.\n  Sequestration has also had an especially damaging impact on the \nFederal judiciary. I continue to hear from judges and other legal \nprofessionals about the serious problems that sequestration presents. \nChief Justice John Roberts said in July that these cuts ``hit [the \njudiciary] particularly hard . . . When we have sustained cuts that \nmeans people have to be furloughed or worse and that has a more direct \nimpact on the services that we can provide.'' We must look to \nstreamline our Federal budget wherever we can, but we should do so with \ncare and not simply cut indiscriminately across the board. The Federal \njudiciary's budget takes up substantially less than 1 percent of the \nentire Federal budget. That is correct. We have the benefit of the \ngreatest justice system in the world for less than 1 percent of our \nbudget. Yet, we refuse to provide this co-equal branch with the \nadequate resources it needs. Let us work to reverse the senseless cuts \nto our legal system from sequestration so that we can help our coequal \nbranch meet the Constitution's promise of justice for all Americans.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Madam President, I thank the Chair for the \nrecognition, and I rise today to talk about the unimaginable losses all \nof us in Colorado have experienced over this last week.\n  While much of the Nation's attention was focused on Syria or on the \nactivities here in Washington, those of us in Colorado watched rain \nfall for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days straight with no end in sight. Creeks, \nsuch as the one that runs behind my home in Eldorado Springs, swelled. \nCulverts, such as those in Commerce City, quickly filled with rushing \nwater. Rivers, such as the Big Thompson near the beautiful town of \nEstes Park, turned into walls of water that threatened entire \ncommunities. From the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the Eastern \nPlains, rivers overtopped their banks--crumbling highways, drowning \nfamily homes, and transforming entire farms into lakes.\n  Many Americans have seen photos like this one that show the \nwidespread and indiscriminate path of the floodwaters. In some places \neven today entire communities are still underwater, with families and \nhomes uprooted by the ferocious strength of nature.\n  We say that water makes the West possible, but this past week Mother \nNature gave us rain for 5 straight days, and now at least eight people \nare dead and hundreds are still missing or in need of rescue. We pray \nthat we find every single one of those missing persons alive and in \ngood health.\n  As of today the President has issued major disaster declarations for \n4 counties and 15 counties are in a state of emergency, where \nlifesaving rescue efforts are still underway. In these areas active \nsearch and rescue operations are being conducted 24 hours a day by the \nColorado National Guard, local police and fire departments, and rescue \nteams flown in from across the State and around our country. At least \n19,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. Several towns, such as \nJamestown and Lyons, have been washed out and lack even the most basic \npublic services. The town of Estes Park, which I mentioned earlier, the \ngateway community to the Rocky Mountain National Park, has literally \nbeen cut off from the rest of the State because the two major highways \nto it have literally been destroyed and the only access road will soon \nbe closed for the winter.\n  There are some wonderful, inspiring stories that have come out of \nthese events that we couldn't possibly comprehend or predict, and I \nwant to start with the National Guard.\n  The National Guard has been amazing, doing outstanding work and \nrescuing thousands of Coloradans who have been affected by this \ndisaster. They tell me that more people have been rescued by air in the \npast few days than at any time since the devastation we saw with \nHurricane Katrina.\n  We saw--Senator Bennet, who is here with me, and I, along with the \nGovernor and many members of our congressional delegation--the \ndevastation from these floods with our own eyes. Just a few days ago--\nSaturday, to be exact--Senator Bennet and I joined others to fly over \nflooded areas in Boulder and Larimer Counties with a Colorado National \nGuard unit. At one point, as we circled over an area, we spotted a \ncouple of families waving for help. We were able to land and be a part \nof the effort that brought them out of one of those isolated \nsituations. That experience impressed upon me the very human side of \nthis disaster.\n  As we all know, behind these graphic images being shown on TV are the \nlives of thousands of Colorado families, some forever changed. While so \nmuch of this disaster has taken on the grand proportions of a historic \ndisaster, those whose lives have been affected by this flood have \nendured it on a very personal scale. I think this photograph says it \nall. It is the family who has to dig through mud and debris just to get \ninto their kitchen or the older couple who returns from the evacuation \nto see their lifelong home completely destroyed or even, as I mentioned \nearlier, the extended family members who sit by the phone waiting for a \ncall from a missing aunt, a niece, a child, or a friend. These are the \nvery human faces of this tragedy.\n  This is a tragedy from which we can't recover alone. The outpouring \nof support from our friends and neighbors has been crucial to early \nresponse efforts, and this generosity will only strengthen us as we \nbegin to recover. After all, there is no ``i'' in Colorado, and it is \nthis strong sense of community which will allow us to recover from this \ndisaster and to rebuild stronger and more resolute than before.\n  We are also going to rely on the full support of our Federal \npartners. I have long supported disaster aid, such as during Hurricanes \nSandy and Katrina, as well as when we have experienced other countless \nacts of God, and now it is time for us to come together as one Nation \nand rebuild.\n  This will not be fast. It will not be easy. Many of our narrow \nmountain highways that had been carefully built through steep canyons \nhave been destroyed and washed downstream. These highways, such as \nthose in the Presiding Officer's State, are the economic basis for our \nMountain State. Without them, trade and movement of any kind comes to a \ncomplete standstill.\n  I took this photo as we flew over what looks to be a river, but it \nactually used to be a stretch of U.S. Highway 34 outside of Estes Park. \nThat\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nmajor east-west highway is gone. In looking at this photograph and \nseeing what Senator Bennet and I and many others saw on Saturday, it is \none of those ``oh my God'' moments over and over again. Mother Nature \nhas literally rewritten the map. This isn't an isolated incident in \nthis canyon. There are dozens of these washouts, as we see here.\n  That is why I am going to fight in this Congress for full Federal \nsupport for recovery and rebuilding efforts. I am confident the support \nwill be there, just as it was for so many others in their time of need.\n  In the meantime, individuals and businesses that are still dislocated \nor figuring out the extent of their damage must take action. So I want \nto share some advice I have received from FEMA and the other agencies \ninvolved.\n  If your home was damaged because of the storms of the past week, \nplease go to DisasterAssistance.gov to view Federal assistance that may \nbe available to you and to submit your claim. So that is right here--\nDisasterAssistance.gov. I urge everybody to go there and enroll, if you \nwill, on that Web site.\n  If you operate a small business that has been affected by the \nflooding, you should register your claim with the Small Business \nAdministration by going to DisasterLoan.SBA.gov. Again, if you have a \nsmall business and you have been affected by the flooding, go to this \nWeb site: DisasterLoan.SBA.gov.\n  If you are just looking, as so many people are, for a way to help the \npeople suffering from this disaster, go to HelpColoradoNow.org, where \nthe State of Colorado has pooled resources to assist those in need.\n  Madam President, as I conclude, again I want to reference that in so \nmany ways the history of our part of the Nation--the West--has been a \nstory of water, but now that very resource that is our lifeblood is \nwriting a new chapter in our history as it runs uncontrolled over every \nroad, field, and structure in its path. But we are Colorado tough and \nwe are rugged cooperators, and our spirit of strengthened independence \nhas seen us through the most trying of times. It will see us through \nthese days of loss and hardship.\n  I thank the Chair for her attention and her support, and I yield the \nfloor to my colleague and friend Michael Bennet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague Mark \nUdall for summarizing so well what we are facing out in Colorado. I \nthought I would share a few of my thoughts too.\n  As Senator Udall said, our State is in the midst of unprecedented \nflooding that has wiped out entire communities in over a dozen counties \nacross Colorado. Last week rain began to fall across our State, across \nthe Colorado Front Range, and it didn't let up. A lot of reports have \ntermed this historic, but to get your head around the scale and scope \nof the damage it is important to express what that means in hard \nnumbers.\n  In the course of 1 week, 21 inches of rain fell in parts of Boulder, \nincluding over 9 inches on September 12 alone. The previous alltime \nhigh for a single day in Boulder was 4.8 inches in 1919, and they have \nkept records since 1893. The average annual precipitation in Denver is \n14.9 inches--for an entire year. On September 12, 11.5 inches poured \ndown in Aurora. Just to give a sense of the order of magnitude, that is \nalmost as much rain as it typically gets in 1 year--in 1 day. It was \nthe same story all across the Colorado Front Range. The result was \nflooding, destruction, and tragedy on an unprecedented and unmanageable \nscale.\n  Based on the latest estimates, over 17,000 homes were seriously \ndamaged, over 1,500 homes were completely destroyed, and over 2,300 \nagricultural properties were flooded. In just Larimer County alone, \nthey estimate that 200 businesses were destroyed and 500 more were \ndamaged. At least 30 highway bridges were destroyed, and at least 20 \nmore were seriously damaged. Hundreds of miles--hundreds of miles--of \nmajor roads have been washed away, as Senator Udall said. The \nfloodwaters consumed more than 2,000 square miles across 15 counties \nalong the Front Range--an area about twice the size of Rhode Island. \nBecause the rain is just finally letting up and emergency officials are \nonly beginning to measure the magnitude of this rain, these numbers \ncould easily go up, and they could go up a lot.\n  As recently as yesterday morning, 4 days after the flooding reached a \ncrisis, over 1,000 Coloradans are still stranded and awaiting \nevacuation, with hundreds still not accounted for. Tens of thousands \nwere forced to evacuate, and many had to abandon their homes within \nminutes, grabbing whatever they could carry and wading through rising \nwaters to seek shelter and safety. Most tragic of all, eight Coloradans \nare either confirmed or presumed dead as a result of this storm. Those \nare just some of the numbers and a taste of the pain this disaster has \nbrought to cities and counties across our State.\n  As Senator Udall mentioned, over the weekend I joined him and \nGovernor Hickenlooper and others on a helicopter tour of the damage, \nand from the air the scope and scale of the destruction boggles the \nmind. Here is some of what we saw. These photos were taken from the \nDenver Post and other media.\n  Here is an image showing dozens of vehicles flooded in Greeley, CO.\n  Here is a home and a car stranded after a flash flood destroyed a \nbridge near Golden. Dozens of other bridges also collapsed.\n  This is a picture of the Big Thompson River washing out the Loveland \nWater Storage Reservoir.\n  In this picture, young Casey Roy, 9 years old, is looking through a \nwindow into her family's basement under 3 feet of water. And there are \nthousands of families in Colorado just like Casey's.\n  Finally, this image shows the Big Thompson River overflowing and \ntearing apart Colorado U.S. 34 in the Big Thompson Canyon--another \nexample of the damage to the infrastructure across our State.\n  Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time is remaining.\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. I won't go on too much longer, but in addition to showing \nthese images, I do want to pass along a few of the stories we are \nhearing from Colorado families from the past week.\n  In Jamestown, a small mountain community of just a few hundred people \nin the mountains northwest of Boulder, a mudslide destroyed the home of \n72-year-old Joey Howlett, a pillar of that community. It killed him. In \nthe hours that followed, Jamestown residents pooled their resources so \nthat no one was without food or shelter. The town, isolated from \noutside assistance, was literally split in two by the flood, so they \nrigged a pulley system to carry food, medicine, and supplies across the \nrising waters to fellow townspeople.\n  Just outside of Lyons, CO, four adults, three children, and two dogs \nhad to scramble up hills and across ledges with no trails to escape the \nfloodwater. At one point they literally had to make a human chain \nacross waist-deep water so nobody would be carried away. These are a \nfew of the thousands of stories from across our State.\n  We know these floods are devastating. We know the loss some Colorado \nfamilies feel today is beyond words. We know some have lost loved ones, \nand many others have lost homes and businesses that took them decades \nto build. But stories such as this remind me Coloradans are resilient, \nthat the worst disasters often bring out the best in our neighbors. All \nacross the State we have seen Coloradans of different ages, \nbackgrounds, and beliefs pull together and help each other get through \nthis massive storm. We saw real heroism a thousand times a day as first \nresponders and National Guardsmen risked life and limb to carry the \nyoung, the old, the vulnerable, and the injured to safety.\n  I close by saying thank you to the FEMA Administrator for his prompt \nresponse to our request to declare a disaster. He would not let me \nleave the floor without saying that if you are in Boulder, Weld, Adams, \nor Larimer Counties, and impacted, you can go to\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\ndisasterassistance.gov or call 1-800-621-FEMA to register for disaster \nassistance.\n  As we move from rescue to recovery, frustration and enormous \nchallenges lie ahead. We know in the coming weeks, months, and even \nyears Colorado is going to face a lot of rebuilding, and we will rise \nto this occasion. We will build it back better than it was before it \nwas destroyed. We are going to fight every day for Colorado families, \nmany of whom have lost everything, to make sure they are getting the \nsupport they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6489-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6489-S6509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2013\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Statement Correction\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is one thing for a politician to say \nhe misspoke and another for most ordinary people to say they got it \nwrong.\n  I made a statement on the floor of the Senate earlier this morning \nwhich turns out was not entirely accurate, and I would like to clarify \nit and correct it for the Record.\n  I was recounting the history of the Social Security Program created \nby Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, and recounted that it faced a filibuster \nin the Senate. I mistakenly believed it was a Republican filibuster \nwhen in fact it was a filibuster by Senator Huey Long, a nominal \nDemocrat, who was filibustering because of his support of certain \nagricultural subsidies. I want the Record to be clear the filibuster to \ndelay or in any way impact the implementation of Social Security was in \nfact by Senator Long, not a Republican filibuster.\n  I also note the information I used on the floor was derived from a \nbook which I am reading entitled ``Citizens of London'' by Lynne Olson, \nand it is no reflection on her that I got that fact wrong. I remembered \nit wrong when I spoke to it on the floor.\n  The Washington Post is going to go to great lengths tomorrow to \nexplain my other errors in my statement, and I acknowledge I could have \ndone more research before coming to the floor, but I stand by the \npremise that the notion we are somehow going to filibuster the \nAffordable Care Act to delay its implementation is not in the best \ninterests of the United States. If this bill or law needs amendment or \nrepair, let's do it on a bipartisan basis, rather than voting 41 times, \nas they have in the House, to abolish it.\n  I also believe it is valuable for this country to face the cost of \nhealth care. If we are going to deal with America's debt and deficit, \nwe have to acknowledge that 60 percent of it relates to health care \ncosts. The Republican side has not come up with any alternative to deal \nwith this health care crisis. We believe the President's legislation--\nwhich I proudly supported--is a step in the right direction. It can be \nimproved. I will work to improve it. But simply saying we are not going \nto allow it to be implemented is not a positive effort to improve the \nsituation in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as bipartisan discussions go on over the \nnext hour or two on the important Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency \nlegislation, I wish to take a few minutes to outline where we are, why \nthis bill is so important, and how it is going to affect energy policy \ndeliberations generally.\n  I appreciate the work of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I see \nSenators from both sides who I believe would very much like to see \nDemocrats and Republicans work on an agreement to move forward on the \nShaheen-Portman legislation.\n  When you look at this bill, it is almost the platonic ideal of how \nconsensus legislation ought to work in the Senate. You have in effect a \nbipartisan Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We are very pleased \nthe Presiding Officer has joined the committee very recently.\n  This bipartisan committee, taking a piece of bipartisan legislation \nauthored by Senators Shaheen and Portman, two of our most thoughtful \nSenators--took their bill to the floor of the Senate and hour after \nhour the bill got more bipartisan, starting with the distinguished \nSenators Inhofe and Carper, who came with a thoughtful amendment with \nrespect to thermal energy. The list went on and on. Senatorial pair \nafter senatorial pair came to the floor and said they wanted to show \nlaw-making 101 is Democrats and Republicans working together in a \nbipartisan way and to respond to what we have heard Americans say all \nduring the summer break. No matter what part of the country you are \nfrom, the message was the same: Go back and deal with the important \nissues for the economy. Let us expand the winner's circle in a middle-\nclass-driven economy. That is what this legislation does. It is going \nto help create jobs, it is going to allow consumers to save money \nthrough practical energy savings, and it is going to increase American \nproductivity.\n  It is an extraordinary coalition that has assembled for Senator \nShaheen and Senator Portman's legislation: Business Roundtable, \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and environmental groups, public \ninterest organizations--an incredible breadth of support for this bill.\n  What I have been struck by in discussions, particularly over the last \n24 hours, is this question: OK, the Senate is now finally on energy \nlegislation. We actually did a major bill right before the August \nrecess, the hydropower bill. Hydropower is the biggest source of clean \npower in the country right now, 60,000 megawatts, essentially, of \npotential production delivery out of that legislation. But this is the \nfirst bill to actually be on the floor of the Senate since 2007.\n  A number of Senators have said we have got this huge pent-up demand \nto work on energy, and now we have scores of amendments coming in on \nthis bill--perhaps as many as 60 amendments that Senators want to \noffer. Obviously, we could probably be here until New Year's Eve \nworking on this legislation if we have scores of amendments coming in. \nWhat I have tried to tell Senators is, We can't do everything under the \nSun--literally and figuratively--with respect to this bill and still be \nable to move on to other subjects. We would not be able to deal with \nthe continuing resolution and a whole host of other issues the Senate \nhas to tackle. So there has to be some limits.\n  My hope is that agreement can be worked out on several of the issues \nSenators have felt most strongly about. Then if Senators Reid and \nMcConnell can work out an agreement to have a finite number of \namendments that will address energy issues, hopefully bipartisan, we \ncan then move to a vote on energy efficiency. It seems to me there is \nno reason why, theoretically, that could not be done this week. If we \nhave votes on a couple of these issues through a procedural agreement \nthat would address what Senators have been debating over the last few \ndays and then the leaders come up with a finite list of amendments on \nthe other issues, we could finish this bill this week. I think it is \nimportant for the institution to do so.\n  I say to Senators who want to debate a variety of energy issues that \ndeal with, for example, the EPA, we can't do all of those issues on \nthis bill. The energy committee doesn't have jurisdiction over those \nissues. Those are going to come up. On some of what Senators are most \nconcerned about, the government hasn't even acted yet. In other words, \nit is one thing to have a response from the Senate after an agency has \nacted. On some of these matters, the agency hasn't even acted yet. So \nit ought to be possible to find a path forward that would allow for \nvotes on several issues that have been\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\ndebated since the middle of last week. I think there is a way to do \nthat if we can get an agreement on a finite list of additional \namendments so both sides could have some other questions aired and we \ncould vote on energy efficiency.\n  The reality is on the question of energy efficiency, those who are \nmost knowledgeable on the subject say our country has plenty of room \nfor improvement. As of 2011, our country ranked ninth out of the top 12 \nglobal economies in the amount of energy it uses to generate every \ndollar of goods and services it produces. This is what is commonly \nknown as energy productivity. This is not a hypothetical exercise. As \nof 2008, industries consumed about one-third of the total U.S. energy \nuse. The biggest users were chemicals and petroleum refining, pulp \npaper, iron and steel, and obviously other important industries are \nenergy intensive as well. A lot of those employers know using less \nenergy means lower costs and higher margins. Especially larger \ncompanies are in a position to take the steps that will allow them to \ntap those financial gains. But the small and medium-sized companies \noften don't have the technical expertise to know about which upgrades \nare going to make the biggest difference.\n  Here we have this bipartisan bill, and without putting any mandates \non the private sector--not a single mandate on the private sector--this \nbill takes three steps that can help our small companies--the kind of \ncompany that dominates Oregon and Wisconsin and others as well. With \nthis legislation, these small companies are going to be able to be more \ncompetitive.\n  First, the bill tells the Energy Department to reach out to the small \nand medium-sized businesses and make their experts available so the \nsmall businesses can learn directly what the commercially available \nenergy-efficient technology is in their area that will allow them to \nbecome more competitive.\n  Second, it creates rebate programs to encourage manufacturers to \nreplace some of their inefficient equipment, particularly motors and \ntransformers. These are two pieces of equipment in particular that have \nlong service lives and often get rebuilt instead of replaced because of \nthe high cost of replacement.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes a program called Supply Star to \nrecognize companies that have successfully made their supply chains \nmore efficient--once again, voluntary, modeled after the ENERGY STAR \nProgram. I offer that in this debate about what the role of the \ngovernment is in an ``all of the above'' energy policy, these kinds of \napproaches that have a market-driven orientation, that are voluntary in \nnature, are ones that I think are going to allow our country in the \ndays ahead to keep ahead of the competition.\n  In wrapping up, we do have, apparently, over 60 amendments filed. A \nsignificant chunk are them are not on the topic of energy efficiency. I \nsee that the distinguished Senator from Ohio is on the floor, Senator \nShaheen is on the floor, as are others who have strong concerns and are \ngoing to look to see if we can put together a bipartisan approach over \nthe next few hours. I ask Senators to focus on what is doable, which is \nto have votes on the several issues that have been debated over the \nlast few days, and then come to a finite agreement on the rest of the \nissues that would be offered--hopefully by colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. Then we can vote, quaint as the idea might be, on an energy \nefficiency bill, which is the topic that has been before the Senate \nsince the middle of last week.\n  I note that the Senator from Ohio is on the floor. He brought a good \nbill, with Senator Shaheen, to the floor in the middle of last week. It \ngot better with the Inhofe-Carper amendment on thermal energy; the \nLandrieu-Wicker amendment, which helps us make better use of the green \nbuilding certification system; the Hoeven-Pryor amendment that allows \nthe continued use of grid-enabled water heaters to make utility \nmanagement programs more efficient; the Sessions-Pryor and the \nLandrieu-Wicker amendments that reduce regulatory burdens on testing \nconsumer products; the Bennet-Ayotte amendment on commercial buildings; \nthe Pryor-Alexander amendment to look at how the review process works \nin terms of planning our energy future; the Isakson-Bennet amendment to \nlook at home efficiency during mortgage underwriting.\n  When you think about this, the reality is you seem to know more about \nthe energy efficiency of the products you have around your house, such \nas a toaster, than you do about a major--really an extraordinary \npurchase, such as a home. So we have a bipartisan duo in the Senate, \nSenator Isakson and Senator Bennet, wanting to address it. It is a \nterrific amendment, in my view.\n  Then there is the Bennet-Coburn amendment and the Udall-Risch \namendment--saving taxpayers money by saving energy in the Federal \ncomputer data centers--and Senator Klobuchar and Senator Hoeven trying \nto make our nonprofits make better use of their energy because with \nthat tax status it is hard to qualify for some of the opportunities to \nsave energy.\n  I could go on, but it just highlights how a bipartisan committee took \na bipartisan bill from Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman and then a \nbig group of bipartisan Senators made it better. And that is what we \ncould pass, and we could do it this week.\n  For all the Senators who have said there is this pent-up demand since \nthe Senate has not been dealing with energy since 2007, I say the only \nway we can really get to all those topics is to pass a bill such as \nthis that does have a finite list of amendments, and then let's vote on \nShaheen-Portman.\n  Several of my colleagues are on their feet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee regarding this Energy \nbill and his suggestion of a way forward. We did have a good debate \nlast week--not just on the underlying legislation but also, as he \nindicated, on seven different bipartisan amendments. I know we have a \ncouple of colleagues interested in coming to the floor today to talk \nabout additional amendments. We have an opportunity to actually come \ntogether as Republicans and Democrats with a good bill but to improve \nit through some of these amendments that have been discussed on the \nfloor.\n  We do need a way forward. We need to know we are going to have the \nopportunity to have good debate on these issues, to have votes on these \nissues. Specifically, I know Senator Vitter is going to speak in a \nminute on his amendment. I hope he will be given a vote on his \namendment. I understand there is an interest in doing that and perhaps \nallowing the other side to have their point of view expressed as well, \nalong with his vote. If we can have that move forward, my understanding \nis that then we would be able to agree to a series of amendments, \nperhaps an equal number on each side.\n  I am looking at a list here of about a dozen amendments that are \ntruly bipartisan. I am looking at another list of maybe 20 amendments \nthat people on our side of the aisle are interested in offering, some \nof which are directly related to energy, some of which are not. I am \nhopeful we can come up with some time agreements that are reasonable \nand come up with a list that makes sense. The alternative is for us to \nturn our backs on an opportunity here to help grow our economy, to \nreduce our imports of foreign energy--specifically oil. We will miss an \nopportunity to save taxpayers a bunch of money by forcing the Federal \nGovernment to be more energy efficient, to practice what it preaches.\n  Finally, we have an opportunity before us to have a cleaner \nenvironment and to have one of the important legs of an ``all of the \nabove'' energy strategy not just debated on the floor but actually \npassed by the Senate and would then go to the House, where there is a \nlot of interest on both sides of the aisle in together doing something \ncomparable, and go to the President's desk for signature and actually \nbe able to move the country forward in the way I think is needed, which \nis a national energy plan that takes into account producing more \nenergy, as we talked about last week. I am interested in ensuring that \nwe use the resources we have here in the ground in America but also \nusing that energy more efficiently. It makes too much sense for us to \nallow this opportunity to go by.\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\n  I am hopeful that even in the next few hours here we can come \ntogether with a list of amendments that make sense, that we can move \nforward by allowing the Senate to express its view on the Vitter \namendment and other amendments on both sides of the aisle that come \nforward but also move this underlying legislation forward at a time \nwhen, frankly, we need a little bipartisanship around here, at a time \nwhen we seem to be gridlocked on so many big issues. Maybe by finding a \nway forward on the relatively narrow issue of energy efficiency--one \nwhere there is a lot of consensus, one where there is a lot of common \nground, frankly--we can find a model for dealing with some of the \nbigger issues.\n  We do have some time this week to do this; however, the continuing \nresolution is likely to come over from the House soon. I hope it will \nbecause we have to deal with that issue before the end of the month.\n  My urging of my colleagues is, if you have not already come over to \ntalk about your amendment, please do so today, understanding that you \nwill not be able to offer it in an official manner. You will be able to \ntalk about it, which will help expedite the process later as we begin \nmoving on these amendments, which I hope we will do again even after \ncoming up with this agreement today. And then if you have an amendment \nyou do not think is on this list, please be sure to tell us right away.\n  I do think getting this across the finish line should be something \nRepublicans and Democrats alike can agree to. I am not suggesting that \neverybody is going to vote for it, but I think everybody should be \nwilling to let us have a chance to move to this legislation.\n  By the way, it is endorsed by over 260 groups, including the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, which decided to key vote the legislation late \nlast week. As they looked at some of the these amendments and the \nunderlying bill, they thought it was important enough to key vote it. \nBut it is not just the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it is the Alliance to \nSave Energy, which is a group that has worked on this legislation with \nus for almost 3 years now, and it is also the National Association of \nManufacturers and the environmental groups, including NRDC. It is an \nunusual combination when you have business groups and environmental \ngroups saying: This makes sense. It helps make our economy more \ncompetitive, helps create jobs, and gets us away from our dependency on \nforeign oil. It actually makes the environment cleaner. That is a \ncombination we do not see often.\n  My hope is that we will move forward, and I again urge my colleagues \nto come forward to help us move forward by talking about your \namendments today so that when we have a chance to move forward \nofficially on these amendments, we can do so expeditiously.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire Senator Shaheen is on the \nfloor. I know she is speaking with her side of the aisle as I am \ntalking to my side of the aisle to try to come up with a list of \namendments to which we can agree within a reasonable timeframe, and I \nam hopeful we can move forward with that in the next few hours.\n  I yield back my time and look forward to talking about some of these \namendments as people bring them to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I wish to commend my colleagues \nSenators Shaheen and Portman for their work to bring this legislation \nto the floor. I commend as well Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member \nMurkowski for their leadership in the energy committee.\n  Fully half of the energy we use in this great country is wasted. That \nis a fact we can no longer afford to ignore. Each one of us is able to \nmake changes in our daily lives to increase our energy efficiency. \nThere is no kilowatt hour, no Btu more valuable than the ones we do not \nactually use in the first place. But it is clear that we are going to \nhave to do a lot more than turn the lights out when we leave home to be \na leader in the world in this field.\n  As the largest energy consumer in the United States, I think the \nFederal Government has not only an obligation but also an opportunity \nto lead by example when it comes to energy performance. We know that \nbuildings are the largest energy consumers in the United States today. \nAccounting for over 40 percent of our use, they offer the greatest \nopportunities for energy savings.\n  Over the summer I had the opportunity and the privilege of joining \nthe Department of Energy in presenting the Brackish Groundwater \nNational Desalination Research Facility--that is a mouthful, I know. It \nis an important research facility in New Mexico, in my home State. We \npresented them with a Better Buildings Award on behalf of the DOE. The \nFederal Energy Management Program designed those awards, the Better \nBuildings Awards, to encourage significant reductions in energy usage \nin Federal buildings all across the country--reductions that go above \nand beyond the current codes and mandates that exist.\n  What the team at the desalinization research facility accomplished \nwas nothing short of truly impressive and an example of what is \npossible with legislation such as this and in the field of energy \nefficiency. They were able to save approximately 300,000 kilowatt-hours \nper year--an annual savings of $42,000. That is a remarkable 53.6 \npercent of their former energy footprint at a time when that research \nfacility was actually increasing the amount of research going on. They \ndid this through thoughtful analysis, by implementing both active and \npassive energy conservation techniques, and with a capital investment \nof literally less than $800. For $800 and some engineering expertise, \nthis research facility was able to save the taxpayers over $40,000 last \nyear--$40,000 next year, $40,000 the year after that and into the \nfuture. That is a window into why this kind of legislation is so \nimportant and why we ought to be able to find common ground when it \ncomes to energy efficiency.\n  I would also like to touch on another area of rapid energy innovation \nthat is relevant to this legislation--the lighting sector. Lighting \nconsumes 22 percent of the electricity that is generated in this \ncountry. That is $50 billion per year for consumers across the United \nStates. In Albuquerque, Sandia National Laboratories is accelerating \nadvances in what is called solid state light, or SSL, which is a \nrapidly evolving technology with the potential to reduce energy \nconsumption in lighting by a factor of three to six times. My \ncolleagues may have seen some of the new solid-state lights if they \nhave been to Home Depot or Lowe's or their locally owned hardware \nstore. These light bulbs are so efficient that when I was installing a \ncouple in my son's bedroom a few weeks ago, I could literally put my \nhand on the light bulb because they make such good use of the energy \nthey use.\n\n  Sandia has worked in solid-state lighting for a long time and their \nSSL Science Center is exploring new energy conversion techniques in \ntailored photonic structures. Drawing on their long history of research \nand development in this area--and, frankly, working closely with both \nuniversity and private sector partners--they are working to understand \nthe mechanisms and the defects in SSL semiconductor materials so they \ncan make these already incredibly efficient light bulbs even more \nefficient.\n  Sandia is also investigating the basic conversion of electricity to \nlight using radically new designs that can take these things even \nfurther--things such as luminescent nanowires, quantum dots, and even \nhybrid architectures that may be the bright light bulb of the future. \nThis is progress driven by basic research and science--the kinds of \ninvestments that, frankly, have made our country great and made our \neconomy so strong.\n  The Shaheen-Portman bill will spur the use of energy efficiency \ntechnologies such as these, where all of us live and work and, in turn, \nwill lower utility bills for consumers and save money for taxpayers. \nFurthermore, this bipartisan bill will strengthen U.S. competitiveness \nby stimulating significant private sector research and development \ninvestments in manufacturing innovation and productivity.\n  Investing in energy efficiency is one of the fastest as well as the \nmost cost-effective ways we can grow our economy. It is estimated that \nthis measure alone--just this piece of legislation--would help create \n136,000 new jobs by\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\n2025 and, by 2030, the bill would net an annual savings of over $13 \nbillion--billion with a ``B''--for consumers, and lower CO2 \nemissions and other air pollutants by the equivalent of taking over 20 \nmillion cars off the road.\n  My home State of New Mexico is already capitalizing on a highly \ndiversified but rapidly transforming energy sector. It stands to \nbenefit from leveraging investments and efficiency projects and native \ntechnologies.\n  Through American ingenuity we can slow the effects of climate change \nand unleash the full potential of cleaner homegrown energy, creating a \nstable and healthier nation for future generations of Americans.\n  So instead of transforming this debate about what is fundamentally \nsupposed to be a debate about energy efficiency into another tired \nbattle over ObamaCare, I urge my colleagues to embrace the fact that \nthis bill truly represents the culmination of years of bipartisan work \nto craft a smart, effective energy bill with a good chance of actually \nbecoming law.\n  I know when I go home--and I have spoken to many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who say the same--one of the complaints we hear \nthe most right now is: Why can't you guys just get something done? Why \ncan't you work together on something? This is an opportunity to show we \ncan still legislate, we can come together on the things we agree on, \neven while agreeing to disagree on many other issues.\n  Again, I thank Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman for working so \ntirelessly on this bill, I thank the chair and ranking member of the \nenergy committee for making it a priority, and I thank all of the \nSenators who serve on that committee for working together on both sides \nof the aisle to see this move forward. I hope as a Senate we will seize \nthis opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Republican Whip.\n\n\n                          Navy Yard Shootings\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor the day \nafter a terrible tragedy that befell Washington, DC, particularly those \nwho live and work around the Washington Navy Yard.\n  Hardly a mile from this building, and in the shadow of its dome, \nthere occurred an act of senseless violence that took the lives of 12 \nmen and women and injured several more, as well as the life of the \nshooter himself. These men and women worked, by and large, in service \nto our country, whether as uniformed military or as civilian \ncontractors. Of course, they are more than just the numbers usually \nascribed. They are mothers and fathers, brothers, sisters, husbands and \nwives.\n  When I heard about this shooting yesterday as I was traveling from \nTexas back to Washington, DC, I couldn't help but think about a not-\ntoo-dissimilar tragedy that occurred about 4 years ago at Fort Hood, \nTX, when MAJ Nidal Hasan killed about 13 people there as well as \ninjuring more than 30 others.\n  At this difficult time, we, of course, pray for these souls who were \nunexpectedly taken from us. We pray for comfort for their grieving \nfamilies and friends, and we pray that healing may come quickly for \nthose who were wounded.\n  We witnessed evil yesterday, but as so often is the case when the \nunthinkable occurs, accounts of tremendous bravery and self-sacrifice \nemerge. I found some small measure of solace in one such story I read. \nIt described how one gentleman at the scene--a man by the name of Omar \nGrant--guided his partially blind colleague to safety. As shots rang \nout and people ran for the exits, Mr. Grant took his colleague by the \narm and, risking his own safety, made his mission to guide him out of \nthe building. This, of course, says nothing about the remarkable feats \nof bravery of the first responders who rushed to the scene and who \nplaced their lives at risk in order to preserve the safety of others \nahead of their own.\n  Yesterday's events remind us life is fragile and it is a precious \ngift. Let us express our deep gratitude for those who work around the \nclock, both in places such as the Navy Yard and here at the Capitol, to \nhelp keep us safe. I wish to thank the DC Metropolitan Police for their \nimportant role, the U.S. Capitol Police, and all the first responders \nfor their extraordinary response. Their courage, their vigilance, and \ntheir sacrifice is what helps keep all of us safe, all of us who work \nhere and visit our Nation's Capital. We thank them and we promise, on \nbehalf of a grateful nation, we will never forget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I was very happy to hear the description \nof a possible path forward from the floor manager for this bill a few \nminutes ago, and I welcome that path forward. It is completely \nconsistent with the UC I offered many times last week that was, \nunfortunately, then rejected. Hopefully, it will now be accepted so we \ncan have a path forward and have votes on so many amendments brought to \nthis bill about energy, on my amendment, and on other significant \ntopics. It certainly sounds as though the discussion at the majority \nlunch today was, let's say, more appropriate and more productive than \nthe discussion last Thursday. I look forward to that path forward.\n  As we hopefully build on that path forward, let me again explain why \nI think a clear up-or-down vote before October 1 on my amendment is \nvery important and why I am demanding it. It is not my choosing that \nthis happen in terms of this illegal OPM rule, it is not my choosing \nthis October 1 deadline has been created, but that is exactly what has \nhappened, which demanded that I act with my amendment which, in \ngeneral, I am joined with the support of several colleagues and I \nappreciate their partnership and their help.\n  This all began in the ObamaCare debate--in our debate and in our \nlegislating--on the ObamaCare bill. In that process a Grassley \namendment was accepted that said in clear and no uncertain terms that \nevery Member of Congress and that all congressional staff would go to \nthe so-called exchanges, no ifs, ands or buts. The purpose of that \nlanguage was crystal clear. The message was whatever the fallback plan \nis for all Americans--first it was the public option and then it became \nan exchange--whatever that fallback plan is for all Americans, that is \nwhat every Member of Congress and that is what congressional staff \nshould go to. There should be no special deal, no special exemption, no \nspecial subsidy; that is what we should live by. I certainly supported \nthat language. It goes to what is a fundamental rule of democracy: The \ngovernors should live by the same rules as the governed, across the \nboard.\n  Our Founders actually talked about that specifically. James Madison, \na coauthor of the Federalist Papers, wrote Federalist No. 57 \nspecifically about this point, and a central theme in that Federalist \nNo. 57 was exactly this: What is good for America is good for \nWashington. The rule for America should certainly be the rule for those \nwho have the particular honor and responsibility to help govern, and \nthat should be the case across the board, certainly including \nObamaCare. That is why that provision got into law, passed into law, \nand was signed into law by President Obama.\n  After that, I guess we sort of experienced what Nancy Pelosi \ndescribed about ObamaCare, which was we had to pass the law to find out \nwhat is in it. After the law was passed, several folks around here on \nCapitol Hill and in Washington read the law, read that particular \nprovision, and they said: Oh ``you know what.'' They said: Wait a \nminute, look at this, and they correctly noted the clear language \ndemands that all Members of Congress, all congressional staff, go to \nthe exchange, and, clearly, our current subsidy for health care does \nnot follow us there. In fact, there is a specific other section of \nObamaCare that says quite clearly that when an employee of a business \ngoes to the exchange, that employee's employer contribution for \nemployer-based health care does not follow him or her to the exchange.\n  Again, when a lot of folks around here, after the fact, read what was \nthen the ObamaCare law on that point, they said: Oh ``you know what.'' \nThat is when a lot of scurrying started, a lot of gnashing of teeth, a \nlot of scheming, a lot of discussion, and ultimately a lot of lobbying \nof the President and the Obama administration. Sadly, it was \nbipartisan, I believe, a lot of folks\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\npushing to have the Obama administration simply issue a rule, a \nregulation that fixed all of this.\n  The problem is pretty simple, pretty straightforward, and pretty \nimportant. We are not supposed to issue a rule or regulation that is \ncontrary to the statute, and that is what these folks were lobbying for \nand, sadly, that is what they got.\n  Right as Congress was going into the August recess, safely leaving \ntown, the Obama administration issued this OPM rule that my language is \nall about. That rule is flatout clearly illegal on two grounds.\n  First of all, under this proposed OPM rule, every Member of Congress \ngets to decide for himself or herself what staff members are even \ncovered by the mandate to go to the exchange at all. That is \nridiculous, and it is directly contrary to the clear, unmistakable \nlanguage in ObamaCare. That language says all official staff go to the \nexchange. Now this illegal OPM rule is going to say: Well, it did not \nreally mean all official staff; it just meant whoever any individual \nMember of Congress decides. That is ridiculous and that is illegal.\n  The second part of the OPM rule is just as illegal, just as \nridiculous, just as objectionable, and it says: Whoever does go to the \nexchange--Members of Congress and whatever staff do go to the \nexchange--they get to bring along with them their big taxpayer-funded \nsubsidy from their previous Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan.\n  Well, wait a minute. ObamaCare does not say that. In fact, there is a \nseparate provision of ObamaCare that says the opposite, that says when \nan employee goes to the exchange from a business, that employee loses \nhis or her employer contribution--a specific part of ObamaCare directly \ncontrary to what this illegal OPM rule is trying to do.\n  So, again, the attempt is simply to rewrite the law by administrative \nfiat, yet again to create another exemption from ObamaCare, if you \nwill, that is nowhere in the statute. That is wrong, that is illegal, \nand that demands action. That is why I, with several other Members--\nHouse and Senate--came up with this language.\n  This language I am proposing on the floor now as an amendment would \nstop this illegal OPM rule. It would say exactly what ObamaCare says \nnow: Every Member of Congress, all of our staff, must go to the \nexchange and operate under the same rules as all other Americans--no \nspecial deal, no special exemption, no special subsidy. No other \nAmerican gets this fat employer subsidy in going to the exchange, nor \nshould we. That is not in ObamaCare, and there is a specific section of \nObamaCare that, in fact, says the opposite. So my language on the floor \nnow would say that and would broaden the rule, appropriately, to the \nPresident, the Vice President, and all of their political appointees.\n  The clear intent of this provision in ObamaCare from the beginning \nwas that what is good for America has to be good for Washington, \nwhatever cards America is dealt, including that fallback plan--\noriginally it was proposed as the public option; now the exchanges--\nthat should be what is imposed on Washington. No special plan, no \nspecial deal or exemption or subsidy; what is imposed on America needs \nto be imposed on Washington.\n  That is true under ObamaCare. That should be true across the board \ntoday, just as it was true in the eyes and minds and hearts of the \nFounders. Again, James Madison, in Federalist No. 57, wrote \nspecifically on this point. This basic first rule of democracy goes \nback that far.\n  That is why I come to the floor and demand a vote. It is an explicit \nreaction to an illegal rule--a rule issued by the administration beyond \nthe President's authority, with no basis in the ObamaCare law, in fact, \nwith provisions of the ObamaCare law that are directly contrary to it, \nand a rule that is set to take effect October 1. So we must vote now.\n  That is why, again--to come back full circle to the comments of the \ndistinguished majority floor leader on this bill--I welcome the path \nforward he was describing. That is exactly the path forward I set out \nlast week in my UC request. So let's vote. Let's do what this \ninstitution is supposedly set up to do. Let's vote on this very \nimportant, very timely issue. Let's vote on other amendments on the \nbill. Let's vote on the bill. Let's move forward in that appropriate \nand productive way.\n  Thank you.\n  With that, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to speak to the Shaheen-\nPortman legislation that is on the floor, the Energy Savings and \nIndustrial Competitiveness Act. But I have to start by responding to my \ncolleague from Louisiana because, first of all, I appreciate that he \nwants a vote on this issue of the OPM ruling. There are a lot of things \nI would like to see a vote on, and I understand he is saying he is not \nopposed to the bill, which I very much appreciate. But the fact is, he \nchooses to be here to hold up this bipartisan piece of legislation at a \ntime when we can get some real agreement on energy legislation coming \nout of the Senate--the first time since 2007 we have had an energy bill \non the floor.\n  This is a bipartisan energy bill. It is a bill that has over 16 \nbipartisan amendments that have been vetted by the energy committee, \nthat have support not just from the chairman of the energy committee \nand the ranking member but from the committee staff, from Senator \nPortman and myself. We think we have a real opportunity to pass this \nbill and to make it even better because of all of these bipartisan \namendments. But my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter, is \nrefusing to allow us to get these votes because he wants a vote on his \namendment.\n\n  I am happy to take a vote on his amendment. I would like to be able \nto clarify for the record the OPM ruling. I think there is a lot of \nmisinformation--people who are calling to say that Members of Congress \nare not going to be in the exchange. Well, the fact is, Members of \nCongress who choose to continue to have their health care through the \nFederal program are in the exchange, as are our staffs. But we are not \nasking other large employers such as the Federal Government to \neliminate the employer share of health care, as Senator Vitter would \nask--that the Federal Government eliminate its employer share of health \ncare for all of our staffs who are working for the Federal Government.\n  I do not think the American people believe the employer's share of \nhealth care should be eliminated. I think we have a system of health \ncare that is employer based, and the system we have in the Federal \nGovernment is going to continue to be employer based as well. That \nmeans the Federal Government will pay a share of health care.\n  I think this is a debate we ought to have because I think there are a \nlot of people who are on the extreme right who want to be disingenuous \nabout what is going on here. They are interested in spreading \nmisinformation about what is happening with the health care law because \nthey cannot believe Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, that the \nSupreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act, and that, in fact, we are \nalready seeing the benefits for people across this country from the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We are seeing people who have had previous illnesses--so preexisting \nconditions--who are no longer going to be denied health insurance \nbecause of the Affordable Care Act. We are seeing people who can stay \non their health care--young people--until they are age 26 because of \nthe Affordable Care Act. We are seeing people who no longer have \nlifetime limits on what their share is for health insurance when they \nbecome ill. We are seeing people who are in the doughnut hole with \ntheir prescription drugs who are getting help for those prescription \ndrugs. So I am happy to have that debate on the Affordable Care Act. \nBut now is not the time to do it. This is a time when we can get some \nreal agreement on energy efficiency, on an energy bill that, as the \nAmerican Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has said, would create \n136,000 jobs by 2025, that would save consumers billions of dollars by \n2030, that would be the equivalent of taking millions of cars off the \nroad. It is a win-win-win, and it is a bill that has not just \nconsiderable bipartisan support in this Chamber but it is a bill that \nhas support from groups that are as far apart as the American Chemistry \nCouncil and the Sierra Club, groups that do not normally come together \non a bill--over 260\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\ngroups. That list is growing every day, private businesses that say: \nThe way we need to begin to address our energy challenges is by saving \nenergy. The cheapest, fastest way to address our energy needs is \nthrough energy efficiency.\n  This is a bill that does not depend on whether you support fossil \nfuels or new alternatives. The Presiding Officer knows we can support \ncoal, investments in coal, and still support energy efficiency. We can \nsupport wind and still support energy efficiency. We can support solar \nand still support energy efficiency. We can support more drilling and \nstill support energy efficiency.\n  This bill is a win-win-win, and we need to get on the bill. We need \nto get those people who would rather debate issues that are extraneous \nto this legislation to hold those debates for a later time.\n  As I said, I am happy to continue to debate health care. Even though \nwe have been debating it now for the 4 years since the bill has been \npassed, I am happy to do that. But now is not the time to do that.\n  So, Mr. President, I will yield the floor and hope we can reach some \nagreement that will address Senator Vitter's concerns, that will \naddress some of the other concerns that have been waiting that will \nallow us to move forward on an energy bill that is in the best \ninterests of the country.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Navy Yard Tragedy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, to begin, my thoughts and prayers certainly \ngo out to everyone who was impacted by the horrific events of yesterday \nat the Navy Yard, particularly to those whose loved ones lost their \nlives or were injured in what is a senseless tragedy.\n  Having said that, I also want to express my gratitude to the brave \nmen and women who serve in our Nation's military for the sacrifices \nthey make for each and every one of us and to the first responders and \nlaw enforcement personnel who work tirelessly to assist those in need \nand to keep us all safe throughout the day.\n  It was a dreadful day. I know there is little I can say or do to \nbring comfort to those who are suffering today, but I hope and pray \nthey will find some measure of peace in the coming days.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak about some of \nthe problems we face as the administration continues to struggle with \nthe implementation of the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n  It seems as though nearly every week we learn about another problem \nfacing the Obama administration as they seek to implement this \nmisguided law. More often than not, those problems are revealed through \nstatements announcing delays in certain elements of the law.\n  The employer mandate? Delayed. The small businesses health insurance \nmarket? Delayed. Employee automatic enrollment in the exchanges? \nDelayed.\n  Of course, this should not come as a surprise to anyone. This is, \nafter all, the largest expansion of government in a generation. And it \nis not as though it was carefully crafted. No. The President's health \ncare law was rushed through Congress in a partisan fashion, virtually \nensuring it would face problems when the rubber meets the proverbial \nroad.\n  For months now, experts have been warning us about ObamaCare's \nfailings and the challenges those failings pose as the administration \ntries desperately to have something ready to implement by October 1.\n  One of the major parts of ObamaCare is the health care exchanges. \nThese are designed to be online marketplaces where those without health \ninsurance will be required by law to shop for coverage.\n  Millions of people are expected to sign up to purchase insurance \nthrough the exchanges. As a result, the exchanges are expected to have \na massive impact on the overall insurance market, even affecting those \nwho get their insurance elsewhere.\n  Make no mistake, ObamaCare's health insurance exchanges will have an \nimpact on every American, regardless of where they get their health \ninsurance.\n  That being the case, one would reasonably assume the administration \nwould not move forward on the exchanges until they were ready. \nUnfortunately, when it comes to implementing the President's health \ncare law, reason does not appear to enter into the equation. Despite \ncountless red flags, the administration is charging ahead. They are, to \nsay the least, desperate to avoid another delay when it comes to \nObamaCare. So come hell or high water, the exchanges will go live on \nOctober 1 of this year.\n  This is problematic for numerous reasons, not the least of which are \nthe privacy and security considerations that up to now appear to have \nbeen ignored by the administration officials. When people sign up for \ninsurance through an exchange, they will be required to submit their \nSocial Security number, tax returns, household income information, and \nthe like. This is, to say the least, highly sensitive information.\n  In recent months, we have seen government-certified security systems \nhave been shown to be less than reliable when it comes to protecting \npersonal information. This past July, for example, the IRS accidentally \nposted thousands of Social Security numbers on its Web site. That was a \nsmall mistake with potentially devastating consequences for those who \nhad their information exposed.\n  The information collected when people sign up for the exchanges will \nbe entered into a Federal services data hub, a new information-sharing \nnetwork that will allow State and Federal agencies, including the IRS, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, \nand the Department of Homeland Security, to verify a person's \ninformation. It is at this point unclear whether the data hub has \nadequate security in place to prevent enrollees' information from \nfalling into the hands of data thieves. There are plenty of them out \nthere.\n  Last month the HHS Office of Inspector General issued a report \nindicating the government had failed to meet several deadlines for \ntesting operations and reporting data security vulnerabilities involved \nwith the data hub. This, as you might expect, led to an outcry from \nMembers of Congress from both sides of the aisle. As a result, on \nSeptember 10, the White House conveniently announced that all testing \nhas been completed and that the data hub was ready to launch.\n  This announcement came a mere 3 weeks before the exchanges were set \nto go live. Of course, no independent entity will get a chance to \nverify the testing and to certify that there are, as the administration \nclaims, no security problems. No third party will be able to make \nrecommendations to improve safeguards in order to better protect the \nprivacy of consumers. Instead, we are supposed to simply rely on the \nadministration's internal testing of the data hub security and stop \nasking questions. This, sadly, is par for the course with the Obama \nadministration.\n  So here we are. We are mere days away from the launch of the \nexchanges, and we have yet to definitively prove whether the massive IT \nor information technology system that will be compiling enrollees' \ninformation is secure. What a state of events. To the millions of \nconsumers about to enroll in the exchanges, this could end up being \ntheir worst nightmare.\n  As if the potential disaster surrounding the data hub were not \nenough, we also have lax regulations regarding the hiring of the so-\ncalled navigators who are to help people get through these problems. As \nyou will recall, under ObamaCare, organizations will receive grants to \nassist the uninsured in determining what type of coverage they qualify \nfor in States where the Federal Government will be running the \nexchange. The individuals working with those organizations are called \nnavigators. Under the law, they will often have access to enrollees' \npersonal information.\n  In April HHS published its proposed rule regarding the certification \nof navigators. Almost immediately Members of Congress recognized the \nregulations were far too lenient, cutting corners on things such as \ntraining and background checks and threatening to leave patients and \nconsumers with inadequate protection.\n  A group of my colleagues and I sent a letter to Secretary Sebelius \noutlining our concerns regarding this rule. Our hope was the \nrequirements for navigators would be enhanced to ensure consumers were \nnot harmed by unqualified navigators or imposters serving as government \ncounselors. Sadly, our request\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nfell on deaf ears. We never received a response.\n  In late July HHS issued its final navigator rule keeping in place the \nvery weak privacy protections, opening the door for private information \nto fall into the wrong hands. Consumer watchdog groups are already \nwarning of scams leading to fraud and identify theft with regard to the \nexchanges. Indeed, it seems criminals and fraudsters are already lining \nup to game the system and prey on the innocent.\n  Over the last few years I have come to the floor several times to \ntalk about the shortcomings of ObamaCare. I continue to believe the law \nis beyond saving, that it should be repealed in its entirety. That \nremains my No. 1 goal when it comes to ObamaCare. However, I also \nbelieve those of us who opposed this law, which, according to recent \npolls, is a growing percentage of the population, cannot stand on the \nsidelines and let this law inflict harm on the American people. While \nwe continue to push for a full repeal of the law, we need to do all we \ncan to mitigate the damage that could come from this law.\n  With regard to privacy and data security, we need to ensure the \nadministration does not expose the personal data of millions of \nAmericans to more fraud. That is why I am introducing the Trust But \nVerify Act. If enacted, this important legislation would delay the \nimplementation of the Federal and State health insurance exchanges \nuntil the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the \nHHS inspector general, can attest that the necessary privacy and data \nsecurity parameters are in place.\n  It would simply be irresponsible to open the exchanges without \nadequate safeguards to protect and secure consumers' personal \ninformation. While the administration claims these safeguards exist, \nthere is simply no way to verify these claims absent an independent \nreview, which they are not taking. Until we can demonstrate to the \npublic their personal information is secure, we should not move forward \nwith enrollment in the exchanges. It is that simple. My legislation \nwould ensure the exchanges remain on ice until this threshold issue is \naddressed. These are not frivolous concerns; these are real problems. I \nhope all of my colleagues, even those who continue to support the \nPresident's health law, will work with me to help address these issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, first, let me commend the chief \ncosponsors of this bill, Senators Shaheen and Portman, for their \nperseverance and their great leadership on this issue. I am a \nwholehearted and passionate supporter of this cause and urge my \ncolleagues to address what is truly a triple play.\n  This bill is a way to win for employment and economic growth. It is a \nway to win for energy savings and financial savings for our \nmanufacturing companies, to make America more competitive. It is a way \nto win for our planet, indeed, to help save our planet along with \nsaving money and saving energy.\n  I will not only support the bill and the amendments, but I have asked \nfor support for an amendment of my own that would help to measure the \nnonmonetary benefits of some of the changes that would be brought about \nby this legislation. I ask Senators Portman and Shaheen to accept this \namendment and for my colleagues to support it as well.\n\n\n                          Newtown Anniversary\n\n  I am here to help commemorate the 9-month anniversary of the tragedy \nat Newtown that took the lives of 26 wonderful people--20 beautiful \nchildren and 6 courageous, skilled educators. It was a commemoration I \nwas going to observe yesterday on the floor of the Senate, but, of \ncourse, there was no Senate session yesterday because of yet another \nunspeakable, horrific tragedy, this one close, literally within blocks \nof this great building.\n  It was physically close, but every one of those incidents should be \nclose to us emotionally as Newtown has been for me and others of my \ncolleagues, most especially my friend and colleague Senator Murphy. It \nbrought back a rush of memories for me because Newtown is still close \nto us in emotional proximity, just as the Navy shooting was close in \nphysical proximity. The Navy lost 12 of its members. My heart and \nprayers go out to those great sailors, civilians, and contractors, and \ntheir loved ones.\n  Today we have an inspector general report that is profoundly and \ndeeply troubling. If reports of this audit are true, the Navy put the \nsafety of personnel at risk to save dollars and cents. This apparent \nsecurity lapse, permitting people with criminal records to freely \naccess military bases and facilities, is deeply concerning, indeed \nshocking. I call on the inspector general to release the full report. I \nhave the report. I have reviewed it briefly. I cannot talk about its \ncontents because it has not been released. Make this report public so \nwe know what the inspector general of the Navy has said about lapses of \nsecurity and about the failures of the RAPIDGate technology that was \nsupposed to protect people at the Navy Yard here in Washington, DC.\n  Lax safety and security measures at our military facilities is \ninexcusable. I commend the Secretary of the Navy and the leadership of \nthe Navy for raising this issue and hope they will decide to make \npublic the full report to the extent it can be done so consistent with \nour Nation's security.\n  But one of the lessons here is that the Navy, with RAPIDGate \ntechnology and all of its facilities with armed guards and the complex \ntechnology it uses, could not protect members of its own ranks at the \nNavy Yard. We should know why. If it could not do so there, can our \nschools be safe? Can our workplaces be safe? Can America be safe with \nthe present plethora of firearms in our Nation today?\n  This day was horrific and tragic for America. Yet in many ways it was \nanother day. The threat is these incidents will become the new normal. \nWe need to ask, will these incidents, these horrific, unspeakable \ntragedies, make a difference? Will they change the political mindset \nand culture in this body and in the House of Representatives?\n  In the days to come, we will learn more. There is much more to learn \nbefore we draw conclusions. I emphasize the facts are disclosed one by \none even as we watch the news. We will try to wrap our minds around \nwhatever evil motive caused this senseless crime, but we know the means \nall too well. The moment shots rang out and the blurb came over the \nnews wire, we knew with an instinctive understanding this unfolding \nincident was another act of gun violence in America, another act of gun \nviolence in an America plagued by a plethora of guns.\n  The answer to the question, will it become a new normal, should find \nthe articulate, in fact, deeply powerful words of Janis Orlowski, the \nchief medical officer of MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the \nhospital that received some of yesterday's victims, the hospital that \ndeals routinely with gunshot wounds and sometimes deaths. I hope the \nNation will hear her plea when she said, in effect, these senseless \nkillings have to stop, stating:\n\n       There's something evil in our society that we, as \n     Americans, have to work to try and eradicate. I would like \n     you to put my trauma center out of business. I really would. \n     I would like to not be an expert on gunshots. Let's get rid \n     of this. This is not America.\n\n  When I went to Sandy Hook 9 months ago on December 14, I felt an \nobligation to go as a public official, but what I saw was through the \neyes of a parent, the cries of grief and pain that I will never forget. \nThey will live with me always, loved ones and parents emerging from \nthat firehouse having learned moments before that their beautiful \nchildren and loved ones would not be coming home that evening.\n  Like the loved ones who said goodbye to the 12 victims at the \nWashington Navy Yard, it was another day, a day like every other day \nwhen they expected them to come home to the routine, mundane joys of \nlife. Twenty innocent, beautiful children and 6 great educators did not \ncome home that day. In the days that followed, we all hoped the Senate \nof the United States would keep faith with those families. In the 9 \nmonths since, we have hoped the Nation would keep faith with the 8,158 \nAmericans around the country, the 8,158 victims of gun violence.\n  Last April, the Senate turned its back on Newtown families. One of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nmost difficult days of my career in this job or any other job was to \ntry to explain to those families how more than 90 percent of the \nAmerican people--a majority of gun owners, in fact many members of the \nNRA--could back a commonsense measure like background checks, the bill \nthe Presiding Officer and Senator Toomey sponsored so courageously and \nably--could have that kind of support and yet fail to pass this body. \nIt had 55 Senators supporting it on that day--54 voting for it, but 60 \nvotes were needed. One of the answers, of course, is to change the \nSenate rules, which I have long supported, to eliminate the filibuster.\n  The families of Newtown, and those 8,158 Americans, their loved ones, \nand all Americans deserve a better answer. It is not to accept these \nmass killings as the new normal, as the commonplace of America. We are \nbetter than that normal as a Nation. We cannot accept it. I hope, ask, \nand pray that the unspeakable, unimaginable tragedy of Newtown and now \nWashington Navy Yard will renew and reinvigorate this movement and give \nus impetus, emotional, intellectual, and political, which we need and \ndeserve.\n  The shooting at the Washington Navy Yard makes clear that, as we said \nin the wake of Newtown, these kinds of mass killings can happen \nanywhere, any school, any community--in Newtown, the quintessential New \nEngland town, or at the Washington Navy Yard, a supposedly secure \nmilitary facility. We need to make sure it happens nowhere.\n  Let us make a mental health initiative a centerpiece of this renewal \nand reinvigoration of our effort to stop gun violence. Let us combine \nit with background checks and other commonsense measures. Bring back \nthis issue and these measures.\n  We are not going away. We are not giving up. Many of the Newtown \nfamilies will be here again this week. The Newtown Action Alliance has \nbeen joined by other groups such as Sandy Hook Promise, Newtown Speaks, \nand Mayors Against Illegal Guns. They have formed a powerful gun \ncoalition, and I promise I will never give up. I know together we can \nprevail.\n  Not long ago--in fact, this past weekend--I attended a playground \ndedication on the beach in Fairfield overlooking Long Island Sound, a \nbeautiful, cloudless day lit by an early morning Sun, to dedicate a \nplayground in honor of one of the children, Jessica Rekos, whose family \nwas there as well. That playground will be a living reminder of our \nobligation to do better.\n  There are regulations right now that have not been approved in final \nform for mental health parity to enable more people to have private \nhealth insurance coverage. There are commonsense mental health funding \ninitiatives. As we speak on this day, groups are going around to our \noffices from the National Council for Behavioral Health, asking for \nsupport for the Excellence in Mental Health Act, S. 264, ably \ncosponsored by Senator Stabenow and Senator Blunt, focusing on mental \nhealth and combining those measures with other commonsense, sensible \ngun violence prevention measures. It is the way to forge the consensus \nwe need and move from those 55 votes to the 61 we need for passage of a \ngun violence prevention measure that can make us proud, make America \nbetter, safer, and that can make us, as Americans, a better Nation to \nleave for generations to come.\n  As we celebrate the lives lost but commemorate the horrific, \nunspeakable tragedy of Newtown, we should take heart from the courage \nand resilience of those families and their loved ones. From the Newtown \ncommunity which will be visiting the Capitol again, their resoluteness \nand steadfastness should inspire us to do better and to ask more of \nourselves and make America a better Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to extend my sympathy to all those \nwho have suffered a loss yesterday, both here in DC and any other place \nin the country. A loss, a quick and unexpected loss, is always \ndifficult.\n\n\n                            Constitution Day\n\n  I also wish to take a second today to recognize that this is \nConstitution Day. It is 226 years of our country having this \nConstitution, which is a world record for a constitution. Hopefully we \nwill continue to live under the Constitution, work and make progress.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  My main purpose today is to take a few minutes to talk about \nsomething that occurred during the recess that is another sad example \nof business as usual in Washington. The health care law we are all \nunder requires Members of Congress and their congressional staff to \nobtain health insurance under the new exchanges provided by ObamaCare \nnext year. I voted to include Congress under the health care law in \n2009 because I believe very strongly that Congress should have to live \nunder the laws it passes.\n  Let me say that again. I think Congress ought to live under the laws \nit passes. We passed a law that is going to affect most people in the \nUnited States. I can tell you that the administration doesn't appear to \nshare this belief.\n  On August 2, immediately after Congress adjourned, the Office of \nPersonnel Management, under heavy pressure from congressional leaders, \nannounced it would issue regulations saying the government can continue \nto make the employer contribution to the health plans of congressional \nMembers and staff. No one else in America who will get their health \ninsurance through an exchange may receive a contribution from their \nemployer, but the administration decided it would be OK for Congress.\n  I am not sure where the authority came from to be able to do that or \nsay that. It was difficult at the beginning of the process for us to \nget that amendment in the HELP Committee, Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, when the bill was coming through there. It was \nrepeated again in the Finance Committee, and it wound up in the final \nbill.\n  That is a law we passed. It is a law we passed that said we are going \nto be subject to the same thing the American people are going to be \nsubject to.\n  Now the administration has said, no, it doesn't apply to Congress. \nWhere does it say it doesn't apply to Congress?\n  I was in Wyoming for the last month or so, holding listening sessions \nand meeting with the people as I drove 6,000 miles across the State. I \ncan tell you people are angry that Congress gets some exemptions from \nObamaCare that they don't. They are tired of the deal making that \nhappens here instead of legislating that could be occurring. They see \nthese kinds of exemptions and they don't think it is fair. I agree. I \ndon't think it is fair either.\n  This is why Senator Vitter and I have introduced a bill that would \nprohibit Members of Congress from receiving a contribution from the \nFederal Government toward their health insurance. Of course, it is not \nonly--in our amendment, it is not only Congress but the President, the \nVice President, and the people responsible for implementing the health \ncare law who will not be allowed to receive any government subsidy.\n  The President talks about how great the health care bill will be for \neveryone, but the administration doesn't think it is so great that they \nshould have to live under it. That should change.\n  In addition, the legislation ensures Congress and the administration \nwill have to live under the laws it passes and enforces by clarifying \nthat all of us can only obtain our health insurance next year through \nan exchange. That is what it says.\n  The bill also states Members do not have the authority to define \nofficial staff. That would be a sneaky way of making an exclusion for \nsome of the people we consider to be critical, and can thereby not \nexempt any of their staff from going into the exchange. Yes, that is \ndifficult. Yes, that is the same thing that is going to happen with the \nrest of America. The rest of America is going to have these same pangs \nof wishing their contribution could go with them to the exchange. But \nthey are going to have to go to the exchange and it is not going to \nfollow, and there is no reason we should get an extension.\n  The reason we have this amendment is to show Congress shouldn't be \nspecial, that the American people are going to have this great pain and \nwe ought to suffer from it too or change it for everybody. That would \nbe unique.\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\n  I wish to clarify that our bill does not end the government \ncontribution for all congressional staff. Those who make the least \namount of money will still receive a contribution, but many staff who \nwould not qualify for any assistance otherwise will not. There is a \nprovision in the law that anybody who goes on the exchange, and they \nmake less than $43,000 a year as an individual or $92,000 as a family, \ncan get a subsidy under the exchange. It would work the same way for \nCongress.\n  Legislation is needed to prevent lawmakers and their staff from \ngetting special treatment under the law. Absent this legislative \nchange, Congress and the administration are essentially shielded from \nthe higher cost, the limited access, and the confusion everybody else \nis going to feel.\n  I continue to oppose the health care law, as I have done since it was \npassed. When you pass something from one side of the aisle, without \ntaking into consideration the amendments from the other side of the \naisle, and when you make special deals in order to keep the one side, \nyou will end up with a law you will own and it will have flaws in it. \nIt is time we quit dealmaking and start legislating on all the issues \nand considering all of the amendments. This is one example of an \namendment that is up--it is the next amendment up--and it should get a \nvote. It could have had a vote last week and it can have a vote this \nweek, but we need to vote on these things and see how they wind up.\n  I do continue to oppose the health care law, as I have done, and I \nsupport full repeal of the law. There are replacements out there. I \nhave worked with replacements. In fact, I had my own 10-step plan \nbefore the President even became a Member of the Senate. That 10-step \nplan would have done more than this bill does and it would have been \npaid for.\n  I also worked with Senators Burr and Coburn on a substitute when this \nlegislation was going through the process, and that one would have done \nmany of the things the President promised in his joint speech to \nCongress. He promised there would be certain things in the bill. I took \nvery careful notes at that meeting and found out there were 14 things \nthat didn't appear to be in the bill. So I asked those things be in the \nbill, and that is when it became a partisan issue.\n  The President said the bill would have tort reform. There is no tort \nreform in the bill. The President said there would be a doc fix. There \nis no doc fix in the bill. I guess the thing that amazed me was that \npeople from the American Medical Association stood behind the President \nwhen he signed the bill, realizing they didn't get the two things they \ninsisted on and said they would continue to push for and continue to \noppose the bill until they were in there, and that was tort reform and \nthe doc fix.\n  Doctors, under the law for Medicare are not going to be paid \nadequately. If they are not paid adequately, they have a tendency to \nnot see Medicare patients. I am pretty sure all of us know somebody who \nhas tried to get an appointment with the doctor and the doctor asked: \nDo you get Medicare? If they said yes, he said: I am sorry. I am not \ntaking Medicare patients.\n  So if you can't see a doctor, do you have insurance at all? I don't \nthink so. Medicare has been the lifesaver for seniors in our country \nfor some time, and we haven't begun to see the tip of the iceberg yet \non what is going to happen to our seniors.\n  This amendment, which we should get to vote on, is just one piece of \nan overall effort to make sure the bill will work for everybody in \nAmerica. I have 17 other amendments that would, hopefully, close \nloopholes and dismantle pieces we know would not work and make changes. \nSo there are ideas out there that could make this bill work, but this \none amendment is just part of an overall effort. It will close the \nloophole for Congress and it will ensure that everyone is treated \nequally under the health care law.\n  For better or for worse, we should all be in this together. Again, \nthis isn't just to subject our colleagues to pain; it is to get them to \nrecognize the pain America is about to feel. It is not fair for us to \nmake ourselves pain free. We can't inoculate ourselves or give \nourselves some special medication. That is what we are doing in the \nbill. This amendment clarifies Members don't have the authority to \ndefine ``official staff'' and, therefore, they can't exempt any of \ntheir staff from going into the exchange. It clarifies that Members of \nCongress, all of their staff, the President, the Vice President, and \nall political appointees are no longer eligible for the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Plan and have to go into the exchange.\n  That seems fair to me. The bill is named after the President. Why \nwouldn't the President want to be under the bill? How could he possibly \navoid being under the bill and doing what the rest of Americans will \nhave to do? If it is such a great deal, and since the bill is named for \nhim, one would think he would want to do that.\n  I voted to include Members and staff on ObamaCare before the bill \npassed, in the HELP Committee, in the Finance Committee, and on this \nfloor. It got tweaked a little after it passed on the floor--and I am a \nlittle disturbed about that--but even that doesn't warrant the \nclarification of this magnitude. People deserve and expect those who \nare responsible for passing and implementing laws will have to live \nunder the same laws they do.\n  I have cosponsored this legislation with Senator Vitter, and I \nappreciate all of the initiative he has taken, the difficult and \nspecific task of drafting, and all of the work that has gone into this. \nThis will make a difference. Congress will realize the difference. The \nAmerican people will blame us if they see the difference and we \nhaven't.\n  I would ask we get to vote on this amendment. I hope we get to vote \non it soon and we can then move on to other amendments on an important \nbill and get things done. That is what the American people expect us to \ndo. They expect us to get some things done. If somebody thinks this is \nsomething that would be wrong for us, they should consider it to be \nwrong for America as well and join us in fixing it one way or the \nother.\n  Again, I thank Senator Vitter for all his efforts on it, and I do \nexpect we should get a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank and recognize the longstanding \nwork of the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. He has fought long and \nhard from the very beginning for this position during the ObamaCare \ndebate, and he has done so in a very focused and determined and \nconsistent way. I appreciate his doing that all through the ObamaCare \ndebate and bringing it to the floor with me and others in this \namendment.\n  I repeat, I appreciate all of his leadership in fighting for what I \nconsider the first principle of democracy, which is that all rules that \nare passed on to America should be visited on Washington, and we should \nbe treated exactly the same as the rest of America is treated. That \nshould be true across the board, but it certainly should be true under \nObamaCare. That is the very intent of this provision, which is the law \nnow. It is the law now under ObamaCare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I see my colleague from North Dakota \nSenator Hoeven is here so I will be brief.\n  I wish to pick up on something Senator Enzi talked about, which is \nthat the American people are expecting us to get something done. I \ncouldn't agree with him more. That is why I have been on the floor for \nthe last 3 days, along with my colleague from Ohio Senator Portman, who \nhas worked so hard with me to put together an energy efficiency bill to \naddress the very real challenges facing this country around energy \nsecurity, and energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest way to deal \nwith our energy needs.\n  We have multiple bipartisan amendments to this legislation. We have a \nlot of bipartisan support for this legislation, with more than 260 \ngroups, as varied as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National \nResources Defense Council, supporting this legislation. I hope all \nthose people who would like to have a different conversation around \nhealth care, or whatever else, will be willing to postpone that \nconversation so we can deal with the bill before us, which is the \nEnergy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act.\n  I appreciate all the work of my colleague from North Dakota, Senator\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nHoeven. He has been willing to engage with us on this legislation and I \nurge all of us to get to the bill at hand and deal with energy issues \nand let us have those other debates at the appropriate time. Now is not \nthe appropriate time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the Senator from New Hampshire yield for a question?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I would.\n  Mr. WYDEN. How many years has the Senator from New Hampshire been \ninvolved in this legislation? Because I can recall the various \niterations that she and Senator Portman offered, and then she worked \nwith various groups, business organizations and public interest groups, \nand I think it would be helpful to hear how long she has been working \non this legislation and how long she has been waiting to actually get \nthis bill in front of the Senate.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Senator Portman can correct me on this, but I think we \nintroduced this legislation early in 2011, not too long after he came \nto the Senate, and we have been working for 3 years. We reintroduced it \nin this Congress and have made a number of changes over the years in \nresponse to what we heard from stakeholders and in response to some of \nthe concerns expressed by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto make the bill better and to try and put together legislation that \ncould actually pass the Congress.\n  We have another bill in the House that is very similar, which is also \na bipartisan piece of energy efficiency legislation. There has been a \nlot of interest expressed in the House in trying to act on this issue, \nso we have a real opportunity to get a bill through Congress, to get it \nto the President's desk, to get it signed, and to begin making progress \non those 136,000 jobs we have heard about from the ACEEE--the American \nCouncil for an Energy-Efficient Economy--that could be created as a \nresult of passing this bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Is it the view of the Senator from New Hampshire that the \namendments that have been offered--the bipartisan amendments--take her \nbill, the product of all those negotiations, more than 3 years' worth \nof work, and actually make the bill even better?\n  I look at some of the amendments, particularly the one offered by the \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from Colorado--the Isakson-Bennet \namendment--and I realize we know more in America about the kind of \ncommon energy-efficient products that one might use, whether it is a \ntoaster or something else around the house, than we do about the actual \nhouse itself. So we have two thoughtful Senators coming together and \nthey have worked with a whole host of commercial building interests and \nthey are going to make it possible, in my view, to save a lot of energy \nthat will result in savings for homeowners and other Americans.\n  I would be interested in the Senator's take on the various amendments \nthat have been filed because I think those amendments take the very \nfine bill she and Senator Portman have and make it even better.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. There is no doubt about that. I have been impressed \nwith the amount of thought that has gone into these bipartisan \namendments and with the variety of ways in which they improve on energy \nefficiency.\n  The Senator talked about the Isakson-Bennet amendment. Senator Bennet \nhas an amendment with Senator Ayotte, my colleague from New Hampshire, \ntalking about tenants who are renting and the incentives we can provide \nto tenants to address their energy use.\n  Senator Gillibrand, who came to the floor last week, talked about how \nwe could look at emergency disaster relief and try and make sure when \nwe rebuild from disasters we rebuild in a way that is much more energy \nefficient.\n  So we have a whole range of ideas. Senator Hoeven, who is on the \nfloor, is talking about addressing water heaters and the need to make \nsure water heaters are more efficient. He is working with Senator \nPryor. We have a whole list of amendments that are thoughtful and that \nhave been the result of a lot of work on the part of a lot of Senators \nin this Chamber.\n  It is unfortunate we can't get to those amendments and get them \npassed. I think most of them would pass on a voice vote.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Let me wrap up with one last question to get a sense of \nthe Senator's intent. My sense is the Senator is very open, as is \nSenator Portman, that there will be votes. I see our colleagues on the \nfloor who have also been here since Wednesday, but the Senator from New \nHampshire, I believe, is open to giving them votes on the several \nissues that have come up in connection with this debate, that have been \ndebated over the last few days, and then she would be open to the \nleadership on both sides agreeing to a finite list of amendments and \nthen actually voting on the energy efficiency bill this week.\n  My hope is that is what the Senator would like to do because that is \nwhat I have tried to tell colleagues, as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I just came back from an excellent visit to North Dakota \nwith Senator Hoeven. There are a lot of other issues the Senate wants \nto tackle in the energy area to make sure we fully tap the potential of \nnatural gas. There are win-win opportunities that are also good for the \nenvironment. We would like to resolve the nuclear waste question. We \nhave a bipartisan bill here in the Senate.\n  Is that the intent of the Democratic sponsor of this legislation, \nthat in the next couple of hours we get a finite list of the additional \namendments In other words, we have the Senator's bill, and we have \nseveral amendments that have been debated at length already. Those \nwould be part of the vote, and then in the next couple of hours we \nwould have a finite list, and then we could address those and finish \nthe bill this week?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely. And I think that is Senator Portman's \ninterest. We would like to get some agreement on how to move forward. \nAs I said last week, I don't have any objection to voting on Senator \nVitter's legislation if we can get some agreement on limiting those \nextraneous amendments that really don't have anything to do with energy \nefficiency so we can get onto this bill, get it done, and make progress \nbecause, as the chairman knows, it is going to be very challenging to \ntackle some of those other energy issues that are much more \ncontroversial than this energy efficiency bill. So it would be nice to \nbe able to have agreement so we can move on to some of those other \nissues.\n  I especially appreciate the Senator's leadership and Senator \nMurkowski's leadership in reaching some agreement and trying to move an \nenergy agenda on the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to briefly respond to the comments \nby the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  First, I welcome her statement that she supports getting a vote on \nthe Vitter amendment. I am not sure I have heard it before, but I heard \nit just then and I welcome it and I appreciate it and want to echo \nthat.\n  Secondly, I wish to briefly respond to the notion that somehow now is \nnot the appropriate time for that vote. I and my colleagues who support \nthis language are reacting to an illegal rule that goes into effect \nOctober 1, so I am demanding a vote before October 1, when this goes \ninto effect. I am not sure what more appropriate time there can be than \nbefore October 1 if we are trying to block this illegal rule that will \nhappen October 1. So this is the appropriate time--not according to a \ntimetable I made but according to a timetable that the Obama \nadministration made and that is supported by the opponents of our \nlanguage.\n  If OPM wants to announce that they are delaying this illegal rule \nindefinitely or for 1 year, then we will delay this vote because that \nwould be appropriate. But the appropriate time to stop this illegal \nrule that goes into effect October 1 is, by definition, before October \n1, which is all I have demanded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to introduce two energy efficiency \namendments that I am offering for attachment to the Shaheen-Portman \nenergy efficiency bill.\n  I thank both of the bill's sponsors, the Senators from New Hampshire \nand Ohio, for their willingness to work with me and with our cosponsors \non\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\nthis bipartisan legislation. I also thank both the Senator from Oregon, \nwho is the chairman of the energy committee, as well as the ranking \nmember of the energy committee, the Senator from Alaska, for working \nwith us as well.\n  Obviously, I hope we will be able to work through the list of \namendments to this legislation so that we can get votes on these bills. \nWe have broad bipartisan support on both of these measures, so I wish \nto take a few minutes to introduce them and to briefly describe them.\n  The first is an amendment regarding water heaters. It is actually the \nwater heater efficiency amendment. Currently, a 2010 Department of \nEnergy rule on water heaters effectively bans the manufacture of large \nelectric water heaters beginning in 2015, which will greatly affect \nconsumers in our rural areas and hurt the effectiveness of some of the \ndemand-response rural electric programs. These demand-response rural \nelectric programs are designed to use off-peak loads, which is both \nenergy efficient and also generates big-time savings for consumers. So \nit is one of those win-win deals. But many of our rural areas are not \nserviced by natural gas. As a result, they would be forced to buy \nmultiple water heaters in order to meet their need because the load \ndoesn't enable them to store enough heat. That doesn't make any sense.\n  What I am offering is a practical amendment that improves the \nefficiency of electric water heaters but lets our rural areas have \naccess to affordable, efficient water heaters that can supplement \nrenewable energy. Much of this off-peak energy is renewable energy, so \nthere is another benefit as well. This is one that saves money, is \nenergy efficient, and also provides good environmental stewardship.\n  Many of our electric cooperatives and other utilities have voluntary \ndemand-response programs that use electric water heaters to more \neffectively manage power supply and demand. In those areas where \nrenewables are part of the electric generation system, these water \nheaters facilitate the integration of renewable energy that can be \nstored--like at nighttime, obviously--for use during peak hours. That \nincludes such things as wind and solar energy.\n  This amendment would allow the continued manufacture of large, grid-\nenabled, electric-resistance water heaters only for their use in \nelectric thermal storage or demand-response programs, meaning that they \nuse off-peak load or lower cost energy that would otherwise be lost or \nnot used. The amendment would require that grid-enabled water heaters \nhave a volume of more than 75 gallons, be energy efficient, and work on \ngrids that have a demand-response system. So, again, you are using off-\npeak loads, using renewable energy, and it saves the consumer a lot of \nmoney and makes sure they have the hot water they need for their use \nbut is a big-time cost saver and good environmental stewardship \nmeasure.\n  We have broad support from the energy efficiency groups, from the \nenvironmental groups, from manufacturers, and from the rural electric \ncooperatives. I will name some of them. These include the Air-\nConditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, the American \nCouncil for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the American Public Power \nAssociation, Edison Electric Institute, General Electric Company, \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the National Resource \nDefense Council, the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, and there \nare many more. This has broad support. I am not aware at this point if \nthere are opponents.\n  The Shaheen-Portman bill is an energy efficiency bill. It is about \nusing energy more wisely, benefiting both providers and consumers \nalike. And that is exactly what this amendment does. It saves money, it \nsaves energy, it benefits the environment, and it benefits consumers.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I certainly yield to the good Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I know my colleague is going to talk about another one \nof his amendments in a moment. I wish to briefly stay on this \namendment.\n  It makes a lot of sense, and he said it well. In Ohio as well as \nother States, during these off-peak periods--and often it is renewable \nenergy--think about a time when you can generate power during the day \nfrom solar or wind or other sources, and if you can store that during \nthe peak times and if these water heaters are well enough insulated, \nthey can store that heat that is otherwise wasted or not used.\n  It seems it makes a lot of sense to ensure that the 2010 DOE rule the \nSenator talked about doesn't preclude the possibility of manufacturing \nthese large water heaters for electric thermal storage and for these \ndemand-response programs the Senator talked about that some of them \nhave. One is the Buckeye Power Utility, an electric co-op, and they are \nvery interested in this amendment.\n  I support the amendment. I think it is an example of an amendment \nbrought to the floor that is going to help make the bill better. It is \nconsistent with the energy efficiency goals of the legislation.\n  I thank the Senator for his work.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Ohio. It \nreally does comport both with the spirit and intent of the legislation \nthat he has coauthored with the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, but really it actually accomplishes what the Department of \nEnergy set out to do.\n  In rural areas across this country, whether in North Dakota, Ohio, \nWest Virginia, New Hampshire, or anywhere else, we have rural consumers \nwho are looking at having to buy multiple water heaters just to have \nenough hot water because they are on these off-peak load programs, \nwhich makes sense and which is what we want. We want them on these off-\npeak programs because it is more efficient and saves money and utilizes \nrenewable energy, but we have to enable them to do it. So this \naccomplishes what DOE set out to do.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I wish to offer another amendment to the underlying \nlegislation. This is the ``all of the above'' Federal building energy \nconservation.\n  We talk about doing ``all of the above'' energy development in this \ncountry, and we have to get from talking about it to doing it. This is \na great example of what I am talking about. It actually goes back and \naddresses a problem that was created in the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007. In that act they set efficiency standards for \nFederal buildings that have to be achieved by 2030 and then they limit \nit as to which types of energy can be used, creating a real problem for \nthe Department of Energy, which is actually having to implement that \nlegislation.\n  This is a piece of legislation that actually will enable some of \nthese energy efficiency goals to be achieved with better environmental \nstewardship but with a commonsense ``all of the above'' approach in \nterms of energy sources. Frankly, the goals of that cannot be achieved \nwithout them. The Shaheen-Portman legislation is an on-subject piece of \nlegislation that really allows us to correct the problems in the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007 and really accomplishes what that \nact set out to do, so if I could just take a couple minutes to describe \nit.\n  This ``all of the above'' Federal Building Energy Conservation Act, \namendment No. 1917, is a commonsense piece of legislation that saves \ntaxpayers money by enhancing the energy efficiency of Federal buildings \nby allowing all forms or all sources of energy to power our buildings \nwhile still meeting the objectives of the underlying legislation.\n  Currently, section 433 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n2007 mandates the elimination of all fossil fuel-generated energy use \nin any new Federal building by the year 2030, but the mandate also \ncovers any major renovation of $2.5 million or more to any Federal \nbuilding. Unfortunately, the Department of Energy has been unable to \nfinalize a rule because the law itself is unworkable.\n  Think about it--any Federal building where there is a renovation of \nmore than $2.5 million, you can no longer use fossil fuels--think \nnatural gas--in that building. So what are you going to heat and cool \nthe building with? Are you sure you are going to have enough \nintermittent power--whether it is solar or wind or something else--to \nmake sure that for any Federal building\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\nwhere you make a change of more than $2.5 million you are going to be \nable to meet the energy needs of that building? The Department of \nEnergy can't do it. They can't write a rule that meets that statutory \nrequirement. So we fix it in this amendment.\n  My amendment would replace an unworkable mandate that is impossible \nto implement with a practical, time-proven approach, using technology \nand all of our energy resources to achieve the goal of energy \nefficiency. Again, this will enable us to achieve the energy efficiency \ngoals of the underlying legislation, which is the Energy Independence \nand Security Act of 2007.\n  Instead of prohibiting the use of fossil fuels, including next-\ngeneration technologies as section 433 would currently provide as \nwritten, this amendment creates sensible energy efficiency guidelines \nto make Federal buildings more energy efficient, thereby lowering \nemissions. The measure also helps to make sure when we do major \nrenovations we use the most up-to-date building codes. We do all of \nthis in a transparent manner by having the Secretary of Energy make \ninformation available as to how the Federal Government is improving its \nefficiency in Federal buildings.\n  Current law is unable to do any of this. The reality is section 433 \ndoes not work, as I said, and cannot be implemented without a fix. We \nare providing that fix. According to the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy:\n\n       The current section 433 is not very workable because in its \n     present form it discourages investments in long-term energy \n     savings contracts and in combined heat and power systems.\n\n  So if you care about efficiency--that is what this underlying bill is \nall about, energy efficiency--if you care about efficiency, we need to \nchange section 433. If you care about making sure our taxpayer dollars \nare well spent, we need to pass the amendment I am offering. It is \nbetter to have aggressive yet achievable goals with a means to obtain \nthem through private sector financing mechanisms than to have an \nunfunded mandate that will not produce the intended results.\n  Major conservation stakeholders agree. This amendment is supported by \na remarkably broad coalition. That coalition includes: the Alliance to \nSave Energy, the Combined Heat and Power Association, the American Gas \nAssociation, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the \nEdison Electric Institute, the Federal Performance Contractors \nCoalition, Owens Corning, Siemens, the National Association of Energy \nService Companies, the American Public Power Association, Lockheed \nMartin, Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association, Honeywell--the list \ngoes on, and there are many more.\n  That is because, again, it is about common sense, it is about energy \nefficiency, and it is about doing it in a way that actually \naccomplishes those goals.\n  Energy conservation is an objective where we should be able to find \nconsensus. Everyone agrees it makes good sense to save energy. This \namendment makes the current law both practical and achievable. The \nCongressional Budget Office says it saves money. I urge my colleagues \nto support this commonsense amendment.\n  Finally, if I may before I close, I would like to make some brief \ncomments in regard to the farm bill. We have been working on a farm \nbill for over 2 years. I am a member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. Last year we passed a solid farm bill from the Senate \nAgriculture Committee that strengthens and enhances crop insurance and \nsaves money. At a time when we are running a Federal deficit and debt, \nwe are saving money. We passed the bill out of the Agriculture \nCommittee last year. The House passed a bill different than the bill we \npassed out of the Senate Agriculture Committee, but the House \nAgriculture Committee passed a farm bill as well, and a good farm bill.\n  On the Senate floor last year we passed the farm bill and passed it \nwith a large bipartisan vote. On the House side they were not able to \npass it. They were not able to pass their bill, so at the end of the \nyear when the current farm bill expired we were forced to do an \nextension.\n  We come back this year. The Senate Agriculture Committee again passes \na good solid farm bill that strengthens crop insurance, is good for \nfarmers and ranchers, and saves money. We pass it on the Senate floor \nas well. On the House side, they pass the bill through the House \nAgriculture Committee and they pass a bill on the floor. It did not \ninclude the nutrition piece, but they did pass a bill on the floor.\n  This week they are set to vote on a nutrition bill. That is good. \nThey need to do that and they need to make their decision on how they \nwant to handle the food stamp reform, or Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program reforms. But the key is they need to name their \nconferees. They need to take action this week and name their conferees. \nWe have named our conferees. I am pleased to be a member of the \nconference committee. But we need to work. We need to get this \nfinished.\n  The reality is, for our farmers and ranchers, we should not be \nproviding another 1-year extension. These are business people. They \nneed to plan. They need to know what the 5-year farm program is going \nto be so they can plan and operate their business accordingly. There \nare on the order of 16 million jobs in this country that are dependent, \ndirectly or indirectly, on agriculture. We want to get this economy \ngrowing. Those are a tremendous number of jobs, 16 million jobs, that, \ndirectly or indirectly, rely on agriculture. Agriculture creates a \npositive balance of trade.\n  We are talking about an energy efficiency bill right now and our \nfarmers are out there right now, not only producing food but fuel as \nwell--food, fuel, and fiber. They create not only jobs in this country \nbut they have a positive trade balance, which is tremendous for our \ncountry.\n  The bill, as I mentioned earlier, saves money. At a minimum we are \ngoing to save $24 billion, and it will likely be more than that. It \nhelps with the deficit and the debt.\n  I want to close today by again calling on my colleagues on the House \nside to deal with the nutrition issue, name their conferees, let's get \ninto conference, and let's get a farm bill done. Thanks to our farmers \nand ranchers, we have the highest quality, lowest cost food supply in \nthe world, in the history of the world. That benefits every single \nAmerican--whether you live in rural America or in the biggest city. \nLet's get it done.\n  I again thank the sponsors of this bill. They are working hard. You \nknow what. They are setting an example for this body on the kind of \nbipartisanship and working together we need to have to get things done \nfor the American people. I commend them both and thank them for this \nopportunity to present these amendments to their bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, the second amendment my colleague from \nNorth Dakota spoke about is another example of a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. In fact, I think the Presiding Officer of the Senate this \nafternoon is a cosponsor of it, which I think makes sense because I \nthink the current program which would, by 2030, lead to no fossil fuel-\ngenerated energy for use in newer renovated buildings is not practical. \nI think the impracticality of it is shown by the inability of the \nDepartment of Energy to move forward with their regulations.\n  I will say while this amendment repeals the fossil fuel ban in \nsection 433, it also strengthens other existing provisions for Federal \nenergy management, including extending the Federal efficiency targets \nfor Federal buildings to 2013. I think it is a responsible approach and \na practical approach. It will give the Federal Government added \nflexibility to achieve these reductions in energy production without \nadding burdensome new requirements to the Federal building energy \nmanagers.\n  It is also, in combination with many aspects of the underlying bill \nwhich deal with energy efficiency on Federal Government buildings and \npractices, basically encouraging the Federal Government to practice \nwhat it preaches and be more efficient, as the largest energy user in \nthe country and probably in the world.\n  I think it is consistent with the legislation, although there may be \nsome alternatives people want to talk about, but I do think this is an \namendment which actually makes sense because it\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nis practical and I think it also is consistent, again, with our \nunderlying purpose which is to, in a way that provides flexibility, \nachieve efficiency standards at the Federal Government level. It \nencourages more efficiency.\n  Finally, on the farm bill comments, I agree with my colleague from \nNorth Dakota. Our farmers need the predictability and certainty that \ncomes with the farm bill. He talked about 1 year not being enough. I do \nagree with that. I hope we will be able to get the conferees named and \nget in conference and come out with a bill that helps farmers know what \nthe rules of the game are. That is what they are looking for. They want \nto know the crop insurance program is going to be there and be sure and \nstrong, the safety net will be there--which this bill will provide, \nregardless whether it is the House version or Senate version, and then \nthey need to know what the rules of the game are for the other \ncommodities and other programs.\n  I hope that can move forward because it would be great for our \ncountry, great for Ohio. The No. 1 industry in Ohio is agriculture. We \nare proud of that. We want to make sure those farmers have the ability \nto succeed.\n  I will yield back my time and thank Members who have come to the \nfloor to talk about amendments. I hope other Members who might be \nlistening will do that.\n  This is an opportunity, even before we can officially file or \nintroduce amendments and debate and vote them. At least we can have the \ndiscussion so we are ready to go when I suspect we will have an \nagreement between leadership of both of our parties even later today. \nWe are working on that. We think we have limited the number of \namendments to a reasonable level and we are trying to encourage Members \nto work with us to ensure we can get to this underlying legislation and \nmove forward with a bipartisan energy efficiency bill that is going to \nhelp on our trade deficits, going to help our economy grow jobs, make \nour environment cleaner, and is going to be one that actually shows \nthis body we can in a bipartisan way do what is good for our \nconstituents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Navy Yard Tragedy\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nVitter amendment to the energy efficiency bill. Before I begin my \nremarks, I wish to recognize the horrific events that occurred \nyesterday, a little over a mile from here. Yesterday's tragic and \nsenseless shooting devastated families and changed lives forever. We \ncontinue to hold the victims and their loved ones in our thoughts and \nwe are deeply appreciative of law enforcement and first responders who \nhelped save lives and prevent further violence.\n  Senator Vitter's amendment to the energy efficiency bill addresses a \nserious concern that I, along with many of my constituents, have \nexpressed about ObamaCare. Specifically, this amendment seeks to \neliminate special Washington, DC, exemptions in the current law. It \nrequires congressional staff, including the committee and leadership \nstaff as well as the President and the Vice President and all political \nappointees in the administration, to participate in the same exchanges \nObamaCare forces on everyday Americans.\n  I have cosponsored this amendment with some of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Vitter and Enzi, because I think it is clear the \nAmerican people are fed up with the beltway mentality that the rules \napply to everyone else but not Washington, DC. If you ask me, a law \nthat applies to all Americans except those who wrote it simply does not \npass the smell test.\n  By the way, I wish to note this elitist attitude is not anything new. \nIn fact, America's second President, John Adams, warned against a \nlegislative assembly that would ``in time not hesitate to exempt itself \nfrom the burdens which it will lay without shame on its constituents.'' \nIt turns out this was a tragically accurate prediction.\n  Before ObamaCare was even passed into law, I argued that those who \nwrote the law should be beholden to it. As a member of the House Ways \nand Means Committee, I introduced an amendment that would require all \nMembers of Congress and their dependents to obtain their health \ninsurance through the Affordable Care Act's health care insurance \nexchanges. But last month, immediately after Congress left for the \nAugust recess, the Office of Personnel Management announced in its \nproposed rules on ObamaCare that the government can continue to make \nemployer contributions to the health plans of congressional Members and \nstaff. This basically means Members of Congress and congressional staff \nwill receive a taxpayer-funded subsidy for their health care insurance. \nUltimately, these tax dollars will be used to protect Washington \ninsiders from the negative consequences of ObamaCare's health \nexchanges.\n  Following OPM's announcement, I immediately wrote to them, asking \nthat they clarify in their final rule exactly who is subject to the \nexchanges. Specifically I asked them to ensure that in addition to \nMembers of Congress, all congressional staff, including committee and \nleadership staff as well as political employees, go to the exchanges. I \nhave written a followup letter to OPM, and as of yet I have not \nreceived a single response for this concern.\n  If ObamaCare is such a good idea, why would those who helped write \nthe law not stand proudly by it? The fact that ObamaCare protects a \nselect few from participating in the exchanges is further evidence that \nthe law never should have been passed to begin with. But now that it \nhas been passed, upheld by the courts as a massive tax increase, those \nwho put it in place should be subject to the same burdensome \nregulations, taxes, and mandates that everyday Americans are stuck \nwith. If the President and Congress say it is good enough for the \nAmerican people, then it should be good enough for the President, Vice \nPresident, political appointees, and all congressional staff too. So \nthis amendment I have cosponsored ensures that there is no special fix \nor exemption for Members of Congress and their staffs. It ensures that \nthey participate in the exchanges just as does every other American \nstarting January 1 of next year. It also ensures that any type of \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies offered to them are also available to the \nAmerican taxpayers through tax credits.\n\n  As many of my colleagues did, I spent the August recess meeting with \nmy constituents and listening to their concerns. It probably won't \nsurprise anyone that the general public doesn't think very highly of \nCongress, and this exemption is a perfect example of why that is the \ncase.\n  Unfortunately, in recent days the conversation about this particular \namendment has taken an ugly turn toward personal attacks. Regardless of \nwhether my colleagues support this amendment, we should be talking \nabout this measure in the context of what is fair and what is best for \nthe American public. I urge my colleagues to abandon threats and \npersonal attacks and examine this legislation based on its merits.\n  Since the Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare, its provisions have been \nrepeatedly delayed by the administration, demonstrating that the \nFederal Government understands how bad the law will be for businesses \nand middle-class families. In fact, the Washington Times just reported \nthat the Obama administration has delayed major aspects of the health \ncare law no less than five times to date. And this latest move to \ninsulate DC insiders from this unpopular law is more than enough \nevidence that ObamaCare is the wrong answer to the health care \nchallenges in this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a reflection of \na basic principle of our democracy: that equality under the law means \nthe law applies to everyone. Serving the people of the United States is \na privilege. It is about service. It is not about status. And if \nCongress is going to pass laws that are unpopular, we better be ready \nto live by the same rules as everyone else. This is what this amendment \nis about, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to personally thank our \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada for all of his work and partnership \non this important measure. He has been an outspoken leader from the \nvery beginning of this debate and has stood hard and fast for the truly \nfundamental principle that any rule we pass here for America should \nfirst and foremost and equally be applied to Washington. So I really \nappreciate his leadership and his work, which continues, and we look \nforward to the vote that we absolutely demand and deserve before \nOctober 1.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Alzheimer's Disease\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, every 68 seconds--a little more than 1 \nminute--someone in America develops Alzheimer's. It is a devastating \nand irreversible brain disease that slowly destroys an individual's \ncognitive functioning, including memory and thought.\n  Back home in Kansas, a Kansas City physician, Dr. Richard Padula, and \nhis wife Marta had been married for 51 years when he was diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's disease in 2006. It is difficult to imagine the anguish \nDick and Marta and their family and their friends experienced as he \ndeteriorated from a leading heart surgeon into someone unable to \ncomprehend a newspaper article. Unfortunately, these stories have \nbecome very common.\n  Alzheimer's currently affects more than 5.2 million people in the \nUnited States and more than 35.6 million people worldwide.\n  As our population ages, the number of people diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's after the age of 65 will double every 5 years, while the \nnumber of individuals 85 years and older with this disease will triple \nby 2050. Already, Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in \nthe United States, and there is currently no cure, no diagnostic test, \nand no treatment for this terrible, terrible disease.\n  As a nation, we should, we must, we ought to commit to defeating one \nof the greatest threats to the health of Americans and to the financial \nwell-being of our Nation.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy called our Nation to action to reach the \nMoon by the end of the decade, and Americans rallied around that cry. \nSimilarly, we need to commit ourselves to a goal just as ambitious but \nperhaps even more imperative. We must strive to achieve not only an \neffective treatment but a cure for Alzheimer's over the next decade.\n  President Kennedy said: `` . . . because that goal will serve to \norganize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that \nchallenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to \npostpone, and one which we intend to win. . . .''--I would like those \nwords to be spoken about the fight against Alzheimer's.\n  As the baby boomer generation ages and Alzheimer's disease becomes \nmore prevalent, the need to confront the pending health care crisis has \nbecome even more urgent. The financial costs alone cannot be ignored. \nWhat it costs America's health care system, what it costs Americans, \nwhat it costs the taxpayers, we need to address these issues.\n  Caring for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to \nreach an expense of $203 billion this year--$203 billion this year--\nwith $142 billion covered by the Federal Government through Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  A recent study by the RAND Corporation stated that the cost of \ndementia care is projected to double over the next 30 years, surpassing \nhealth care expenses for both heart disease and cancer. Without a way \nto prevent, cure or effectively treat Alzheimer's, it will be \ndifficult, if not impossible, to rein in our Nation's health care \ncosts.\n  Alzheimer's has become a disease that defines a generation, but if we \nfocus and prioritize our research capacity, it does not need to \ncontinue to be an inevitable part of aging.\n  It is time to truly commit to defeating this disease in the next \ndecade, a goal no more ambitious than President Kennedy set forth for \nthe Apollo space program. For every $27 that Medicare and Medicaid \nspend caring for an individual with Alzheimer's, the Federal Government \nonly spends $1 on Alzheimer's research--$27 to care for the disease; $1 \nto try to cure or prevent the disease.\n  Yet we know that research suggests that more progress could be made \nif given more support. One study found that a breakthrough against \nAlzheimer's that delays the onset of the disease by just 5 years would \nmean an annual savings of $362 billion by 2050. A sustained Federal \ncommitment to research for Alzheimer's will lower the cost and improve \nthe health outcomes for people living with the disease today and in the \nfuture.\n  I am the ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee \nthat funds the National Institutes of Health. NIH is the focal point of \nour Nation's medical research infrastructure, and I am committed to \nworking with my colleagues to prioritize funding for Alzheimer's \nresearch. This year our subcommittee increased funding for the National \nInstitute on Aging--the lead institute for Alzheimer's research at \nNIH--by $84 million and supported the initial year of funding for the \nnew Presidential initiative to map the human brain. Both projects will \nincrease our understanding of the underlying causes of Alzheimer's, \nunlock the mysteries of the brain, and bring us closer--closer--to an \neffective treatment and, one day, closer to a cure.\n  Alzheimer's is a defining challenge of my generation, and we should \ncommit to a national goal to defeat this devastating disease. We can do \nthat by supporting critical research carried out by scientists and \nresearchers across our Nation and supported by the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  In my view this is an area in which we all can come together. You can \nbe the most compassionate, caring person--and we ought to spend money \nto care for people--you can be the most cautious about spending dollars \nand the investment and what the return is for every dollar we spend, \nand because we could save on health care costs, you ought to be \nsupportive of this funding.\n  The health and financial future of our Nation, in my view, is at \nstake, and the United States cannot, should not, must not ignore this \nthreat. Together, we can make a sustained commitment to Alzheimer's \nresearch that will benefit our Nation and bring hope to families such \nas the Padulas, as well as to every American. It is a challenge. It is \na challenge we ought to accept. The moment for us to act is now, and \nthe end result is hope for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise in support of the legislation \ncoauthored by Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman, the Energy Savings \nand Industrial Competitiveness Act. I wish to take a minute to thank \nthem for their leadership and for their tenacity in getting this bill \nto the floor, struggling through all of the amendments that are being \noffered to it, trying to make sure we figure out how we can actually \nsave some energy, save some money, and do some good for our \nenvironment.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire very much. It is always a \npleasure to work with a recovering Governor. We will see where this \nends. I hope it ends in a good place. As our economy picks up and our \nNation's energy needs grow, investing in energy efficiency is a no-\nbrainer.\n  Energy efficiency investments save money, save money in energy costs,\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\nsave energy resources, protect our environment, and create jobs.\n  Homeowners and businesses are already investing in energy-efficient \ntechnologies. As an extra bonus, many of these technologies are \ndeveloped right here--not here in Washington but right here in America. \nEarlier this month I visited a company called WhiteOptics, and they are \nproducing advanced light bulb technology. When it is used, it can \ndeliver more light than traditional fluorescent bulbs for half the \nenergy. Think about that, more light for half the energy. The payback \nfor that technology is not just less than a decade, not less than 5 \nyears, it is less than 1 year.\n  Since the cost of lighting can comprise up to 50 percent of a \nmanufacturer's energy bill, it is a relatively easy and inexpensive way \nto save money and, as it turns out, a lot of money. Through investments \nin advanced light bulbs, light technology, and other energy efficiency \nmeasures, our country has the potential to save as much as 40 gigawatts \nof power by 2018.\n  How much is 40 gigawatts? Think of 80 coal-powered plants, all of \nthem going full blast, is about 40 gigawatts.\n  Unfortunately, barriers such as upfront costs and inadequate \nefficiency standards are preventing our country from realizing our \nenergy efficiency potential. The Shaheen-Portman bill breaks down many \nof these barriers. Again, I think voting for it is a no-brainer.\n  As an added bonus, the legislation before us will help us rein in \nFederal spending too, because it includes provisions that will reduce \nUncle Sam's energy consumption from across the country and around the \nworld.\n  To illustrate that point, let me use an example from the world of \nsports. Similar to a lot of Americans, I spent some time the past two \nweekends watching some terrific football games. But on Labor Day I took \nthe 12-year-old boy I mentor and his twin sister to see the final game \nof the season of the Wilmington Blue Rocks, a Single-A team, Minor \nLeague team that played in the Carolina League.\n  It turned out to be a very good game. One of the highlights again--\nthe Presiding Officer is from Massachusetts and the prime sponsor of \nthe bill is from New Hampshire. My guess is they are Red Sox fans, and \nwe used to be a farm club for the Red Sox. Now we have a farm club of \nthe Royals, but the minor league game we went to was terrific.\n  One of the highlights occurred when the Blue Rocks came close to \npulling off a triple play. You don't see that very much. It is very \nrarely seen and done in the majors, much less in the minors.\n  While our Blue Rocks came close to pulling off a triple play that \nday, our Federal Government can actually pull one off, at least \nfiguratively speaking, by reducing the amount of energy we consume \nevery year in the Federal Government.\n  Here is how we do it. First, you cut down on the carbon and the air \npollution that is going into the air and we thus improve American's \nhealth.\n  Second, we cut down on Federal spending. The deficit is down--what \ndid we hear at lunch today--about $1.4 trillion 4 years ago. We are \ndown to something under $700 billion now.\n  It is still too much, but we have seen the deficit come down by over \nhalf, and this can help bring it down a bit further.\n  The third point is we can cut down unemployment by creating good \nAmerican jobs to produce, install, and to maintain the energy that is \nneeded for energy efficiency technology, a lot of which I said earlier \nis made right here in the USA. We are not talking minor leagues here \neither, at least in terms of savings. This is big league stuff.\n  The annual energy bill for the Federal Government is around $25 \nbillion. I think the Federal Government is the largest consumer of \nelectricity in the country. Of that, some $7 billion alone is spent on \nenergy to operate Federal buildings, $7 billion just for the buildings \nalone.\n  Last Congress, my colleague from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, and \nour colleague Sheldon Whitehouse--from another small State--and I tried \nto pull off a triple play of our own. We produced a bill that was \ncalled the Reducing Federal Energy Dollars Act. It focused like a laser \non greening down Federal energy costs.\n  Today we are happy to see that many of its provisions have been \nincorporated in the Shaheen-Portman bill. If we pass it, we could pull \noff that triple play after all.\n  One of those provisions takes what works and seeks to ensure we do \nmore. Here is just one example. Not too long ago the Veterans Affairs \nDepartment, which runs the VA for us, mandated that employees turn off \ntheir computers at the end of the workday. This is not the whole \nFederal Government. This is one department of the Federal Government, \nthe VA.\n  The agency also began acquiring more energy-efficient computers and \nsoftware. Combined, the Department plans to save about $32 million over \nthe next 5 years--$32 million. This is not too shabby. Again, that is \njust one Federal department. The bill before us calls on all agencies \nto adopt these kinds of energy and cost-saving techniques.\n  Another provision included in the Shaheen-Portman legislation adopted \nfrom our earlier legislation ensures that we build Federal buildings \nwith some of the most energy-efficient technology that is available. \nThese are buildings that will be with us for not just a couple of \nyears, maybe not just for a couple of decades, they could be here a \nwhole lot longer.\n  They could be around when all of these pages down here are dead and \ngone. We still have these Federal buildings. They can still be energy \nefficient, but if we build them wrong, they will never be energy \nefficient. Maybe so. This is a chance to get it right from the start.\n  Overall, the Shaheen-Portman bill makes major strides in promoting \nFederal energy efficiency. I wish to applaud its authors, both of whom \nI have huge respect, love and affection for, especially my former \ncolleague in the National Governors Association.\n  However, there is a small provision in the bill that was overlooked \nand one that, if added, could make possible even greater gains. I will \ntalk about that for a minute.\n  Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress overlooked geothermal \nas a renewable for the purposes of Federal energy requirements. \nRenewable thermal energy is clean, it is efficient, and it is often \nmore cost-effective than electric energy.\n  This is why I have joined a colleague, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, in \noffering amendment No. 1851--if you are keeping score--which allows \ngeothermal to be considered a renewable energy for Federal \nrequirements. Our amendment gives Federal agencies another valuable \noption as they consider the most cost-effective way to meet their \nenergy needs and obligations. It is another option.\n  I again wish to thank our chair and ranking member of the energy \ncommittee, as well as the sponsors of this bill, the authors of this \nbill, in support of our amendment.\n  Before I close, there is something I have to get off my chest. This \nis a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that seeks to do a number of \nthings I said earlier. This is a bill that tries to reduce our energy \nconsumption in this country, especially the energy consumption of the \nenergy consumed in the Federal Government.\n  This is legislation that tries to do some good things for the \nenvironment. This is legislation that helps to further reduce our \nbudget deficits. It helps keep them coming down.\n  This is a bill that has bipartisan support and does so much good. \nPeople offer amendments to this bill, hopefully, that are germane \namendments. Let's debate them and have a chance to vote on them, up or \ndown, but let's do it and let's move on. Let's not be dilatory. Let's \nnot just offer amendments that have nothing to do with this \nlegislation. Let's address some real problems--not just address them, \nbut let's solve them. Let's solve them. And we can do that.\n\n  We have plenty of work to do on this front. I wish to see us do it. \nWe will be a lot more successful in this regard if we work together to \nfoster what I call a culture of thrift.\n  We need to look at everything we do in this government that has \ndiscretion and will probably get a better result for less money. One of \nthe ways is how do we provide energy for Federal buildings and for \nFederal employees to use in the work we do for our taxpayers--\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\nhow do we get a better result for less money or the same amount of \nmoney.\n  Almost everything needs to be on the table if we are to continue to \nwhittle down the size of our Federal budget and restore our Nation's \nfiscal challenge for my children, for our children, and for our \ngrandchildren. I think if we accomplish this while at the same time \ncreating some well-paying jobs at home and save energy, we will come \nclose to completing that triple play that the Wilmington Blue Rocks \ncame very close to pulling off a couple of weekends ago.\n  In doing so, we will give something for our fans--there are not a lot \nof them these days--to talk about for seasons to come.\n  The last thing I wish to say is this. One of the amendments that is \noffered, maybe a couple of the amendments offered to this bill have to \ndo with health care.\n  I serve on the Finance Committee and worked a fair amount on the \nAffordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare. The heart and soul of the \nAffordable Care Act, as far as I am concerned, is the creation of the \nhealth exchanges, Federal exchanges, or they call them marketplaces. \nThe idea is to let everybody in this country--not everybody but a lot \nof people in this country who don't have health care coverage or who \nhave paid an arm and a leg for it--have the opportunity to participate \nin a large purchasing pool in their own State.\n  We have something such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan \nthat all Federal employees, Federal retirees, including legislators, \nMembers of the legislative branch, judges, folks throughout the \ncountry, Federal retirees, their dependents, postal employees, postal \nretirees, their dependents, everybody who wants to purchase their \nhealth insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan can \ndo that. It is up to about 7 million or so people. We don't have that \nmany Federal employees, but there are a lot of people who use that plan \nto buy their health insurance. It is not free. It is not cheap.\n  One of the things that helped drive down the cost is every health \ninsurance company worth their salt in this country wants to sell \nthrough this large purchasing pool, the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan purchasing pool. Because of the large size, the economies \nof scale, the administrative costs to those who get their insurance \nthrough the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the administrative \ncosts are not 30 percent of premiums, they are not 20 percent of \npremiums, they are not 10 percent of premiums--they are 3 percent of \npremiums.\n  What we do with the Affordable Care Act is we allow every State to \nset up a health care exchange, a large purchasing pool, also called \nhealth insurance marketplaces. If you are an individual, if you have a \nfamily, a small- or medium-sized business up to 50 employees, you can \nbuy your health insurance through the exchange in the health insurance \nmarketplace in your State.\n  One of the stipulations--I am not sure who authored it, but I am \npretty sure it is a Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee. \nIt may have been Senator Grassley. Somebody authored an amendment that \nrequired and said if these exchanges are such a great idea, why don't \nwe require us, Members of Congress, and our staffs to buy our health \ninsurance through the exchanges? If that is such a great idea, why \ndon't we too? That is what the legislation says.\n  We don't get our health insurance free. Members, our staff, folks who \nwork for the Federal Government, we don't get it free. We have to pay a \npercentage of our premiums.\n  Most large employers pay something. The employer contribution, the \naverage is about 70 percent. The Federal Government pays about 70 \npercent of our health insurance premiums. We have to pay the rest.\n  I think for us to set an example, I think the kind of example we \nshould set would be if we set up these health insurance exchanges, why \ndon't we participate in them. We are going to.\n  Some people think we get free health care. Some people think we get a \npension after 2, 4 or 6 years. People see this stuff on the Internet \nand they believe it. It is not true.\n  We say in the Navy if you want to find out the truth, ask for the \nstraight skinny. That is what you call it in the Navy, the straight \nskinny. Tell me the straight skinny. Give it to me straight.\n  The great skinny is these health exchanges are a very important \ncomponent of the Affordable Care Act. Every State will have an \nopportunity to set them up. Individuals, families, small- and middle-\nsized businesses will have an opportunity to participate. They will get \nbetter options to choose from. In the end, I think we will get better \nprices and they will be better off. Small businesses that participate, \nsmall- and middle-sized businesses will be better off as well.\n  The last word, speaking of the truth, the words of Thomas Jefferson \ncome to mind. Thomas Jefferson said a lot of great things, but one of \nmy favorite things he said was if the people know the truth, they will \nnot make a mistake. If the American people know the truth, they will \nnot make a mistake.\n  Our job is to make sure they know the truth about the Affordable Care \nAct, the kinds of options and opportunity they can find through these \nexchanges and through these health marketplaces across the country. \nLet's stick to the truth.\n  In closing, the truth is this bill that is before us shouldn't be a \nvehicle for health care reform, getting rid of it or expanding health \ncare reform; this should be a roadmap to help us save money, clean our \nenvironment, preserve energy, reduce energy, and foster American \ntechnology. That is great. That is not a triple play. If they had four \nouts in an inning, there would be four of them.\n  Senator Shaheen--Senator Portman is not with us--my hat is off to \nboth of them. Thank you for leading the way. We are happy to be, as we \nsay in NASCAR, drafting on you, and hopefully we will draft right \nacross that finish line with you.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Before my colleague from Delaware leaves the floor, I \nwish to think him for coming down, speaking on the bill, and for his \nkind words. As the Senator pointed out, we were Governors together. \nActually, we have another former Governor on the floor, Senator King of \nMaine, who also appreciates dealing with the challenges of high energy \ncosts.\n  The Senator pointed out, and something that I know, that as Governors \nenergy was a big issue for us. In New Hampshire we have the sixth \nhighest energy costs in the country, so it is still a big issue for us \nin New Hampshire. As the Senator points out, energy efficiency is the \ncheapest, fastest way to deal with our energy needs because the energy \nwe don't use doesn't cost us any money.\n\n  I would argue that, as the Senator mentioned when he closed, this is \nnot just an opportunity for a triple play but an opportunity for us to \nwin on four fronts: on job creation, on reducing pollution, on savings \nfor businesses and for consumers who have to use energy, but also on \nnational security. Because to the extent we can reduce our dependence \non foreign oil, it helps improve our national security. So this bill is \na win-win-win-win.\n  The amendments, such as the one the Senator is talking about today \nwith Senator Inhofe, improve the bill significantly. If we can call up \nthat amendment today--the amendment of the Senator from Delaware on \nthermal energy--we can probably get a voice vote on it because it has \nthat kind of bipartisan support in this body. It is something the \ncommittee has looked at--both the majority and the minority on the \nenergy committee--and said this is an amendment we think can be \nsupported and has great bipartisan support.\n  As the Senator from Delaware says, we need to have these votes on \nenergy, we need to get a comprehensive energy-efficient strategy in \nthis country, and that is what Shaheen-Portman does. I very much \nappreciate the Senator's good work on this legislation.\n  Mr. CARPER. Reclaiming my time for a moment--and I note Senator Angus \nKing is patiently sitting over there waiting to speak--I said earlier \nthe cleanest, most affordable form of energy is the energy we never \nuse. The cleanest, most affordable form of energy is the energy we \nnever use. Whoever said that first was a wise man or woman. That is the \ncase here, and so I\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\nthank Senator Shaheen for leading us toward that goal.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, for the 43rd time now, to say it is time to wake up to the \nthreat of climate change. Today I am joined by my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Angus King, a fellow New Englander, whose State, like Rhode \nIsland, has rich cultural and economic ties to the sea. As carbon \npollution changes our oceans, the consequences for our States, for our \nfishermen, for our economies, for our way of life are very real--far \nmore real than the lives of the deniers.\n  Here is what we know: The oceans are warming. That is a measurement, \nit is not a theory. Sea level is rising. That is another measurement, \nnot a theory. And oceans are becoming more acidic. Again, that is a \nmeasurement.\n  In fact, according to research published in the journal Oceanography, \nthe acidity of the oceans is now increasing faster than it has in the \nlast 50 million years. We know what is causing it--carbon pollution. My \ncolleagues can deny and delay and dance all day to the polluters' tune, \nbut these are facts.\n  The changes are already reaching our marine life. A research paper \npublished in August looked at the changes over time of where species \nhave lived, when they laid their eggs, and how they have grown their \nshells. The authors concluded that more than 80 percent of the changes \ndocumented in the study were consistent with what one would expect as \nconsequences of a warming and acidifying ocean.\n  Some species are moving toward the colder water of the North and \nSouth Poles, moving at about 10 to 45 miles per decade, extending their \nrange. Events that are timed for spring and summer, such as egg laying \nor migration, are happening on average about 4 days earlier per decade. \nThis means if a parent teaches their child how to fish, where the best \nspots are, how to dig for quahogs or what time of year to get the traps \nout, all of that changes by the time that child becomes a parent.\n  Here is how these changes are affecting Rhode Island, according to \nChristopher Deacutis, the previous chief scientist of the Narragansett \nBay Estuary Program. I will read what he said:\n\n       Although regional climate factors, such as the North \n     Atlantic Oscillation, can influence temperature trends, there \n     appears to be an overall increase in annual Narragansett Bay \n     water temperature of about 3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1960. \n     Fish species in Narragansett Bay are shifting, seemingly in \n     step with increased temperatures. Jeremy Collie--\n\n  And he is a URI professor.\n\n     --and others have shown that cold-water marine species, such \n     as the winter flounder, which used to be the dominant fish \n     species in the bay, are radically decreasing in numbers. \n     Meanwhile, warmer-water species, such as summer flounder, \n     scup, and butterfish seem to be increasing. More southern \n     warm-water species that weren't seen in the past are likely \n     to extend their range north as Narragansett Bay continues to \n     warm. In addition, there seems to be an overall shift from \n     large bottom-dwelling species, such as flounder, to small \n     water column plankton-feeding species, such as anchovies.\n\n  That is the end of his quote.\n  NOAA researchers studied 36 fish in the northwest Atlantic Ocean--\nfish such as the Atlantic cod and haddock, yellowtail and winter \nflounders, spiny dogfish, Atlantic herring--and found that about half \nare shifting northward. Janet Nye, the lead NOAA researcher, said:\n\n       During the last 40 years, many familiar species have been \n     shifting to the north, where ocean waters are cooler, or \n     staying in the same general area but moving into deeper \n     waters than where they traditionally have been found. They \n     all seem to be adapting to changing temperatures and finding \n     places where their chances of survival as a population are \n     greater.\n\n  Those are long descriptions of the situation. Here are some briefer \ndescriptions. One Rhode Island fisherman told me: ``It's getting weird \nout there.'' Another said he is seeing ``real anomalies . . . things \njust aren't making sense.''\n  Some might say: Who cares about the winter flounder or these other \nfish, for that matter? Some people don't care about God's world or \nGod's species unless they can monetize them. Let's answer them in the \nterms they care about.\n  The winter flounder has been a lucrative catch for Rhode Island \nfishermen, and according to a variety of estimates commercial fishing \ngenerates about $150 million to $200 million of spending per year in \nRhode Island and directly supports about 5,000 workers. Recreational \nfishermen spend over $100 million annually and directly support about \n2,000 workers.\n  Last year the Commerce Department declared the northeast groundfish \nfishery a disaster. To quote Acting Commerce Secretary Blank:\n\n       The diminished fish stocks . . . resulted despite \n     fishermen's adherence to catch limits intended to rebuild the \n     stocks.\n\n  The Commerce Department says it is not overfishing that is preventing \nour stocks from rebounding. Scientists think warmer waters could be the \nculprit.\n  The effects of climate change on marine life don't stop with warmer \nwaters. Carbon dioxide emissions are also causing our oceans to become \nmore acidic. Last week two Rhode Islanders came down and visited us \nhere in the Senate: Bob Rheault, the executive director of the East \nCoast Shellfish Growers Association, and Dave Spencer, president of the \nAtlantic Offshore Lobstermen's Association. Dr. Rheault told my \ncolleagues about shellfish larvae literally dissolving because of more \nacidic waters. More acidic waters caused a 70- to 80-percent loss of \noyster larvae at an oyster hatchery in Oregon and crashed wild oyster \nstocks in Washington State. This is an industry worth millions to those \nlocal economies.\n  The problem, as Dr. Rheault pointed out, is that while we know carbon \npollution is causing ocean acidification, we don't know enough yet how \nto protect the shellfish industry. We could help by continuing support \nfor the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act and by \nsupporting funding for the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System. We \ncould support funding for the National Endowment for the Oceans. We \nneed to better understand the changes around us to protect the \neconomic, ecological, cultural, and recreational value our oceans and \ncoasts provide.\n  Rhode Islanders are already working hard to rebuild our fishing \nindustry. We are managing overfishing and limiting water pollution. We \nhave planned for the future by developing a special area management \nplan for our coasts and waters. We are working on a shellfish \nmanagement plan to better support an industry that is growing at 20 \npercent a year. We have supported world-class oceanographic research \nwith scientists at URI's Graduate School of Oceanography, conducting \nsome of the highest quality long-term research on marine ecology.\n  My wife Sandra was part of that research tradition at URI, and I can \nremember as a young husband helping her in her lab and out on the bay.\n  There was a story recently in the Providence Journal about a \nlobsterman named Al Eagles, out on his boat near the Newport Bridge \nrecording on a tablet computer the size, gender, and location of \nlobsters he catches. Mr. Eagles is working with the Commercial \nFisheries Research Foundation trying to improve the southern New \nEngland lobster stock assessment. American lobsters have been, in the \npast, Rhode Island's most valuable commercial catch. Mr. Eagles said:\n\n       The last 2 years it has been very slow. It's been the worst \n     2 years we've ever had.\n\n  In Rhode Island, lobster catches and stocks rose rapidly in the 1990s \nand then plummeted around 2000.\n  Again, it is a similar story. Scientists think the lobsters are \nmoving offshore and northward to shelter in cooler waters. As the \nlobsters move offshore and change their traditional behavior, we need \nto know more about what is going on. But it gets more difficult. We are \ndoing our level best, from our scientists to our fishermen, from our \nlabs to our lobster boats, to understand. There is now so much more we \nneed to understand. Fisheries and fisheries management, like so many \nother industries, is going to have\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\nto operate in a new reality--a reality of warmer and more acidic seas.\n  In the colder waters of Maine, as Senator King will explain, a \nlobster boom continues, but it is not all good news, and Maine \nlobstermen are already sounding the alarm bells at what climate change \nwill mean for them in the future. The fates of our two coastal \neconomies--Maine's and Rhode Island's--are connected.\n  The Presiding Officer represents the State of Massachusetts, which is \nright in the middle of this problem as well. None of our three States \ncan solve what carbon pollution is doing to our oceans alone. Even with \nour three States working together, we can't solve what carbon pollution \nis doing to our oceans. Federal action is necessary to reduce the \ncarbon emissions that are warming and acidifying our seas and to help \nus adapt to the changes we can no longer avoid. Fishermen and \nscientists know these challenges are real, as does my friend from \nMaine, Senator Angus King. But we can't act alone. It is time for all \nof Congress to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                            A Looming Threat\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, in the 1930s there was a looming threat \nfrom Germany to the peace of Europe and to the existence of England. \nThat threat was real, and there were multiple signs. There was data. \nBut there were very few people who wanted to do anything about it \nbecause it would have caused disruption--economic and personal \ndisruption.\n  There was one politician in England who understood this threat, \nunderstood its dangers, and understood that if gone unmet it would \nengulf his country into a destructive and potentially catastrophic war. \nOf course, that politician was Winston Churchill. He saw the danger \nbased upon data--the size of the German air force, the building of \nmunitions, the invasion of other smaller countries, the expansion of \nGermany and their armed forces. He was ignored and ridiculed by his own \nparty and by the leadership of his own party, but he kept talking. He \nkept raising this issue. He kept trying to raise and awaken the people \nof England. It was a very difficult task. In fact, our own great \nPresident John F. Kennedy wrote his thesis as a student about this \nperiod in English history, and the title was very provocative and \nforward-thinking: ``Why England Slept.'' Churchill tried to wake them \nup. Had he been heeded, World War II could have been avoided.\n  There were multiple times when Hitler could have been stopped by the \nslightest bit of resistance on the part of the European powers. \nInstead, the war came, and 5 years later 55 million people had died. \nNot heeding warnings has consequences, and we can always find reasons \nfor nonaction. Churchill acknowledged this. The British had been \nthrough the trauma of World War I less than 20 years before. They \ncouldn't face the possibility of another devastating war. That is \ntotally understandable, and that is human nature.\n  To capture the flavor of Churchill's warning, which I think is very \nrelevant to us here today, here is what he said in a speech to the \nParliament on November 12, 1936:\n\n       The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing \n     and baffling expedience, of delays, is coming to its close. \n     In its place we are entering a period of consequences. We \n     cannot avoid this period, we are in it now.\n\n  He understood the resistance of the people in England. He said:\n\n       We recognize no emergency which should induce us to impinge \n     on the normal course of trade. If we go on like this, and I \n     do not see what power can prevent us from going on like this, \n     some day there may be a terrible reckoning--\n  That reckoning was World War II--\n\n       and those who take the responsibility so entirely upon \n     themselves are either of a hearty disposition or they are \n     incapable of foreseeing the possibilities which may arise.\n\n  He then went on to talk about the responsibility of a parliamentary \nbody. And I will conclude my comments on Churchill with this quote:\n\n       Two things, I confess, have staggered me, after a long \n     Parliamentary experience, in these Debates. The first has \n     been the dangers that have so swiftly come upon us in a few \n     years. . . . Secondly, I have been staggered by the failure \n     of the House of Commons to react effectively against those \n     dangers. That, I am bound to say, I never expected. I never \n     would have believed that we should have been allowed to go on \n     getting into this plight, month by month and year by year, \n     and that even the Government's own confessions of error would \n     have produced no concentration of Parliamentary opinion. . . \n     . I say that unless the House resolves to find out the truth \n     for itself, it will have committed an act of abdication of \n     duty without parallel in its long history.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Madam President, I rise today because we are entering a period of \nconsequences. It is 1936. It is August 2001, when we had warnings that \nAl Qaeda determined to strike in the United States.\n  I actually carry this chart around in my iPhone, but I blew it up for \ntoday's purposes. It is a chart of the last million years of \nCO2 in the atmosphere. I believe this chart answers two of \nthe three basic questions about global climate change.\n  The first is, Is something happening? And occasionally we hear people \nsay: Well, climate change happens in cycles, and CO2 goes up \nand down, and we are just in a cycle and it is no big deal.\n  This is 1 million years, and for the past 999,000-plus we did have \ncycles. The cycles were between about 180 parts per million in the \natmosphere up to about 250--I think 280 was the highest--back 400,000 \nyears ago. But this has been the cycle since before human beings \nstarted to actively impinge upon the environment.\n  Then comes the year 1000. We go along here at a fairly high level, \nand then around 1860 it starts to go up. What happened in 1860? That \nwas the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. That was when we \nstarted to burn fossil fuels in large quantities, whether it was coal, \nlater oil, gas. But that was when it happened.\n  So this answers the second question, which is, Do people have \nanything to do with it? Of course they do. It would be the greatest \ncoincidence in the history of the world if this change just happened to \nbegin at the same time as the Industrial Revolution.\n  Then you see where it has gone since 1960. This chart is actually a \ncouple of years out of date. This point is just below 400 parts per \nmillion. We passed 400 parts per million this summer. We are now here.\n  I don't see how anyone can look at this chart and conclude anything \nelse. A, something is happening to CO2 in the atmosphere, \nand B, people are involved in causing it. I just don't see how you can \nescape that.\n  I believe this is the other piece about this 400. The last time we \nhad 400 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere we know \nfrom ice cores was 3 million years ago, during the pliocene period. I \nknew someday my sixth grade geology would come to the fore. And when we \nhad 400 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere 3 million \nyears ago, sea levels were 60 to 80 feet higher than they are today. As \nthe distinguished Senator from Rhode Island said, this isn't argument. \nThis isn't theory. This is data. This is fact.\n  Remember I said there are three questions about global climate \nchange. One is, Is CO2 really going up? The answer is yes. \nTwo is, Do people have anything to do with it? The answer is yes. The \nthird question is, So what? So what if CO2 is going up?\n  Here is an interesting chart of the past 400,000 or 500,000 years. \nYou have a red line and a black line. The black line is temperature and \nthe red line is CO2. As you can see, it is an almost exact \ncorrelation. I don't think anybody could argue, looking at this, that \nthe amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has nothing to do with \nthe temperature on the Earth. Is it causal? Is there a correlation? \nThere are a lot of things going on here about feedback loops, and it is \nvery complicated. Climate science is one of the most complicated \nsciences there is. But I don't think you can look at this chart and say \nthere isn't some relationship between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \nand temperature. This is what has been happening as CO2 and \ntemperature move essentially in lockstep.\n  I should mention that often when we are talking about these things--\nand the Senator from Rhode Island knows what I am saying--people tend \nto think that we are talking in long periods of time, we are talking \nabout geologic time, thousands of years. No. Climate change often \nhappens abruptly. That is a word that ought to strike fear into our \nhearts. Abruptly. Almost overnight.\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\n  This is temperature and size of the ice field in Greenland. You can \nsee it going back 5,000 to 10,000 years. Here it is going along, \ntemperature goes along, starts to drop, and then it drops in a decade. \nIt is as if someone throws a switch. So this isn't something where we \ncan just say: Oh well. We will do a few little things now and maybe it \nwill be OK, and then 100 years or 500 years from now somebody else will \nworry about it. There could be a catastrophic event within years, \ncertainly within decades.\n  The University of Maine has a center that talks about climate change. \nWhen I went up to see them last spring, they said: Senator, you have to \nunderstand, we are talking about the possibility of abrupt climate \nchange, not just climate change. I think that is a very important point \nto realize.\n  So what difference does temperature make? If it gets a little warmer, \nMaine will have a longer tourist season. That will be OK if it is \nwarmer. I don't think anybody will complain if it is warmer in Maine in \nFebruary--maybe the ski industry. But what difference does it make?\n  It makes a lot of difference. It makes a lot of difference to \nspecies, but it also makes a lot of difference to people.\n  Here is a chart that shows what would happen to many of our coastal \ncommunities with a sea level rise that is reasonably modest. The dark \nred out here is a 1-meter rise. It goes up to 6 meters. That is about \n20 feet. But remember the last time we were at 400 parts per million, \nit was 60 to 80 feet. So this is conservative. This is a smaller \nexample of what can happen if we let this happen to us.\n  Boston essentially is gone. A good deal of downtown Boston, Virginia \nBeach, Norfolk, the Outer Banks--gone. Southern Florida, Miami, the \neastern coast of Florida all the way up into Tampa--gone. By the way, \nthere is no more fresh water in Florida during this period either \nbecause of the intrusion of seawater into the water table. New Orleans \nis all gone. This is at 20 meters. In fact, it is not even that. This \nis about a 3-meter rise. Going up, Savannah and Charleston, New York \nCity, Long Island, the New Jersey shore--all gone.\n  This isn't academic. This impacts billions of dollars of expenditures \nto try to fight this off and to hold it at bay.\n  What about species? In Maine we talk about lobster. The lobster is an \niconic product of Maine. It is a huge part of our society, it is part \nof our culture, it is also a big part of our economy. Well over $1 \nbillion a year in Maine is attributable, in one way or another, to the \nlobster. The lobster population in Maine was pretty steady for an awful \nlong time. When I was Governor--and that was 10 or 12 years ago--we \nharvested roughly 50 million pounds of lobster per year. That was the \nway it had been, between 40 and 50 million. In 2008 it went to 69 \nmillion pounds; in 2009 it went to 81 million; 2010, 96 million--last \nyear, 123 million pounds, more than twice as much as what was harvested \n10 or 12 years ago.\n  I am sure you are saying to yourself: What is the problem, Senator? \nThe lobsters are doing great.\n  They were doing great in Rhode Island and Connecticut until the \ntemperature started to kill them off. It makes a boom and then there is \na danger--we certainly hope it will not happen--but there is a danger \nof a collapse. That is what happened. The lobster fishery in southern \nNew England has essentially collapsed.\n  The lobster makes up about 70 to 80 percent of our fisheries' value. \nWhat is happening in Maine is as the water gets warmer the lobsters go \nnorth. Is the water getting warmer? Here is Maine--Boothbay Harbor, ME, \na great town. If anybody wants to visit, it is a wonderful place to \nvisit. I have to get in that little bit of promotion.\n  Here is the water temperature in Boothbay Harbor over the last 10 \nyears. It is going up. It is getting warmer. There is no indication--in \nfact, if you follow the curve here, it appears it is headed into an \naccelerating mode, the famous hockey stick.\n  Anything above 68 degrees of water temperature is very stressful to \nlobsters. The University of Maine says:\n\n       While warmer waters off the coast in recent years have \n     probably aided the boom in lobster numbers, putting us right \n     in the temperature sweet spot . . . we're getting closer and \n     closer to that point where the temperature is too stressful \n     for them, their immune system is compromised and it's all \n     over.\n\n  ``And it's all over,'' that is a frightening phrase, it is all over. \nIn the 1980s lobster fishing was concentrated in southern Maine, along \nour coast, in what is called Casco Bay, which is down around Portland. \nThen it moved up into what is called the midcoast, Lincoln County near \nwhere I live. The bulk of the lobster fishing moved up into Penobscot \nBay and now the bulk of the lobster fishing is in what we call Hancock \nCounty, the village of Stoning, ME. At least that is where it was last \nyear. In other words, the lobsters are moving north because the \ntemperatures are getting warmer. That is what is happening.\n  I have a young man on my staff whose father is a lobster buyer in the \nmidcoast of Maine. His father has been buying lobster since 1975. This \npast summer he bought 200 crates a night of lobsters; 10 years ago he \nwas buying 100. So it has doubled. But what we are worried about is \nthat when the lobster line passes, this industry is gone. We saw it \ncollapse in southern New England, Rhode Island. In 1999 lobstering in \nLong Island Sound collapsed totally without warning, in part because of \nan infection that was brought about by the warmer water temperatures.\n  I use lobster as just an indication. You can substitute your own \nissue, local issue. Whether it is lobsters in Maine or flooding in \nColorado, the impacts are real.\n  So what do we do? I hate raising problems and not talking about what \nto do. By the way, I have to say I am puzzled about why this has become \na partisan issue. I do not understand it. Maybe it is because Al Gore \ninvented it? I don't know. But I don't understand why this became a \npartisan issue because it is a scientific issue, it is a data issue. \nThe data is overwhelming.\n  So what do we do? By the way, I should mention when I was a young man \nworking in and around the legislature in Maine, the leaders of the \nenvironmental movement in Maine who passed the major legislation to \nprotect our environment were all Republicans--not all, but most of them \nwere Republicans and they were great names in Maine history.\n  OK, what do we do? The first thing we have to do is admit there is a \nproblem. If you do not admit there is a problem, by definition you \ncannot address it. That is No. 1. I think the data is becoming \noverwhelming.\n  The second thing you have to do is gather all the facts and \ninformation you can. Gather all the information. It has been my \nexperience in working on public policy most of my adult life, if you \nhave shared information, if the people working on the problem have the \nsame facts, generally the conclusion, the policy, is fairly clear. It \nmay be controversial, it may be difficult, but usually it becomes \npretty self-evident if everybody shares the same sets of information. \nOnce we can agree on the facts, the solutions become clear.\n  What are some things we can do in the near term? We have to talk \nabout mitigating the impacts. We have to talk about the fact that \nfisheries are made up of both fishermen and fish. As climate change \nalters these coastal economies, we have to work to preserve both. We \nhave to work with groups such as a nonprofit in Maine called the Island \nInstitute that is working to preserve Maine's working waterfronts, and \nwe also have to make sure our Federal fisheries management laws take \ncognizance of what is going on here and manage ecosystems, not just \nsingle species. We have to take cognizance of the fact that the fish \nare in fact moving.\n  In the long term, it seems to me, it is pretty simple. The big \npicture answer is we have to stop burning so much stuff. That is what \nis putting carbon in the atmosphere. Whether it is in our automobiles, \nour homes, our factories, our powerplants--it is burning fossil fuel \nthat is putting CO2 into the atmosphere. That is why the \nefficiency bill we are on this week is an important bill, because it \ncuts back on the use of energy altogether and saves us in terms of \nputting CO2 into the atmosphere.\n  The President has proposed a carbon agenda that I think is an \nimportant first step. But this is hard. Dealing with this is a hard \nissue, just as dealing with the prospect of World War II was a hard \nissue in England in 1936. It\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\nis hard because it is going to require changes that are going to be, \nperhaps, expensive, and significant modifications--because our whole \nsociety is based on burning stuff. That is what makes our cars and \ntrucks go, that is what makes our transportation system work, that is \nwhat keeps us warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and creates the \nelectricity for all the products we use. It is hard because of the \ninternal impacts.\n\n  It is also hard because it is an international problem. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island talked about this being national. You know, Maine and \nRhode Island can't fix it. He says the Federal Government has to step \nin. I would take it one step further. This has to be an international \nsolution. We cannot take steps which would compromise our economy at \nthe same time China and India are becoming major polluters. Air doesn't \nrespect international boundaries. CO2 is the same whether it \nis coming up from China, India, Europe, or the United States. I believe \nthis is a case where we absolutely have to have international \ncooperation.\n  We have to do something. We have to do something. The generation that \nnobly woke up to World War II and fought it and preserved this country \nand Western civilization for us has often been referred to as the \n``greatest generation.'' The reason they were the ``greatest \ngeneration'' is they were willing to face a problem and make enormous \nsacrifices in order to deal with it, to protect us and our children and \ngrandchildren and our ability to function in this new world. They were \nthe ``greatest generation.''\n  I have to say, if somebody were going to characterize us, we would be \ncharacterized as the oblivious generation, the generation that saw the \ndata, saw the facts, saw the freight train headed for us and said: That \nis OK, it is business as usual, don't bother me, I don't want to be \ninconvenienced.\n  To go back to Churchill:\n\n       The era of procrastination, half-measures, of soothing and \n     baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In \n     its place we are entering a period of consequences. . . . We \n     cannot avoid this period; we are in it now.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I take this opportunity to thank \nmy friend Senator King for his remarkable comments on the Senate floor. \nI think it truly is our choice in this time and in this generation to \nbe Nevilles or to be Winstons. Which way will we go? On that choice \nwill hinge history's judgment of us.\n  There was another good Winston Churchillism that talked about `` . . \n. the sharp agate points, upon which the ponderous balance of destiny \nturns.''\n  For better or for worse, we live at a time that is a sharp agate \npoint upon which the ponderous balance of destiny will turn. Senator \nKing has done a wonderful job of calling us to that duty and to that \nresponsibility. I fear that in this particular body the facts are less \nrelevant than the interests that are involved.\n  There are special interests, there are polluters who are calling a \ntune to which too many of our Members are happy to dance. I worry that \nmany of them will be willing to go down with the ship; that as the \nwaters gurgle down their throats that last time, the last words up out \nof their mouths will be the flagrant falsehood: But the science still \nisn't real.\n  As much as I would like to see us solve this problem in this Chamber, \nas committed as I am to making that happen, I think we do have to call \non the American people to stand and be counted and to make sure their \nvoices are heard, because the choice that is before us is one where the \nAmerican people have a view. They understand this problem and they know \nit is real. They are not fooled. They are not part of the polluters' \ndance. But they have to be heard. Whatever we can do to make sure their \nvoices are reflected here I think we need to do.\n  There are some very important voices that recognize climate change is \nreal: the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the entire property casualty insurance industry, the \nnameplate corporate leaders of America--whether it is Ford and GM or \nNike and Apple or Coca-Cola and Pepsi, our national security \nestablishment or national intelligence establishment and our foreign \npolicy establishment. Wherever you look, people get it, except right \nhere where the polluters call the tune and too many of us dance to it.\n  But with more people standing up the way Senator King did, the sooner \nwe will be able to bring that day. I am confident the American people \nwill get this done and get it right.\n  The last Churchillism--I am kind of a fan of Winston Churchill: The \nAmerican people will always do the right thing, after they have tried \neverything else.\n  We work together to bring that day forward.\n  Let me change the subject briefly to remark on a different occasion. \nIt is also oceans related.\n\n\n                          Battle of Lake Erie\n\n  We have just been through the 200th anniversary of one of the pivotal \nnaval victories in our Nation's history which was led by a great Rhode \nIsland hero, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Commodore Perry was born \njust after the dawn of our Republic in 1785, in South Kingstown, \nRI. His father Christopher Perry had fought in the American Revolution \nand after the war became a captain in the U.S. Navy. By the time young \nOliver reached his teenage years, he was already serving as a \nmidshipman on his father's vessel. Interestingly enough, his father's \nvessel was called the General Greene, named after Rhode Island's \nRevolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene, whose statue stands in this \nbuilding--in the center of the Capitol--and who is renowned. General \nCornwallis is reputed to have said that ``Greene is more dangerous than \nWashington.''\n\n  Young Oliver Perry was also destined for great things. The late 1700s \nand the early 1800s were a very precarious time for this fledgling \nAmerican democracy, and it was still an open question whether our \nexperiment in self-government would endure. In 1812, when America once \nagain declared war on Britain, following a series of disputes over \ntrade and territory, the future of this young democracy hung in the \nbalance.\n  Oliver Hazard Perry went to war. He began his war service in Newport, \nRI, but in February of 1818, as the War of 1812 raged on, Perry was \ngiven command of the American forces on Lake Erie.\n  When Perry arrived in the region, the British had taken Detroit and \nwere looking to expand their control of the American Northwest. As \nRichard Snow wrote in his chronicle of the Battle of Lake Erie for \nAmerican Heritage magazine: ``Perry took command vigorously and at \nonce.'' He oversaw an aggressive shipbuilding operation on the lake's \nshore and worked diligently to raise enough men and guns to carry out \nhis mission. GEN William Henry Harrison, later to be President, had \npositioned his fleet into a stalemate with British GEN Henry Procter on \nLake Erie, leaving Perry and his fleet with the responsibility of \nretaking the lake for the United States.\n  Perry sailed west and holed up in Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie's South \nBass Island. There he waited until, on September 10, 1813, Robert \nHeriot Barclay sailed his British command within sight of Commodore \nPerry's lookout. As Snow wrote about that:\n\n       The American ships cleared for action; stands of cutlasses \n     were set up on deck, shot was placed near the guns, and the \n     hatches were closed . . . Sand was sprinkled on the deck so \n     that the sailors could keep their footing when the blood \n     began to flow. Perry brought the ship's papers, wrapped in \n     lead, to the ship's surgeon and told him to throw them \n     overboard should the Lawrence be forced to strike. Sometime \n     during the morning he hoisted his battle flag, a blue banner \n     bearing the dying words attributed to Captain Lawrence: \n     ``Don't give up the ship.''\n\n  The battle commenced, but the British were better armed and gained an \nearly advantage. Soon enough, Perry's flagship, the Lawrence, was \ncrippled, but he refused to give up. He took down his flag, climbed \naboard a small row boat, and made his way toward the Niagara, the \nLawrence's sister ship which had yet to engage in the battle. Perry's \ncrossing between the ships is the inspiration for William Henry \nPowell's painting, which hangs in the staircase directly outside of \nthis room right now. It is the biggest painting in the Senate, and it \nfeatures a hero of the littlest State in the country.\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\n  From the Niagara, Perry reengaged the battle with the British and \nultimately gained the day. He forced their surrender and sent the now \nfamous message to General Harrison: ``We have met the enemy and they \nare ours.'' Lake Erie had been secured for America.\n  The War of 1812 continued on through 1814, but Perry's victory on \nLake Erie was pivotal. Had the British taken Lake Erie, it would have \nprovided a base for attacks into New York or into the new State of Ohio \nand for control of the American Northwest. Instead, the Treaty of Ghent \nended the conflict with no loss of territory or trade to the United \nStates.\n  Perry continued his naval service after the war, but he contracted \nyellow fever during a mission to Venezuela in 1819 and he died at the \nage of 34. Today, his name and his actions are remembered in ways large \nand small throughout our country. In Ohio, on Lake Erie, a bicentennial \ncelebration was held this year commemorating the great battle, and Put-\nin-Bay boasts a memorial maintained by the National Park Service--\nPerry's Victory and International Peace Memorial. I am told that up \nthere one can toast to Perry's victory with a Commodore Perry IPA, \ncourtesy of Cleveland's Great Lakes Brewing Company.\n  In Rhode Island, one can travel along Commodore Perry Highway in his \nnative South Kingstown or visit the newly commissioned Rhode Island \ntall ship SSV Oliver Hazard Perry, which will provide education-at-sea \nprograms to Rhode Island kids.\n  It is fitting that we continue to honor this great Rhode Islander. \nHis victory on Lake Erie was, to borrow from Churchill, one of those \n``sharp agate points'' on which history turned. So today I hope we will \nall take a moment and remember Oliver Hazard Perry and reflect on how \ndifferently our world would have turned out were it not for his \nactions.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today, the Nation celebrates the 226th \nanniversary of the Constitution's signing. That moment was a decision \nto create a Federal Government with the power to address national \nproblems. During the Constitutional Convention, the delegates debated \nhundreds of issues and proposals before crafting the original version \nof the Constitution. Even then, though, the true genius of their \ncharter was article V, which provided for later amendments--because the \nFounding generation knew that they did not have all the answers and \nthey had faith in future generations to perfect their charter and \n``form a more perfect Union.'' And so, step by step, we have. ``We the \nPeople'' have shown a continuing concern for the sacred right to vote. \nAnd we have amended the Constitution six times to expand that right.\n  For over 2 centuries, the Constitution has allowed America to \nflourish and adapt to new challenges. Since the inclusion of the Bill \nof Rights in 1791, the Constitution has been amended 17 times. Our \ncurrent version of the Constitution reflects not just the Founders \noriginal crafting, but also the need for subsequent amendments. Today \nis a good day to remind the American people that when we pledge to \nsupport the Constitution, we must pledge our support for the whole \nConstitution, and not just those specific provisions and amendments \nthat we favor or find convenient to uphold.\n  Too often, I have heard people who profess to support the original \nmeaning of the Constitution, ignore the subsequent amendments that \ninform and alter that original meaning. Some even express strong \nsupport for specific amendments, but then ignore others. That is not \nhow our charter functions. It is not a menu that you can pick and \nchoose from. The whole Constitution is what we celebrate today.\n  This past June, when the Supreme Court issued its decision on the \nVoting Rights Act, I noticed that there was surprisingly little \ndiscussion of the fundamental importance of the Reconstruction \nAmendments. After the Civil War, we transformed our founding charter \ninto one that embraced equal rights and human dignity by abolishing \nslavery, guaranteeing equal protection of the law for all Americans, \nand prohibiting racial barriers to the right to vote. I find it \nalarming that many who claim to support and honor the Constitution \nconveniently ignore these critical amendments that made our Nation a \nmore perfect one after the Civil War.\n  There are perhaps no two amendments that have played a larger role in \nsecuring liberty and equality for all Americans than the 14th and 15th \nAmendments. Without the 14th Amendment we would still have ``separate \nbut equal'' treatment of Americans and State-sanctioned gender \ndiscrimination. Without the 15th Amendment, minorities would continue \nto be excluded from fully participating in our democracy.\n  The importance of these amendments was clear upon passage. President \nUlysses S. Grant in 1870 signed a bill into law that created the United \nStates Department of Justice to help facilitate the enforcement of the \n14th and 15th Amendments. But the Justice Department does not have sole \nresponsibility for supporting and upholding the 14th and 15th \nAmendments. Congress, as provided by the text of the Amendments, has an \neven greater role in enforcing the mandates of those Amendments.\n  Section 5 of the 14th Amendment states that: ``The Congress shall \nhave power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of \nthis article.'' Section 2 of the 15th Amendment states that: ``The \nCongress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate \nlegislation.'' It is clear that the Constitution has placed the burden \non Congress to ensure that all Americans are entitled to the freedoms \nand rights guaranteed by these two amendments.\n  It is for this reason that Congress must respond to the recent \nSupreme Court decision severely undercutting the Voting Rights Act by \npassing legislation that protects against racial discrimination in \nvoting. It is our duty and constitutional obligation to not waver from \nthe path of greater political inclusion that we have set for the Nation \nthrough our bipartisan support of the Voting Rights Act. I hope that \nCongress will work with me so that we can provide the protections \nguaranteed by these two amendments for all Americans.\n  On this day, as we commemorate the signing of the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America 226 years ago, I hope that Congress will be \nreminded of its obligation not only to periodically read the words of \nour founding charter, but to act and to give meaning to those words. I \nlook forward to working with fellow Senators to reinvigorate the Voting \nRights Act this fall to uphold our constitutional values and ensure \nthat every American enjoys the right to vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6509-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6509-S6510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CITIZENSHIP DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in 1940, Congress officially recognized \nthe values inherent in United States citizenship by enacting \nlegislation to designate a day of commemoration. At that time, the \nthird Sunday in May was designated ``I Am an American Day.'' In 1952, \nCongress passed new legislation to move the commemoration date to \nSeptember 17, the date in 1787 the Constitution was signed. September \n17 became known as Citizenship Day, a day that we recognize today.\n  Today's celebration of the values represented by United States \ncitizenship represents also a celebration of our democracy. In Vermont, \nUnited States Federal District Court Judge William Sessions will \nconduct a naturalization ceremony today. Once again the President will \nissue a proclamation to honor\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\nthe principles of what it means to be an American. I am proud to join \nthe President in the official recognition of the citizenship process \nand all it represents.\n  Last week, as Americans remembered and reflected upon the tragedy of \nSeptember 11, 2001, I was reminded of how I recognized that terrible \nday on its 1-year anniversary. With Judge William Sessions, on \nSeptember 11, 2002, we convened a naturalization ceremony in Vermont's \nhistoric State House. I was honored to speak at that ceremony and at \nothers in the years following. These celebrations, in which we welcome \nnew Americans, reflect America's resiliency and ongoing renewal. They \nalso serve as an emotional reminder to me what it means to be part of \nthis country. When we say to those who aspire to be Americans that we \nwelcome you regardless of religion, ethnicity, native language, or \nculture, we honor the principles upon which America was founded, and \nwhich Americans spanning generations have given so much to defend.\n  This August, I was privileged to be invited to participate in a \nnaturalization ceremony by the Chief Judge of the Federal District \nCourt for the District of Vermont, Christina Reiss. I was moved then, \nas I am at every naturalization ceremony I attend, by how uplifting and \nhopeful this process is for those who have earned it and for those \nincluding myself who witness it.\n  In June, 68 Senators voted to pass a comprehensive immigration reform \nbill. The Senate and so many Americans--and aspiring Americans--wait \nwith optimism and hopefulness for the House of Representatives to act. \nThe core of the Senate's legislation was the opportunity for many \nmillions of undocumented people living in the United States to enter \nthe lawful immigration system, and to one day become citizens. The \nSenate recognized that the time for action is now and in acting, upheld \nthe sacred values we celebrate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6510-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CONSTITUTION DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, especially in times of crisis but also in \ntimes of ease, Americans have reason to reflect on the foundation of \nthe life we enjoy as a Nation. More than the citizens of any other \ncountry, when Americans think of their collective lives or their \nindividual liberties, we think of a document. On this day, 226 years \nago, a group of America's Founders signed the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  In May of 1787, 55 of the 70 delegates chosen by 12 of the 13 States \ngathered in the Pennsylvania Statehouse, where both the Articles of \nConfederation and the Declaration of Independence had been signed. Just \n115 days later, 39 of those delegates signed the Constitution and \nwithin 18 months it had been ratified and was the supreme law of the \nland.\n  The Constitution is special both for whose it is and for what it \ndoes. The Constitution's first three words identify its ownership when \nit says ``we the people.'' The Constitution belongs to the people. The \nConstitution is also special for what it does. It both empowers and \nlimits government. The Constitution gives powers to government by \ndelegating enumerated powers to the Federal Government and reserving \nthe others to the States and the people. And the Constitution limits \nthose powers in multiple ways, including the very fact of being written \ndown. As the Supreme Court put it in Marbury v. Madison, the \nConstitution was written so that the limits on government would be \nneither mistaken nor forgotten.\n  Put these two principles together and we see that the Constitution is \nthe primary tool for the people to control their government. That is \nboth the genius of its design and the source of its vitality. The \nConstitution lives because of whose it is and what it does. Departing \nfrom that design kills the Constitution.\n  President George Washington said in his farewell address that the \nvery basis of our political system is the people's right to control \ntheir Constitution. Take away that right, undermine that control, \nstrikes at the heart of the system of government that has given us \nliberty unparalleled in human history. That is why, for example, we \ncontend over the appointment of Federal judges, many of whom appear \nwilling or even determined to control the Constitution rather than to \nbe controlled by it.\n  In times of crisis, we often look to the powers of government and in \ntimes of ease, we may emphasize more the limits on those powers. But \nlet us never mistake or forget whose the Constitution is and what it \ndoes so that it may continue to fulfill the purposes stated in its \npreamble: to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure \ndomestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \ngeneral welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and \nour posterity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6510-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DEREK JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Sadly, Sergeant Johnson \nlost his life in Draper, UT on the morning of September 1, 2013 in the \nline of duty.\n  From a very young age, Johnson always knew he wanted to be a police \nofficer. His childhood aspirations became reality as he worked in \nvarious aspects of law enforcement. While he was still in high school \nhe was an Explorer Scout for the Sandy City Police Department; followed \nby time as a police dispatcher, and then completion of police academy \ntraining. He has worked for the Draper City Police Department for the \npast 8 years, first as a reserve officer and then a full-time officer, \nand recently as Sergeant.\n  In 2012, Johnson was presented with the Distinguished Service Medal \nfor his role in the investigation and prosecution of a child abuse \nhomicide in 2012. He also received the Life Saving Award, and the 2012 \nCommunity Policing Officer of the Year.\n  Those who knew Johnson said he loved his family, and he loved his \nwork as a police officer. Johnson has been described as someone with a \ngood nature and a sense of humor that could light up any room; and the \nability to make anyone his friend.\n  Draper City Mayor Darrell Smith stated: ``I have known Derek for many \nyears. He is one of the best and most qualified sergeants on our \nforce.''\n  Johnson leaves behind his childhood sweetheart and wife Shante' \nSidwell Johnson, their 7-year-old son, Bensen who he called his \n``little buddy,'' his parents Randy and Laura Johnson, and many other \nfamily and friends.\n  I have the highest personal regard for those who not only enter law \nenforcement but put their lives on the line each day to protect and \nserve our fellow men, women and children in communities across America. \nSergeant Johnson did just that--he sacrificed to keep his community \nsafe and we owe a debt of gratitude to him for his courage and selfless \nservice.\n  It is my sincere hope that Shante' and Bensen and the many family \nmembers and friends who love Sergeant Johnson will find peace and hope \nin the life he lived and the example he set for so many to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6510-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6510-S6511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MARREEN CASPER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I am grateful for this opportunity today to \npay tribute to a truly extraordinary woman--Marreen Casper. Sadly, \nMarreen passed away on September 14, 2013, while she was serving a \nmission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with her \nhusband Ron Casper in Tennessee.\n  I had the wonderful opportunity of working with Marreen while she \nserved on my staff for 13 years. She retired at the end of last year to \npursue new opportunities in life, and to spend time with her family \nwhom she greatly loved. Throughout her years of service in my Senate \nOffice, she distinguished herself as someone who truly cared about our \ngreat State and its citizens. For many years she worked as my Southern \nUtah Field Director and became immersed in the many communities she \nserved. She had a dogged determination and a great compassion for the \ncitizens of southern Utah and had a ready smile and helping hand for \nall. She literally had friends in every corner of Utah through \nassociations she has made and help she has rendered.\n  There has been no assignment ever given to Marreen that she did not \nfulfill willingly and with enthusiasm. She was a world-class volunteer \nfor schools,\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\ncampaigns, and other causes she believed in; dedicated Senate employee \nwho fulfilled her duties in a professional, caring manner; faithful \nservant in her church; and loving wife and mother. Marreen was \nabsolutely loyal and always approached challenges and obstacles with \ngrit and determination.\n  To know Marreen was to know one irrefutable truth--she truly loved \nher family. She was very proud of her children and grandchildren. \nFamily photos adorned her office walls, and conversations with Marreen \nwere always peppered with anecdotes and stories of events and \naccomplishments taking place within her family. She was very careful to \nalways balance her work responsibilities with family time. In fact, \nmost of her vacation days were spent traveling to visit and participate \nin important events in the lives of family members. I know she attended \nsports events, graduations, baptisms, mission farewells, and so many \nother milestones in her children and grandchildren's lives and loved to \nregale her peers and friends with memories from these experiences. \nMarreen loved her family with her whole heart and soul and believed \nwholly in the power and strength of family.\n  Marreen also deeply loved the Gospel of Jesus Christ and had a strong \nand firm testimony of eternal life and in the teachings of our Savior. \nShe served in many positions in the church and had a profound influence \nin the lives of those she worked with and through her beautiful \nexample. Marreen and Ron had planned on serving a mission for the \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for many years and \ncarefully prepared for this opportunity to serve. She was thrilled to \nbe called to Tennessee to spread the message of the Gospel and to help \nthose in need. She was a true disciple of Jesus Christ and a loving \nexample of missionary work going forward throughout the world. It is my \nfirm hope that Ron and her family will find some peace and comfort \nknowing that Marreen died while in the service of her Heavenly Father \nwhom she deeply loved.\n  I am grateful I had the opportunity to work and share a friendship \nwith Marreen Casper. Her life although not as long as many would have \nhoped for; was a life well-lived. She was a woman deeply admired and \nloved. Elaine and I extend our deepest sympathies to Ron and her five \nchildren and many grandchildren. May they find peace and comfort in the \ncherished memories they have shared with this noble woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6511-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ELMORE LEONARD\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, when Michigan novelist Elmore Leonard \npassed away on August 20, the world lost an irreplaceable voice, a \nwitty creator of unlikely and unforgettable characters who, like their \ncreator, knew the value of brevity.\n  Leonard's novels took place in the American West, in the Everglades, \nin the Horn of Africa or the streets of Havana, but they always carried \na little of his hometown, Detroit. His protagonists, like his hometown, \nwere tough and gruff, but loveable and good-hearted, people of few \nwords but bold actions. Like his hometown, Leonard's writing was \nwithout pretense or formality. ``If it sounds like writing,'' he said, \n``I rewrote it.''\n  The New York Times accurately described Leonard as ``A Man of Few, \nYet Perfect, Words.'' In 2001, he wrote for The Times a short essay on \nhis tips for writers, titled, ``Easy on the Adverbs, Exclamation Points \nand Especially Hooptedoodle.'' Their aim, he said, was to ``remain \ninvisible when I'm writing a book, to help me show rather than tell \nwhat's taking place in the story.'' His rules for writing are useful \nfor all of us who write and want to be read, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record. The world has lost a great \nwriter. I have lost a friend.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [Published: July 16, 2001]\n\n    Writers on Writing: Easy on the Adverbs, Exclamation Points and \n                        Especially Hooptedoodle\n\n                          (By Elmore Leonard)\n\n       These are rules I've picked up along the way to help me \n     remain invisible when I'm writing a book, to help me show \n     rather than tell what's taking place in the story. If you \n     have a facility for language and imagery and the sound of \n     your voice pleases you, invisibility is not what you are \n     after, and you can skip the rules. Still, you might look them \n     over.\n       1. Never open a book with weather.\n       If it's only to create atmosphere, and not a character's \n     reaction to the weather, you don't want to go on too long. \n     The reader is apt to leaf ahead looking for people. There are \n     exceptions. If you happen to be Barry Lopez, who has more \n     ways to describe ice and snow than an Eskimo, you can do all \n     the weather reporting you want.\n       2. Avoid prologues.\n       They can be annoying, especially a prologue following an \n     introduction that comes after a foreword. But these are \n     ordinarily found in nonfiction. A prologue in a novel is \n     backstory, and you can drop it in anywhere you want.\n       There is a prologue in John Steinbeck's ``Sweet Thursday,'' \n     but it's O.K. because a character in the book makes the point \n     of what my rules are all about. He says: ``I like a lot of \n     talk in a book and I don't like to have nobody tell me what \n     the guy that's talking looks like. I want to figure out what \n     he looks like from the way he talks . . . figure out what the \n     guy's thinking from what he says. I like some description but \n     not too much of that . . . Sometimes I want a book to break \n     loose with a bunch of hooptedoodle . . . Spin up some pretty \n     words maybe or sing a little song with language. That's nice. \n     But I wish it was set aside so I don't have to read it. I \n     don't want hooptedoodle to get mixed up with the story.''\n       3. Never use a verb other than ``said'' to carry dialogue.\n       The line of dialogue belongs to the character; the verb is \n     the writer sticking his nose in. But said is far less \n     intrusive than grumbled, gasped, cautioned, lied. I once \n     noticed Mary McCarthy ending a line of dialogue with ``she \n     asseverated,'' and had to stop reading to get the dictionary.\n       4. Never use an adverb to modify the verb ``said'' . . .\n       . . . he admonished gravely. To use an adverb this way (or \n     almost any way) is a mortal sin. The writer is now exposing \n     himself in earnest, using a word that distracts and can \n     interrupt the rhythm of the exchange. I have a character in \n     one of my books tell how she used to write historical \n     romances ``full of rape and adverbs.''\n       5. Keep your exclamation points under control.\n       You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words \n     of prose. If you have the knack of playing with exclaimers \n     the way Tom Wolfe does, you can throw them in by the handful.\n       6. Never use the words ``suddenly'' or ``all hell broke \n     loose.''\n       This rule doesn't require an explanation. I have noticed \n     that writers who use ``suddenly'' tend to exercise less \n     control in the application of exclamation points.\n       7. Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly.\n       Once you start spelling words in dialogue phonetically and \n     loading the page with apostrophes, you won't be able to stop. \n     Notice the way Annie Proulx captures the flavor of Wyoming \n     voices in her book of short stories ``Close Range.''\n       8. Avoid detailed descriptions of characters.\n       Which Steinbeck covered. In Ernest Hemingway's ``Hills Like \n     White Elephants'' what do the ``American and the girl with \n     him'' look like? ``She had taken off her hat and put it on \n     the table.'' That's the only reference to a physical \n     description in the story, and yet we see the couple and know \n     them by their tones of voice, with not one adverb in sight.\n       9. Don't go into great detail describing places and things.\n       Unless you're Margaret Atwood and can paint scenes with \n     language or write landscapes in the style of Jim Harrison. \n     But even if you're good at it, you don't want descriptions \n     that bring the action, the flow of the story, to a \n     standstill.\n       And finally:\n       10. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.\n       A rule that came to mind in 1983. Think of what you skip \n     reading a novel: thick paragraphs of prose you can see have \n     too many words in them. What the writer is doing, he's \n     writing, perpetrating hooptedoodle, perhaps taking another \n     shot at the weather, or has gone into the character's head, \n     and the reader either knows what the guy's thinking or \n     doesn't care. I'll bet you don't skip dialogue.\n       My most important rule is one that sums up the 10.\n       If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it.\n       Or, if proper usage gets in the way, it may have to go. I \n     can't allow what we learned in English composition to disrupt \n     the sound and rhythm of the narrative. It's my attempt to \n     remain invisible, not distract the reader from the story with \n     obvious writing. (Joseph Conrad said something about words \n     getting in the way of what you want to say.)\n       If I write in scenes and always from the point of view of a \n     particular character--the one whose view best brings the \n     scene to life--I'm able to concentrate on the voices of the \n     characters telling you who they are and how they feel about \n     what they see and what's going on, and I'm nowhere in sight.\n       What Steinbeck did in ``Sweet Thursday'' was title his \n     chapters as an indication, though obscure, of what they \n     cover. ``Whom the Gods Love They Drive Nuts'' is one, ``Lousy \n     Wednesday'' another. The third chapter is titled \n     ``Hooptedoodle 1'' and the 38th chapter ``Hooptedoodle 2'' as \n     warnings to the reader, as if Steinbeck is saying: ``Here's \n     where you'll see me taking flights of fancy with my writing, \n     and it won't get in the way of the story. Skip them if you \n     want.''\n       ``Sweet Thursday'' came out in 1954, when I was just \n     beginning to be published, and I've never forgotten that \n     prologue.\n       Did I read the hooptedoodle chapters? Every word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6511-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6511-S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the Attorney General has recently \nannounced that the Department of Justice will not charge certain drug \noffenders in a way that would trigger the\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nimposition of mandatory minimum sentences.\n  Before outlining some of the concerns that I have with the policy and \nthe statement that the Attorney General issued on the subject, I do \nwant to note that I agree with a number of the points that he made.\n  These are the specific points with which I am in agreement with the \nAttorney General:\n  The Department will coordinate with State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement to maximize the operation of Federal resources in criminal \nprosecutions.\n  The development of comprehensive anti-violence strategies by the U.S. \nattorneys with input from State and local authorities.\n  The designation by the U.S. attorneys' offices of coordinators for \nprevention and reentry.\n  Direct Federal assistance to hot spots of violence and the new use of \nCOPS grants for school resource officers.\n  Creation of a new task force for violence experienced by Indian \nchildren.\n  Providing support for survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, \nand dating violence.\n  Compassionate release of nonviolent inmates who are elderly and have \nserved a long part of their sentences is wise.\n  And I favor addressing unwarranted racial disparities in sentencing.\n  That is quite a bit of agreement. I am pleased that we share some \ncommon ground.\n  But there are other statements of the Attorney General that I cannot \nagree with, and I think it is important to set the record straight.\n  Almost 30 years ago the crime situation in this country was far \ndifferent from the 1960's on, crime rates had risen rapidly. One reason \nfor that state of affairs was the way sentencing worked. There was \noften little relation between the length of sentence that was imposed \nand the actual time the offender served. Parole often led to release of \ncriminals too soon, enabling them to repeat their crimes on other \nunsuspecting victims. Judges had almost limitless discretion in \nsentencing within a broad range. Sentences imposed depended much more \non which judge was giving the sentence than the nature of the offense \nor the criminal history of the offender. Parole and excessive judicial \ndiscretion led to unwarranted disparities in sentencing.\n  And so in 1984 Congress changed how Federal sentencing operated. We \nadopted truth in sentencing. We added certainty by abolishing parole. \nNow Federal sentences given are the time that is served. Disparities \ndue to parole boards were eliminated. Sentencing guidelines were \nestablished. They reflected the nature of the criminal offense and the \ncriminal history of the offender. Those guidelines were normally \nbinding on any Federal judge in the country. So no longer would \nsentences turn on which judge a criminal appeared before.\n  The guidelines eliminated other disparities as well. Judges could not \nconsider factors that often led to wealthier defendants receiving \nshorter sentences for similar crimes than less wealthy defendants. \nRacial bias in sentencing, conscious or unconscious, also was addressed \nthrough mandatory guidelines. The legislation was passed by wide \nbipartisan majorities. Nearly everyone agreed that some judges were too \nlenient in sentencing and that the excessive discretion they exercised \nproduced various unfair disparities.\n  Congress, separate from the sentencing guidelines, also increased the \nnumber of mandatory minimum sentences. Since then, due in part to \ntougher Federal criminal penalties, elimination of parole, increased \nnumbers of inmates, better police practices, and other factors, crime \nrates have dropped significantly.\n  However, the Supreme Court undermined the excellent sentencing \nlegislation that Congress passed. First, the Court created from whole \ncloth a novel interpretation of the Sixth Amendment.\n  Second, the Court in a 2005 case called Booker unnecessarily extended \nthat line of cases to mandatory sentencing guidelines and held them \nunconstitutional.\n  Third, rather than then strike down the guidelines, the Court rewrote \nthem. In a particularly egregious example of judicial activism, they \noverrode congressional intent and made the guidelines advisory. It was \nonly because the guidelines were clearly intended to be mandatory that \nCongress ever passed them in the first place.\n  Following Booker, Congress now has only one available tool to make \nsure that sentences are not too lenient and do not reflect unwarranted \ndisparity. That is mandatory minimum sentences.\n  Given this background, I do take issue with a number of the Attorney \nGeneral's statements.\n  I do not agree with him that prisons today ``warehouse and forget.''\n  All kinds of programs and incentives exist for prisoners today to \nimprove their behavior when they are released. Sentences can be \nshortened by completion of these programs. And I don't think that the \nsolution to a cycle that ends in incarceration is simply to incarcerate \ncriminals for less time or to jail fewer criminals.\n  For the most part, it is not the case that too many Americans go to \nprisons for too long and for no good law enforcement reason. And the \nAttorney General just is not right when he says that ``[w]idespread \nincarceration at the federal, state, and local levels is both \nineffective and unsustainable.''\n  Increased incarceration has led to less crime.\n  I do see that for the first time in 5 years the Obama administration \nhas finally found one area of Federal spending that it wants to cut: \nprisons.\n  But in the same speech, the Attorney General called on more spending \non Federal defenders.\n  I do not agree with that. Federal defenders play an important role \nand often represent defendants well. But we should be encouraging more \nprivate attorneys, at lower cost, to represent defendants against the \nGovernment. And we should consider requiring better training of these \nlawyers before they are allowed to represent defendants.\n  The Attorney General correctly notes that ``unwarranted disparities \nare far too common.'' He cited one report that shows that ``black male \noffenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those \nimposed on white males convicted of similar crimes,'' and that this is \n``shameful.'' But he overlooks the reason for those disparities. They \nexist not so much due to mandatory minimum sentences, which existed \nboth before Booker and after. In fact, Congress has reduced mandatory \nminimum sentences since Booker. Rather, the disparities are due \nprimarily to the Supreme Court's Booker decision that made the \nsentencing guidelines advisory, rather than to mandatory minimums.\n  Since that 2005 ruling, the guidelines have been applied in fewer and \nfewer cases every year. Sentences imposed now turn on which judge the \noffender appears before. And more than before, the quality of the \nlawyer and the other factors that produced disparity before the \nSentencing Reform Act are now creeping back into sentencing.\n  The sentencing commission, in that report that the Attorney General \nreferred to, tracked racial disparities in sentencing. It compared \nsentences of African-American and White males at the time the \nguidelines were still mandatory compared to today, when they are \nadvisory only. For cases overall, when the guidelines were mandatory, \nAfrican-American males served 11.5 percent longer sentences than White \nmales. Now that the guidelines are advisory, African-American men serve \n19.5 percent longer sentences than white males.\n  That is a significant difference.\n  There are various categories of crimes in which the rendering of the \nsentencing guidelines as advisory has increased disparity. For \ninstance, in firearms case, African-American men received sentences \nthat were 6 percent longer than White men when the guidelines were \nmandatory. Today, African-American men receive sentences 10 percent \nlonger than Whites for these crimes. For drug trafficking, African-\nAmerican men received sentences that were 9 percent longer than White \nmen in 2005, but since the guidelines were made advisory, they now \nreceive sentences that are 13 percent longer.\n  It is true that sentences overall are falling since the guidelines \nwere made advisory. But as the sentencing commission concluded, \n``Although sentence length for both Black male and female offenders and \nWhite male and female\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\noffenders have decreased over time, White offenders' sentence length \nhas decreased more than Black offenders' sentence length.''\n  And in considering racial disparities in the criminal justice area, \nthe race of the victims must also be considered. Despite reductions in \nhomicides nationwide in recent years to levels not seen since the \n1960s, this is not true for the number of homicides of African-\nAmericans. ``The number of black male murder victims rose more than 10 \npercent from 2000 to 2010, to 5,942 from 5,307,'' according to the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  Two areas that the Attorney General has said are criminal enforcement \npriorities also exhibit disparities. These are financial crimes and \nchild pornography possession. As I have said many times before, I wish \nthe Department would prosecute even one of the executives of the major \nfinancial firms whose criminal conduct contributed to the financial \ncrisis.\n  These two criminal fields both tend to involve White male defendants. \nToo often, the sentences imposed are too lenient. In addition, these \ncrimes do not carry mandatory minimum sentences. We should consider \nimposing mandatory minimum sentences for these offenses, both to reduce \nracial disparities and to give prosecutors additional tools to combat \nthese serious crimes. Since Booker, there have been press reports of \npeople who have been convicted of financial fraud who have received \nvery lenient sentences, far below the guidelines. That is leading to \ndisparity.\n  One report showed that there have been so many financial fraudsters \nin New York who have been sentenced merely to probation that lawyers \nfor newly convicted fraudsters have argued that to avoid disparities, \ntheir clients must also receive probation. Other press accounts have \nshown financial criminals who have persuaded judges that the financial \nbenefits these criminals have provided to needy people should be \nconsidered to lighten their sentences. No poor defendant would be able \nto reduce his sentence based on using a portion of his ill-gotten gains \nto help others.\n  Another set of defendants who in the post-Booker world have received \nvery lenient sentences is those who are convicted of child pornography \npossession. Too many judges are lenient in their sentencing. Too often \nwe are seeing that unless the defendant actually molested a child, a \njudge doesn't impose a serious punishment. More than other Federal \ncrimes, defendants in financial and child pornography cases tend to be \nWhite males. Too many judges have given these criminals only a slap on \nthe wrist. After Booker, the only way Congress can control the abuse of \ndiscretion that judges are showing in these cases is through imposition \nof a mandatory minimum sentence.\n  The Attorney General announced a new policy of not charging certain \ndefendants with crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences. That \nraises concerns. Withholding quantities of drugs from indictments may \nnot have the effect he desires, since the judge will know the quantity \nin any event when the presentencing report is received. The judge can \nstill take that into account when sentencing. Moreover, a dangerous \nprecedent may be established by not charging the greatest offense that \ncan be proved.\n  All Federal crimes now are typically prosecuted at the highest level \nthat can result in a conviction, unless a plea agreement is reached. \nThis reduces prosecutorial discretion and disparity in charging and \nsentencing. I hope that the new policy will not be applied or extended \nin a way that would increase disparity.\n  Mandatory minimum sentences are not new. The first Congress enacted \nmandatory minimum sentences in 1790.\n  Nor are they as inflexible as they are often characterized. According \nto the sentencing commission, almost half of all offenders convicted of \nan offense carrying a mandatory minimum sentence are not given such a \nsentence.\n  We hear over and over that mandatory minimum sentences are one size \nfits all. We hear that low level and first time offenders always \nreceive harsh sentences. Not so. The safety valve provision requires \njudges not to impose mandatory minimum sentences for first time, low-\nlevel, nonviolent drug offenders, who have provided all information to \nthe authorities. Mandatory minimum sentences are not imposed on many \nother offenders because they provide substantial assistance to the \ngovernment in prosecuting more serious criminals.\n  Congress in 2010 also passed legislation reducing mandatory minimum \nsentences for certain crack cocaine offenses. Contrary to standard \nrules of statutory construction, that law has been interpreted to apply \nretroactively to people who committed their crimes before enactment of \nthe law. We need to keep that in mind for any sentencing legislation we \nmight enact.\n  The combination of mandatory minimum sentences and a reduction for \nsubstantial assistance provides investigative leads against bigger \nfish. It is a benefit of mandatory minimum sentences that is not always \nappreciated. Were we to meaningfully cut back on mandatory minimums, we \nwould lose the ability to bring prosecutions against a large number of \nmajor criminals. We should always consider what crimes should carry \nmandatory minimum sentences and what the length of those sentences \nshould be. But for the reasons I have outlined, it would be a serious \nmistake to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, either wholesale or \nfor a class of drug offenses.\n  I am also troubled by a document the Attorney General released along \nwith his speech entitled, ``Smart on Crime.''\n  In that document the Department favors diversion and supervision \nrather than incarceration for what it terms low-level, non-violent \noffenders. The Department says it encourage U.S. Attorneys to use \n``best practices'' of diversion for non-violent offenders and \nsupervision for more serious offenders. The document says, ``Examples \nof eligible defendants are those charged with non-violent bank \nrobberies.'' What bank robberies does the Attorney General think are \nnon-violent? If a person hands the teller a note that says, ``I have a \ngun, hand over the money,'' but he does not actually have a gun, is \nthat a non-violent offense? No, it is not. Robbery always involves \nviolence or the threat of violence. There is no such thing as a non-\nviolent bank robbery. Those who commit that crime should go to jail, \nnot be released back into the community under supervision, as the \nDepartment is advocating.\n  There is a danger that some of what the Attorney General is proposing \nis unjustified leniency and would harm public safety.\n  Madam President, I appreciate that the Attorney General has offered \nideas on sentencing. I agree with some. Others are misguided, even \ndangerous. I will work with him where I can. But we cannot have a \nproper debate on sentencing reform without understanding how we have \nreached our current situation, why unwarranted disparities exist, and \nwhat changes in sentencing would improve rather than harm the \nsituation.\n  The Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on mandatory minimum \nsentences and proposed legislation on Wednesday. As I have stated, \nthere are some common misunderstandings on this subject. I hope that \nmore clarity will emerge as a result of the hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6513-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CROSSROADS CHURCH\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Thornton later represented New Hampshire as a representative \nto the Continental Congress, and signed the Declaration of \nIndependence. The town was named to honor Thornton for his service to \nNew Hampshire.\n  The town's population has grown to include over 2,400 residents. The \npatriotism and commitment of the people of Thornton are reflected in \npart by their record of service in defense of our Nation.\n  Notable Thornton residents include 19th century abolitionist Moses \nCheney, a conductor with the Underground Railroad, and MIT professor \nand nutritionist Nevin S. Scrimshaw.\n  Thornton is home to one of the oldest remaining meetinghouses in the \nState. Erected in 1789, the Old Town House is listed on the New \nHampshire State Register of Historic Places and serves as an enduring \nsymbol of New Hampshire's tradition of self-governance.\n  Thornton is a place that has contributed much to the life and spirit \nof the Granite State.

Madam President, as we continue our debate about \nhealth care reform, I would like to recognize an organization in \nMissouri that has been a leader in innovation in driving down the \nhealthcare costs for manufacturers and their employees. The Missouri \nAssociation of Manufacturers and their CEO, Rita Needham, have been at \nthe forefront of the debate in my State. She is committed to new \nstrategies to provide affordable health care through consortiums of \nmanufacturers that employ more than 2,100 people.\n  As an educator, human resource manager and administrator, Rita \nNeedham joined the Southwest Area Missouri Association, SAMA, in 1999 \nas community affairs director. SAMA reached out to support \nmanufacturers in the Springfield, MO area. Needham was elevated to \nexecutive director 2 years later and created a health care consortium \nwhich provided affordable health care coverage for manufacturers.\n  Rita was the driving force in obtaining a two-year waiver from the \nMissouri Department of Insurance to enable companies of all sizes to \njoin together in a pilot program to purchase group health insurance. \nBefore the consortium was created, the initial 32 companies who joined \nthe SAMA I Consortium had to buy their health insurance individually, \nbut, under the consortium, they were rated as one policy holder \ntherefore achieving significant savings. Six smaller companies who were \npart of the consortium were able to access affordable health care for \nthe first time. The consortium members were able to achieve long term \nrate stability, create large group buying power and reduce claim risk \nin response to their biggest concern--the rising costs of health care.\n  In 2006, Rita led SAMA's efforts to persuade the Missouri General \nAssembly to pass House bill 1827, landmark legislation known as the \nSAMA bill, which allowed manufacturers of all sizes the option of \npurchasing a group health plan under the consortium.\n  In 2010, the Southwest Area Manufacturers Association became the \nMissouri Association of Manufacturers, MAM, with 170 member companies \nacross the State representing 14,500 employees. Today, MAM is a strong \nvoice for manufacturing with free market positions on trade, \nregulation, tax and energy policy, education, health care and the \nenvironment.\n  Rita is planning to retire this year, but throughout her career she \nhas been a thoughtful, dedicated leader for Missouri manufacturers. I \nhave always relied on her expertise and common sense to better \nunderstand how Federal policy impacts health costs for manufacturers.\n  I wish Rita and her husband Jim a wonderful retirement. There is no \ndoubt that Rita's advocacy and smart leadership have improved the \nbusiness environment in Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6514-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAS VEGAS NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I wish to recognize the Las Vegas \nNatural History Museum and congratulate it on being awarded national \naccreditation by the American Alliance of Museums. This accreditation \nis the highest national recognition of a museum's commitment to public \nservice, professional standards, and excellence in education. This \nimportant milestone exemplifies the remarkable progress that the Las \nVegas Natural History Museum has made, and attests to the central role \nthe museum plays in educating the local community.\n  For more than 2 decades, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum has \nprovided Nevadans of all ages and from all walks of life the \nopportunity to explore the natural treasures of our past. The museum \nhas expanded the small, loaned exhibit with which it began into a \npremiere, multi-million dollar collection of wildlife and prehistoric \nexhibits. Today it offers a truly unique educational experience from \nwhich countless Nevadans have benefited.

Madam President, I wish to recognize an \noutstanding achievement by a group of hard-working students at Faith \nLutheran Junior/Senior High School in Las Vegas. The Faith Lutheran \nMock Trial team has been invited to compete in the Seventh Annual \nEmpire Invitational in New York City, and is the first ever Nevada team \nto be invited to compete in this mock trial event.\n  Faith Lutheran's mock trial program is part of the school's justice \nand advocacy program, which is designed to prepare and equip students \nfor academic and professional paths in public policy, law and advocacy. \nIt is notable achievement to be invited to the Empire Invitational \nevent, which is the only mock trial tournament in the country that \nhosts schools from Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. By competing \nin this year's tournament, Faith Lutheran's mock trial participants \nwill not only receive invaluable experience applying legal principles, \nbut they will also enhance skills that are critical to their future \nscholastic and vocational success.\n  Educational activities such as this mock trial tournament open the \ndoor to increased possibilities for young students to make a difference \nin their communities. Faith Lutheran's mock trial team serves as an \nadmirable example to aspiring students across the Silver State.\n  This special achievement is the result of many hours of teamwork, \neffort and preparation. The dedicated students and faculty who are part \nof Faith Lutheran's mock trial team should be immensely proud of the \nopportunity to represent their school, and the State of Nevada, at this \nyear's Empire Invitational. I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncommending these exceptional students, and wish them a successful and \nmemorable experience at the tournament.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6514-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6514-S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BECKY NELSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize and congratulate Becky Nelson of Sioux Falls, SD for over 38 \nyears of service with Sanford Health.\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n  In 1971, Ms. Nelson graduated from Presentation College in Aberdeen, \nSD, and began her career at Dakota Midland Hospital. In 1975, Ms. \nNelson joined Sioux Valley Hospital & Health System, which would later \nbecome Sanford Health. Starting as a critical care staff nurse, Ms. \nNelson's skill and intellect launched her into clinical leadership \npositions.\n  Today, Ms. Nelson is Sanford Health's senior vice president & chief \noperating officer, overseeing all patient care services provided by \nSanford Health's northern and southern regions, encompassing parts of \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\n  In addition to her outstanding work at Sanford Health, Ms. Nelson \nremains an active leader in the community. She has served on the First \nNational Bank board of directors as well as the Boards of the \nUniversity of Sioux Falls, Sanford Research/USD, Washington Pavilion of \nArts and Science, and the Sioux Falls Development Foundation.\n  Ms. Nelson's devotion to exceptional care will continue to benefit \nSouth Dakotans and Midwesterners long after her retirement. She is an \nexceptional role model who has a positive impact on those who cross her \npath. For example, her soon-to-be successor, Nate White, whom she is \ncurrently mentoring, commented, ``There isn't a day that goes by when \nthere isn't something I grasp onto and say, I have to remember that.' \n`` Clearly, her excellent example resonates with her peers.\n  I thank Ms. Nelson for her incalculable contributions to our \ncommunity and wish her and her husband, Dave, all the best in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6515-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6515-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/17/senate-section/article/S6515-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSMITTING THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SLOVAK \nREPUBLIC ON SOCIAL SECURITY, CONSISTING OF A PRINCIPAL AGREEMENT AND AN \n                    ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENT--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended \nby the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. \n433(e)(1)) (the ``Social Security Act''), I transmit herewith an \nAgreement on Social Security between the United States of America and \nthe Slovak Republic (the ``United States-Slovak Republic Totalization \nAgreement''). The Agreement consists of two separate instruments: a \nprincipal agreement and an administrative arrangement. The Agreement \nwas signed in Bratislava on December 10, 2012.\n  The United States-Slovak Republic Totalization Agreement is similar \nin objective to the social security totalization agreements already in \nforce with most European Union countries, Australia, Canada, Chile, \nJapan, Norway, and the Republic of Korea. Such bilateral agreements \nprovide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign \nsocial security systems to eliminate dual social security coverage and \ntaxation and to help prevent the lost benefit protection that can occur \nwhen workers divide their careers between two countries. The United \nStates-Slovak Republic Totalization Agreement contains all provisions \nmandated by section 233 of the Social Security Act and other provisions \nthat I deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233, \npursuant to section 233(c)(4) of the Social Security Act.\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nUnited States-Slovak Republic Totalization Agreement, along with a \nparagraph-by-paragraph explanation of the provisions of the principal \nagreement and administrative arrangement.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1508. A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish a program of awarding grants to owners \nor operators of water systems to increase the resiliency or \nadaptability of the systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes to the \nhydrologic conditions of a region of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, our existing water infrastructure is \ncrumbling. The longer we ignore the problem, the more it costs us. The \ntruth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. There is no need \nto lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. Our water \ninfrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; but \ntoday we must elevate these systems to the priority level they deserve.\n  Each year within my home State of Maryland I witness stark reminders \nof what cities across the Nation are facing. In July of this year, \nPrince George's County, MD, experienced a breakdown of its most \nessential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 \npeople began to fail. Mandatory water restrictions were instituted, \nlimiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense \nheat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. \nAt the National Harbor, one hotel evacuated 3,000 guests and was forced \nto cancel upcoming reservations. Included in the affected area is Joint \nBase Andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long list of \nservices, including appointments at its medical center.\n  There are incidents like this happening all across America. The \nreports are startling. They confirm what every water utility \nprofessional knows: we need massive reinvestment in our water \ninfrastructure now and over the coming decades. The Nation's drinking \nwater infrastructure--especially the underground pipes that deliver \nsafe drinking water to America's homes and businesses--is aging. Like \nmany of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the \ncountry relies, most of our buried drinking water infrastructure was \nbuilt 50 or more years ago, in the post-World War II era of rapid \ndemographic change and economic growth. Some of our systems are even \nolder; in Baltimore, where I live, many of the pipes were installed in \nthe 1800s. We need investment to deal with changing population needs \nand changing hydrological conditions. We have no other choice but to \nelevate it to a public safety priority and to take action now.\n  The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to \nhelp local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water \ninfrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing \ntoday. The bill directs the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure \nResiliency and Sustainability program. Grants will be awarded to \neligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities \nacross the country will be able to compete for Federal matching funds, \nwhich in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome \nthese threats.\n  Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure \nsystems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water \nsupply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant \nmore than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation \nbetween local communities and the Federal government. The EPA will try \nto award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible.\n  It's estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining \nwater delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a \n$206 billion increase in costs for businesses. In a worst case \nscenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the \nUnited States to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020.\n  A healthy water infrastructure system is as important to America's \neconomy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater \ninvestment has been shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference \nof Mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water \ninfrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product is increased to more than \n$6. The Department of Commerce has found that that same dollar yields \nclose to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. Every job \ncreated in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs \nelsewhere in the national economy.\n  We know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in \nthe short-term. Let us instead take a proactive approach, making \nstrategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the \ncurrent and future needs of our water systems. That is the purpose of \nthe Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1509. A bill to establish a Maritime Goods Movement User Fee and \nprovide grants for international maritime cargo improvements and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation that \nSenator Cantwell and I are introducing today to strengthen our maritime \neconomy and protect American jobs.\n  Over the past decade, we have seen increasing competition for the \nmarket share of U.S.-bound maritime goods from ports beyond our border \nto the north and to the south. In fact, among the 25 largest North \nAmerican ports, the fastest growing in 2012 were the Port of Prince \nRupert in Canada and the Port of Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico. Instead of \nU.S.-bound cargo creating economic growth here at home by entering at \nU.S. ports, we are witnessing it being diverted through Canadian and \nMexican ports. This loss of cargo shipments leads to decreased activity \nand capacity at American ports. In our home State alone, more than \n200,000 jobs are tied to the activities at the Ports of Seattle and \nTacoma. With nearly 27 percent of international container cargo \npotentially at risk of moving to Canada from four West Coast ports, \nthis trend could result in significant job losses.\n  One of the main reasons for cargo diversion is the Harbor Maintenance \nTax, HMT. The HMT is a levy on imports designed to fund the operation \nand maintenance of America's large and small ports, which drives job \ncreation and strengthens America's trade economy. Unfortunately, \nshippers have been able to avoid the Harbor Maintenance Tax by shipping \ngoods through ports in Canada and Mexico and then transporting those \ngoods into the United States via truck and rail. This growing cargo \ndiversion reduces the funds available to keep our ports in operating \ncondition.\n  The loss of revenue from cargo diversion is only part of the problem. \nEqually concerning is the fact that only half of the tax revenue \ncollected is being spent, even though ports across the country are in \ndesperate need of additional maintenance funding. As of 2011,\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\nthe balance of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, HMTF, which is funded \nby the HMT, had a surplus of more than $6.4 billion, and it continues \nto grow. Furthermore, of the funds allocated through the HMTF, the \nbalance is rarely spent on operations and maintenance at West Coast \nports, where a significant amount of the tax revenue is generated. Our \ntwo largest ports in Washington--Seattle and Tacoma--generate, on \naverage, close to seven percent of the funding for the HMTF, but each \nreceived just over a penny for every dollar collected from shippers who \npay the HMT in Seattle and Tacoma. We believe that we must work to \naddress the issue of cargo diversion as well as ensure that the funds \ncollected are allocated fully and more equitably to meet our nationwide \nharbor and waterway needs.\n  To remain competitive in an international marketplace, we need a \nlong-term plan to grow and support infrastructure development, and \nreforming the Harbor Maintenance Tax is a commonsense place to start. \nThat is why we are proud to introduce the Maritime Goods Movement Act \nfor the 21st Century. The legislation addresses threats to America's \nmaritime economy by repealing the Harbor Maintenance Tax and replacing \nit with the Maritime Goods Movement User Fee. The proceeds of which \nwould be fully available to Congress to provide for port operation and \nmaintenance. This would nearly double the amount of funds available for \nAmerican ports, which will help our economy thrive.\n  The bill ensures that shippers cannot avoid the Maritime Goods \nMovement User Fee by using ports in Canada and Mexico.\n  The legislation sets aside a portion of the user fee for critical \nlow-use ports that are at a competitive disadvantage for Federal \nfunding compared to large ports.\n  Lastly, the bill creates a competitive grant program using a \npercentage of the proceeds of the user fee to help make improvements to \nthe intermodal transportation system of the United States so that goods \ncan more efficiently reach their intended destinations.\n  The HMT simply is not being collected or spent in a way that ensures \nAmerican ports can continue to compete on a level playing field. Our \nlegislation works to address these inequalities and enhance our \neconomic competitiveness abroad while supporting good jobs here in the \nUnited States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COBURN (for himself, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Paul, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Heller, Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1510. A bill to provide for auditable financial statements for the \nDepartment of Defense, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this bill, the Audit the Pentagon Act of \n2013, sharpens the teeth of the appropriations and accountability \nclause in the Constitution, article I, section 9, clause 7, which says:\n\n       No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \n     public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  The intent of this clause is simple: Congress cannot possibly know \nthat the executive branch is obeying the first part of the \nappropriations clause--spending--of the Constitution without confidence \nin the second--accountability. The decades-long failure by the Pentagon \nto comply with existing Federal financial management laws is against \nthe very spirit of the Constitution--our Founding Fathers demanded that \nthose spending taxpayer dollars are accountable to taxpayers.\n  The Pentagon's financial management problems are intimately related \nto the problems of waste at the Pentagon and the budget crisis that has \ncreated sequestration. Currently, neither Pentagon leaders, nor \nCongressional members can consistently and reliably identify what our \ndefense programs cost, will cost in the future, or even what they \nreally cost in the past. When the Pentagon doesn't know itself and \ncan't tell Congress how it is spending money, good programs face cuts \nalong with wasteful programs, which is the situation in which we find \nourselves today under sequestration. Unreliable financial management \ninformation makes it impossible to link the consequences of past \ndecisions to the defense budget or to measure whether the activities of \nthe Defense Department are meeting the military requirements set for \nit. Passing a financial audit is a critical step that will protect \nvital priorities and help the Pentagon comply with current law and our \nConstitution.\n  The problem is clear: if the Pentagon doesn't know how it spends its \nmoney, Congress doesn't really know how DOD is spending its money. This \nincomprehensible condition has been documented in hundreds of reports \nover three decades from both the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nand the Department's own inspector general (DOD IG).\n  Our current Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel knows that this is a \nproblem. In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee he said \nthat the Pentagon needs ``auditable statements, both to improve the \nquality of our financial information and to reassure the public, and \nthe Congress, that we are good stewards of public funds.'' Secretary \nHagel agrees that the Pentagon must audit the Pentagon and says, ``Our \nnext goal is audit-ready budget statements by the end of 2014 . . . I \nstrongly support this initiative and will do everything I can to \nfulfill this commitment.''\n  For far too long, Congress has abdicated its constitutional role and \nits duty to the taxpayers by choosing not to hold DOD accountable for \nthe deadlines it sets for itself, and the result has been continued \nmissed deadlines and wasteful, non-value added spending. Past efforts \nto make the Pentagon comply with the law by passing additional laws \nwith no teeth has not worked--the Pentagon simply ignores the laws \nbecause it suffers no consequences. The result is that unlike every \nother major Federal department, the Pentagon continues to fail at their \nrequirement and responsibility to report to Congress and the American \npeople that it can show where the hundreds of billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer money goes. I hope my fellow Senators will join me in \nsupporting this bill for auditable financial statements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1511. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to remove barriers to the adoption of children in foster care \nthrough reauthorization and improvement of the adoption incentives \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, throughout my career in the Senate, I \nhave been proud to fight tirelessly for policies that will help \nvulnerable children in our foster care system find the permanent homes \nthey need and deserve. I have been very proud of the Finance \nCommittee's bipartisan work over the years to encourage adoption and \nenhance child welfare services for our most vulnerable children. That \nwork would not have been possible without the commitment of Chairman \nBaucus, as well as my other colleagues that I have been so proud to \nwork with over the years. Our goal has always been to improve our \nFederal laws related to adoption and foster care, so that every child \nhas an opportunity to have a loving, safe home and a successful future.\n  To build on our history of encouraging safe and stable families, \nSenator Casey and I are introducing the Removing Barriers to Adoption \nand Supporting Families Act of 2013. This legislation outlines our \nvision for a path to increase the number of successful adoptions from \nfoster care in our country. Doing so, we believe, can improve the lives \nof the hundreds of thousands of children in our foster care system.\n  This legislation encourages safe and stable families, and takes a \nnumber of important steps forward to ensure that permanency is \nparamount for children in our foster care system.\n  First, the legislation puts incentives in place to help encourage \ninterstate adoptions, creating a shared incentive for states that work \ntogether to connect children in foster care with families who are ready \nand willing to provide loving homes, but who happen to live across \nstate lines. It also helps facilitate interstate adoptions further\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\nthrough better data tracking and development of national standards for \nhome studies, a requirement before a child can be adopted.\n  Second, the bill aims to establish permanency for youth by \neliminating long-term foster care as a goal for children under 17. We \nalso request a study to learn more about why long-term foster care has \nbeen set as a goal for some youth. We believe the study will further \ninform our overall goal of connecting these children to permanent \nfamilies and caring adults. But, simply put, we believe permanent \nfoster care should not be a goal for children who are younger than 17.\n  Third, this legislation dedicates funding to post-adoption and post-\npermanency support services for children who are adopted, or are \npermanently in the care of a relative or guardian. This is an important \nstep to make sure that families receive support after a child becomes a \nfamily member and, more broadly, can help make sure more adoptions and \npermanent placements are successful. Additionally, the legislation \nrequires states to engage in public-private partnerships and enhanced \nstrategies to find more permanent placements for older youth who are \nmost at risk of aging out of foster care. Among our foster care \npopulation, these are some of our most vulnerable and valuable young \npeople who are most in need of guidance and a loving, nurturing home.\n  Finally, this legislation would do more to keep siblings together \nafter they are removed from an unsafe home. The bond between siblings \nis unique and often an important source of stability for children. \nUnfortunately, once a child joins a permanent home through adoption, \nthere are sometimes barriers to maintaining sibling relationships under \ncurrent Federal law. Our legislation helps to remove these barriers by \nstrengthening the opportunities for sibling relationships and joint \nplacement, and making sure that the parents of siblings are given \nnotice if their brother or sister enters foster care.\n  Our legislation lays out an important vision for how we can improve \nadoption and foster care in our country. Adoptions from foster care \nhave increased in recent years, which means that more families are \nstepping up to adopt children who are in vulnerable situations through \nno fault of their own. But, we have far more to do to ensure that every \nchild in foster care has this opportunity. I am extremely grateful to \nmany of the adoption advocates, including the Congressional Coalition \non Adoption Institute, Voice for Adoption, and Listening to Parents, \namong others, who have been so instrumental in developing \nrecommendations and moving this and other related proposals forward.\n  Together, we can make great strides toward improving opportunities \nfor the nearly 400,000 children in foster care, of which 102,000 are \nwaiting to find forever families through adoption. New data from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services on adoption and foster care \nsuggests that while the number of children in foster care remains \nsteady, the adoption rate continues to climb. Last year alone, 52,000 \nchildren were adopted from foster care and for each of those children, \nbeing adopted is a positive, affirming, and life-changing event. \nThrough our work, we can provide more of these opportunities for \nchildren in foster care, and set them up to have successful lives with \nforever families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1514.

In addition to \n     influences on mental disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and \n     alcoholism, unemployment is also an important risk factor in \n     cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life \n     expectancy.'';\n       (F) according to the National Center for Health Statistics, \n     ``children in poor families were four times as likely to be \n     in fair or poor health as children that were not poor'';\n       (G) any major decision that would cost the economy of the \n     United States millions of dollars and lead to serious \n     negative health effects for the people of the United States \n     should be debated and explicitly authorized by Congress, not \n     approved by a Presidential memorandum or regulations; and\n       (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make United \n     States energy as clean as practicable, as quickly as \n     practicable, without increasing the cost of energy for \n     struggling families, seniors, low-income households, and \n     small businesses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that--\n       (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-income households, \n     and small businesses do not experience skyrocketing \n     electricity bills and joblessness;\n       (B) to protect the people of the United States, \n     particularly families, seniors, and children, from the \n     serious negative health effects of joblessness;\n       (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to develop and \n     authorize an appropriate mechanism to address the energy \n     needs of the United States and the potential challenges posed \n     by severe weather; and\n       (D) to restore the legislative process and congressional \n     authority over the energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not \n     promulgate any regulation relating to power sector carbon \n     pollution standards or any substantially similar regulation \n     on or after June 25, 2013, unless that regulation is \n     explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n                           TITLE II--PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 201.
