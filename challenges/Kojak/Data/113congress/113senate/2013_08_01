SCHIAPPA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning I wish to say a few words \nabout somebody who will not be around when we get back after the \nrecess. After nearly 30 years of service, Dave Schiappa is hanging up \nhis cleats. Dave is not exactly a household name. I think he likes it \nthat way, but there is no question to those who work here day in and \nday out that nobody is more essential to the running of this place than \nDave. To the extent we get anything done around here, it is largely \nbecause of Dave. To the extent we are not getting into shouting matches \nand food fights the rest of the time, well, that is largely thanks to \nDave too. He has been the glue and he has been the grease that keeps \nthis place functioning and we are really going to miss him.\n  As Secretary for the Republican majority and minority under three \ndifferent leadership offices, Dave has been the eyes and ears on the \nfloor for Republican leaders going back more than a decade. He has also \nbeen our chief diplomat to the other side. He has answered a million \nquestions from all of us at all hours, always with the same tact, \nwicked sense of humor, and sharp mind that has made him not just an \nindispensable help to our conference but also the kind of guy we just \nlike having around this place. I know I am speaking for everybody when \nI say that.\n  When I announced Dave's departure to the leadership team earlier this \nweek, the entire room, Senators and staff, erupted in applause. I \nassure you it was not because folks were glad to see him go. There is \njust nobody you would rather be with, in a foxhole or just killing time \non the Senate floor, than Dave.\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n  Dave had a pretty illustrious career before he got the big office up \non the third floor. Prior to joining the Senate as a cloakroom \nassistant at the tender age of 21, legend has it he did stints as a \nbartender--that was while he was in college--and as a hot dog vendor \nout on the National Mall during summers in high school. As far as I \nknow, these are the only two jobs outside the Senate Dave has ever had. \nSomehow they turned out to be great preparation for this place. I am \nnot exactly sure why that is, but I am sure we could all come up with \nsome interesting theories about that.\n  So Dave came here right out of college, back when there were no \ncameras on the floor, just a radio. His job back then was basically to \nperform the role of play-by-play announcer, telling offices what was \nhappening out here on the floor, matching the voices with names, and \njust letting everybody know where things stood at all times. I wanted \nto have a poster out here with a photo of Dave from those days, but all \nthe photos have mysteriously somehow disappeared. Someone suggested it \nmight have something to do with the fact that Dave sported a pretty \nserious eighties mustache back then. Maybe Cheryl can dig up that good \nphoto from the family collection.\n\n  In 1994, Dave moved out of the cloakroom and onto the floor as \nRepublican floor assistant. Two years after that, he was named \nAssistant Secretary for the majority and 2 weeks before 9/11, in August \n2001, Senator Lott named him Secretary for the majority. Since then, \nthe two parties have swung back and forth a couple of times, but Dave \nhas been one of the constants--smoothing out all the rough edges during \na thousand legislative fights, providing indispensable strategic advice \nto me and to the rest of our conference, and just generally keeping \neverybody on both sides informed of everything that is going on out \nhere.\n  It is not easy. It is not easy telling Senators they will not get an \namendment they have been fighting for or that they have to wait. But \nDave has always had the perfect temperament for that job.\n  Nobody on Earth--nobody--knows more about Senate precedent and \nprocedure than Dave Schiappa, and nobody wears their knowledge and \nskill more lightly.\n  So we are going to miss him a lot. We will all miss his ``Davisms,'' \nwhether he is reporting that some Senator just showed up in the \ncloakroom ``in a three-point stance'' or that the week is shaping up to \nbe a ``nothing burger.'' Those are Davisms.\n  He will take some secrets, hopefully, with him. It will forever \nremain a mystery, for example, how Dave stuffs all of those cards into \nhis suit coat pocket. Ask Dave a question about anything and he will \nhave the answer written on some card inside his coat. The secrets of \nthe Senate are contained on those cards.\n  They say there are no indispensable men, though many of us have long \nsuspected that Dave is the exception. I guess we will soon find out.\n  Dave, thanks for all you have done for all of us and for your \ndevotion to the institution. I know how much the Senate means to you \npersonally and we all appreciate how much you have given to it over the \nyears. Some folks complain about the hours and the unpredictable \nschedule around here, but Dave has us all beat. He is not only here \nwhenever we are, he is here after the lights go out, finishing up the \nbusiness of the day, sending out e-mails, tying up loose ends or \n``loose tarps,'' as he might put it. We are all glad you will finally \nhave a little predictability in your life.\n  Which brings me to my last point which is almost, actually, the most \nimportant. Nobody who has a family can handle this place without an \nunderstanding spouse. So I want to thank Cheryl for putting up with \nthis place over the last 23 years. Dave tells the story that early on \nin their marriage, Cheryl got Dave tickets to a show at the Kennedy \nCenter for his birthday. When he called to tell her something had come \nup and he couldn't make it, she didn't know what he was talking about. \nDave explained that he was stuck and there just wasn't anything he \ncould do about it; it is just how the Senate works. It was the last \ntime she questioned his job or his schedule.\n  So as much as I am here to thank Dave today, I want to thank Cheryl. \nI want Cheryl to know we are grateful to her for all the sacrifices she \nhas made over the years for Dave and their family.\n  Ask Dave why he has been here so long and he will tell you it is the \npeople, but the truth is Dave is one of the best this place has ever \nseen. I have no doubt about it.\n  Dave, on behalf of the entire Senate family, thanks for everything. \nYou will be missed.\n  I see my friend the majority leader. Let me call up a resolution \nbefore his comments and then we will move on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6142-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6142-S6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING DAVID J. SCHIAPPA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 212 and for the clerk \nto read the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 212) commending David J. Schiappa:\n\n                              S. Res. 212\n\n       Whereas, David Schiappa has loyally served the Senate for \n     29 years, his entire professional career, starting in the \n     Senate in December 1984;\n       Whereas, David Schiappa grew up in Maryland and graduated \n     from DaMatha Catholic High School, the University of \n     Maryland, and Johns Hopkins University;\n       Whereas, David Schiappa rose through all the positions in \n     the Republican Cloakroom finally serving as either Secretary \n     for the Majority or Secretary for the Minority for the last \n     three Republican Leaders;\n       Whereas, David Schiappa has at all times discharged the \n     duties of his office with great dedication, diligence, and \n     sense of service, thus earning the respect of Republican and \n     Democratic Senators alike, as well as their staffs; and\n       Whereas, his good humor, storytelling ability, and easy-\n     going manner have made him an invaluable member of the Senate \n     family: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its appreciation to \n     David Schiappa and his family and commends him for his \n     outstanding and faithful service to the Senate.\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     resolution to David J. Schiappa.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  (Laughter.)\n  I will withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 212) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. President, when I learned David Schiappa was going to leave, I \nhad a brief conversation with him at the back of the Chamber. I am not \nvery much for being emotional, but if ever there was a time I felt like \nshedding a tear, it was when I said goodbye to Dave Schiappa.\n  ``Parting is such sweet sorrow,'' and it really is. It is from \nShakespeare:\n\n       ``Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow.''\n\n  And it really is.\n  If you are looking for someone who is a true Washington insider, you \nneed look no further than Dave. He was actually born in Washington, DC, \nand for a quarter of a century he has made the trains run on time in \nthe Republican cloakroom. For 13 of those years he served as the \nRepublican secretary. He has been the secretary, as the Republican \nleader mentioned, when the Republicans held the majority and the \nminority.\n  Regardless of who controlled this Chamber, my observation was that he \nhas always managed the floor with integrity and an even temper. He has \nbeen a real pleasure to work with. When Gary, his counterpart, wasn't \naround, I would go to Dave and ask him questions. I never had any \nconcern about the answer because he would always tell me the truth. \nSometimes I didn't like to hear the truth, but he was always very \nforthright and candid.\n  No matter how bad things got on the floor between Members, Dave and \nhis Democratic counterpart Gary Myrick were always looking for a path \nforward. Gary Myrick has been so important to this body, along with \nDave.\n  How these staff members love their jobs. I try to tell people about \nmy staff,\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\nand about the Senate staff in general. They do this because it is \npublic service. He has put in 20 years--longer than 20 years. He is 50 \nyears old and moving on to another career. I understand his doing that \nfor himself and his family.\n  Gary Myrick has been my chief of staff. He ran my office. He loved \nthis floor very much. This was always his dream job even though on \npaper he was a big shot by being the Democratic leader's chief of \nstaff, but that is not what he wanted to do. He wanted to come to the \nSenate floor where he was raised in his employment. He knew this was \nthe job that he wanted, and he told me that. I arranged things so he \nwould come and be the secretary to the majority here.\n  Gary Myrick and David Schiappa were literally always looking for a \nway forward. They sorted through what I wanted, what the Republican \nleader wanted, and what Members wanted. They didn't always arrive at \nthe conclusion the Republican leader or I wanted because sometimes that \nwasn't possible, but they worked through long hard days--and even \nlonger nights--as well as holidays and birthdays. He has a friendly \ndemeanor--Gary is not nearly as friendly as Dave but is just as \neffective.\n  They worked so well together. They are a team. Some day, when the \nhistory of this institution is written, they will have to talk about \nthese two good men who made this place work through some of the most \ndifficult times this body has ever seen.\n  He will be missed by Democrats and Republicans alike, and that is the \ntruth.\n  In all of the times we talked--and we talked about important things \nmost of the time. I understand he and Gary have been working together \nsince the 1980s, and they are supposedly great storytellers--one and \nall. They have been known to talk for hours on end. They would \ndisappear, and when Gary came back, we would ask: What did you talk \nabout? And Gary would say--and I want to make sure I get this right--\n``I have no idea.'' But that was only a way of covering for both of \nthem because they were so candid and forthright with each other. They \nalways have been, and they would never ever divulge anything I was \ndoing or going to do or anything Leader McConnell was going to do or \nhad done. They were absolutely confidential in their communications \nwith each other. That is how they trusted each other. So when Gary \nsaid, ``I have no idea,'' he knew every idea, but he wasn't going to \ntell me what they talked about.\n  They are two such fine men. Even though there were difficult \nsituations where they found themselves forced to talk, I am sure time \npassed quickly because they are such good people.\n  I know David will be successful at whatever he does. I congratulate \nhim and thank him for three decades of valued service to the United \nStates Senate and to our country.\n  I wish him, his wife Cheryl, and his children Aly and Mason--by the \nway, that is my middle name--happiness. I mean it when I say: Parting \nis such sweet sorrow.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am both saddened and heartened by the \ndeparture of Dave Schiappa from the Senate family.\n  I share the sadness felt on both sides of the aisle that the Senate \nis going to lose a valuable, dedicated, and inspiring resource.\n  I am heartened to know, without doubt, that Dave will move on to \npursuits in which everyone around him will benefit from his productive \npresence. I am heartened to think, also, that his family might be able \nto see him a bit more often.\n  Dave's work in the Senate involves a challenging schedule, often \ninvolving brutal hours. He is often here morning, noon, and night--and \nsometimes overnight--helping to ensure that the Senate operates. With \nDave at the helm, the operations are smooth, predictable, and \ndisciplined. When things go smooth, as they normally do with Dave \naround, rest assured that much of that is the direct cause of Dave's \ntireless work and devotion.\n  Amazingly, with all of his tireless devotion, Dave always has a \npositive and uplifting disposition, and is always a pleasure to be \naround. Whether it is idle friendly chat, or discussions of Senate-rule \nintricacies, discourse with Dave always leaves you in a better place.\n  As Leaders McConnell and Reid and many others have attested, Dave \nalways tells you the truth and is a straight-shooter, whether you like \nit or not. He tells the truth to any Senator on the floor, no matter \nwhat side of the aisle. That is what has helped the Senate work \nsmoothly for the many years Dave has been at the steering wheel on our \nside.\n  Dave's tenure in the Senate began almost 30 years ago when he began \nworking in the cloakroom. Since those earlier days, he has moved up the \nranks to be one of the few people around here who understands all of \nthe intricacies of the Senate, and he uses that understanding to help \nall of us and to make this place work. Dave is ending his illustrious \nSenate career with more Senate years under his belt than most Senators \nhe works with on the floor.\n  Dave Schiappa has been a true treasure for me, for the Senate, and \nfor the American people. The Senate is losing a valuable resource, and \nI am sad to see him go. I, and I am sure all of my colleagues, wish \nDave and his family all the very best, and I am confident that in \nwhatever Dave chooses in his future endeavors, we will continue to see \nnothing but the very best from him.\n  When people talk about America's best and brightest, they refer to \nfolks like Dave who is truly one of our best and brightest.\n  In addition to thanking Dave for his counsel, camaraderie, guidance, \nand hard work, I also would like to give sincere thanks to Dave's wife \nand family. They have endured the often-grueling schedule demanded by \nSenate hours, which for Dave often stretches well before and well after \nwhen the Senate is actually in session. We owe Dave's family an \nenormous amount of gratitude for the time demands that the Senate has \nplaced on them.\n  I am going to miss Dave Schiappa, as will the entire Senate as a \ncollection of people and as an institution which Dave has nurtured and \npreserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6143-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING ROHIT KUMAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

We \nrank-and-file Senators feel the same way on both sides of the aisle.\n  I was reminded that the late Alex Haley, the author of ``Roots,'' \nonce said: ``When an old person dies, it's like a library burning \ndown.'' Dave is neither old nor dying, but there is some similarity in \nwhat is happening. With his leaving after 30 years, a number of volumes \nfrom the Senate library are going out the door. We won't have that \nwisdom, that experience, or that knowledge that has been so valuable to\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\nus, and that has been especially important to the Senate where nearly \nhalf the Members are in their first term. This is an institution that \ndepends on precedent, understanding, and respect of its strengths over \na long period of time.\n  I had a chance to work with Dave at the request of Senator McConnell \nat the beginning of the last two Congresses to work on the Senate \nrules. In working with Dave and with Gary, what I found was they were \nrepresenting our point of view, but they also had such a love of the \ninstitution, they wanted to make sure whatever we came up with enhanced \nit, strengthened it, and didn't destroy it.\n  We wish Dave the best. We have admired his service and his \nfriendship, and we hope that over the next few years he will allow us \nto bring those volumes of wisdom, knowledge, and experience back \nbecause occasionally we may need to read them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to join my \ncolleagues in wishing Dave Schiappa well in his next adventure in life, \nand I know he will be successful and also build upon his knowledge and \nexperience here in the Senate. I know his contributions will continue, \nand it will be a pleasure to continue to follow Dave in his career, \nnoncareer, or long vacation. Whatever he chooses to do will be happy \nand rewarding as has his tenure here in the Senate.\n  No one is more respected or more appreciated than David Schiappa. So \nis it a sad day, in many ways, to see him leave, but a happy one to \nknow he is going to begin a new era. We will watch him closely and stay \nin touch with him and continue to appreciate him throughout his career.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to add to the comments. In \nWyoming we have what is called the code of the West. While Dave \nSchiappa may be the man of Washington, he abides by the code of the \nWest. There are 10 points, and I won't name them all, but it is to live \neach day with courage, take pride in your work--and we see that year \nafter year--do what needs to be done, if you make a promise, keep it. \nWe also say ride for the brand.\n  Finally, we say--and this really applies to David--it is: Speak less \nand say more. When he speaks, we all listen, just like the old EF \nHutton commercial. But he does epitomize what we look to in terms of \nleadership, and his guidance has been so wonderful for all of us. So I \nwanted to rise from the West to say that David Schiappa has done a \nremarkable job for all of us, both parties, and a wonderful job for \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6144-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6144-S6145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, many of us will be leaving in the next \nday or so and heading to States across the country. As we travel across \nour States, we will be listening to our constituents and hearing what \nis on their minds.\n  One of the things I hear about every weekend in Wyoming is that \npeople are concerned about the President's health care law, and \nspecifically how the law affects their lives, their families, and their \njobs. People all across Wyoming--and I believe all across the country--\nare angry. They are angry that the White House is unfairly giving \nemployers a 1-year delay in the mandate to offer insurance but did not \ndelay the individual mandate that says every American must buy or hold \nWashington-approved insurance. For many of these people this is very \nexpensive insurance.\n  Instead of granting a permanent delay or helping all Americans, \nPresident Obama and his supporters are trying to convince the American \npeople that this health care law is working fine. Once again, the Obama \nadministration is lecturing the American people instead of listening to \nthe American people. They think if they give more speeches and deliver \nmore sales pitches the American people will finally like this law. It \nis not going to happen.\n  Look at how far the Obama administration is willing to go with its \nlatest sales pitch. Last week CNN reported the administration called \ntogether a bunch of Hollywood celebrities to help convince young \nAmericans to buy expensive health coverage. The youth of America are \nnot going to fall for it. Even though many of these Hollywood stars are \ngreat actors who always remember their lines, young Americans \nunderstand that ObamaCare is the wrong script for America. Even though \nsome of these stars deliver funny jokes on ``Saturday Night Live,'' \nthey are about to find out that this health care law is no laughing \nmatter.\n  In fact, Americans of all ages believe the law is unworkable, \nunaffordable, and deeply unpopular. They are also finding out it is \nunfair, and that is what CBS found out last week. They did a poll. They \nfound that 54 percent of Americans disapprove of the law. They also \nfound that only 13 percent of the people say the law will actually help \nthem personally. Three times as many Americans in the poll believe the \nlaw will hurt them personally. Three times as many people believe the \nlaw will hurt them personally than the people it will help. So over the \nnext couple of months the American people can expect a barrage of \nadvertising.\n  There was a big story about it today in the New York Times. Musicians \nare playing songs on the west coast and trying to get people to sign up \nfor the exchanges. It was all aimed at trying to distract the American \npeople from the health care train wreck that is coming.\n  According to the Associated Press, at least $684 million will be \nspent nationally on publicity, marketing, and advertising for the law. \nThe Washington Post found that the States will be running ads not just \non TV and radio--and you are not going to believe this--they are also \nputting slogans on coffee cups, on airplanes flying banners across \nbeaches, and even, believe it or not, on portable toilets at a cost of \nnearly $700 million. It is a windfall for advertising agencies and a \nhard sell for hard-working taxpayers.\n  The administration is picking the pockets of the American people for \nadvertising while the health care law is shrinking the paychecks of the \npeople who can only find part-time work.\n  Speaking of part-time workers, I wish to talk about a new story that \nis out that demonstrates the height of hypocrisy surrounding the \nPresident's health care law. Frankly, the story is so outrageous that \nit is one of those things a person can't make up. The headline of the \narticle reads ``Half of Affordable Care Act call center jobs will be \npart-time.'' Here are the details.\n  The article is about a new call center in Contra Costa County, CA. \nThis is part of the effort to have so-called navigators who will answer \nAmericans' questions about the health care law. The call center ran ads \nfor more than 200 jobs that said all of these jobs would be full time. \nThat is what people are looking for in America--full-time jobs, full-\ntime work. But once the new workers started training, some of them got \na different story. They found out that they would actually be part-time \nemployees with no health benefits.\n  Let me emphasize that point. Even the ObamaCare navigators are not \ngoing to be covered by the health care law and are not going to be \nprovided health care. Even some of the navigators will not know how \nthey can get affordable health care coverage even though they are the \nones who are supposed to be giving advice to Americans. Some navigators \nare being forced to work part time because the company cannot afford to \nprovide the expensive government-mandated, government-approved \ninsurance they are supposed to teach others how to get. It turns out \nthe ObamaCare navigators need their own ObamaCare navigators.\n  The article even quotes one worker saying, ``What's really ironic is \nworking for a call center and trying to help people get health care, \nbut we can't afford it ourselves.'' That is what this\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\nadministration has done to this country. I don't call that ironic; I \ncall it outrageous.\n  So the question is, Who are the navigators going to call for help and \nhow are they going to answer Americans' questions when many of them \ndon't know how they are personally going to be able to afford the \nhealth care coverage the government and the President of the United \nStates mandate they have?\n  The bad news is this story is only one of many new examples of \nhypocrisy recently surrounding the President's health care law. Week \nafter week we have seen labor unions--one after another--that \noriginally supported the law now express concerns about how the health \ncare law will impact their members' access to care. Late last week we \neven heard from something called the National Treasury Employees Union. \nIt is important to know that this union represents most of the IRS \nworkers--the 100,000 IRS workers--who are going to be enforcing the \nhealth care law. What about these IRS workers? What are they saying? \nWell, it turns out the IRS employee union said they are very concerned \nthey might actually have to buy their own health insurance in the \nexchanges, just as other Americans will. These are the exact same IRS \nagents who will collect massive amounts of data--personal data--on \npeople's individual lives and their health care choices. They will \ninvestigate whether people have the right coverage. They will apply the \ntax penalties to anyone who doesn't. These are the agents who now say \nthey want no part of the health care law's exchanges for themselves. \nThey actually have sample letters the union has sent to the IRS agents \nto send to Members of Congress to say: I am one of your constituents, \nand we don't want it to apply to us, and we want to hear back.\n  This health care law is bad for all Americans. Each of those stories \ndemonstrates again that the President's health care law is \nfundamentally broken. Instead of spending the rest of the summer trying \nto sell an expensive failing product, the President should simply \nlisten. He should listen to young people who are about to see their \npremiums soar. He should listen to ObamaCare navigators who can't find \naffordable health care. He should listen to the IRS agents who enforce \nthe law and who don't want to live under the law. He should listen to \nthe American people and what they have to say about the high costs of \ntheir health insurance coverage. He should listen to what Americans \nhave to say about how hard it is to find a doctor who will take care of \nthem.\n  Front-page story: So many people on Medicare cannot get a doctor to \ntake care of them. Why? Because of the health care law. Twenty percent \nof family physicians in this country--this story was reported in the \nWall Street Journal--20 percent of family physicians are not taking new \nMedicare patients. Thirty-three percent are not taking new Medicaid \npatients. But a big part of the President's health care law was to \nforce people onto Medicaid--a program that is not working already.\n  The President should listen to what Americans have to say about how \nhard it is to keep their current coverage. And the President should \nlisten to what the American people have to say about trying to make \nends meet on a part-time salary--a part-time salary because of the \nhealth care law, because of the incentives of the health care law to \nknock down employees' work hours to less than 30.\n  Then the President should come back to Washington after he actually \nlistens, not lectures, and sit down with Congress--Republicans and \nDemocrats working together--and work on real solutions that will give \nAmericans what they wanted in the first place with health care. \nAmericans want the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower \ncost. These are the things that have not been provided under the health \ncare law.\n  Remember what Nancy Pelosi said: First we have to pass it to find out \nwhat is in it. The American people now know more and more what is in \nthis health care law, which is why it is even less popular today than \nit was the day it passed and why; for every American who thinks they \nwill be helped by the health care law, three Americans believe their \nlives will be made worse by the law forced through this body.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, if you come to my office in the Russell \nBuilding, you will usually be greeted by one of the young and eager \nstaffers who welcome visitors and answer the phones at the front desk. \nEvery once in a while, you will find, instead, someone with a little \nmore experience--my chief of staff, who has now about 30 years of \nSenate service in fact.\n  David Lyles often takes time to sit at the front desk and to answer \nphone calls--not during the slower, easier days of a summer recess, but \nalways, instead, when the constituent calls are the hottest and the \nheaviest. It is his way of staying connected to the flow of feedback \ncoming into the office and of letting the staff know that everybody, \nfrom the most experienced staffer to the most recent college graduate, \nis responsible for responding to the people we all serve. But it is \nalso his way of providing some relief to the pressure these young new \nstaffers are under--particularly when answering the phone calls at \nvarious times when issues are very contentious. That hands-on approach \nis emblematic of David's leadership--leadership that has meant so much \nto my work in the Senate and to me personally.\n  At the end of this week, when David Lyles retires from the Senate, we \nare going to miss his passion, his dedication, his South Carolina \nmaxims, his encyclopedic knowledge of the Senate, Civil War history, \nand also his vast knowledge of the best bicycling routes in Northern \nVirginia.\n  Nearly all of David's professional life has been in public service, \nand nearly all of that service has been spent with the aim of \nstrengthening our Nation's security and honoring our commitments to the \nmen and women of our military. Of more than 30 years of Senate service, \nmost has been spent with the Armed Services Committee, first as a \nprofessional staff member, then as deputy staff director, and from 1997 \nto 2003 as director of the Democratic staff, before agreeing to serve \nas my chief of staff in my personal office.\n  He also served earlier with the Senate Appropriations Committee, as a \ncivilian member of the Pentagon staff. and as staff director of the \n1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission--a difficult and at times \nthankless job that was nonetheless of major importance to our Nation.\n  His Armed Services Committee career even encompassed some of the most \nsignificant national security challenges of our time: the end of the \nCold War, the Persian Gulf war, the 2001 terrorist attacks, the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, as well as the immense technological changes and \nmajor budget challenges we have faced during his years here.\n  I have asked David twice to change jobs: first in 1997 when I asked \nhim to leave a brief stint in the private sector to serve as Democratic \nstaff director on the Armed Services Committee and, second, when I \nasked him to give up that position to join my personal office as the \nchief of staff.\n  I made these requests because I value his judgment, his knowledge, \nand his integrity, because I know of his love and his respect for this \ninstitution. When new staffers join our office, David will usually walk \nthem down to the Senate floor, bring them to the staff benches behind \nme along the walls, give them a chance to see in person what most have \nonly seen on C-SPAN and to share some of the mix of excitement and \nresponsibility that David still feels when he comes to this floor.\n  David once told a reporter for the Washington Post, ``I've always \nfelt that anonymity was the key to job security.'' Well, I am sorry to \nblow his cover, but David's outstanding career is worthy of public \npraise. He has served the American people and the\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\nSenate with great distinction. He has helped protect the men and women \nin uniform and their families. He has led the men and women in his \ncharge with patience and loyalty and modesty at times of great \nchallenge for the Senate and the Nation.\n  I am and I always will be deeply grateful to David Lyles for his wise \ncounsel, for his loyalty, for his friendship, and above all for his \nintegrity. I wish David and his wife Annie a long and happy retirement \nfull of visits with laughing grandchildren, untroubled waters to \npaddle, and smooth roads to ride.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about my \ngood friend and a great friend of this great institution who will be \nleaving us this week, Dave Schiappa.\n  I remember after I was elected in 2002 there was a transition in the \nleadership on the Republican side from Trent Lott to Senator Bill \nFrist. Trent told me one day that the first thing he told Bill Frist \nwas make sure that Dave Schiappa is going to be your floor leader, and \nthat is exactly what Bill did.\n  I was new to the Senate, did not know my way around at all, much less \nknow the rules. I simply don't know how I would have functioned over \nthe last 10 years without Dave Schiappa being here. He has been that \nvaluable to all of us as Members of the Senate. He is available, \nfrankly, to both sides of the aisle. I have heard a number of my \nDemocratic friends over the last 24 hours, since we have been aware of \nDave's departure, who have said: Gee, I don't know what I am going to \ndo without Dave Schiappa being here.\n  Our floor leaders are all so vitally important. We do reach out to \nthose Members on the other side who inform us from time to time of what \nis going on. They are always straight with us. This institution \ncouldn't operate without them.\n  Dave has certainly been our leader. He is very smart, very \nknowledgeable, and he is very hard-working. All of these folks work \nsuch long hours. They are here long after we are here, and they are \nhere well before we get here the next morning. We owe a deep debt of \ngratitude to all of them, and particularly when someone such as Dave \nSchiappa, who has been here for 28 years, makes a move on to another \nlife. It is imperative that we say: Dave, thanks for your great work. \nThanks for your inspiration to all of us.\n  Dave probably knows this institution better than any Member on the \nRepublican side, certainly. The one thing I will always remember about \nis Dave, No. 1, keeps his word. If you tell him you have an issue with \nthe bill, an issue with a nominee, or you have an amendment you wish to \ncall up, Dave takes care of you.\n  He has been so valuable to all Members of the Senate during his \ntenure. We are truly going to miss him. I know his next life will hold \ngreat things for him. He will be very successful there, and we \ncertainly wish him the best.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. We are in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6146-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6146-S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. I wish to speak briefly about ObamaCare once again. This \nis an issue that is now coming to the forefront over the next few \nweeks.\n  As we get ready to start to implement portions of it across the \ncountry, we are starting to see the implications of it.\n  There is so much coverage given to this as a partisan fight between \nRepublicans and Democrats or liberals and conservatives, but I actually \nthink this issue goes much farther than that because it is impacting \nall Americans.\n  I understand the President was here yesterday and individuals from \nthe White House as well. According to the press reports, they were here \nto reassure nervous Democrats about the implementation of ObamaCare and \nwhat it could mean.\n  I understand why people are nervous about this bill. They have the \nright to be. For example, the exchanges, health care exchanges which, \nif you can't get insurance, you are supposed to be able to go to them \nand buy health insurance, are not going as planned. Only yesterday \nthere was a news report that in Georgia they have asked for an \nemergency extension because they won't be up and running by October 1.\n  There are more news reports of more people being pushed from full-\ntime work to part-time work. The reason why is because ObamaCare says \nif a company has more than 50 employees at full-time status, there are \ncertain rules to follow that are going to cost money. We are starting \nto see evidence that people are being moved from full time to part \ntime. Some major companies are announcing that they are moving more \npeople to part time. There are reports of impending rate increases.\n  In my home State of Florida 2 days ago, the insurance commissioner \nannounced that the individual market rates, if you are buying as an \nindividual, are going to go up 30 or 40 percent.\n  We know there are many people in the middle class, hard-working \nAmericans who are happy with the health insurance coverage they have \nnow. They are probably going to lose that coverage. They are going to \nhave to go to an exchange or another company their company is now \noffering. This doesn't mean you lose only the insurance with which you \nare happy, it means you lose the doctor, potentially, because you can \nonly go to a doctor that is in the network on your insurance plan. If \nyour new insurance doesn't have that doctor, you can't keep going to \nthat doctor. There are a lot of reasons to be nervous.\n  Add to this a lot of the original supporters of this; for example, \nthe labor unions. The Teamsters came out 2 weeks ago saying they want \nthis suspended or repealed because it is breaking the promises it made \nin terms of the 40-hour workweek and the whole argument I made about \nfull time to part time.\n  Here is the irony. The labor union that represents the IRS workers is \nasking to be exempted from ObamaCare. This is ironic, because they are \nthe very workers who are in charge of enforcing the law. The people who \nare going to be in charge of enforcing ObamaCare have asked to be \nexempted from ObamaCare. There are a lot of reasons to be nervous about \nit if you are a supporter.\n  One more reason is the impact it is going to have on our insurers. We \nhaven't heard a lot of talk about this yet, but I will focus on one \ngroup of seniors in particular, and that is seniors who are on \nsomething called Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is the Medicare \nProgram where basically you contract with a private company to \nadminister your benefits under Medicare. How these companies compete \nfor your business is they add all sorts of value-added services.\n  One example is transportation. My mom is on Medicare Advantage. One \nof the reasons they get her business is that in addition to good \ndoctors, they actually will pick her up from home, because she can't \nand doesn't drive. They take her to her doctors' appointments. These \nare the kinds of benefits Medicare Advantage offers.\n\n  The problem is ObamaCare cuts about $156 billion out of Medicare \nAdvantage--not to save Medicare; it throws it into the overall budget \non ObamaCare.\n  Who uses Medicare Advantage? This is an interesting statistic: Forty \npercent of African Americans on Medicaid use Medicare Advantage, 53 \npercent of Hispanic beneficiaries who are on Medicare use Medicare \nAdvantage, and 38 percent of people on Medicare Advantage make less \nthan $30,000 a year.\n  What is the impact of taking $156 billion out of Medicare Advantage? \nIt is\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\nabout $11 billion this year alone being taken out of the Medicare \nAdvantage Program.\n  This means--and the President would say we are going to pay less \nmoney to these insurance companies. Fine. What is the impact of that? \nLet me describe to you the impact of what it is going to be.\n  First, you are going to see reductions in benefits, meaning a lot of \nthese companies are going to have to save that money somewhere. Where \nthey are going to save it is by reducing the benefits they offer you on \nMedicare Advantage.\n  For example, maybe there won't be anymore transportation in my mom's \nMedicare Advantage plan. We don't know.\n  There will be increases in copays, the amount of money seniors are \ngoing to have to pay every time they go to the doctor or hospital. They \nare going to have to tighten physician networks, which means the number \nof doctors available is going to shrink. If you have a doctor now who \nhas been seeing you, and he or she gets kicked out of the network \nbecause they are tightening the network, you may not be able to keep \ngoing to the same doctor. That is the disruption it has.\n  One study found that by 2017, seniors on Medicare Advantage could \nlose on an average about $1,841 a year. This is the impact.\n  I will say why this is pernicious, why this hurts. Medicare Advantage \nhas some things about it that need to be fixed, but it is a good \nprogram. It has good outcomes. The fact is these companies want you to \ngo to your doctors' appointments. They want you to be getting your flu \nshots and your vaccine against pneumonia and other things. Why? Because \nthey want to you stay healthy. They need you to stay healthy in order \nfor the plan to work. We see it in the results.\n  Medicare Advantage patients have 39 percent fewer hospital \nreadmissions. When people leave the hospital, there is a 39-percent \nreduction in people who go back because something went wrong. There are \n24 percent fewer emergency room visits and 20 percent fewer hospital \ndays.\n  Medicare Advantage is the program that works. I say this firsthand \nbecause I see it in my mom's life, and I see it in the lives of \nthousands of seniors in Florida who are on Medicare Advantage.\n  You may ask yourself: Well, if this is so bad why haven't we heard \nany of this before? The reason is the insurance companies, because of a \ngag order, are prohibited from talking about any of this until you \nstart getting your benefits letter, and they are coming. If you are a \nsenior on Medicare Advantage, the chances are that soon you will open \nyour mail to the bad news that the Medicare Advantage you have and are \nhappy with has been changed in a negative way for you because of \nObamaCare. They don't know that yet, because the companies have not \nbeen allowed to tell them yet, but they will have to tell them soon. \nWhen they do, this will add one more concern that people should \nrightfully have about ObamaCare and the impact it is going to have on \nour people, particularly on seniors. This is why, my colleagues, I have \nbecome so passionate about this issue, one more reason why it is so \nimportant that we stop ObamaCare.\n  One may say what can we do to stop it? It is already the law. It is \nalready in place. A lot of people have told me this. The answer is \nthere is something we can do and it comes as soon as September. In \nSeptember, in order for this government to continue to function, we \nhave to pass a short-term budget. I wish it were a long-term budget \nthat was balanced, but it looks as though it is going to be a short-\nterm budget.\n  We should pass the budget. We have to. We can't shut down the \ngovernment. I am not for shutting down the government. When we do this \nshort-term budget, let's fund the government. Let's make sure Social \nSecurity checks go out. Let's make sure we are funding defense to keep \nour Nation safe. Let's make sure we fund the government, but let's not \nkeep funding ObamaCare. Let's not keep pouring money into a program \nthat even the unions are now against. Let's not keep pouring money into \na program that not even the IRS workers, who are going to enforce this, \nwant for themselves. Let's not keep funding this program that is going \nto hurt seniors on Medicare Advantage. Let's not keep funding it.\n  I will say what the blowback is: Oh, you are threatening to shut down \nthe government. No, I am not. I don't want to shut down the government. \nIn fact, the only people who are talking about shutting down the \ngovernment are the people who go around saying: We will not support a \nshort-term budget unless it funds ObamaCare. Those are the people who \nare threatening to shut down the government. Their position, basically, \nis that ObamaCare is so important we can't possibly fund government \nwithout funding it.\n\n  So if the government is shut down--and I hope that doesn't happen--\nbecause of ObamaCare, that is an unreasonable position, especially in \nlight of all the problems we know this program has. And this idea that \nunless we fund ObamaCare we must shut down the government is a false \nchoice. That is not true.\n  Let me just say every single Republican opposes ObamaCare. And I must \nshare with you that there are a growing number of Democrats who are at \nleast nervous about ObamaCare and would love for it to go away in some \nway, shape, or form. In fact, one of them is the President. The \nPresident has actually delayed a major portion of ObamaCare because he \nknows it is going to be a disaster.\n  I would just suggest to those who oppose ObamaCare to ask themselves \nthis question: How can I possibly go back to the people who sent me \nhere--to the people who are going to be hurt by this, to the people \nbeing moved from full-time to part-time employment, to the businesses \nthat can't grow, to the individuals who are going to lose the coverage \nthey are happy with and the doctor they have gotten to know, to the \nseniors on Medicare Advantage who are going to see their benefits \nreduced and their out-of-pocket costs go up--and say to them I did \neverything I could to prevent these things from happening? How can I \npossibly say that to them if I vote for a budget that pays for this?\n  This September gives us the last best chance to slow this down or to \nstop it. Once this law starts kicking in and starts hurting our \neconomy, we will start crossing some points of no return.\n  To my colleagues on the Republican side, I would just say: Look, if \nwe are not willing to draw a line in the sand on this issue, what issue \nare we willing to draw a line in the sand on? If we are not willing to \nfight on this issue, what issue are we willing to do it on?\n  Right now I can think of nothing that is hurting our economy and \nnothing that is hurting job creation more than the uncertainty and the \nfear this law is imposing on our small businesses, on our middle class, \non our working class, and on our seniors. I hope we will not let this \nlast best chance go by. I hope we will take this opportunity to stop \nthis law from hurting Americans, especially the millions of seniors who \nrely on Medicare Advantage for their health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6147-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 3 months ago, I noted in my statement on \nApril 18 that it had taken the Senate almost 1 year longer to confirm \n150 of President Obama's district court nominees than it took the \nSenate to confirm the same number of President Bush's district court \nnominees. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\nwe have not picked up the pace, and we remain almost 1 year behind the \nrecord we set from 2001 to 2005. Today, the Senate confirms the 200th \nof President Obama's circuit and district nominees. Thanks to Senate \nRepublicans' concerted effort to filibuster, obstruct and delay his \nmoderate judicial nominees, it took almost 1 year longer to reach this \nmilestone than it did when his Republican predecessor was serving as \nPresident--over 10 months, in fact. I have repeatedly asked Senate \nRepublicans to abandon their destructive tactics. Their continued \nunwillingness to do so shows that Senate Republicans are still focused \non obstructing this President rather than helping meet the needs of the \nAmerican people and our judiciary.\n  Earlier this month, the senior Senator from Tennessee observed that \nat the time there were only three circuit and district nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar. He said, correctly, that we could clear those three \nnominees in just one afternoon. Weeks later, we are now being permitted \nto vote on just one of those nominees. As Senator Alexander said, we \ncould very easily be voting on several others as well. There are now 12 \ncircuit and district nominees pending before the Senate. The only \nreason we are not voting on all 12 is the refusal of Senate Republicans \nto give consent. This refusal means that by the time the Senate returns \nin September, our district courts will once again be facing a period of \nwhat the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service calls \n``historically high'' vacancy levels, which they last experienced 2 \nyears ago. So the Republicans' effort to obstruct and delay the \nconfirmations of President Obama's nominees means that we have \nessentially not been permitted to make any net progress in filling \nvacancies. We have barely kept up with attrition.\n  Over the past month, some Senate Republicans have been claiming that \n``at this same point in their presidenc[ies]'' President Obama has had \nmore circuit and district nominees confirmed than President Bush did. \nOf course, these Senators fail to mention that they are referring only \nto the fifth year of those presidencies, and ignoring both presidents' \nfirst terms. Such comparisons are misleading--the reason President Bush \nhad so few confirmations in his fifth year is that we had made such \ngood progress already in his first term--but I appreciate the Ranking \nMember of the Judiciary Committee for at least being honest when he \nmakes this comparison by saying that it is between fifth years, and not \nentire Presidencies.\n  The assertion by some Senate Republicans that ``there is no \ndifference in how this President's nominees are being treated versus \nhow President Bush's nominees were treated'' is simply not supported by \nthe facts. Compared to the same point in the Bush administration, there \nhave been more nominees filibustered, fewer confirmations, and longer \nwait times for nominees, even though President Obama has nominated more \npeople and there are more vacancies. Anyone can point to this example \nor that example, but when one looks at the whole picture, it is clear \nthat President Obama's nominees have faced unprecedented delays on the \nSenate floor and that his nominees have been less likely to be \nconfirmed than President Bush's at the same point.\n  But if Senators wish to claim that there is no obstruction of the \nSenate's consideration of judicial nominees, or that we are matching or \neven exceeding the pace of confirmations from the Bush administration, \nlet us make it a reality. According to the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service, it would require 27 additional circuit and district \nconfirmations this year to reach the same number of confirmations as \nPresident Bush had achieved by the end of his fifth year in office. \nThat means we must pick up the pace, since we have had only 26 circuit \nand district confirmations so far this year, and just two confirmations \nin the past month.\n  Fortunately, the Senate had already received more than enough \njudicial nominees to make this happen. There are eight circuit and \ndistrict nominees pending on the calendar today, and another four were \nreported this morning. One of the nominees reported today is Patricia \nMillett, one of three well-qualified nominees for the vacancies on the \nD.C. Circuit. I hope Senate Republicans will end their misguided \nattempt to strip the D.C. Circuit of three seats and that we will be \nallowed to consider her nomination on the merits of the nominee. Five \nmore nominees had a hearing last week, as the Judiciary Committee \ncontinues to do its job. If we do confirm 27 more nominees this year, \nwe might even bring the number of vacancies below 70 for the first time \nin more than 4 years.\n  However, even if we do bring the number of vacancies down to 70, that \nnumber is still far too high. These vacancies impact millions of people \nall across America who depend on our Federal courts for justice. In \naddition to the 87 current vacancies, the Judicial Conference has \nidentified the need for 91 new judgeships, so that the people who live \nin the busiest districts can nonetheless have access to speedy justice. \nEarlier this week, Senator Coons and I introduced a bill to create \nthose judgeships, and I hope we can pass this long-overdue legislation \ninto law. The Nation's growing demands on our courts also shows how \nimportant it is that we reverse the senseless cuts to our legal system \nfrom sequestration. I continue to hear from judges and other legal \nprofessionals about the serious problems sequestration either has \ncaused, or will cause, if we do not fix it. Last week the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts held a hearing on \nthe impact of sequestration and highlighted how it is devastating our \npublic defender service. This was an important and timely hearing, and \nI commend Chairman Coons for chairing it.\n  Today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Raymond Chen, who is \nnominated for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit. Mr. Chen currently serves as Deputy General Counsel for \nIntellectual Property Law and Solicitor in the Office of the Solicitor \nat the United States Patent and Trademark Office, a position he has \nheld since 2008. Prior to 2008, he was an Associate Solicitor in the \nOffice of the Solicitor at the USPTO, a Technical Assistant for the \nFederal Circuit, and an Associate at Knobbe, Martens, Olson & Bear. \nBefore practicing law, Mr. Chen was a scientist at Hecker & Harriman. \nThe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave \nhim its highest rating of ``well qualified.'' Mr. Chen was reported by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee over 3 months ago by voice vote.\n  We must work to reduce the number of judicial vacancies so that \nAmericans seeking justice are not faced with delays and empty \ncourtrooms. So let us act quickly on consensus nominees. And if Senate \nRepublicans have concerns about a nominee, let us debate that nominee, \nfor however long is necessary, and then have an up-or-down vote. Eleven \nof the twelve circuit and district nominees currently pending before \nthe Senate were reported by voice vote. There is no reason we cannot \nconsider all 12 today. If Senators are willing to work together to \nfocus on meeting the needs of the Federal judiciary, then I am \nconfident that we will be able to make real progress for the millions \nof Americans who depend on our courts for justice.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                            Power Nomination\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, let me express my thanks to Senator \nSanders for his willingness to yield to me and give me this time.\n  I am here very briefly to commend Samantha Power to the entire Senate \nas President Obama's nominee to be the U.N. ambassador representing the \nUnited States.\n  I do so proudly because of the great work she has done against \ngenocide and atrocities around the world, because she has been an \noutspoken leader in terms of doing what is right, and I think she has \nthe courage to represent our country on the Security Council better \nthan anyone I know.\n  I got to know Samantha Power by reading her book, ``A Problem from \nHell: America and the Age of Genocide.'' It is the story about Rwanda \nand the genocide where 1 million people died while the rest of the \nworld turned and looked away, and her calling on all people of \ndemocracies and freedom around the world to not let that happen again.\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\n  When she came to the White House, she created the Commission on \nAtrocities for President Obama to focus on that and see to it that it \ndidn't happen again. It was through her leadership that she forced \nPresident Obama and the administration to engage in Libya and end what \nwould have been a genocide in Libya by Muammar Qadhafi.\n  She is smart, she is intelligent, she is tough, and she has a Georgia \ntie of which I am very proud. She graduated from a high school in \nDeKalb County, GA, in the 1980s called Lakeside High School. She did an \ninternship between her first and second year at Yale University in \nAtlanta, GA, for a sports broadcaster on a sports station in the city. \nHe was asked a few days after she left to give some description of what \nkind of person Samantha Power was, and I want to read that quote \nbecause it reflects the kind of person we want representing us as an \nambassador at the U.N. He said:\n\n       Oh, my God, was she bright. Acerbic, lightening-witted, and \n     the depth of the Mariana Trench.\n\n  That is a quote from Jeff Hullinger, the first person she worked for \nin 1988.\n  Samantha Power is the right person, at the right time, to represent \nthe right country in the U.N. on the Security Council. I commend her to \nthe Senate and hope she receives a unanimous vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and thank the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            The Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate hundreds and \nhundreds of young people throughout the country who are standing up for \njustice, who are putting a spotlight on one of the major economic \ncrises facing this country.\n  Today--this week and in recent weeks--we have had young people in New \nYork City, in Chicago, in Washington, DC, in St. Louis, in Kansas City, \nin Detroit, in Flint, MI, and other areas around this country who are \nfast-food workers--the people who work at Burger King and McDonald's \nand Popeye's; the ones who give us the hamburgers and the french \nfries--saying that workers all over this country cannot make it on \n$7.25 an hour, $7.50 an hour. Often they are unable even to get 40 \nhours of work and, in most cases, they get no or very limited benefits.\n  So all over the country these workers, often young people, are \nwalking out of their establishments, their fast-food places, and are \neducating consumers about the economic injustice taking place in these \nfast-food establishments. What they are saying is that we need to raise \nthe minimum wage in this country; that American workers cannot exist on \n$7.25 an hour, which is the national minimum wage now, or $8 an hour or \n$9 an hour.\n  My own view is, at the very least, we should be raising the minimum \nwage to $10 an hour. Just do the arithmetic, with somebody making $7.25 \nan hour, and if they are lucky enough to be getting 40 hours a week--\nand many workers are not.\n  I was in Detroit a couple of months ago talking to fast-food workers, \nand what they are saying is they get 20 hours a week in one place to \nmake a living and then they have to work at another place. One young \nman I talked to is working at three separate locations, having to \ntravel, in order to cobble together what, in fact, is by far less than \na livable income. So just do the arithmetic. If you make $7.25 an hour, \nand if you are lucky enough to be working 40 hours a week, you are \nmaking about $15,000 a year. Then, of course, your Social Security \ntaxes are coming out of that and your Medicare taxes are coming out of \nthat, and maybe some local taxes. You can't survive on $14,000 or \n$15,000 a year.\n  The point is these fast-food workers are educating the Nation about \nthe fact that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are working \nhard every single day and are falling further and further behind \neconomically. We have to stand with them and we have to raise the \nminimum wage in this country.\n  While workers at fast-food establishments and other places such as \nWalmart are earning the minimum wage, I should mention that the CEOs of \nthese large corporations are, in many cases, making exorbitant \ncompensation packages. The CEO of Burger King, a corporation with over \n191,000 mostly low-wage workers gave its CEO Bernardo Hees a 61-percent \npay raise last year, boosting his total compensation to $6.5 million in \n2012.\n  Well, if a millionaire can get a 65-percent pay raise, maybe it is \ntime to get a pay raise for the workers who are making $7.25 an hour.\n  Last year, McDonald's, a corporation with over 850,000 mostly low-\nwage employees, more than tripled the compensation of its CEO Don \nThompson. In 2011, Mr. Thompson received a mere, paltry $4.1 million. \nBut last year, because of his significant raise, the CEO of McDonald's \nreceived $13.8 million.\n  Well, if Mr. Thompson can make $13.8 million as the head of \nMcDonald's, surely the workers at McDonald's can make at least $10 an \nhour, not $7.25 an hour, not $8 an hour.\n\n  David Novak, the CEO of Yum! Brands--the owners of Taco Bell, Pizza \nHut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Long John Silvers--was paid $11.3 \nmillion last year and received over $44 million in stock options.\n  Well, if this company has enough money to give this gentleman $44 \nmillion in stock options, maybe we can end starvation wages at Yum! \nfoods.\n  In terms of the minimum wage, since 1968, the real value of the \nFederal minimum wage has fallen by close to 30 percent. The purchasing \npower of the minimum wage has gone down by some 30 percent since 1968. \nIf the minimum wage had kept up with inflation since 1968, it would be \nworth approximately $10.56 per hour today.\n  The issue our young people working at these fast-food places are \nhighlighting goes beyond the fast-food industry. The reality is that \nmany of the new jobs being created in America today are low-wage jobs.\n  I think we all recognize, even some of my Republican colleagues \nunderstand, we have made significant economic gains since the collapse \nof the economy at the end of President Bush's tenure in 2008 when we \nwere losing 700,000 jobs a month--an unsustainable reality, 700,000 \njobs a month. Now we are gaining jobs, and that is a good thing, but \nnot enough jobs. Unemployment remains much too high. Real unemployment \ntoday is close to 14 percent. But in the midst of understanding the job \ncreation process in this country, we need to know that nearly two-\nthirds of the jobs gained since 2009 are low-wage jobs that pay less \nthan $13.80 an hour.\n  So the good news is we are now creating some jobs--not enough jobs; \nunemployment remains much too high--but we cannot lose track of the \nfact that most of the new jobs being created are not paying working \npeople a living wage. While most of the new jobs being created are low-\nwage jobs, we should remember that nearly two-thirds of the jobs lost \nduring the Wall Street recession were middle-class jobs that paid up to \n$21 an hour. So the economic trend is not good. The Wall Street crash \nresulted in mass unemployment, and though we are gaining new jobs, many \nof the jobs we are gaining are low-wage jobs. Yet the jobs we have lost \nare higher wage jobs.\n  Also, while we discuss the state of the economy, let us never ever \nforget that middle-class families have seen their incomes go down by \nnearly $5,000 since 1999, after adjusting for inflation.\n  Opponents, and there are many--the entire fast-food industry and all \nthe big-money interests, the guys who make millions and millions of \ndollars a year, the people who have unbelievable pensions, who have all \nkinds of benefits, the CEOs--are working very hard to tell us in \nCongress not to raise the minimum wage, which is $7.25. Among many \nother arguments they say: Well, if you raise the minimum wage, it is \ngoing to be a job killer. It will kill jobs.\n  Let me say this on a personal basis. I represent the State of \nVermont. The State of Vermont has the third highest minimum wage in the \ncountry; it is $8.60 an hour. Meanwhile, with an $8.60-an-hour minimum \nwage, I am happy to say that the State of Vermont has the fourth lowest \nunemployment rate in the United States at 4.4 percent. And to be very \nhonest, I have not bumped into many employers who tell me: I would be \nhiring more people if we lowered the minimum wage in Vermont. It does \nnot happen. I think that is a bogus argument.\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n  The State of Washington, if my memory is correct, has the highest \nminimum wage in the country. Their unemployment rate is lower than the \nnational average.\n  There is another point I would like to make that needs to be made \nover and over. We talk a lot in this country about welfare reform. I \nthink that in general, when people use that expression, what they are \ntalking about is lower income people who may be breaking the law and \ntaking advantage of programs for which they are not quite eligible.\n  Let me say a word about the need for welfare reform but in a somewhat \ndifferent tone, and let me say that the biggest welfare recipient in \nthis country happens to be the wealthiest family in the United States \nof America; that is, the Walton family, who owns Walmart, a family that \nis worth $100 billion--more wealth, by the way, than the bottom 40 \npercent of the American people. The wealthiest family in America is the \nlargest welfare recipient in America. How is that? Well, the reason \nthey are so wealthy, the reason that family is worth $100 billion is \nthey make huge profits because they pay their workers starvation wages. \nBut in order to keep their workers going, the taxpayers of this \ncountry--through Medicaid, through nutrition programs, through \naffordable housing--give assistance to Walmart so that their workers \ncan keep coming to work. So somebody who works at Walmart for $7.25 or \n$8 an hour, more often than not their children are on Medicaid paid for \nby the taxpayers of this country. They and their kids are on food \nstamps paid for by the taxpayers of this country. Many of their \nemployees live in affordable housing subsidized by the taxpayers of \nthis country.\n  So the Walton family becomes the wealthiest family in this country \nwhile working-class and middle-class taxpayers provide assistance to \ntheir workers so they can continue going to work. Let me make the very \nradical suggestion that maybe the wealthiest family in America might \nwant to pay their employees a living wage so that the taxpayers of this \ncountry do not have to subsidize them.\n  I would conclude by telling those young people in major cities around \nthis country that many of us respect and appreciate the courage they \nare showing. It is not easy to walk out of a job when you don't have \nany money, because your employer may say: You are out of here; you are \nfired. But these young people have the courage to stand and say: No. We \nare human beings. We live in the greatest country on Earth. We have to \nearn a living wage. We can't make it on starvation wages.\n  So I thank those young people for standing for justice not only for \nthemselves but for all Americans, and I hope that Members of Congress \nlisten carefully to what they are saying and that we go forward as soon \nas possible in passing a minimum wage that will provide dignity for \nmillions of workers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we know what is ahead of us the next hour or \nso. I ask unanimous consent that we change that.\n  In between the vote on Chen, the judge, and the next vote, I ask that \nthere be 10 minutes, and 2 minutes of that would be 1 minute on each \nside, and 8 minutes would be given to the comanager of that bill, Susan \nCollins. That would be for debate only.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          THUD Appropriations\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have spent the last 2 weeks here on \nthe Senate floor talking about our bipartisan transportation and \nhousing bill. This is a bill that is all about creating jobs, investing \nin our families and in our communities, and laying down a strong \nfoundation for a long-term and broad-based economic growth. This bill \nis not exactly a bill I would have written on my own. I know it is not \nexactly a bill Senator Collins would have written on her own. But it is \na compromise bill that reflects the deep cuts we made when we set \nspending levels in the Budget Control Act as well as the best ideas \nfrom both sides of the aisle of ways we can improve and reform our \ntransportation and housing investment.\n  The transportation and housing investments in this bill have a direct \nimpact on the families and communities we represent, from improving our \nroads, to reducing traffic and helping Main Street businesses, to \nmaking sure our bridges are safe so we do not see more collapses like \nthe one back home in my State of Washington, to supporting our most \nvulnerable families, seniors, and veterans with a roof over their heads \nwhen they need it the most and making investments in our communities \nthat mayors across our country use to create local jobs in their \nhometowns and so much more.\n  Senator Collins and I worked very hard together to write a bipartisan \nbill to invest in programs that should not be partisan. I think we \nsucceeded. Six Republicans voted for this bill in committee; 73 \nSenators voted to bring this bill to the floor for a debate. That \ndebate was a full and open one, with amendments and votes from \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  I wish to personally thank Senator Collins for her hard work on this \nbill, and I also thank all of our staff on the appropriations \nsubcommittee: Alex Keenan, Dabney Hegg, Meaghan McCarthy, Rachel \nMilberg, and Dan Broder; as well as the staff of Senator Collins, who \nspent endless hours: Heideh Shahmoradi, Kenneth Altman, Jason Woolwine, \nand Rajat Mathur--all of whom worked so hard and put in so many hours \nand late nights on this strong bipartisan bill.\n  After 2 weeks of debate and discussion and a bipartisan bill before \nus, we are now going to move very shortly to a final vote. I want to be \nclear. This bill has the support of the majority of the caucus. In the \nHouse of Representatives, what did we see happen yesterday? They pulled \ntheir transportation and housing bill off the floor. The Republican \nleadership would not even allow a vote on their bill because they did \nnot have a majority in their caucus. The chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee said that showed that sequestration is \nunworkable and needs to be replaced. That is the House Republican \nchairman. But here in the Senate we have a majority, and we should move \nto pass this bill.\n  The only thing that can block the passage of this bill, the only way \na bipartisan bill with the support of the majority could be stopped is \nif Republican leaders whip their own Members into filibustering a jobs \nand infrastructure bill that many of those Republicans actually \nsupport. That is the only way.\n  The choice before us is clear, and I urge my colleagues to make the \nright one. This vote is not about whether you support this exact bill \nor agree with the exact spending level. As Senator Collins has made \nclear again and again, you can think the spending level is too high and \nstill support this process in which we pass a bill in the Senate and \nwork with the House bill on a compromise. You can certainly disagree \nwith the bill and not think it should be subjected to a filibuster.\n  The bottom line is that a vote to wrap up and vote on this bill is a \nvote for jobs and the economy and for bipartisan solutions to the \nproblems facing our Nation. A vote to filibuster this bill is a vote \nfor more gridlock, more obstruction, more partisanship, and more \npolitical games.\n  I know when I go home to Washington State I want to be able to tell \nmy constituents that Democrats and Republicans worked together to solve \nsome problems, help them, and grow the economy. I know there are many \nDemocrats and Republicans here today who want to be able to say the \nsame to their constituents, and I hope they will stand with me and \nSenator Collins and vote against a filibuster of our bipartisan bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                   Unaminous Consent Request--S. 101\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand today to discuss and strongly \nsupport my bill, S. 101, the State and Local Government Bailout \nPrevention Act. I urge all of us to unite to pass this bill\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\nexpeditiously. Let me briefly explain what it is about.\n  I first introduced this bill in early 2011, February 2011, because \ntwo things were happening. First of all, several significant State and \nlocal entities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. At the same \ntime, the Federal Government--things in Washington--was in a horrible \nstate fiscally, such that we could clearly not afford to take on more \nspending, more debt, more responsibility. I wanted to pass legislation \nthat would make it crystal clear that neither we, the Congress, nor the \nTreasury Department, nor the Federal Reserve, nor any other Federal \nentity was going to bail out State or local governments that had acted \nirresponsibly and tipped into bankruptcy.\n  Things have not gotten better since then. In fact, in many ways \nthings have gotten worse, and very recently, just in the last few \nweeks, the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy--the largest municipal \nbankruptcy in U.S. history. Other large States and local communities \nare teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. Many States are in a horrible \nfiscal situation, such as California and Illinois.\n  Meanwhile, we are not in a fundamentally more sound place here in \nWashington at the Federal level. Even if we stick to the Budget Control \nAct numbers--and that is very much up in the air, but even if we stick \nto those numbers, Congress will spend $967 billion in discretionary \nmoney this year, and that will result in a $810 billion deficit--almost \na $1 trillion deficit this year.\n  This Nation, total, is almost $17 trillion in debt. The balance sheet \nof the Federal Reserve has swollen from $800 billion in August of 2007 \nto over $3.5 trillion today.\n  Now more than ever, S. 101, the State and Local Government Bailout \nPrevention Act, is appropriate, is needed. That is why I come to the \nfloor today to urge expeditious passage of S. 101. This bill is very \nsimple, basic, straightforward, but important. It would simply do four \nthings: First, it would prohibit the use of Federal funds to bail out \nState and local government budgets. Second, it would prevent the \nFederal Reserve from providing assistance to or creating a facility to \nhelp, again, State and local governments in a bailout situation. Third, \nit would prevent Congress and the Treasury Department from bailing out \nState and local governments. Fourth, there is specific language so we \ndo not create any confusion that this is not intended to stop or deter \nor interfere with appropriate assistance in declared disaster areas.\n\n  That is the sum and substance of S. 101, the State and Local \nGovernment Bailout Prevention Act. When you look at situations such as \nDetroit--the largest ever municipal bankruptcy--and when you look at \nour fiscal situation in Washington at the Federal level, this clear bar \nof the Fed bailing out State and local governments is very much needed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Development be discharged from further consideration of S. 101 \nand the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration and that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very clear. First, I say to my \ncolleague from Louisiana, he and I have worked together often on a \nwhole host of issues. He is on Environment and Public Works; I chair \nEnergy. I want him to know I am happy to continue working with him on \nthis and other issues. The reason I have to object at this time is that \nthe language as it is written would deal a huge body blow to more than \n700 rural and heavily forested counties across the country in more than \n40 of our States. It, in effect, could prohibit payments under the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act.\n  This legislation, which was a bipartisan bill--Senator Larry Craig \nand I authored this legislation--is a lifeline for these hard-hit rural \ncommunities that are walking on a tightrope. They are trying to \nbalance, for example, how they are going to keep the schools open and \nhow they are going to have law enforcement in their communities. \nDeclining revenues from Federal forests spurred the creation of this \nprogram to compensate for the loss of receipts from the Federal \nforests. Suffice it to say that without this legislation we could have \nschool perhaps 3 days a week in a big chunk of rural America. I \nmentioned law enforcement. The question of how you maintain 24-hour law \nenforcement in a lot of these areas has been drawn into question. I \nthink that without this assistance we might have some counties facing \nbankruptcy.\n  Given the fact that this language does not clarify the status of the \nSecure Rural Schools Program, I have to object. I am going to continue \nto object until the legislation does clarify that it will not prohibit \npayments under that legislation, which is a lifeline for rural America.\n  We have had a number of recorded votes on that particular legislation \nhere in the Senate. It has received overwhelming bipartisan support. It \nwas authorized on a bipartisan basis.\n  I am going to yield the floor. I know colleagues want to speak on \nthis issue. I want it understood how concerned I am about the \nlegislation in its present form. That is why I have to object at this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I too join with our colleague from \nOregon in raising great concern about what this proposal would do. This \nis a proposal--we have seen, actually, three of them now--that would \ncut all Federal funding for any community that has either defaulted or, \nmore important, is at risk, has problems financially. What does that \nmean? It means that any city, any county, any local unit of government \nthat is struggling with a tight budget could potentially lose all \nFederal funding. We are not talking about a bailout here. We are \ntalking about the same Federal funds that go to every community--no \nfunding for emergency services such as police departments and fire \ndepartments; no funding for transportation, for roads and bridges; \ncutting off funding for special education and for our schools; no \nfunding for economic development to help these communities that are \nchallenged because of, possibly, economic circumstances such as a \nshifting manufacturing base or other economic issues beyond their \ncontrol.\n  This is extremely broad. According to some legal definitions, \n``default'' could mean anything--late payments on any kind of an \nobligation. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  Let me also indicate that one of the real concerning problems here is \nthat it would exempt emergency spending for a natural disaster. I \nappreciate that the Senator from Louisiana would want to do that given \nthe fact that we had Hurricane Katrina hit in New Orleans and our whole \ncountry came together. People in Detroit raised money to help with \nHurricane Katrina. But I suggest that for the 41 cities and counties \nthat filed bankruptcy over the last 20 years or the hundreds from \nTexas, to Kentucky, to Alabama, and beyond who now have troubled bond \nratings and are considered at risk--this is really a slap in the face \nto every city and community across our country.\n  This is not about stopping a bailout for Detroit. We are working \nhard. People are coming together. This is a community that is coming \nback thanks to a tremendous amount of grit, hard work, and leadership \nfrom the business community, religious community, community leaders, \nand so on. This is about whether we are going to support communities \nthat need some help.\n  Think about this: If a city is doing well and has a wealthy tax base \nand an upper middle-income community with high-powered lobbyists, then \nthey should get Federal money--taxpayer money? Children with \ndisabilities can get special education. We are going to help build \nroads and bridges in communities. But if a community is having some \nfinancial difficulty, then, unfortunately, we would say we would not \nallow the same ordinary Federal funding every community gets to be \navailable for that community. That is not the right values for America.\n  That is why the International City/County Management Association, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the Government\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\nFinance Officers Association strongly oppose this effort.\n  I have one final statement to make before turning to our \ndistinguished senior Senator from Michigan.\n  When we are looking at what is happening right now in Detroit and \naround the country, once again we are seeing workers and retirees on \nthe frontline who have lost their pensions and their wages. In the auto \nrescue, we saw Delphi retiree pensions were not protected. Now in the \ncity of Detroit, police, fire, and city workers are not protected. So \nwhen we talk about the middle class of this country--people working \nhard every day--we need to put them first. We need to make sure nobody \nloses their pension. We need to make sure we stand as a country with \ncities that are in distress and working hard to become vibrant and \nstrong again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I too object to the unanimous consent \nrequest. While the sponsor says it is aimed at bailouts, no one I know \nof is seeking a bailout from the communities that would be impacted. \nDespite the stated intention, the effect of this bill is to endanger \nthe financial health of hundreds of cities and counties in every corner \nof this country. It would weaken the safety and security of countless \nAmericans who call those communities home. I don't know of anyone \nseeking a bailout. Yet bailout is the word that is used frequently here \nby the sponsor of this legislation.\n  What is the definition? Communities at risk of defaulting. Hundreds \nand hundreds of communities are ``at risk of defaulting.'' It is \nunclear what that means. But the strains on local governments in the \nlast few years--particularly following the financial crisis we had--are \nreal. To say that any community, city, or State, for that matter, that \nis at risk of defaulting is to be challenged in terms of getting \nregular support from the Federal Government.\n  This is not limited to loans. This bill affects grants as well as \nloans. In the words of the bill, ``grants and aid'' would be prevented. \nAll sorts of Federal funding, in other words, besides those kind of \nactions of the Federal Government involving credit or reliance on \ncredit of the donor or for repayment.\n  The Congressional Research Service says this, again, applies not just \nto loans but to grants as well. Why in Heaven's name would struggling \ncommunities--whether it is my hometown of Detroit or any other \ncommunity in this country--be denied the ability to seek grants is \nbeyond me. It is not limited to loans but grants as well. This bill \ngoes way beyond the bailouts that no one is seeking and would have a \nsevere impact on cities and towns across the country.\n  Standard & Poor's lists more than 250 securities offered by Louisiana \nmunicipalities that are below investment grade. One State has 250 \ncommunities with securities below investment grade, which presumably \nmeans there is a significant credit risk in those communities. Under \nthis bill, are those communities not eligible to seek regular grants? I \nam afraid so, and that is not just me saying that. Again, that is from \nthe CRS.\n  Finally, Senator Stabenow has made reference to a letter that we \nreceived from the National League of Cities, National Association of \nCounties, the United States Conference of Mayors, and others, opposing \nthis legislation because it goes way beyond its stated purpose of \npreventing bailouts.\n  Again, my town--and I don't know of any town that has--has not asked \nfor a bailout. I am proud to have been living in Detroit all of my \nlife. It doesn't need this kind of legislation poking at it to stop \nsomething from going to Detroit, which it has not applied for.\n  I know this legislation was introduced before this recent bankruptcy \napplication on the part of the city of Detroit, but nonetheless to seek \na unanimous consent in this context and in this moment to pass \nlegislation--apparently without even a hearing--seems to me to be \nbeyond the pale.\n  As a lifelong resident of Detroit, I oppose this proposal. I oppose \nit because thousands of municipalities that have suffered in the \naftermath of the recent recession would be negatively affected. Our \nresidents, their residents, our employees, their employees, and \nretirees around the country deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the two Senators from \nMichigan being the only ones on the floor right now objecting and \nsaying this has nothing to do with Detroit, but, of course, it does.\n  I am very sorry to hear this objection. There is no objection on the \nRepublican side. Of course there would be an objection if, in fact, \nthis legislation would bar normal Federal grants and normal Federal \nloans unrelated to a bailout of a State or a municipality in bankruptcy \nmode, but it doesn't do that.\n  The legislation is very specific and very targeted. It is about a \nbailout of a State or locality in bankruptcy mode, and that is what it \nis about. It is not about normal routine Federal funding, and that is \nwhy there is no Republican objection.\n  One of the distinguished Senators from Michigan makes the point that \nDetroit has not formally asked for a bailout. That is true so far. But \nwhen the mayor talked to the Wall Street Journal about this, he ``left \nthe door open for a Federal bailout after the city's bankruptcy \nfiling.'' When asked directly whether Detroit would seek a Federal \nbailout, Mayor Bing said, ``Not yet.''\n\n  Similarly, the Governor of Michigan Rick Snyder didn't support a \nbailout but said on CBS's ``Face the Nation:'' ``If the Federal \nGovernment wants to do that, that's their option.'' That is not exactly \nnot opening the door and considering that opportunity.\n  Again, I didn't file this bill in the last 2 weeks. I originally \nfiled this bill in February of 2011. Unfortunately, Detroit isn't the \nonly municipal or State bankruptcy on the maps. States can't formally \nfile bankruptcy, but in laymen's terms they can essentially go \nbankrupt. Detroit is not the only issue on the map. Many States face a \nhorrible fiscal situation as well, such as California and Illinois. \nThere is a real danger of these States and localities seeking a Federal \nbailout. This bill is about that. It is not about normal Federal \nfunding. It is not about the safe and secure rural schools program. It \nis not about any of that routine stuff. It is about a bailout of a \nState. It is about a bailout of the municipality or other local \njurisdiction. Of course, Detroit, unfortunately, is the most obvious \nexample after its historic bankruptcy filing very recently.\n  Again, I am sorry to hear their objection. I am sorry the two \nSenators from Michigan are here on the floor about this. I don't think \nthat is a coincidence because this is a bill about bailouts. I think we \nshould pass it, and be very crystal clear at the Federal level that we \nare not going to take on that bailout role and responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On line 7, page 1: ``Notwithstanding any other provision \nof law''--and then after talking about Federal funds not being used to \npurchase or guarantee obligations, it then says:\n\n     no Federal funds may be used . . . or provide direct or \n     indirect grants-and-aid, to any State government, municipal \n     government, local government, or county government which, on \n     or after January 26, 2011, has defaulted on its obligations.\n\n  It is very clear. It is line 7, page 1, and lines 1 and 2 on page 2: \n``direct or indirect grants-and-aid to'' may not be provided to any \ncity which has defaulted on its obligations. This is the language of \nthe bill.\n  It also says on line 12 of page 2 that the funds of the United States \nmay not be used ``to assist such government entity.'' ``Assist any such \ngovernment entity.''\n  Hundreds of governments would be covered by this legislation. It is \nno coincidence that the Senators from Michigan are here on the floor \nbecause we are the most current victims of this language if it were \never passed. There are hundreds of others who would be victimized by \nthis language because of its breadth, and that is what the Senator from \nOregon was very dramatically pointing out.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the language from the \nbill be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n\n\n                                 S. 101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO PAY \n                   STATE AND LOCAL OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no Federal funds may be used to purchase or guarantee \n     obligations of, issue lines of credit to, or provide direct \n     or indirect grants-and-aid to, any State government, \n     municipal government, local government, or county government \n     which, on or after January 26, 2011, has defaulted on its \n     obligations, is at risk of defaulting, or is likely to \n     default, absent such assistance from the United States \n     Government.\n       (b) Limit on Use of Borrowed Funds.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall not, directly or indirectly, use general fund \n     revenues or funds borrowed pursuant to title 31, United \n     States Code, to purchase or guarantee any asset or obligation \n     of any State government, municipal government, local \n     government, or county government, or otherwise to assist such \n     government entity, if, on or after January 26, 2011, that \n     State government, municipal government, or county government \n     has defaulted on its obligations, is at risk of defaulting, \n     or is likely to default, absent such assistance from the \n     United States Government.\n       (c) Prohibition on Federal Reserve Assistance.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall not provide or \n     extend to, or authorize with respect to, any State \n     government, municipal government, local government, county \n     government, or other entity that has taxing authority or \n     bonding authority, any funds, loan guarantees, credits, or \n     any other financial instrument or other authority, including \n     the purchasing of the bonds of such State, municipality, \n     locality, county, or other bonding authority, or to otherwise \n     assist such government entity under any authority of the \n     Board of Governors.\n       (d) Limitation.--Subsections (a) through (c) shall not \n     apply to Federal assistance provided in response to a natural \n     disaster.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Raymond T. \nChen, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Federal circuit. This \nis the 29th judicial confirmation this year. With today's confirmation, \nthe Senate will have confirmed 200 lower court nominees; we have \ndefeated two. That's 200 to 2. That is an outstanding record. That's a \nsuccess rate of 99 percent.\n  We have been doing that at a fast pace. During the last Congress, we \nconfirmed more judges than any Congress since the 103rd Congress, which \nwas 1993 to 1994.\n  So far this year, the first of President Obama's second term, we've \nalready confirmed more judges than were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of President Bush's second term. At a similar stage in President \nBush's second term, only 10 judicial nominees had been confirmed. We \nare now at a 29-to-10 comparison with President Obama clearly ahead of \nwhere President Bush was. And, as I said, we have already confirmed \nmore nominees this year--29--than we did during the entirety of 2005, \nthe first year of President Bush's second term, when 21 lower court \njudges were confirmed.\n  With regard to hearings, the record shows that President Obama is \nbeing treated much better than President Bush during his second term.\n  Last week we held the 11th judicial nominations hearing this year. In \nthose hearings we we have considered a total of 33 judicial nominees. \nCompare this favorable treatment of President Obama during the \nbeginning of his second term versus the first year of President Bush's \nsecond term. At this stage in President Bush's second term, the \nCommittee had held not 11 hearings with 33 judicial nominees, but only \n3 hearings for 5 nominees, and all of those were hold-overs from the \nprevious Congress.\n  In fact, for the entire year of 2005, Senate Democrats only allowed 7 \nhearings for a grand total of 18 judicial nominees.\n  It is hard to believe, but no nomination hearings on judicial \nnominees were held during April, May, June, or July. Four months with \nno judicial nomination hearings. Yet, we recently rushed through \nhearings on nominees to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, plus a number \nof District nominations. In fact, in just the last few weeks, we have \nheld hearings for 14 judicial nominees. That's not very far behind the \nentire output of 2005--7 hearings, 18 nominees.\n  Again, we have already exceeded that number--11 hearings and 33 \njudicial nominees. The bottom line is that the Senate is processing the \nPresident's nominees exceptionally fairly.\n  President Obama certainly is being treated more fairly in the first \nyear of his second term than Senate Democrats treated President Bush in \n2005. It is not clear to me how allowing more votes and more hearings \nthan President Bush got in an entire year amounts to ``unprecedented \ndelays and obstruction.'' Yet, that is the complaint we hear over and \nover from the other side. So I just wanted to set the record straight--\nagain--before we vote on this nomination.\n  Raymond T. Chen is nominated to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Federal circuit. He received his B.S. from the University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles, in 1990 and his J.D. from New York University \nSchool of Law in 1994. Upon graduation, Mr. Chen worked at Knobbe, \nMartens, Olson & Bear in California from 1994 to 1996. As an associate, \nhe drafted district court briefs and legal memoranda on specific patent \nand trademark issues as well as several patent applications spanning \nvarious technologies.\n  In 1996, Mr. Chen joined the senior technical assistant's office at \nthe Federal circuit in Washington as one of three technical assistants. \nThere, he researched and wrote memoranda, commenting on drafts of court \nopinions for both legal and technical accuracy as well as \nidentification of conflicting legal precedent, occasionally writing for \nindividual judges.\n  From 1998 to 2008, Mr. Chen served as an associate solicitor in the \nOffice of the Solicitor at the United States Patent and Trademark \nOffice. During that time, he was first or second chair on several dozen \nFederal Circuit briefs defending the agency's patent and trademark \ndecisions, and he presented approximately 20 arguments in the Federal \nCircuit.\n  He regularly appeared in district court defending the agency against \nlawsuits brought under the Administrative Procedure Act. He was also a \nlegal advisor on several patent policy and legal issues within the \nagency, occasionally prosecuting patent attorneys in administrative \nproceedings for violating the agency's code of professional \nresponsibility.\n  In 2008, Mr. Chen became the Deputy General Counsel of Intellectual \nProperty Law and Solicitor. There he supervises other lawyers in the \nSolicitor's Office and has presented oral arguments in some of the \nseminal patent cases before the Federal circuit.\n  In addition, Mr. Chen deals with higher-level patent and trademark \npolicy issues within the agency. He also coordinates the determination \nof what positions the United States should take as an amicus in \nintellectual property cases before both the Supreme Court and the \nFederal circuit.\n  Lastly, Mr. Chen is responsible for the review and clearance of all \nnew regulations and amendments to existing regulations for the Office \nof the Solicitor.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him a \nunanimous ``well qualified'' rating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask my colleagues to vote for this nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe we should act quickly on a number of judicial \nvacancies. Eleven of the twelve circuit and district nominees currently \npending before the Senate were reported by voice vote. All Democrats, \nall Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted together. There is no \nreason why we couldn't consider all 12 today, along with Mr. Chen. If \nwe work together, then we can fulfill the needs of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nRaymond T.

Madam President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, have Senators sit down and shut up. OK. It \nis unfair. Senator Murray has something to say. Senator Collins has \nsomething to say. It is just not polite.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Senators will \ntake their conversations from the well. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, the Senate will shortly decide whether to invoke \ncloture on the fiscal year 2014 Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment appropriations bill. We have spent nearly 2 weeks debating \nthis bill and working through approximately 85 amendments.\n  We were making progress. We even had a vote on a nongermane \namendment, which clearly would have fallen to a point of order had one \nbeen raised. So no one has been shut out of this process.\n  Chairman Murray and I have repeatedly encouraged Senators to come to \nthe floor, file, and debate their amendments to improve the bill we \nreported.\n  It has been an open and transparent debate thus far, a return to \nregular order--something I have heard virtually everyone here urge us \nto do.\n  Nevertheless, some Senators are intent on preventing this legislation \nfrom moving forward, despite the fact that this bill is not the final \nversion of the transportation and housing appropriations bill. It is \nonly one step in the process but an essential step--one that will allow \nthe Senate to move forward and eventually negotiate with the House of \nRepresentatives to decide on a top line and to further improve the \nbill.\n  A considerable number of my colleagues have advocated for the House \nfunding level of $44 billion and have opposed the Senate bill. But I \nwould like to point out that not one of my colleagues has offered a \nspecific amendment, account by account, to reduce the funding levels, \nprogram by program, in this bill to meet the $44 billion level in the \nHouse bill.\n  I personally offered an amendment that said that in October, if we \nfind we have breached the top line of the Budget Control Act, we would \ngo back to the appropriations process and redo the bill to meet that \ntop line.\n  I would also point out that yesterday the House leadership was forced \nto pull its THUD bill from the floor due to lack of support. Some \nRepublican Members thought the spending levels were too high. But it is \nsurely significant that a substantial number of Republicans felt the \nbill, as written, was far too low and would hurt our homeless veterans, \nwould delay repair of our crumbling infrastructure, and would slash the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program to the lowest level in \nhistory, to below the 1975 level when it was first created by President \nFord.\n  Let me point out that the numbers in the House bill were not \nrealistic. That is one of the reasons it failed. The numbers in our \nbill are not unrealistic. They are too high. They would come down in \nconference. The President's request was artificially low due to several \nbudget gimmicks and scoring differences. We took care of those \ngimmicks. We have an honest bill that is before our Members. Let me \ngive you just one example of a gimmick that was in the President's \nbudget. His request for the section 8 project-based rental assistance \nis insufficient to fully fund the 12-month renewal contracts with \nprivate owners.\n  We are not going to be throwing people out of those subsidized \napartments after 10 months in the year. So Senator Murray and I added \nfunding to more accurately reflect what was needed. That was over $1 \nbillion of the difference. There was the difference in the scoring by \nCBO and OMB. We have to go by CBO. That accounted for $1.8 billion.\n  It is disappointing to me that we have not gone to conference on the \nbudget because we would not be in this dilemma. We would have agreed-\nupon allocations that would guide the appropriations process. But in \nthe absence of that, what is wrong with proceeding with this bill with \ncutting spending in it? If Members have amendments they wish to offer \nto cut spending--and there are a few that have been offered, but as I \nsaid, none that bring it down to the House's level in an account-by-\naccount manner.\n  I am still hopeful we will be able to pass this bill and start \nbringing other appropriations bills to the floor before the end of the \nfiscal year because forcing the government to operate under continuing \nresolutions is irresponsible. It ends up costing more money in the long \nrun. It is wasteful because we continue to fund programs that are no \nlonger needed because we are just continuing current law.\n  So I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about this vote. It \nwould be so unfortunate if we go home to our constituents in August and \nare forced to tell them we are unable to do our job. We should continue \nworking on this bill. We should invoke cloture. This bill undoubtedly \nwould have been reduced in conference had we been allowed to go \nforward.\n  I do wish to thank many of my colleagues for working with us as we \ntried so hard to advance this important legislation. I am particularly \ngrateful to Chairman Murray for her bipartisan approach and \ncollaboration and for working so closely with me throughout the \nprocess.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank our staffs on both \nsides of the aisle for their hard work. They have worked night and day \non this bill. I will put all of their names in the Record. I know my \ntime is expiring.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's proceed to end the debate on this \nbill, take\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\ncare of the rest of the germane amendments and proceed to final passage \nand ultimately to conference with the House. Let's show that we mean it \nwhen we say we are committed to full and open debate and returning to \nthe process that used to serve us well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to echo what my good friend and \npartner on this bill Senator Collins just said. Similar to all of us, \nwhen I go home to my State of Washington, I do not hear a lot from my \nconstituents about partisan politics. They do not ask me which party is \nup or which party is down. They do not care about the political games \nand certainly not who is winning or losing them.\n  The vast majority of people I talk to when I go home ask me what we \nare doing in Congress to create jobs and get this economy going again. \nThey ask me what we are doing to break through this gridlock and the \nconstant manufactured crises and make sure this country, this economy, \nis working for them and their families.\n  They tell me they want Democrats and Republicans working together. \nThey want us to get into a room and put politics aside and put our \ncountry first and find some common ground and get something done. That \nkind of work is far too rare these days, though many of us are fighting \nto change that. I am very proud the Transportation bill we are about to \nvote on does just that.\n  The bill is not exactly what I would have written had I done it on \nour own or what Senator Collins would have done on her own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 \nadditional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This is a bill that is a compromise that reflect the \ndeep cuts we have set in the spending levels of the Budget Control Act. \nIt reflects the best ideas of both sides. So I urge my colleagues to \nmove past the obstruction, get over the gridlock. Let's show the \nAmerican people we can work for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to commend the Senior Senator \nfrom Maine for the extraordinary amount of work she and her staff have \nput into this bill. But regretfully, where we are is cloture on this \nTransportation bill will be viewed as a question of whether we intend \nto keep the commitment we made to the American people 2 years ago this \nmonth to reduce $2.1 trillion in spending over the next 10 years.\n  The House of Representatives is marking to a $91 billion-a-year lower \nfigure which reflects the law. I believe that if we invoke cloture on \nthis bill and move forward, it will be widely viewed throughout the \ncountry that we are walking away from the commitment we made, on a \nbipartisan basis, that the President signed just 2 years ago, that we \nwould reduce spending by this amount of money, $2.1 trillion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Regretfully, I would strongly urge my colleagues to keep the \nbipartisan commitment we made 2 years ago and to vote no on cloture on \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1243, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, \n     and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other \n     purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Patty Murray, Barbara A.

Mr. President, Chairman Murray, and Senator Boxer, I \nrise to discuss with you the importance of funding for the Surface \nTransportation Board in this legislation, as well as the funding that \nChairman Murray has provided to the Federal Railroad Administration to \ncontinue to administer its grant awards.\n  As you know, opponents of California's high-speed rail project are \nattempting to use the Federal permitting process in order to prevent \nthe Nation's first high-speed rail project from moving forward and \nsucceeding.\n  The Surface Transportation Board funding will provide the resources \nnecessary to continue the Board's efforts to permit the growth of \npassenger rail projects in the United States. The funding in the bill \nfor the Federal Railroad Administration will ensure that this agency is \nable to monitor and administer the grants it already awarded.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am pleased to fund the Surface Transportation Board. I \nagree with my colleague from California that this agency needs funding \nin order to comply with its governing statute, which directs the Board \nto support the growth of rail in the United States.\n  I share your concern that some opponents of a single project in \nCalifornia are trying to limit the ability of the Surface \nTransportation Board to operate under its statute. The appropriations \nbill before us provides the Surface Transportation Board with the \nresources necessary to facilitate California high-speed rail, not stand \nin its way.\n  This bill in no way limits the ability of the Board to oversee \nprojects under its jurisdiction and facilitate their construction.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree that this bill in no way limits the ability of \nthe Board to oversee projects under its jurisdiction and facilitate \ntheir construction.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Chairman Murray and Chairman Mikulski, for \nexplaining that this legislation will\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nallow California high-speed rail to move forward.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I also would like to thank Chairman Murray and \nChairman Mikulski for your explanation.\n  I am deeply alarmed by attempts in the other body of Congress to \nprohibit the Department of Transportation and the Surface \nTransportation Board from completing their permitting and oversight \nresponsibly.\n  These attempts violate the spirit of federalism. The California high-\nspeed rail project was approved by California's voters on the ballot, \nthe legislature has enacted enabling legislation, and the Governor \nsupports it.\n  While some may not like this type of transportation investment, it is \nthe choice that my State has made for their future, and the Federal \nGovernment should respect those decisions.\n  Furthermore, I strongly believe the Federal permitting process should \nnot be used as a tool to obstruct and delay major infrastructure \ninvestments of our States.\n  Permitting infrastructure in California is a notoriously thorough, \nlong, and comprehensive process. In the years California has analyzed \nthis one project, China has built thousands of miles of high-speed \nrail.\n  But this year, in an attempt to stymie the project, opponents of \nCalifornia's plan forced the Surface Transportation Board--an agency \ndedicated to protecting fair competition in freight rail--to assert \nFederal jurisdiction over California's high-speed rail project.\n  This new layer of Federal permitting is duplicative of the thorough \n5-year-long review performed by the Federal Railroad Administration. \nNonetheless, State and Federal entities complied with this extraneous \nrequirement. However, now opponents are working vigorously to stall the \nactions at the Surface Transportation Board that will allow \nconstruction to finally begin in earnest.\n  Fortunately, the Surface Transportation Board exists to facilitate \nthe growth of rail in the United States--not to impede it. As long as \nthe Board acts quickly within its statutory authority, it will not \nimpede California's decisions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also share the concerns expressed by Senator Feinstein, \nand I would also like to reiterate that the people of California voted \nto fund this project. The California State Legislature voted to fund \nthis project, and the Department of Transportation, after weighing a \nnumber of applications for high-speed rail across the Nation, decided \nto fund this project. I find it troubling that opponents have attempted \nto hinder the advancement of this project by curtailing an independent \nagency's mission and responsibilities, as well as trying to prohibit \nthe transmission of appropriated funds to its rightful destination.\n  I am pleased that this legislation will allow the Surface \nTransportation Board to act within its statutory authority. I also see \nthat the legislation will allow the Federal Railroad Administration to \nadminister its previously awarded grants to California, and I thank \nChairman Murray for advancing this legislation.\n  I would also like to note that this project is incredibly important \nto the future of California. California's 170,000 miles of roadway are \nthe busiest in the Nation, with automobile congestion draining $18.7 \nbillion in lost time and wasted fuel from the State's economy every \nyear.\n  Additionally, flights between Los Angeles and the Bay area, which is \nthe busiest short-haul market in the United States with 5 million \npassengers annually, are the most delayed in the country, with \napproximately one in every four flights late by an hour or more.\n  California's high-speed rail system will not only increase mobility \nand save lost time and money over the coming decades, it will also \ncreate near-and long-term employment opportunities, enhance \nenvironmental and energy goals, and spur economic development.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As my colleagues know, California has a grant agreement \nwith the Department of Transportation, and California has spent funds \nconsistent with that agreement. I was extremely careful to draft the \nSenate bill to ensure that California will be able to be reimbursed for \ntheir expenses.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Chairman Murray, for ensuring that \nCalifornia will not be left holding the bag, which is not a fair way \nfor the Federal Government to treat the States. Were an appropriations \nbill to prevent the Federal Government from honoring its grant \ncommitments, it would set a dangerous precedent. I am concerned that it \nwould undermine the competitive process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6156-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Samantha Power, of \nMassachusetts, to be the Representative of the United States of America \nto the United Nations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided between the proponents and the \nopponents.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to strongly support the \nnomination of Samantha Power to be the next United States Ambassador to \nthe United Nations, and I commend President Obama for selecting her for \nthis extremely important position.\n  Born of Irish parents and raised in Ireland until she was 9, Samantha \nand her parents emigrated to Pennsylvania and Georgia, and she attended \nYale and Harvard.\n  She is well known for her accomplishments as a journalist during the \nconflicts in the former Yugoslavia, her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \n``A Problem from Hell,'' her leadership of the Carr Center for Human \nRights, and her work as the senior director for Multilateral Affairs \nand Human Rights at the National Security Council.\n  Samantha is a person of extraordinary intellect, exceptional \nintegrity, and a strong moral compass. She is willing to challenge \nconventional wisdom and fight for things she feels passionately about, \nirrespective of the forces aligned against her.\n  Samantha is an internationalist. She believes in the indispensable \nrole that multilateral organizations play in addressing global problems \nno country can solve alone--from genocide to global warming to \ninternational terrorism.\n  At the National Security Council she also brought much-needed \nattention to human trafficking, protection for refugees, gay rights, \nand gender-based violence. But what some people may be less aware of is \nthe depth of Samantha's devotion to the principles on which this \ncountry was founded, and which I believe is one of the key reasons the \nPresident nominated her.\n  Samantha is an American patriot. She will not only strive to ensure \nthat the United States leads by example at the United Nations, but that \nwe do so in a manner that honors the Constitution and the idealism of \nthose who wrote it, which continue to inspire people around the world. \nThat is what people expect of the United States, and I know of no one \nbetter suited to turn that expectation into reality.\n  At a time when the United States faces emerging threats and \nintensifying competition for natural resources, human rights are under \nassault in many countries, and millions of people live in squalor or \nhave fled their homes due to armed conflict, natural disasters, or the \neffects of overpopulation and climate change on the availability of \nland, water and food, how effectively we use our influence globally \nwill determine the kind of world our children and grandchildren \ninherit.\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\n  Now is the time for the United States to embrace these challenges, \nand I am confident that Samantha Power will do so with every bit of \nconviction and energy that she has.\n  To those Senators of either party who have at times differed with \nthis administration over foreign policy or who may doubt the importance \nof U.S. support for the United Nations, I encourage those Senators to \nspeak to Samantha directly. There is no one better informed, no one \nmore willing to listen to other points of view, and no one more \npersuasive, than Samantha Power.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. RISCH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Risch pertaining to the introduction of S. 1430 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I rise to promote and suggest to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle that we support the nomination of Samantha Power to \nbe the next Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  This is a very complex world we live in today. Certainly the forum of \nthe United Nations, in spite of some issues that all of us had with \nthat body over the years, remains the one forum where the United \nStates, No. 1, gets to exhibit strong leadership with our friends, our \nallies, our adversaries, and a strong voice in the United Nations is \nimperative.\n  Samantha Power is an individual who possesses the type of character, \nthe type of strong background, and the person who possesses the \nintellect and the right kind of ability to communicate to represent us \ntoday in this complex world at the United Nations.\n  Samantha was born in Ireland but moved to the United States shortly \nthereafter. She was educated in the public schools in Atlanta, Yale, \nand Harvard. Obviously, she has the intellect, from a background \nstandpoint, to represent our country at the U.N.\n  Between her stints at Harvard and Yale, she did reporting as a \njournalist on the ground, reporting on the Yugoslav wars. She was \nhands-on dodging bullets and being involved from the standpoint of \nmaking reports to various journals and other publications about what \nwas happening in those Yugoslav wars.\n  Samantha is an individual who developed a passion for human rights. \nShe is not bashful about sharing that passion. It is a commendable \npassion that she has for human rights.\n  From 2005 forward, Samantha has been involved almost exclusively in \nthe arena of foreign policy, first as a staffer for then-Senator Obama, \nlater involved in his campaign, and most recently as a member of the \nNational Security staff.\n  Samantha is not only knowledgeable, she is knowledgeable in the right \nway when it comes to foreign policy. She is not only smart, but she is \nworldly. She has the charisma, in her own way, No. 1, to express \nherself in a way that right now the United States needs to be \nexpressing itself.\n  This is why I am so excited about the opportunity to see her on the \nground at the United Nations representing our great country. She can be \ntough when she needs to be tough. She can be charismatic, and she can \nalso be sharp-tongued.\n  With the adversaries she is going to have to be dealing with at the \nUnited Nations, all of those assets are going to come into play. \nSamantha is going to do a great job as our next U.N. Ambassador. I \napplaud her for her willingness to engage in public service. I would \nencourage all of my colleagues to support her nomination to be the next \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I understand we have 1 hour available in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \npending nomination. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the \nnomination of Ms. Samantha Power to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations.\n  Let me begin by saying that Ms. Power is an impressive person. She \nhas an inspiring personal story, she is clearly very intelligent, and \nshe has already accomplished much in her career. However, I do have \nthree concerns I want to take a moment to highlight today.\n  The first has to do with a concern I have about her unwillingness to \ndirectly answer questions I personally posed to her during her \nconfirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I \nasked her about statements attributed to her in the past alleging that \nthe United States had committed ``crimes'' that it needed to reckon \nwith. I raised the question not to embarrass her but to give her the \nopportunity to clarify by either pointing out examples of these crimes \nor to clarify what she meant by those comments. Instead, she kept \navoiding directly addressing my question. She kept saying that America \nwas the greatest country in the world and that she wouldn't apologize \nfor America.\n  I don't think it is unreasonable to be concerned about those \nstatements, and I do not think it is unfair to be concerned about the \nfact that we are sending someone to represent us at the most important \ninternational forum in the world who thinks the United States has \ncommitted crimes that it needs to reckon with.\n  I believe I and members of the committee deserved an answer to the \nquestion. Instead, what we got in response was a rehearsed line. I \nbelieve it was a missed opportunity for her and for all of us. To me, \nthese statements she made in the past and her inability to answer or \naddress them raise questions about her judgment, although--let me be \nclear--I certainly do not question her patriotism.\n  Secondly, I have an even greater concern that she is being appointed \nby a President whose foreign policy is fast becoming an utter and \nabsolute failure. From crises in the Middle East, to strategic \nuncertainty in Asia, to a country we were told was a partner but is now \nharboring a fugitive and traitor who has done great damage to U.S. \nnational security, I believe the world is now more dangerous and more \nuncertain than when President Obama took office. It is increasingly \napparent that our foes are more willing than ever to challenge us. Even \nmore troubling is that those who seek to emulate us, who desire the \nfreedom we all, as Americans, enjoy, are often left to fend for \nthemselves with little American support.\n  A strong, engaged America has been good for the world and for the \nAmerican people. When America fails to lead, the result, as we see in \nSyria today, is chaos--a chaos that allows others with goals other than \nour own to fill the void we leave behind.\n  History taught us twice in the last century that even if we put our \nheads in the sand and try to ignore the world's problems, those \nproblems will not ignore us. I realize the American people are weary of \nwar. We have paid a tremendous price in lives and money in the war on \nradical Islamic terrorism. But to follow the advice of those--including \nsome in the Republican Party--who advocate disengagement from the world \nwould be a terrible mistake. If we follow their advice, we will only \npay a higher price in the long term.\n  Let me be clear. That does not mean America can solve every problem \nor get engaged in every civil war on the planet. I would confess that \nwe also have voices here that are too eager to engage America in every \nconflict on the planet. We need to be careful about when, where, and \nhow we engage American forces overseas. But isolationism on the one \nhand and hyperintervention on the other are not our only two options. \nBetween these two choices we have a third option, and it is this--one \nbased on the idea that while the United States cannot solve every \nproblem in the world, there are very few problems in the world that can \nbe solved without the United States.\n  If a problem can be solved by using an international forum such as \nthe United Nations, that is fine, but more often than not the United \nNations can not and will not confront the problem. In the end, the \ntruth is that America is still the only Nation in the world able to \nform and lead coalitions to confront evil and solve problems. It is \nstill the\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nonly Nation on Earth able to keep the seas open for trade. It is still \nthe only Nation capable of maintaining the safe balance of power in \nAsia and Europe and around the world. It is still the only Nation on \nEarth capable of preventing rogue nations from becoming nuclear powers. \nAnd it is still the only Nation on Earth capable of targeting and \ndiminishing radical terrorist organizations that plot to attack and \nkill Americans here at home and around the world.\n  We should be careful when we get involved. Foreign aid is not a one-\nway street and should always be conditioned and based on our national \ninterests. Military power should be employed judiciously and only where \nit can make a difference in defending our long-term goals. But we \ncannot pretend that if we ignore our enemies, they will ignore us. We \nmust be involved, and when we get involved we must make sure not just \nthat we are doing it the right way, we must make sure we are doing it \nat the right time because sometimes acting too late is worse than not \nacting at all. When we do get involved, it is OK to be motivated by \nhumanitarian concerns, but the primary objective of our foreign policy \nmust always be to protect our people from those who do or may one day \nwant to harm us.\n  This is the kind of clear strategic view of America's role and of our \ninterests that should guide our foreign policy. It is the kind of clear \nstrategic thinking this President has failed to lay out. As a result, \nwhat we see all around us is failure.\n  The President dithered on Syria. We should have tried to identify \nsecular rebels early in the conflict, and we should have made sure they \nwere the best armed and the best trained group on the ground. Instead, \nthe President decided to lead from behind and allow others to decide \nwhom to arm, and the result is that today it is rebel groups linked to \nAl Qaeda--foreign fighters, not even Syrians--who are the best armed \nand best equipped groups within Syria. Now I fear Syria may be headed \ntoward becoming another Afghanistan before 9/11, toward becoming the \npremier operational area in the world for global jihadists.\n  The President entered office with the naive belief that we could \nconvince Iran to become a responsible nation by, quite frankly, being \nnicer to them. He wasted valuable early years in his Presidency not \ngiving the Iranian threat priority, and now the Ayatollahs continue the \nmarch toward acquiring both nuclear weapons and long-range missiles \nthat can one day threaten the United States.\n  I would be remiss if I did not point out that in 2009 he missed an \nopportunity to clearly stand on the side of those protesting a stolen \nelection and instead chose not to because he didn't want to interfere \nin the ``sovereignty'' of another nation.\n  The President also wasted time thinking the cause of radical Islamic \nterrorism was partially because George W. Bush was hated in the Muslim \nworld. But despite his speech in Cairo, despite his efforts to close \nGuantanamo, despite his elimination of the use of the term ``war on \nterror,'' Al Qaeda continues to hate America, and even as I speak here \ntoday they continue to plan attacks against America here and around the \nworld.\n  The President is not alone in failing to confront these threats. I am \nafraid that because of the success we have had in preventing another \nattack on the scale of 9/11, some of our leaders in both parties have \nbeen lulled into a sense of false security. I certainly support the \nprivacy rights and expectations of all Americans, but, my colleagues, I \nalso know for a fact that the surveillance programs our government uses \nhave prevented attacks and saved American lives.\n  I think it is a mistake to dismiss privacy concerns as crazy. After \nall, we have a government whose tax-collecting agency has targeted \nAmericans because of their political views. But it is also a mistake to \nexaggerate them. After all, if a known terrorist is emailing or calling \nsomeone in the United States, we had better be able to know who and \nwhere that person is.\n  If Osama bin Laden had been calling someone in the United States on \ntheir cell phone, I promise you it wasn't a stockbroker. We had better \nknow because these people are still plotting against us, and not if but \nwhen they strike again the American people are going to turn to us and \nask: What has the Federal Government been doing to prevent this, we had \nbetter have a good answer.\n  We live in a very dangerous world, one, by the way, where our enemies \naren't just other countries anymore. Our enemies are also rogue states, \nwell-armed militias, and radical clerics. This kind of danger calls for \na clear strategic vision on foreign policy, and this President, sadly, \ndoes not have one, which brings me to my third and primary concern \nabout Ms. Power's nomination, and it is one that is related to the \nUnited Nations itself.\n  We need an advocate in New York who makes it their primary focus to \nensure that the United Nations is more accountable, that it is more \neffective, and that it serves U.S. interests and is not just some \nmultilateral ideal in which we invest all of our hopes.\n  If she is confirmed today, I hope Ms. Power does indeed become that \ntype of Ambassador. But I have not been satisfied by the evidence thus \nfar of this administration's willingness to be serious about tackling \nthese issues over the last 4\\1/2\\ years that ensure that every American \ndollar going to the United Nations actually advances America's \ninterests. I think Congress needs to play a more active role in forcing \nthis very much needed change to occur.\n  What I would like to do in closing is spend a few minutes \nhighlighting legislation that I recently introduced to this effect. I \nam pleased to have as cosponsors Senators Cornyn, Risch, and Flake, and \nI hope more of my colleagues will join this effort.\n  I am not the first person to raise concerns about the effectiveness \nand utility of the United Nations. Former Senator John Danforth, who \nwas serving as our Ambassador to the United Nations in 2004, when the \nU.N. General Assembly couldn't even pass a resolution condemning human \nrights violations in Sudan, said at the time:\n\n       One wonders about the utility of the General Assembly on \n     days like this. One wonders if there can't be a clear and \n     direct statement on matters of basic principle, why have this \n     building? What is it all about?\n\n  Anyone who has followed the United Nations closely, especially in \nrecent years as the Security Council has failed to respond to the \ncrisis in Syria as more than 100,000 Syrians have died and hundreds of \nthousands more have been forced out of their homes, across borders, \nstraining all of Syria's neighbors, leaving behind a failing state that \nis becoming a safe haven for global jihadists--all of the people who \nhave shared these concerns and have seen this happen should be rightly \nasking the same question Senator Danforth asked back then.\n  In the midst of this horrific crisis, the United Nations has even \nbeen unable to achieve consensus on the issue of whether to allow \ninternational humanitarian organizations to provide cross-border \nsupport to tens of thousands of Syrians stuck in camps facing frequent \nshelling and attacks from the Assad regime.\n  Just as we are troubled by this inability to tackle the world's \ntoughest problems, we should also be angry about the fact that for \ndecades more human rights criticism at the United Nations has been \ndirected against Israel than against actual human rights violators and \nthat U.N. agencies and organizations have employed blatant anti-\nSemites; or that for decades recipients of U.S. foreign aid have only \nvoted with the United States at the United Nations less than one-third \nof the time and such support, by the way, doesn't even currently factor \ninto U.S. decisions about who receives our foreign aid; or the fact \nthat the world's most notorious tyrants and human rights violators are \nallowed to serve on the Human Rights Council rather than being \ncondemned by it; or by the fraud and the mismanagement that has \npervaded the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations, including abuses and \nexploitation of the very people that those peacekeepers were sent to \nprotect; or by the Security Council resolutions on Iran and North Korea \nthat members of the U.N. willfully violate, as we recently saw with the \nPanamanian capture of a ship transferring weapons from Cuba, one rogue \nstate, to North Korea, another one; or by the proliferation of mandates \nthat have clouded the organization's mission and effectiveness.\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\n  The list goes on and on. But let me be clear. I am not here to argue \nthat we don't need the United Nations. Ideally, we would have a United \nNations where the nations of the world would come together and \nseriously deal with North Korea, Iran, radical Islam, and human rights. \nBut the United Nations we have right now isn't capable of any of this. \nIt has basically become a forum for nations whose interests are \ndirectly opposed to ours, to block our efforts using the United Nations \nas cover.\n  That is how North Korea and Iran continue to evade sanctions. That is \nhow Israel's enemies continue their efforts to delegitimize the Jewish \nState. That is how Assad continues to massacre his own people with \nweapons built in and supplied by the Russians.\n  More than six decades after its creation, we still hope for a United \nNations with resolve, a United Nations that acts with effectiveness and \npurpose. Sadly, the United Nations' persistent ethics and \naccountability problems are limiting its role. Until the organization \naddresses these important issues, it will continue to be ineffective \nand often irrelevant.\n  Americans should care about this more than any other people because \nwe shoulder the primary fiscal burden of the United Nations' budget, \nand our patience is not limitless. We don't believe in continuing to \nthrow money at programs and projects that fail to accomplish their \nobjectives.\n  So my hope with the legislation I filed is to provide an incentive \nfor the United Nations and the President and our Ambassador in New York \nto modernize that international body along a spirit of transparency, \nrespect for basic human freedoms, and effective nonproliferation. This \nlegislation would also attempt to address the anti-Semitic attitudes \nthat have become so prevalent in certain corners of the United Nations \nand seriously diminish the effectiveness and credibility of the entire \nU.N. system.\n  At the core of these reforms that I proposed is an effort to instill \na sense of transparency and competition at the United Nations by its \nadoption of a budgetary model that relies mostly on \nvoluntary contributions. This legislation would also strengthen the \ninternational standing of human rights by reforming the U.N. Human \nRights Council in a way that would deny membership to nations under \nU.N. sanctions, designated by our Department of State as state sponsors \nof terrorism or failing to take measures to combat and end the \ndespicable practice of human trafficking. Other provisions of the bill \nseek meaningful reforms at the U.N. Relief and Work Agency that \nprovides assistance to Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israli \nconflict.\n\n  This legislation is needed because the structure and bureaucratic \nculture of the organization often makes it impossible or, at best, \ndownright difficult to achieve meaningful reforms.\n  In closing, for more than six decades now the United Nations has \nserved as an important multilateral forum to address peace and security \nissues throughout the world. But it has never been, and it is not now, \na substitute for strong American leadership. When America fails to \nlead, the world becomes more dangerous.\n  The United Nations is badly broken. I hope we will work to force \nmeaningful transparency and accountability reforms for the United \nNations. But so far this administration does not seem very interested \nin doing so and, unfortunately, at least based on our conversations, \nneither does the nominee before us. Therefore, until we begin to take \nsome positive steps in that direction, I will not be able to support \nObama administration nominees who have not committed to significant \nreform of the United Nations.\n  Ms. Power has failed to make such a commitment. Therefore, that is \nwhy I am voting against her nomination to be our next Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations.\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Samantha Power to be U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations.\n  As you know, I am very interested in the ability of our American oil \nand gas industry to compete for business in the country of Myanmar as \nsoon as possible. By virtually every international standard, the U.S. \noil and gas industry is the world leader in technical innovation. It is \nmy understanding, however, that Ms. Power, as one of the Obama \nadministration's point persons in pursuing a liberal international \nagenda attempted to 'carve out' the American petroleum industry from \ndoing business in Myanmar when the United States suspended economic \nsanctions against this country last year. Fortunately, wiser powers \nwithin the executive branch prevented such a carve out from occurring, \nand now the American petroleum industry can compete with those \ncompanies from the European Union, China and Russia, which are already \nthere. Clearly, this carve out strategy would have been a strategic \nmistake, and it has led me to question seriously Samantha Power's \nability to represent adequately U.S. national interests and security \nneeds at the United Nations. I believe that American companies, and \nespecially our oil and gas companies, can play positive roles in the \ndemocratic transition in Myanmar by demonstrating high standards of \nresponsible business conduct and transparency, including respect for \nlabor and human rights. Ms. Power's inability to recognize this fact is \nvery troubling.\n  In addition, I find her position on Israeli-Palestinian relations of \ngreat concern. Israel is our friend and the sole democracy in the \nMiddle East. It is a nation that we should support and promote in a \nregion that is torn by violence and conflict. Samantha Power does not \nsee it this way. Rather, she believes that Israel should give up its \nhistorical right to its land, and that the U.S. should impose a peace \nplan upon Israel with the Palestinian Authority. She has also \nrepeatedly accused our friend Israel of human rights abuses. This \ncertainly does not represent the views of the people or that of the \nleadership of the United States.\n  Lastly, in addition to her lack of diplomatic skills, Ms. Power has \nno management experience, causing me to question her ability to lead at \nthe United Nations. The U.S. Mission to the U.N. is constantly facing \nmanagement issues, and I had hoped that President Obama would have \nnominated someone who could effectively promote U.S. initiatives there. \nUnfortunately, Ms. Power is not such a nominee.\n  It is for these reasons that I oppose Samantha Power's nomination as \nthe U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I yield back the balance of the time available to the \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Samantha \nPower's nomination to be the Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  As I said in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which I chaired, \non Ms. Power, her appointment as Ambassador to the United Nations has \ncome with much fanfare and with some criticism--which, at the end of \nthe day, means she must be doing something right. In that regard, as I \nlisten to my colleague member of the committee express his reservations \nand his opposition to Ms. Power, I think we have to have some context.\n  When she responded: The United States is the greatest country in the \nworld and I will not apologize for it, it was her way of rejecting any \ncharacterization of statements that she made in the past. It was very \nclear to me. I want a U.N. ambassador sitting in front of the world who \nconsiders the United States the greatest country in the world and who \nwill not apologize for the United States before that world body. She \nmade it very clear that is exactly what she intends to do.\n  On accountability, we cannot achieve accountability at the United \nNations if we do not have a U.N. Ambassador there to lead the effort on \naccountability. On those questions where she was asked by several \nmembers: Are you committed to making the United Nations a more \naccountable organization, not only did she say yes several times, in \nthe affirmative, but she gave examples of how that accountability can \nbe achieved. We need an Ambassador to pursue accountability at the \nUnited Nations.\n  Finally, I agree with my colleague that when America fails to lead in \nsome critical times, we leave a void in the world. But we cannot lead \nif we do not have a U.N. Ambassador raising\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\ntheir voice and their vote on our behalf on some of the critical issues \nof the day.\n  So this nomination is critical to pursuing the national interests and \nsecurity of the United States. Whatever my colleagues might think about \nher nomination, I don't believe anyone can question her considerable \ncredentials or her years of service. Certainly, no one can question her \nwillingness to speak her mind, especially her willingness to speak out \non human rights issues around the world.\n  As a war correspondent in Bosnia, in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, \nand Sudan, she has, as she said in her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \nseen ``evil at its worst.''\n  Ms. Power has built a career and a reputation as one of the Nation's \nmost principled voices against all human rights violations and crimes \nagainst humanity. I know that voice will be heard around the world \nshould we confirm her.\n  While some of us may not agree with everything she has written and \nsaid during her extensive career as a journalist and foreign policy \nprofessional, she has been a tireless defender of human rights, and she \nhas seen the tragedy of human suffering from the frontlines firsthand, \nand it has given her a unique perspective.\n  In her role at the National Security Council, she was clearly \ninvolved with U.S. policy toward the United Nations. She knows the \nUnited Nation's strengths, its weaknesses, and how it operates. At the \nend of the day the United States needs a representative at the United \nNations who will uphold American values, promote human rights, secure \nour interests and the interests of our national security. I have every \nconfidence in Samantha Power's ability to do exactly that, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting her nomination.\n  Personally, I am incredibly appreciative of the principled positions \nshe has taken on the Armenian genocide, her belief that we should use \nthe lessons of what clearly was an atrocity of historic proportions to \nprevent future crimes against humanity is a view consistent with my own \nand which is supported by her role in the President's Atrocities \nPrevention Board. I agree we must acknowledge the past, study how and \nwhy atrocities happen, if we are ever to give true meaning to the \nphrase ``Never again.''\n  As the son of immigrants from Cuba, I personally appreciate her \ncommitment to exposing Cuba's total disregard for human and civil \nrights, and I respect her for not idealizing the harsh realities of \ncommunism in Cuba. I know from the conversation we had in my office, \nshe appreciates the suffering of the Cuban people--the torture, abuse, \ndetention, and abridgement of the civil and human rights of those who \nvoice their dissent under the Castro regime. I welcome her commitment \nto reach out to Rosa Maria Paya, daughter of the longtime dissident and \nCuban activist, Oswaldo Paya who died under mysterious circumstances \nlast year in Cuba as his car was bumped off the road, and I look \nforward to her fulfillment of that commitment.\n  At the end of day, it is fitting that someone with Ms. Power's \nbackground represent American interests and American values at the \nUnited Nations. In the words of the U.N. Preamble, it was created ``to \nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of \nthe human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations \nlarge and small. . . . ''\n  Who better than Samantha Power, a recognized advocate for the \nfundamental rights of every human being, to be our ambassador to the \nUnited Nations? If confirmed, her focus will, of course, be on the \ncrisis du jour: the Middle East, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan, \nPakistan, and others, and the nature of nations that emerge from the \nArab spring. But I know while she is meeting those challenges, she will \nalso be engaged on human rights around the world: on freedom of \nexpression in Latin America; on fighting HIV-AIDS, malaria, and polio \nin Africa; on the status of talks to resolve the 66-year-old question \nof Cyprus; on women's rights in Pakistan and labor rights in Bangladesh \nand human rights in Sri Lanka.\n  Ms. Power, during her nomination process, has repeatedly expressed \nsteadfast support for the State of Israel during her hearing, in her \ntestimony, and individually to several members of the committee, \nincluding myself as chair. She has promised to stand up for Israel at \nthe United Nations, and I know she will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the committee in support of \nMs. Power from six bipartisan former Ambassadors to the United Nations \nbe printed in the Record, calling on the Senate to confirm her as soon \nas possible in this time of opportunity, to have a U.S. representative \nin New York advocating for American interests. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this qualified, experienced nominee. I know she will serve the \nNation well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Robert Menendez,\n     Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, The Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As former U.S. ambassadors to the United \n     Nations in New York, we are writing in support of Samantha \n     Power's nomination as U.S. ambassador and representative to \n     the United Nations. We believe she is eminently qualified for \n     the role and if confirmed she will effectively promote U.S. \n     values and interests.\n       She has long been a champion of human rights and an \n     advocate for American leadership around the world. As a \n     Pulitzer Prize winner, university teacher, senior member of \n     the National Security staff at the White House, and \n     journalist, she has the knowledge base effectively and \n     efficiently to promote U.S. interests at the U.N.\n       She has a record of support for Israel and she will \n     continue her advocacy as U.N. ambassador for our important \n     ally in the Middle East while bringing to the task the \n     balance and judgment required to advise the President and the \n     Secretary of State on the perspective from the United Nations \n     on the important issues of Arab-Israeli peace as well as the \n     host of other issues which are constantly part of United \n     State's policy in dealing with the world community through \n     and with the United Nations.\n       The administration will benefit from her perspective; if \n     confirmed, her experience will allow her to be an effective \n     leader beginning on her first day.\n       We believe that the Senate should confirm Samantha Power as \n     soon as possible because in this time of opportunity and \n     challenge we need to have the position of US representative \n     at the UN in New York filled and operating--advocating for US \n     interests--at the earliest possible time.\n       We would be most grateful if you would ask your staff to \n     insure that this letter is made available to all the members \n     of the Committee of Foreign Relations.\n       With warm regards and respect,\n     Madeleine Albright.\n     John Danforth.\n     Donald McHenry.\n     Edward Perkins.\n     Thomas R. Pickering.\n     Bill Richardson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise to support the nomination of \nSamantha Power to be our Ambassador at the United Nations. Within the \nlast month I had a unique opportunity as the junior member of the \ncommittee that my friend Chairman Menendez chairs, as the head of \nForeign Relations, to spend the day at the United Nations and learn \nabout it from then-Ambassador Rice. I left that day with a couple of \nreactions: first, very proud to be an American, and, second, concerned \nabout the challenges the institution faces.\n  First, on the proud to be American, I think it is important for us to \nrealize, for whatever its flaws, the United Nations would not exist if \nit were not for this country. It is a quintessential American idea to \npull together an institution that tries to build peace, that tries to \nsolve hunger, that tries to solve global health needs. The idea first \ngained force through the efforts of American President and Virginian \nWoodrow Wilson who won the Nobel prize for trying to get the League of \nNations going at the end of World War 1. That league lasted for 20 \nyears and collapsed, for many reasons, including the lack of \nparticipation in the United States in the global effort. But the idea \ndid not die. The American idea stayed alive, and in 1939 the State \nDepartment, within 2 years after the collapse of the league, started to \nwork on the next version. FDR worked on it during his entire Presidency \nand was scheduled to have the first conference on the United Nations 2 \nweeks after his untimely death in 1945.\n  The second decision made by President Truman in 1945--the first was \nto keep FDR's Cabinet--was he was posed with this: After FDR's death, \nwe can\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\npostpone the meeting in San Francisco about the formation of the United \nNations. But Truman said: No, we are going to go ahead because this is \nsomething the world needs and America is uniquely positioned to lead.\n  Ever since its start, in funding and support, through good times and \nbad, through controversies Senator Rubio described on the floor, this \nUnited Nations has worked hard to do good, worked hard to achieve an \nideal that may be impossible to achieve. It is a tribute to the U.S. \nrole as a global leader that the United Nations exists today.\n  I was also struck again by many of the challenges--the challenges of \na tough globe, the challenges of U.N. problems in the ethics and \nfinance area, the challenges that confuse many Americans as we look at \nthe U.N., principally those referred to by my colleague Senator \nMenendez, a history of anti-Semitism at the U.N. that confuses us as we \nwatch it.\n  What are we to do with this institution that we birthed, more than \nany other nation, that still offers great hope and service every day, \nyet still needs significant change? I think what we should do is put a \nstrong person in to be U.S. Ambassador, and Samantha Power is that \nindividual. She has the strength to tackle the challenges that need \ntackling at the U.N. She has had the career, as described by earlier \nspeakers, as a war correspondent, a writer, somebody who snuck across \nborders to take photos of atrocities in Darfur and then bring them to \nthe attention of the world. Her writings and her activism have inspired \ngenerations of activists around the world to take up the cause of human \nrights.\n  She has been the President's senior adviser on matters in the United \nNations in the last 4 years. To focus on this issue, here is what \nSamantha Power has done in that role to help deal with this issue of \nanti-Semitism at the U.N. and the double standard in the treatment of \nIsrael. She worked to ensure the closest possible cooperation between \nthe United States and Israel at the U.N., where she championed efforts \nto stand up against attempts to delegitimize Israel. She was key to the \ndecision of the United States to boycott the deeply flawed ``Durban \nII'' conference in 2009, which turned into an event to criticize \nIsrael. She helped mobilize efforts for the U.N. sanctions against \nIran. She has challenged unfair treatment of Israel by U.N. bodies, \nincluding the one-sided Goldstone Report, and efforts to single out \nIsrael in the Security Council after the Turkish flotilla incident, and \nshe opposed the unilateral moves in the U.N. by the Palestinians that \ncould undermine prospects for a negotiated peace agreement between \nPalestine and Israel, and how hopeful we are at the events this week, \nand we pray it goes forward and finds positive possibility. This is the \nactivity she has had helping the U.N. while she was not the U.N. \nAmbassador. I want her in that seat so she can carry forward on those \ninitiatives and others.\n  She will champion efforts to protect persecuted Christians and other \nreligious minorities in the Middle East and beyond, and she helped \nspearhead the creation of new tools for genocide prevention and she led \nthe administration's efforts to combat human trafficking, all values of \nwhich we can be proud if they would be on display at the United \nNations.\n  I said during her hearing the one thing that made me scratch my head \na bit about her when I heard she was nominated is I think of her \nprimarily as a very blunt and outspoken person, and blunt and outspoken \nis not always the best job description of a diplomat. But in the case \nof the United Nations, with the challenges there, the challenges in the \nneeded financial reform, the challenges in the need to push back \nagainst some instances of anti-Semitism, the challenges of ethics and \nother issues, we need blunt and outspoken at the United Nation. We \ndon't need vague and ambiguous. We need the kind of strong leadership \nthat Samantha Power would provide.\n  I think of many United Nations Ambassadors. It has been an ``A'' list \nof people from Henry Cabot Lodge to President George H.W. Bush before \nhe was President to Bill Richardson and Andrew Young. We can think of \nmany. But the two I think of most--I guess I think of them because they \nare Irish Americans--when I think of Samantha Power is Daniel Moynihan \nand Jeane Kirkpatrick, strong United Nations Ambassadors who stood \nproudly for the values of this country, who gave no quarter, who were \ngood diplomats but did not hesitate to call the truth whenever and \nwherever they saw it. I think Samantha Power will do the same, and that \nI is why I support her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from Virginia. He is a very thoughtful member \nof the committee. I appreciate his remarks on behalf of Ms. Power.\n  With that, I yield all remaining time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for this session, this work period, we have \ndone a lot of work, and it has turned out quite well. None of us got \nwhat we wanted, but we all got something. I appreciate the cooperation \nof Democrats and Republicans this afternoon. It is always during the \nlast few hours before a recess that problems come up, and this is an \nadjournment, so it is even more difficult. So I am grateful to everyone \nfor their participation and their cooperation.\n  As for Senator Grassley, he has left the floor, but I wish to express \nmy appreciation to him. He had an issue that took us a while to work \nthrough, and it all worked out for the better for not only he and \nSenator Leahy but, most importantly, for our staff.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, as the two Chambers prepare to go to \nconference on the farm bill, I rise to request a commitment from the \ndistinguished chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee to protect \nthe Senate farm bill's vital provision to end direct payments outright.\n  While I commend the chairwoman for her leadership in facilitating the \nfull and immediate elimination of direct payments in the Senate-passed \nfarm bill, many of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that section \n1101 of the House-passed farm bill contains a carve-out that would \nactually continue direct payments to cotton farmers at a rate of 70 \npercent in 2014 and a rate of 60 percent in 2015.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this House-passed \nextension of direct payments would cost taxpayers an estimated $823 \nmillion.\n  Already a poster child for Federal largesse, direct payments have \nmore recently become synonymous with waste, fraud, and abuse. As the \nWashington Post put it, recent analyses of the program have found that \nit subsidizes people who aren't really farming: the idle, the urban, \nand, occasionally, the dead.\n  Investigations have uncovered taxpayer-backed direct payments being \npaid to billionaires, to New York City condo dwellers, and to \nnonfarming homeowners who happen to live on former farmlands.\n  Direct payments have also been the target of a series of scathing \nreports published by the GAO, the most recent of which went so far as \nto question the purpose and need for direct payments, stating that they \ndid not ``align with principles significant to integrity, \neffectiveness, and efficiency in farm bill programs.'' The report went \non to recommend that Congress consider eliminating direct payments \noutright.\n  I ask the distinguished chairwoman, was the unsustainable cost and \nthe pattern of waste, fraud, and abuse associated with direct payments \nthe impetus for the chairwoman to ensure that this subsidy was fully \nand immediately eliminated in the most recent Senate-passed farm bill?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague from Arizona for his passion on \nthis issue.\n  Yes, it has been my goal from the beginning of this farm bill process \nto end unnecessary subsidies and to clean up areas of waste, fraud, and \nabuse starting with the direct payment program. The program is \nindefensible in this current budget climate. It makes absolutely no \nsense to pay farmers when they don't suffer a loss and to pay people \nwho aren't even farming.\n  That is also why we included the strongest reforms to the commodity \nprograms in the history of the farm bill, eliminating payments to \npeople who are not farming and tightening the AGI requirements and the \namount any single farmer can receive.\n  We even have reformed the crop insurance program. The No. 1 thing we \nhave heard from listening to farmers all across this country is that \nthey need market-based risk management tools.\n  Farming is an extremely risky business. Farmers plant seeds in the \nspring and hope that by the time the harvest rolls around there will \nhave been enough rain and the right temperatures to give them a good \ncrop. That is why we strengthened crop insurance and made that \navailable to farmers growing different kinds of crops--because we want \nfarmers to have skin in the game. As I have always said, that is about \nfarmers paying a bill for crop insurance, not getting a check from the \ndirect payment program.\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. To the chairwoman's credit, the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry has maintained a sustained effort to eliminate \ndirect payments. In fact, between the 2012 and 2013 Senate farm bills \nand the majority's sequester replacement legislation, 76 current \nMembers of the Senate--76 current Members of the Senate--have voted for \nthe full and immediate elimination of direct payments.\n  Does the chairwoman agree that even the limited $823 million \nextension of direct payments found in the House-passed bill would be at \nodds with the recorded votes of a supermajority of the Senate?\n  Ms. STABENOW. My friend from Arizona is correct. The Senate has \nrepeatedly voted to end direct payments.\n  Mr. FLAKE. To that end, I respectfully request that the distinguished \nchairwoman make a commitment that she will protect the Senate's vital \nprovision and work to ensure that any conference report brought before \nthe Senate achieves a full and immediate elimination of direct \npayments.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, that is my intension. I strongly agree we should \nnot be spending taxpayer dollars to fund these direct payment \nsubsidies, and I will do everything I can to make sure the conference \ncommittee adopts the Senate version on this issue.\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\n  I would also say to my friend from Arizona that if we do not get the \nfarm bill signed into law by September 30, then direct payments are \nscheduled to continue. So I hope we can count on the Senator's support \nto make sure we can pass the farm bill in time and eliminate direct \npayments.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the chairwoman for her commitment. To be frank, I \nbelieve the Senate farm bill leaves much to be desired. In fact, to \ngain my support, the farm bill will need to undergo dramatic changes to \nreduce the taxpayer cost of Federal crop insurance, remove market-\ndistorting price supports, and limit the scope of the Federal \nGovernment in U.S. agriculture.\n  That said, the chairwoman is right to point out that as uncertainty \ncontinues to surround the farm bill, Congress appears poised to pass \nyet another extension of the 2008 farm bill and, in turn, continue \ndirect payments.\n  With regard to direct payments, such an outcome would be a costly \nregression in light of the Senate's bipartisan efforts to eliminate \nthis multibillion-dollar subsidy.\n  After 17 years, three extensions, and more than $92 billion paid out, \nit is time for direct payments to come to a full and immediate end. On \nthis point, the chairwoman and I are in full agreement.\n  To that end, the chairwoman has my commitment to do everything I can \nto ensure that any legislation that should come before the Senate \ncontaining an extension of direct payments will be met with my fierce \nopposition.\n  I thank the chairwoman again for her commitment and for her attention \nto these concerns.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have been \npatiently waiting. I know there are many Members who wish to speak.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank my colleague as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that \nthe amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses; and the chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate; that following the \nauthorization, two motions to instruct conferees be in order from each \nside: motion to instruct relative to the debt limit and motion to \ninstruct relative to taxes/revenue; that there be 2 hours of debate \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior to \nvotes in relation to the motions; further, that no amendments be in \norder to either of the motions prior to the votes; all of the above \noccurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would ask \nthe Senator from Illinois if he would consent to a modification of his \nrequest that it not be in order for the Senate to consider a conference \nreport that includes reconciliation instructions to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection to the modification has been heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. RUBIO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am sorry we are ending this session and \ngoing home for August with this. This is an attempt to go to a \nconference committee with the House of Representatives to agree on how \nmuch money we as a government will spend next year.\n  Each Chamber has passed a budget resolution. The Senate passed one. \nThe House passed one. The basic constitutional approach to this is to \nbring the two together, work out our differences. This is, in fact, the \n18th time we have asked the Republicans for their consent to go to this \nconference committee to resolve the differences between the House and \nthe Senate and the 18th time that a Republican Senator has stood and \nobjected.\n  We have heard speech after speech about how bad it was that the \nSenate never passed a budget resolution. I bet you heard it too. So we \npassed one. We did not get any help from the Republicans in passing it, \nbut we passed it. Then, when it came time to try to work out our \ndifferences with the House of Representatives, Republican Senator after \nRepublican Senator stood and said: No, we do not want to meet with the \nHouse of Representatives, even though it has a Republican majority.\n  Well, what difference does it make if we agree on this number? Can \nlife go on? It makes a big difference. You see, earlier this afternoon \nwe had this bill on the floor, S. 1243. It is a bill for the \nDepartments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. \nSenator Patty Murray of Washington chairs that appropriations \nsubcommittee. Senator Susan Collins of Maine is her vice chairman on \nthe Republican side. They worked long and hard on this bill.\n  It is a $54 billion bill. It pays for the basics when it comes to \ntransportation in America; TIGER grants so that communities can build \nthe roads they need; money to rebuild bridges that are falling down; \nairports in Massachusetts, Illinois, and Florida. It has the Housing \nand Urban Development Program in it as well, housing for poor people, \nhousing for veterans.\n  Well, it came to a procedural vote today on the floor. It was a \ndramatic moment. The Senator from Maine, the Republican Senator who has \nworked on this for so long, stood and begged her colleagues on the \nRepublican side to join her in moving this bill forward. She put in a \nlot of work, and she went through this long list of 85 different \namendments that have been considered on this bill, how everybody has \nhad their chance if they wanted to change it. Senator Murray of \nWashington said the same thing.\n  Then the Republican leader Senator McConnell came to the floor and \nsaid: I am asking all the Republicans to vote no. Vote no because we \nhave not reached an agreement on the budget resolution; we have not \nreached an agreement on the total amount of money we will spend next \nyear.\n  So they all voted no--all except Senator Collins. Every one of them \nvoted no because we did not have an agreement on the budget resolution.\n  So I just came to the floor and said: Why don't we sit down and try \nto reach an agreement on the budget resolution? And a Republican \nSenator said: No, I object to that.\n  Where does that leave us? They will not pass the bills--\nappropriations bills--for something as basic as transportation and \ninfrastructure because we do not have an agreement on a budget \nresolution, and they will not give their consent for us to sit down and \nagree on a budget resolution.\n  The games politicians play. When we had this press conference \noutside, there were people from the construction industry--iron \nworkers, transportation workers, some of them in hard hats--and one of \nthem got up to the microphone and said: I don't know what is going on \ninside those rooms with all that wrestling, but we need more jobs in \nAmerica. Why can't you pass a bill to create more jobs in America?\n  I think most Americans, wherever they live, would agree with that \nironworker. Most of them would not understand what just happened \ntoday--how the Republicans, except for one, all voted against that bill \nfor transportation, saying we had not reached an agreement on how much \nwe were going to spend, and then they turned around and objected when \nwe came forward and said: Then let's try to reach an agreement. They \nobjected. You just heard it on the floor.\n  I respect my colleague from Florida. And do you know the reason for \nthe objection? He is afraid we may resolve the issue about our debt \nceiling. Do you know what the debt ceiling is? The debt ceiling is \nAmerica's mortgage. When we vote for spending bills, we\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\nhave to borrow some money to cover what we are voting for.\n  Many on the Republican side say: We want to vote for spending bills, \nbut we do not want to be held responsible for the money you have to \nborrow to pay for it.\n  If we fail to enact a debt ceiling at the end of this year, America \nwill default on its debt for the first time in history. The economic \nrecovery we are seeing now will disappear. Jobs will be lost. \nBusinesses are going to contract, some will fail. It is totally \nirresponsible to say: I just hope we never extend that debt ceiling.\n  We need to do that. We did it 16 times under President Ronald \nReagan--16 different times under President Reagan. This is not a \nDemocratic or Republican issue. It is an issue of responsibility and \nfiscal responsibility.\n  I am saddened that we had such a good run for 2 weeks where we were \nworking together and we end on such a sour note. I am saddened we could \nnot pass this good, basic bill--a bill which had bipartisan support \ncoming out of the committee. I am saddened that the Senator from Maine \nwas the only Republican Senator who would vote for this bill today. And \nI am saddened that we will end this session with an objection to the \nHouse and Senate trying to sit down together and work out their \ndifferences.\n  If you wonder why the approval rating of Congress is at rock bottom, \nI am afraid we have seen today in the proceedings of the Senate exactly \nwhy that is the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the \nEnergy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, which is also known \nas Shaheen-Portman. I am very pleased to be here with my cosponsor \nSenator Rob Portman. He has been a partner in developing this \nlegislation. I thank him for being such a great partner and because he \nhas to go catch a flight, I am going to defer, yield to him for his \nremarks, if I could. I will yield to him for a question so he can speak \nto this bill and get to his flight on time.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I appreciate that and \nI will yield back to her in a moment.\n  First, I want to say that I appreciate her working with me over the \nlast couple years on this legislation. This is the kind of legislation \nwe ought to be doing around here because it has a lot of benefits. It \nreduces our trade deficit. It helps encourage job creation. It actually \nmakes our environment cleaner. I think it can be helpful in a \nrenaissance to our manufacturing in America. It is called the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act.\n  I also want to thank the ranking member and chair of the Senate \nEnergy Committee--that is Senator Wyden and Senator Murkowski--for \ntheir consistent support of this legislation. We got it through the \ncommittee with a strong vote, and we need to get it to the floor when \nwe come back in September with a strong vote.\n  I am told this is going to be the first substantive Energy bill on \nthe floor since 2007. It is about time. I hope it will have support \nfrom both sides of the aisle, and I know it has support on both sides \nof the Capitol. It is going to help job creators all over the country. \nIt is the right thing to do.\n  On this side of the aisle, we focused a lot on an ``all of the \nabove'' energy strategy. We believe we ought to be producing more \nenergy, particularly domestic sources of energy in the ground in \nAmerica, and I support that strongly. We also, though, talk about \nembracing smart, economically viable policies that let us use less \nenergy. So it is producing more and using less. There is a lot of focus \non producing more but less on this part about using less, and that is \nwhat this bill does.\n  It is supported by more than 250 businesses, trade associations, \nadvocacy groups--the National Association of Manufacturers, the Sierra \nClub, the Alliance to Save Energy, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--so it \nis a group that does not normally come together to support legislation. \nThey like this bill because, again, it has these benefits for the \nenvironment, but also benefits for the economy and for our energy \npolicy in this country.\n  It passed the Energy Committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 19 to \n3. Simply put, Senator Shaheen and I have a bill that I think makes \ngood environmental sense. It makes good economic sense, and it makes \ngood energy sense.\n  I have visited with businesses and job creators all over Ohio, and \nthey tell me pretty much the same thing. They are competing in a global \nmarketplace. They are competing with companies in Indiana but also in \nIndia, and their ability to compete depends on their costs. They go up \nagainst companies and countries where the cost to produce goods tends \nto be lower. We are never going to compete on wages in developing \ncountries, nor should we. We are not going to be able to reduce the \nquality of our goods, nor should we. We want to be sure we are not \ncutting corners.\n  One thing we can do is reduce the costs to our manufacturers on \nenergy because it is a big input, particularly with heavy \nmanufacturing. This enables us to do that through energy efficiency \ntechnologies.\n  What we can do as the Federal Government--through research, through \ndisseminating best practices, through supporting skills training--is \nhelp the private sector develop the energy efficiency techniques of the \nfuture. We can make it easier for them to use efficiency tools to \nreduce their costs, which enables them to put those savings toward \nexpanding their companies and hiring more people.\n\n  The proposals contained in the bill are commonsense reforms we have \nneeded for a long time. The bill has no mandates on anyone in the \nprivate sector. In fact, many of our proposals come as a direct result \nof our conversations we have had with people in the private sector \nabout how the Federal Government can best help them to become more \nenergy efficient, save money, and create more jobs by reinvesting in \ntheir businesses and communities.\n  Here is a brief overview of what the legislation does.\n  First, it helps manufacturers by reforming what is called the \nAdvanced Manufacturing Office. This is an office at the Department of \nEnergy. We need to provide clear guidance to this office that its \nresponsibilities ought to include and ought to be prioritized to help \nmanufacturers develop energy-saving technology for their businesses. \nFrankly, they have gotten a little bit off track and have focused more \non helping manufacturers of clean energy, which other Departments and \nagencies do, including at DOE. This office ought to be focused on \nenergy-saving technology.\n  It also requires the Department of Energy to assist with on-site \nefficiency assessments for manufacturers. It facilitates the already \nexisting efforts of companies around the country to implement cost-\nsaving energy efficiency policies by streamlining the way the \ngovernment agencies in this area work together.\n  It increases partnerships with National Labs--the National \nLaboratories, which are a great source of research and technology--and \nenergy service and technology providers together to leverage private \nsector expertise toward energy efficiency goals.\n  The legislation also strengthens model building codes, so that \nbuilders in States that choose to adopt them will have the most up-to-\ndate energy-efficient building codes that are available--again, no \nmandates, but best practices.\n  It also establishes university-based building training and assessment \ncenters, building on existing industrial assessment centers located \naround the country. We have one in Dayton, OH, that does a great job. \nWe want to make sure they can also do energy efficiency work.\n  These centers will help train the next generation of workers in \nenergy-efficient commercial design and operations through this \nlegislation. Not only will these programs save energy but they also \nhelp provide our students and unemployed workers with the skills they \nneed to compete in what can be a growing field, which is the energy \nefficiency field.\n  Again, this bill is not about forcing companies to become more energy \nefficient or imposing mandates, it is about giving these companies the \nhelp they are asking for. We can do that at no additional expense to \nthe taxpayer because the cost of this legislation under our bill is \nfully offset.\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\n  In fact, I believe this bill will save the American people a bunch of \nmoney. Why? Because the legislation takes on the largest user of energy \nin the world. That is the U.S. Government. The Federal Government needs \nto practice what it preaches. By requiring it in this bill to adopt \nenergy-saving techniques that make its operations more efficient and \nless wasteful, we are doing just that.\n  The bill directs DOE to issue recommendations that employ energy \nefficiency on everything from computer hardware to operation and \nmaintenance processes, energy efficiency software, power management \ntools. It also takes commonsense steps toward allowing the General \nServices Administration to update building designs that are out. Some \nof them have been out there for years. They have developed these \ndesigns over time. They are going to be permitted finally to update \nthese efficiency standards, again with the latest energy efficiency \ntechnology. The government has been looking for places to tighten its \nbelt. This is certainly one. Energy efficiency is a darn good place to \nstart.\n  All this adds up to a piece of legislation that Americans across the \nspectrum can support. It is fully offset, contains no mandates on the \nprivate sector, and requires the Federal Government to become more \nefficient.\n  According to a recent study of our legislation and its impact, by \n2020, using the tools of Shaheen-Portman, the private sector can create \n80,000 new jobs, lower CO2 emissions by the equivalent of \ntaking 5 million cars off the road, and save consumers $4 billion a \nyear in reduced energy costs. A vote on the Energy Savings and \nIndustrial Competitiveness Act is one more step toward achieving the \ngoal of a true ``all of the above'' energy policy that produces more \nenergy at home while using less. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from New Hampshire for working with us. \nI yield to her after having answered her.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I assume the question is, will this bill pass the \nSenate?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Will this bill pass the Senate is a question that I pose \nto my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I would say absolutely it will pass the Senate. It will \ndo that because it represents almost 3 years of meetings, negotiations, \nand broad stakeholder outreach in an effort to craft the most effective \npiece of legislation with the greatest chance of passing not only the \nSenate but the House as well so it can be signed into law.\n  This bill, as has been explained so well, is a bipartisan effort that \nis designed to boost the use of energy efficienct technologies. It will \nhelp create private sector jobs. It will save businesses and consumers \nmoney. It will reduce pollution. It will make our country more energy \nindependent.\n  This legislation will have a swift and measurable benefit to our \neconomy and our environment. As Senator Portman said, a study by \nexperts at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found \nthat last year's version would have saved consumers $4 billion. This \nmay be a little hard to read on the chart, but you can see it reduces \nenergy costs. In doing so, it saves consumers $4 billion a year. It \nwould create about 80,000 jobs, if it were passed, by 2020. It would \nalso be the equivalent of taking 5 million cars off the road.\n  The United States needs a comprehensive national energy policy. We \nare too dependent on foreign oil. We are overly reliant on an outdated \nenergy infrastructure. We need to utilize a wide range of energy \nsources, including natural gas, oil, nuclear, and renewable such as \nwind, biomass, and solar.\n  But we cannot just focus on the supply side. We also need to think \nabout how we consume the energy once we have it. Efficiency is the \ncheapest, fastest way to reduce our energy use. Energy-saving \ntechniques and technologies lower costs, they free up capital that \nallows businesses to expand and create jobs and allows our economy to \ngrow. We can start by improving our efficiency now by installing ready \nand proven technologies, things such as modern heating and cooling \nsystems, smart meters, computer-controlled thermostats, and lower \nenergy lighting, to name a few.\n  There are substantial opportunities that exist across all sectors of \nour economy to conserve energy, to create good-paying private sector \njobs. In fact, there are countless examples of energy efficiency \nsuccess stories in the private sector that I have had the good fortune \nto see as I have traveled around New Hampshire.\n  I visited small retail businesses, manufacturing companies, ski \nareas, apartment complexes, and municipal buildings throughout New \nHampshire. They are all using energy-efficient technologies to lower \ncosts, to improve working conditions and, most important, to stay \ncompetitive.\n  Not long ago I had the opportunity to visit a company on the seacoast \nin New Hampshire called High Liner Foods. It is a seafood processing \nplant. It requires a lot of energy to operate. In fact, at one point \nthe 180,000-square-foot facility consumed roughly 2 megawatts of power \nat any given time during normal operations. So next to the core costs \nof personnel and fish, because it is a fish processing plant, energy \nwas their biggest expense. But by installing efficient lighting, new \nboilers, various demand-response techniques such as adjusting its \nlighting to dim when no employees are in the area, establishing HVAC \nsetpoints, High Liner Foods is making great strides in reducing energy \nconsumption. It has allowed them to expand their footprint in the State \nand to be more cost-effective in their production.\n\n  This week I had the opportunity to visit the first LEED-certified \nauto dealership in New Hampshire. It is the first Toyota auto \ndealership that is LEED certified in New England, which I know the \nPresiding Officer will appreciate, being from the neighboring State of \nMassachusetts. They have implemented a number of effective energy-\nefficient initiatives to cut their energy cost, including the \ninstallation of solar panels, efficient lighting, and an impressive \nenergy dashboard to monitor energy use throughout their entire service. \nTheir customers can come in, they can touch this interactive dashboard, \nthey can see what is going on throughout the physical plant.\n  I have also visited some great New Hampshire companies that also are \nproducing energy-efficient technology. We have a company in New \nHampshire called Warner Power, which has made the first breakthrough in \ntransformers in over 100 years. Studies show that inefficiency in \ntransformers results in a loss of about 5 percent of all electricity \ngenerated in the United States. With the wide-scale use of Warner \nPower's innovation, the Hexaformer, and their control system \ntechnology, the company estimates that 1.5 percent of all transformer \nenergy losses could be eliminated. This would save the country 60 \nterawatts of electricity a year. That is equal to about five times New \nHampshire's entire annual electricity consumption. So energy efficiency \nis an excellent example of a bipartisan and affordable approach that \ncan immediately grow our economy and improve our energy security.\n  In addition to being affordable, efficiency is widely supported \nbecause its benefits are not confined to a certain fuel source or a \nparticular region of the country. It is clearly one of those areas \nwhere we can all come to some common agreement, whether we support \nfossil fuels or whether we support alternatives such as wind and solar. \nSo it is no wonder, as Senator Portman said, that this legislation \nenjoys such a broad, diverse coalition of support. It has received more \nthan 250 endorsements from businesses, environmental groups, think \ntanks, and trade associations, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and \nthe National Association of Manufacturers to the National Resources \nDefense Council and the Painters Union. These are the types of \nnontraditional alliances that have helped us to get this bill to the \nfloor.\n  The legislation provides a roadmap to create and implement a national \nstrategy to increase the use of energy efficiency technologies in the \nresidential, commercial, and industrial sectors of our economy.\n  It provides incentives and support, not mandates, for residential and \ncommercial buildings in order to cut energy use. This is very important \nbecause buildings consume about 40 percent of all energy in the United \nStates. The bill strengthens voluntary national model building codes--I \nwould emphasize that these are voluntary--to make new homes and \ncommercial\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nbuildings more energy efficient, while working with States and private \nindustry to make the code-writing process more transparent.\n  It also trains the next generation of workers in energy-efficient \ncommercial building design and operation. The legislation also assists \nour industrial manufacturing sector, which consumes more energy than \nany other sector of the U.S. economy. It directs the Department of \nEnergy to work closely with the private sector industrial partners to \nencourage research, development, and commercialization of innovative \nenergy-efficient technology and processes for industrial applications.\n  It helps businesses reduce energy costs and become more competitive \nby incentivizing the use of more energy-efficient electric motors and \ntransformers. It establishes a voluntary program called SupplySTAR, \nwhich is modeled on the successful ENERGY STAR Program, to help make \ncompany supply chains more efficient.\n  Finally, the legislation requires the Federal Government, the single \nlargest user of energy in the country, to adopt more efficient building \nstandards and smart metering technology. It requires the Federal \nGovernment to adopt energy-saving technologies and operations for \ncomputers. It allows Federal agencies to use existing funds to update \nplans for new Federal buildings using the most current building \nefficiency standards.\n  The best part, as Senator Portman said, is the cost of this \nlegislation is fully offset. It reallocates funding that has not been \nused from existing programs.\n  I thank Chairman Ron Wyden and his ranking member Lisa Murkowski from \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee for their great support in \ngetting this bill to the floor. This is a bipartisan, affordable, and \nwidely supported piece of legislation. Most importantly, it is an \neffective step in addressing our Nation's very real energy needs. I \nthank Senator Portman, Senator Wyden, and Senator Murkowski for all of \ntheir help with this bill. I look forward to debating the bill on the \nfloor of the Senate, to listening to amendments, and to passing this \nbill out to the House and finally having it signed into law. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           IRS Investigation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the status of the \nongoing Finance Committee investigation into the targeting scandal at \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  As you can tell, my voice is a bit hoarse this afternoon. I am \nfeeling a little bit under the weather. With the Senate about to go \ninto recess, I thought it was important that I say a few words about \nthis investigation, particularly with some of the statements we have \nheard coming from the administration this week.\n  In May, when the news broke that the IRS had been targeting \nconservative organizations applying for tax-exempt status with \nadditional scrutiny, President Obama promised his administration would \nfully cooperate with Congress in its investigations. He also stated he \ndirected Treasury Secretary Lew to follow up on the IRS inspector \ngeneral audit to get more information as to how this happened, who was \nresponsible, to make sure the public understood all of the facts.\n  I was encouraged by this initial response. As you recall, I worked to \nclear the way for Secretary Lew's confirmation in this Senate, even \nthough many of my colleagues had expressed legitimate concerns about \nhis nomination. I did so, in large part, because I believed him when he \npromised to be fully transparent and cooperative with Congress. When \nthe President said he had ordered the Secretary to get to the bottom of \nthis, I expected him to live up to his promises to do so and to work \nwith us as we tried to do the same.\n  Imagine my surprise then to hear both the President and Secretary Lew \nstate over the past week, with our investigations into the IRS \ntargeting, Congress was creating a ``phony scandal.''\n  It started with the President who said:\n\n       With this endless parade of distractions and political \n     posturing and phony scandals, Washington is taking its eye \n     off the ball. And I'm here to say, this needs to stop.\n\n  That is what the President said.\n  That was followed by Secretary Lew stating on last Sunday's shows \nthis past weekend that ``there is no evidence that this went to any \npolitical official'' and that congressional investigators' efforts to \nfind evidence is ``creating the kind of sense of a phony scandal.''\n  In essence, they are saying our efforts to look into this mess are \nillegitimate and that the American people should simply ignore them. \nThat is a far cry from the position the President and his \nadministration took when this scandal was made public. As I said at \nthat time, they were contrite. Officials were even apologizing for what \nwent on at the IRS.\n  Today, however, it is a ``phony scandal.'' It is not worthy of the \npublic's attention, they say. I have to wonder what they are basing \ntheir dismissal on, certainly not a thorough review of all the relevant \ndocuments, that is for sure.\n  In a letter to congressional leaders on June 4, Danny Werfel, the \nActing IRS Commissioner, stated that the IRS had collected some 646 \ngigabytes of raw, electronically stored information, which is equal to \n65 million pages' worth of documents relevant to this investigation.\n  Let me repeat that. The man in charge, Danny Werfel, stated that the \nIRS had collected some 646 gigabytes of raw, electronically stored \ninformation, which is equal to 65 million pages' worth of documents \nrelevant to this administration. However, to date, only about 21,500 \npages have been given to us--21,500 pages of documents. Those are the \nonly documents produced to the Finance Committee to fulfill our \ncomprehensive document request from May 20 of this year. The pace at \nwhich documents have been provided to our committee has been slow and \noften with long delays in between document productions.\n  Despite their initial pledges to be cooperative and responsive, the \nObama administration has been slow-walking the Senate Finance \nCommittee. We aren't the only ones being slow-walked.\n  Only last week, my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, \nchairman Dave Camp and ranking member Sander Levin, wrote to Danny \nWerfel, who is currently the principal Deputy IRS Commissioner, that at \nthe rate the IRS is producing documents, a full and responsive \nproduction will take months. It is actually much worse than that.\n  Let me refer to this pie chart. Look at the documents we received \nfrom the IRS, 6,000 pages of, guess what, training materials. Come on, \ngive me a break. There were 500 pages of Steven Miller, Douglas \nShulman, and William Wilkins, and 15,000 pages of nonpriority \ncustodians. That is what we have gotten from them since May. It is \npathetic.\n  As that chart illustrates, given the intermittent document production \nand the very small number of priority documents we have received thus \nfar, it could be 2016 before we ever would be able to draw any \nconclusions about what happened at the IRS. That is pathetic. I have a \nfeeling that is exactly what this administration wants, and that is \nwhat I call slow-walking.\n  Since the initial report confirming the inappropriate targeting \nreleased by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or \nTIGTA, on May 14, this ``phony scandal'' has evolved from what the IRS \nfirst claimed was a couple of rogue employees in Cincinnati to direct \nIRS involvement from high-level officials in Washington, DC, including, \nat the very least, individuals in the IRS's Office of Chief Counsel.\n  I should note that the IRS Chief Counsel is also an Assistant General \nCounsel in the Treasury Department, and he reports to the Treasury's \nGeneral Counsel. Clearly, much more needs to be learned about who was \ninvolved, why decisions were made, and what motivated these decisions.\n  This is why the Senate Finance Committee has been conducting a \nthorough, balanced, and fact-based bipartisan investigation that \ncarefully examines every aspect of this in order to get to the truth.\n  We are not interested----\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would the distinguished ranking member yield for one \nquick question? I know the Senator has prepared remarks, and I know he \nis not feeling well, but I am stunned by this. I am a member of the \ncommittee, as the Senator well knows.\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. You have been promised full cooperation by the Deputy \nCommissioner, Mr. Werfel. I have been present when he has tried to \ninform the committee of full cooperation. Now we find out what full \ncooperation is, more especially as the President has indicated these \nscandals are so-called phony scandals and repeated by Mr. Lew.\n  The Senator stated there are 65 million pages that should be \navailable to the committee, which is stunning--stunning--in the job we \nwould have to do. But out of those requested, only 21,500 documents \nhave been presented. Of the 21,500, only 15,000--well, 15,000 pages, \nbut those are nonpriority documents.\n  Thereby, if you try to figure out when this would be done, it would \nbe in 2016; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am stunned by this.\n  Mr. HATCH. It may be beyond that. It may actually go beyond that.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would imagine, if you do the math--and if you know how \nmuch time we have to actually do this--but I am stunned. This isn't \nwhat we were promised. This wasn't the understanding of the full \ncommittee and the bipartisan effort.\n\n  I don't know what we are going to have to do. We are going to have to \ndo some drastic action if this is any indication of what we are taking.\n  The Senator pointed out that we have been thorough, we have been \nbipartisan, and we have kept absolute integrity with this. The key word \nwas ``painstaking.'' If we have this information, there is a lot of \npain, but there is no take.\n  Mr. HATCH. You got that right.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am extremely upset about it. I thank my colleague for \nbringing this to the attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Kansas. All I can say is: Look, \nwe were promised full cooperation, and we are not getting it.\n  I don't blame Mr. Werfel for this, although he is a very close friend \nof Mr. Lew's. I think he has wanted to be more cooperative. When I \nchatted with him today again, he indicated the attorneys are going over \neverything. Let me just say, are we going to get the right papers? Are \nwe going to get the truth?\n  We are not interested in some perceptions of the truth based on \nlimited documents and limited facts. We wish to know precisely what \nhappened, and we are going to find out.\n  Today, in addition to the small number of documents we have been able \nto review, the Finance Committee investigators have interviewed 14 \nindividuals from IRS offices in both Cincinnati and Washington, DC. So \nfar those interviews have yielded more questions than answers. In fact, \nthe list of additional questions keeps growing as the investigation \nwears on.\n  After more than 2 months of investigation, here are just a few of the \nquestions I have. I will not take too much of the Senate's time \ntonight, but I have a lot more questions than this, and I am going to \nask these in a bipartisan manner.\n  Why did IRS Commissioner Shulman visit the White House 157 times? \nThat is the number we have been given. That is unheard of. It has never \nhappened before.\n  I admit ObamaCare has taken some time, but you can't justify 157 \ntimes. It sounds to me as if there is something fishy going on.\n  Why is it that the unions get tax-exempt status under 501(c)(5)? \nThere was a surge in the 501(c)(5) applications in recent years. Why \nweren't they subject to some of the scrutiny?\n  Did the IRS give extra scrutiny to union applications for tax-exempt \nstatus? The answer to that is, no, they didn't.\n  I am not suggesting they should, but they certainly shouldn't have \ntraded preelection of so-called conservative groups the way they \ntreated them.\n  Everybody knows that is a scandal. Yet they call this not a scandal?\n  Once Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin learned from Inspector \nGeneral Russell George of the TIGTA audit regarding IRS targeting of \nconservative groups on June 4, 2012, did he tell anyone else at the \nTreasury Department or the White House about his findings, including \nthen-Treasury Secretary Geithner? Not that I can understand, because we \ndon't know. They are not answering these questions.\n  When did Assistant General Counsel for Treasury William Wilkins, who \nalso holds the title of IRS Chief Counsel, first find out that the IRS \nwas targeting conservative groups? When did he find that out? Why can't \nwe get a simple answer on that?\n  Whom did Mr. Wilkins inform about this targeting when he found out \nabout it? What was the extent of the Treasury Department's role \nregarding Lois Lerner revealing, in response to a planted question, \nthat the IRS had targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt \nstatus at an American Bar Association conference? When did any employee \nof the Treasury Department first have involvement regarding the IRS \ntargeting of conservative groups' applications for tax-exempt status?\n  What was first date that any White House official was informed about \nthe IRS targeting of conservative applicants for tax-exempt status?\n  It has been reported that ProPublica obtained private information \nfrom the IRS about conservative groups that had applied for tax-exempt \nstatus. In addition, it has been reported that the National \nOrganization for Marriage alleges that the IRS illegally leaked \ninformation about its donors.\n  What action, if any, has been taken by the IRS and the Department of \nJustice with respect to any IRS employee who may have illegally \ndisclosed private taxpayer information in either of these cases? These \nare important questions.\n  Are there other cases where a conservative group or its members have \nhad their private taxpayer information unlawfully disclosed?\n  It has been reported that the IRS attempted to impose gift taxes on \ndonors to the conservative group Freedom's Watch. Did the IRS attempt \nto impose gift taxes on the donors of other tax-exempt groups? Has the \nIRS targeted individuals for an audit of their personal tax returns \nbased on their membership in or donations to a conservative tax-exempt \ngroup?\n  It has been reported that Lois Lerner communicated with an attorney \nat the Federal Election Commission regarding a case before the FEC.\n  Did Lois Lerner violate section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code \ndealing with the protection of taxpayer privacy in her communications \nwith the Federal Election Commission? She had a right to take the Fifth \nAmendment, but was that why she took it if she violated section 6103?\n  These are questions that have to be answered. Why did Sarah Hall-\nIngram, who was in charge of the IRS's efforts in implementing \nObamaCare, attend a meeting with then-IRS Commissioner Steve Miller in \nMay 2012 regarding the IRS's targeting of conservative groups' \napplications for tax-exempt status?\n  It has been reported in the media that Christine O'Donnell had a tax \nlien put on her property the day she declared her candidacy for the \nSenate.\n  There is something wrong here. Anybody who is fair ought to be \nconcerned about what is wrong here--not just this but in all these \nquestions.\n  As part of the IRS internal investigation the President charged \nSecretary Lew with conducting, has the IRS examined whether any \npolitical candidates were inappropriately targeted?\n  Much has been made of the employees who have been ``relieved of \nduty'' and had ``administrative actions'' taken against them, allegedly \nin direct response to the inappropriate targeting. Once again, the \nfacts do not add up, as the administrative actions discovered thus far \nwere against low-level employees for actions that were not directly \ntied to the allegations of inappropriate targeting.\n  So my question is, Who was relieved of duty? Lois Lerner supposedly \nwas after she took the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. But even \nshe was able to log in to her computer after being allegedly relieved, \nand she is still being paid her full salary.\n  Who else has been relieved of duty? What does Lois Lerner know that \nprompted her to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-\nincrimination?\n  Former IRS Commissioner Steve Miller and Doug Shulman were both aware \nof the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status and \nthe systematic practice of subjecting those\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\nconservative groups to intrusive and unwarranted scrutiny about their \nactivities. Why did they both deceive the Senate by failing to inform \nus that these practices were going on? Why? I was disappointed in \nCommissioner Shulman because he came to my office long before this all \ncame up and I was quite impressed. But I think he had an obligation to \ncome clean.\n  Why did the tea party cases sit for months at the IRS, through the \n2010 election cycle without activity? Why? Why did Lois Lerner direct \nthe IRS Chief Counsel's Office--an office that was purportedly slow in \nits response to requests for assistance from other IRS components--to \nget involved in reviewing tea party cases? Why did the IRS demand that \ntea party organizations seeking tax-exempt status provide a list of \ntheir donors to the IRS when that was not required? Why?\n  These types of inappropriate actions, as I said, are just some of the \nmany questions we have about the IRS targeting scam. These questions \nwill simply not go away, and our investigation will not stop until all \nof them are answered. And we are doing this in a bipartisan way.\n  Just today we learned President Obama has selected a new nominee to \nserve as the next Commissioner of the IRS. I have to say I was a bit \nsurprised, although perhaps I really shouldn't be. Given the dark cloud \nthat currently hangs over the IRS, I would have thought the President \nwould have taken the time to consult Congress before choosing the \nagency's next leader. Yet I am the ranking member of the appropriate \ncommittee with sole jurisdiction over the IRS, and today's announcement \nis the first I have heard of this decision, and it was only after the \ndecision was made. I like the President. I think we are friends. But \nthat was improper, and it was a slight that should not have happened.\n  I asked Senator Baucus if he was informed by the President, and he \nsaid: About 3 hours ago. And he sounded a little disgusted himself.\n  I won't go into the merits of John Koskinen's nomination today. I \nhave no intention of prejudging him. He will be fairly considered by \nthe Finance Committee, and I have the reputation that he will be fairly \nconsidered. His record and qualifications will be thoroughly examined. \nBut I want to assure my colleagues that I will demand significant \nanswers from Mr. Koskinen when he comes before the committee, and I \nthink other Republicans will as well.\n  My purpose will be twofold. First, we need to get to the truth about \nwhat happened at the IRS and, perhaps just as important, we need to \nmake sure the Obama administration is fully cooperating with our \nefforts rather than using phony statements about phony scandals.\n  So today I want to call on President Obama and Secretary Lew to stop \nclosing the door on this investigation that has just started and hasn't \neven been given a chance. If this is indeed a phony scandal, the burden \nis on them to prove it is. And just saying that it is isn't good \nenough. They should have the IRS produce all the requested documents \nand let the documents speak for themselves. There is no reason to hide \nthese things, nor is there a reason to have a whole bunch of attorneys \ndetermining what can be released and what can't be released. Let them \nshow how their partisan targeting began and why it continued for years. \nLet them show who was or was not involved and to what level within the \nIRS or elsewhere in government these activities were discussed and \ndirected. Until then, this is certainly not a phony scandal. It is a \nlegitimate bipartisan investigation being conducted in a fair and \nbalanced way that seeks to let the facts dictate the outcome.\n  I have a reputation around here for being fair and honest, and I \nresent the way the Finance Committee is being treated. I can't speak \nfor the chairman, but I believe he feels pretty much the same way \nbecause we are being mistreated with regard to our requests for \ninformation. This isn't some itty-bitty phony scandal. This is big-time \nstuff that should get into why the IRS was doing this to begin with.\n  People in this country are scared to death of the IRS, and with good \nreason. If they can do this to you, can you imagine what else they can \ndo? And I have listed just a few things here today. I have a lot more I \ncould say. This is an important investigation, and Senator Baucus and I \nintend to do it in a bipartisan way. But when we ask for documents, we \nwant documents, and we don't want some bunch of partisan lawyers in the \ndepartment stopping us from getting the documents they must provide. It \nsure looks as though they are deliberately trying to delay this as long \nas they can so they can say: Well, nobody cares about it. Well, I have \nto tell you, everybody in this country must care about it. If they can \ndo this to these small, conservative tax-exempt organizations, then \nthey can do it to every other organization when the time comes.\n\n  This is an important investigation, and this administration ought to \nbe at the forefront of trying to get to the bottom of it instead of \npulling from behind, saying there is nothing here when they know there \nis a lot here. I would like these questions answered. They are \nimportant questions. This is an important investigation. We should not \nallow the IRS to run rampant like this. That is the beginning of \ntyranny--except it began before 2010--and we should get to the bottom \nof it so it never, ever happens again.\n  I think there are a lot of people at the IRS who would like to see us \nget to the bottom of it because they are being besmirched by the bad \nthings that have happened. There are a lot of decent, honorable people \nworking at the IRS, and they have to be as concerned as I am about the \nmistreatment that occurred prior to the last election and after.\n  Is it going to happen again? Are these agencies of government going \nto be used by partisan people in the way they has been used up until \nnow? It is enough to scare the daylights out of anybody, and it is \nenough to think, are we moving toward a totalitarian system where the \npeople in government can get away with anything they want to and \nespecially an agency as powerful and scary as the IRS? I hope we can \nget the answers to these questions. If we can't, this isn't going to \nstop until we do. And these are just preliminary questions; I will come \nback with some more in the coming weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I would like to again thank the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee for his \npresentation and asking very pertinent questions with what I thought \nwas going to be not an easy task but at least a task where we would \nreceive cooperation from the IRS and, for that matter, the \nadministration.\n  Nobody likes to be audited, and surely nobody likes to say they have \nbeen audited, as the distinguished ranking member pointed out about all \nthe conservative groups. But let me point out that this has gone on not \nonly with regard to them but to individuals as well. We are getting \nreports from the senatorial campaign committee indicating that people \nare hesitant to give, that people who have given in the past \nsignificantly to the Republican cause have been audited, and audited \nfor the first time in their lives, to pro-Israel groups--and I can go \non and on with a list of the organizations.\n  This is a very serious situation. This really surprises me, that \nhaving said we were going to do this in a painstaking, bipartisan way, \nthat this is simply not the case.\n  I am going to be joining the distinguished ranking member. I am very \ninterested in the further questions we feel we can boil down that \nsimply have to be answered first, and then obviously there are many \nmore.\n\n\n                       Affordable Health Care Act\n\n  This really goes to the subject I want to talk about. The American \npeople now, as a result of this, do not trust the IRS, and they sure as \nheck do not trust the IRS to be in charge of their health care. That is \nthe subject I want to touch on, and I will try to make it very brief.\n  It has been more than 3 years since the Affordable Care Act--referred \nto by some or most in the press as ``ObamaCare''--was signed into law. \nAt the time, I can recall, after months of markup in both the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions and Finance Committees, I had many \nconcerns. I remember I was very frustrated with my amendments being \ndefeated on partisan votes, most of them having dealt\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nwith rationing. I remember distinctly comparing this rush to government \nhealth care to a western or Kansas analogy of riding hell for leather \ninto a box canyon to eventually finding the only alternative would be \nto turn around and ride back out to a more realistic market-oriented \nhealth care reform trade.\n  As it turned out, we never even saw the bill before we voted on it. I \nvoted no, and so did every other Republican Senator and Member of \nCongress. And I regret to say to my colleagues that I told you so. \nPremiums are going up. Taxes are going up. Overall health care costs \ncontinue to rise. Burdensome, costly, and, I might add, difficult-to-\nunderstand regulations are confusing and confounding health care \nproviders. Many of these folks will not even know about a particular \nregulation until they are fined by outside contractors. The results \nhave been terribly counterproductive to any economic recovery. \nRegulations such as these this have a way of dampening anything we are \ntrying to do.\n  The current and growing problems are so large and complicated with \nthis government takeover of health care that it has been difficult, if \nnot impossible, for the administration to get ObamaCare off the ground. \nI mentioned what happened 3 years ago at the beginning of my remarks. \nLet's now talk about what is coming down the pike in just a matter of \nweeks.\n  October 1 is the deadline when, according to the Affordable Care Act, \naccording to the law, according to promise, millions of Americans who \ndo not receive insurance through an employer will be forced to purchase \nhealth insurance in an exchange overseen by the States and the Federal \nGovernment--except for Georgia. Yesterday, Georgia was the first to \nannounce that they will not be ready by the October 1 deadline and have \nasked for a delay.\n  I am going to make a prediction that what Georgia did, others will \ndo, including the Federal Government. In fact, as we all know, the \nadministration--in a weekend blog, no less--announced they would delay \nthe employer mandate due to take place January 1, 2014, by a year, to \nJanuary of 2015. I might add, that just happens to be after the midterm \nelections. This just means another delay for businesses that complained \nabout the redtape and costly burdens the mandate placed on their \noperations. Many are already laying off employees or moving them to \npart-time status to avoid the costly mandate. And all of this follows \nthe thousands of waivers granted to corporations, unions, and other \ngroups.\n  Again, my question is, Where is the waiver for the average family in \nKansas and around the Nation? Where is the permanent delay for the \ntaxes that will affect individuals?\n  As we warned, things are starting to crumble and get worse, which is \nwhy we need to sunset the exchanges and the individual mandate--\nliterally, a tax on families.\n  This evening or tomorrow those of us privileged to serve in the \nSenate will leave Washington for the month of August, and we are going \nto get an earful regarding all of the problems associated with \nObamaCare and the impending deadline. Will exchanges be ready? If they \nsay they are ready, will they really be ready? Many Kansans who will be \nforced into a Federal exchange or see another last-minute delay--a \nFederal exchange, by the way, that doesn't exist as of my remarks--will \nask how much the new plan will cost. They will say: What will it cover? \nWill they be able to see their family doctor? Will their personal \nhealth information remain private and safe or end up in a six-agency \ndatabase? Some people call it seven agencies. Will they be losing the \nhealth insurance they like? Will the high costs force their employer to \nmake them a part-time employee, change their plan, or just drop their \ncoverage altogether?\n  Right now Kansans and everyone else in the country cannot answer \nthese questions--and neither can the administration. And when we get \nback, we will have only 4 weeks until the October 1 deadline. That \nmeans, really, if we are going to do something about this, we are only \ngoing to have 3 weeks in which something can be done to sunset, delay, \ndefund, or repeal the law and replace it with real health care reform \nthat works and to restore the all-important relationship between \npatients and doctors.\n  Well, I do have an answer. Some time ago, when the ObamaCare storm \nclouds were first forming, I introduced legislation to sunset the \nexchanges and the individual mandate if they are not, as promised, up \nand running and ready to enroll by October 1 so that the exchanges can \nmeet the requirements prescribed by law. Simply named the ``Exchange \nSunset Act of 2013,'' S. 1272, my bill aims to make sure that if the \nexchanges are not ready, they go away and so does the mandate.\n  I realize, as we travel down this road to the October 1 deadline at \never-increasing speed, there will be those who support continued \nadvertising and encouraging thousands to sign up in the exchanges. The \nquestion is, Sign up for what? The chances of the exchanges, State and \nFederal, being ready--and I mean ready and accessible to all that the \nadvertising is trying to bring in--are remote at best. Obviously, there \nwill be some kind of a delay, and once again we will have the \nadministration rewriting laws which they had a direct hand in writing \nand which were passed exclusively by the Democratic majority. I submit, \nchanging the law by the Executive--the Office of the President--without \napproval by the Congress is unconstitutional.\n  Three weeks, three weeks before the ObamaCare train wreck. When this \nbody comes back, let's talk about it, and I urge immediate \nconsideration and hopefully passage of S. 1272, the Exchange Sunset Act \nof 2013. It is a train wreck, folks, and we have to get America off the \ntrack.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                        Manipulating Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the so-called \ngrand bargain referenced yesterday by the President.\n  On Tuesday President Obama recycled a number of policy ideas that \nhave lingered for months, if not years, and repackaged them as what he \ncalled ``a grand bargain.'' This proposal seems to be an attempt by the \nPresident to extend an olive branch to the Republican side of the aisle \nby offering corporate tax reform. In exchange, he is asking for \nadditional stimulus spending.\n  I am in favor of a grand bargain, but this is not even close to a \ngrand bargain. It is not even a bargain. A grand bargain would involve \nreform to entitlement programs to make them sustainable over time. A \ngrand bargain would involve a farsighted look at the outyears, not just \na shortsighted attempt to score political points for the next election \ncycle.\n  The administration has taken the taxpayer down the road of stimulus \nspending before, with the idea that we can stimulate job growth with \nso-called shovel-ready projects. Sadly, we have all seen what throwing \ntaxpayer money at supposed shovel-readiness gets you and just how \nlackluster this economic recovery has been. Wasting hard-earned dollars \non so-called investments doesn't create jobs. Businesses and the people \nwho build them is what creates jobs.\n  I think both sides of the aisle agree that our Tax Code is already \nfar too complicated. In fact, a recent bipartisan letter from the \nchairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee \ndiscussed the complexity, inefficiency, and unfairness of our Tax Code, \nwhich acts as a brake on our economy. But if we can't bring ourselves \nto do entitlement reform--or the so-called grand bargain--at least at \nthis stage what we can do is perhaps a small bargain for businesses and \nthe taxpayers just by simplifying both the individual and corporate \ncodes to foster an environment that is hospitable to business \nexpansion, to hiring, and to international competitiveness.\n  Last week I shared publicly with the leadership of our tax-writing \ncommittee my goals and principles for tax reform. Chief among them is \nlowering the business income taxation for corporations and those \nbusinesses that file as individuals.\n  With 95 percent of U.S. businesses structured as subchapter S \ncorporations, limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and \nother passthrough businesses, we can't ignore the fact that many of \nthem pay a top rate of 39.6 percent in addition to several other layers \nof taxation. In my view,\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\nany substantive tax reform should include a reformed tax system that \nallows all U.S. businesses, including passthrough businesses, to \nthrive. Unfortunately, the proposed corporate taxation reforms the \nPresident included in his recent announcement will once again have the \ngovernment picking winners and losers in the Tax Code.\n  Here in the Senate, there are efforts to work in a bipartisan fashion \nto reform the Tax Code. This is a good-faith effort that should be \nencouraged. As I mentioned, it would be a bargain for taxpayers and \nbusinesses alike.\n  If we can make progress on the small bargain, then perhaps some day \nwe can return our attention to the grand bargain--a bargain that would \ninclude and involve entitlement reform and substantive tax reform in \nthe same package.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2668\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 145, H.R. 2668. \nI ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, \nwithout intervening action or debate, and the motion to reconsider be \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, very briefly, reserving the right to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. It comes as no surprise that the Republicans are once again \ntrying to repeal the health care act. By one count, the House and \nSenate Republicans have tried to fight the same fight more than 70 \ntimes.\n  Albert Einstein was not insane. He was very smart. But he described \ninsanity pretty clearly as doing the same thing over and over and \nexpecting different results. That is where we are here. This is insane. \nIt is clear Republicans liked it better when insurance companies could \ndeny coverage when you had a preexisting condition; when insurance \ncompanies could cut off your health insurance when you got sick; when \ninsurance companies could raise insurance rates without any review. \nThey would say--I guess when they say what they are saying now, that \nthey want to prevent enforcement of the health care reform, what they \nare really saying is they want to repeal free mammograms and preventive \ncare, repeal the law that lets kids stay on their parents' health care \nuntil they are 26.\n  Let's not fight the same fight over and over. It is time to stop \nfighting. It is time to work together.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2009\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate receives from the House H.R. 2009, the Keep the IRS Off Your \nHealth Care Act, the Senate proceed to its consideration; that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, without intervening action or debate, \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n\n\n                      Delay The Individual Mandate\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me address the first consent I \noffered, which was objected to. Last month the administration announced \nit would delay ObamaCare's employer mandate on business. It is not hard \nto see why they wanted to do that. We keep reading about why businesses \nlarge and small will have little option but to cut employee hours and \npaychecks as ObamaCare comes on line, about how restaurants such as \nWhite Castle, for example, are considering hiring only part-time \nworkers moving forward, about how small businesses are citing ObamaCare \nas a top worry.\n  I think there are a lot of Members on this side who would question \nthe legality of what the President did. But with midterm elections on \nthe horizon, it is no mystery why the administration would want to \ndelay the law for businesses, considering how many jobs it is likely to \nkill, how many paychecks it is likely to slash. Here is the thing, \nthough: Don't families and individuals deserve the same kind of relief? \nI believe they do. I do not believe it is fair to give a break to \nbusiness and leave Americans out in the cold.\n  Recently we learned that Ohioans buying health insurance next year \ncan expect about a 40-percent premium increase. Next door, in Indiana, \ncosts could rise by more than 70 percent. Some Georgians could face a \nnearly 200-percent premium spike. In my home State of Kentucky, \nactuaries are predicting cost increases that could exceed 30 percent. \nRemember, the President said costs would go down, that ObamaCare was \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  Millions face the prospect of losing the insurance they like and want \nto keep, which again is not what the President promised. That is why I \nhave asked the Senate to pass H.R. 2668. This legislation passed the \nHouse on a strong bipartisan vote with nearly 2 dozen Democrats \nsupporting it and it would delay some of ObamaCare's most burdensome \nmandates for everyone.\n  Shortly after its passage in the House my colleagues and I called on \nthe majority leader to bring it to the floor for a vote. Those calls \nwere unheeded. So I am disappointed to hear that some of our friends on \nthe other side have objected to this vote as well. I do not understand, \nfrankly, why they would want to leave Americans out in the cold. I note \nthat Members on this side are united in our belief that at the very \nleast Americans deserve the same relief as businesses do. So we will \nall be supporting this commonsense bipartisan bill if we have a chance \nto vote on it.\n  You would think this is a principle Members of the body would support \nunanimously. If it is OK for businesses, why not for individuals? \nUnfortunately, objection has been heard and we will not get an \nopportunity to have the same break for the average American citizen as \nthe administration is giving through executive action to businesses. It \nis a shame, but that is where we are going into the August recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n     Honoring our Armed Forces PRIVATE FIRST CLASS DUSTIN P. NAPIER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is with sorrow that I rise to pay \ntribute to a young man from Kentucky who gave his life in service to \nour country. PFC Dustin P. Napier of London, KY, died on January 8, \n2012, in Zabul Province, Afghanistan while in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. The cause of death was injuries sustained from small-\narms fire. PFC Napier was 20 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, PFC Napier received several awards, \nmedals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Army \nAchievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the \nOverseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, \nand the Overseas Service Bar.\n  Dustin's father Darrell Napier says of his son, ``He was born in an \nArmy hospital, and I'm sure he ended up dying in an Army hospital. He \nwas my hero. Please pray for us.''\n  Dustin was born in an Army hospital because he followed his father's \nexample of military service. Darrell Napier served in the U.S. Army \nfrom 1989 to 1994, and was stationed in Germany and Fort Polk, LA. \nDustin, the youngest of Darrell's three sons, knew from an early age he \nwanted a military career.\n  ``He'd been wanting to do that since he was a little boy, about when \nhe was six years old,'' Darrell recalls. ``I encouraged him to do so. \nAnd he was a leader. He'd take the initiative to get things done. I've \nalways raised my boys to do the right thing, no matter if the cause was \npopular or unpopular.''\n  By the time he reached high school, Dustin was a top cadet in his \nJunior ROTC program. ``I remember him as a model student, very quiet \nand serious. You always knew where he stood,'' says Colonel Mark Jones \nof the Air Force Junior ROTC program at South Laurel High School, \nDustin's alma mater.\n  Dustin rose to be his Junior ROTC unit's corps commander and the most \ndecorated cadet.\n  News of PFC Napier's loss shook many who remembered him at South\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nLaurel High, where Dustin graduated in 2010 and had many friends. \n``When I . . . heard he died, my legs almost collapsed. It was \nunbelievable. He was a good friend, a good mentor, and truly a good \nperson,'' says Devan Burkhart, a South Laurel student.\n  ``I learned from him. He was the one who would tell me, `Stick with \nit,' when I got frustrated with the program, and I did stick with it.''\n  Steven Cheek, one of Dustin's best friends and a high-school \nclassmate, recalls the fun he and Dustin had shooting rifles, going to \nball games, watching movies, and listening to music. Dustin's favorite \ngroup was the Doors. Other friends remember Dustin loved to play the \nair guitar.\n  After graduating from South Laurel High in May 2010, Dustin joined \nthe U.S. Army in July and completed basic training at Fort Benning, GA. \nIn April 2011, he was deployed to Afghanistan with C Company, 1st \nBattalion, 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, based out of \nFort Wainwright, AK.\n  Darrell Napier recalls that Dustin would call home from Afghanistan \nevery now and then. ``He did miss home a lot,'' Darrell says. ``He \nloved to hang out with his friends very much. He missed his friends at \nSave-A-Lot, where he worked for almost four years. And if there was one \nmeal Dustin really loved from his mother, it was her chicken and \ndumplings.''\n  Dustin also found happiness thousands of feet in the air, while on \nR It was in an airplane that he met Tabitha Sturgill Napier, who he \nmarried in October 2011.\n  Remembering her husband, Tabitha says, ``You are my very best friend \nand I love you very, very, very much. You are an amazing husband.''\n  A few days after his death, friends and classmates held a memorial \nservice for Dustin at South Laurel High School. His friends from his \nold Junior ROTC unit thought it only fitting to hold the service where \nDustin had served as such a fine example to past, present, and future \ncadets. Outside the school, the American flag stood at half-mast.\n  ``Cadet Napier came here with a purpose from start to finish, from \nthe first fall-in to the last fall-out,'' says CMSgt Randy Creech of \nJunior ROTC.\n  We are thinking of PFC Napier's loved ones today, including his wife, \nTabitha Sturgill Napier; his parents, Darrell and Marianne Napier; his \nbrother, Darrell Dean Napier; his stepbrother, Christopher Bittner; his \nstepson, Lane Robison; his grandmother, Monika Paul; his grandfather, \nJames Napier; and many other beloved friends and family members.\n  I know that no words spoken in this chamber can take away the sadness \nand loss that Dustin's family must feel. But I do want them to know \nthat this Nation, and this United States Senate, are deeply grateful \nfor Private First Class Dustin P. Napier's service and sacrifice. And \nwe are humbled to pay tribute to his life and legacy.\n\n\n                                 Burma\n\n  Madam President, today I rise to discuss U.S. policy toward the \nSoutheast Asian nation of Burma.\n  In a little over 2\\1/2\\ half years, the world has witnessed dramatic \nchange in Burma; change that would have been thought unimaginable not \nlong ago. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been \nreleased from house arrest and now sits in parliament. Hundreds of \npolitical prisoners have been released from prison. A largely free and \nfair by-election was held in April 2012. Ceasefires have been signed \nbetween the central government and several ethnic minority groups.\n  Yet, despite these welcome reforms, much work remains to be done. At \nthe heart of Burma's existing problems is the need for constitutional \nreform. The current flawed constitution is not up to the task of \nsupporting the country's democratic ambitions. Simply put, if Burma is \nto take the next big step toward economic and political reform and \ntoward fully normalizing its relations with the United States, it needs \nto revise its constitution.\n  And there has been some encouraging news on that front. Just last \nweek the Burmese parliament announced it would establish a committee to \nexamine amending the constitution. This provides a great opportunity \nfor the Burmese leadership to follow through on its commitment to full \ndemocratization.\n  As this parliamentary panel begins its efforts, I would highlight \nfour areas of the constitution that are, in my view, in particular need \nof reform.\n  The first area of reform is the need to bring the Burmese military, \ncalled the Tatmadaw, under civilian control. Civilian control of the \nmilitary is a fundamental condition of a stable, modern democratic \ncountry. Many of the stubborn problems Burma still needs to address \nstem from the continued outsized role of the military in Burmese \npolitical life. For example, Burma continues to maintain military ties \nwith North Korea. Indications are that elements within the Burmese \nmilitary want to continue enjoying the financial benefits of continued \nrelations with North Korea.\n  The unfortunate result is that Burma's pro-reform president Thein \nSein cannot formally rein in the Tatmadaw since, under the \nConstitution, the president is not head of the armed forces. A separate \nmilitary Commander in Chief leads the armed forces and he is \nindependent of the president.\n  Another example of the problems stemming from the lack of civilian \ncontrol of the military is the tense state of relations between the \narmed forces and the Kachin ethnic group. The Kachin in northern Burma \nshare a proud history with the United States stemming from our close \ncooperation during World War II. Ending the conflict in Kachin state--\nand all other ethnic conflicts for that matter--is essential to \nachieving lasting peace, reconciliation and security in Burma after 60 \nyears of civil war.\n  In Europe recently, President Thein Sein predicted that a national \nceasefire was right around the corner. And a peace process led by one \nof his close ministers has been ongoing. However, military clashes \ncontinue in northern Shan state as well as in Kachin state. The \nTatmadaw has every right to protect itself, but, without transparency \nand civilian oversight, questions remain about the extent to which \nmilitary operations have conformed with the President's guidance and \nintentions.\n  Without ending its relationship with Pyongyang and without building \npeace with the Kachin and other ethnic nationalities, U.S.-Burmese \nrelations will not become fully normalized. Without the military \naccepting civilian oversight and demonstrating a commitment to peace, \nour military relationship will likewise be limited. Such a result would \nbe to the detriment of both countries.\n  Having U.S. diplomats continue to urge Burma to amend its \nConstitution to bring the military under civilian control is important. \nBut there are other policy tools that I believe can help reform the \nTatmadaw. I believe that beginning a modest military-to-military \nrelationship would serve this purpose. Just to be clear. I am not \nadvocating rushing into lethal training of the Burmese military or arms \nsales. What I am talking about is the U.S. armed forces engaging with \nthe Tatmadaw on compliance with the law of armed conflict, and other \nissues related to international standards of military professionalism.\n  What better way is there to show the virtues of civilian control of \nthe military than to have the most highly regarded armed forces in the \nworld--the U.S. military--engaged with the Tatmadaw about respect for \nhuman rights, accountability and rule of law? I believe that a modest, \ntargeted military-to-military relationship would work hand in glove \nwith diplomatic efforts to convince the Burmese military that placing \nthemselves under civilian control is good for the nation.\n  Beginning a military-to-military relationship is common sense. Since \nbefore independence, the Burmese military has been a significant \npolitical institution in the country. And no lasting reform in Burma \ncan take place without convincing the Tatmadaw that such a step is a \npositive development for the country.\n  A second area of needed constitutional reform involves amending the \nconstitution to permit the Burmese people to choose freely whom they \nwant to serve as their leader. This is a fundamental democratic \nprinciple. Current restrictions include a requirement that no one in \nthe President's immediate family can be a citizen born to parents who \nwere not born in Burma.\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nJust think about that. That's a remarkably narrow requirement. Why does \nthe Burmese government have so little faith in the ability of its \ncitizens to freely and responsibly choose their own leaders?\n  These provisions, if left unamended, would cast a pall over the \nupcoming 2015 elections. And, those elections are viewed by many \nobservers as the next high-profile step in Burma's reform efforts. If \nthe 2015 elections are viewed as illegitimate, it will lead many to \nconclude that reform efforts have stalled in Burma and the country's \nstated commitment to democracy is hollow.\n  I think having the 2015 elections turn out to be flawed would cloud \nthe reformist legacy of the current national leadership.\n  A third area of needed reform in this regard is judicial \nindependence. Currently, the Burmese judiciary is not independent of \nthe executive. As we ourselves have learned from experience in America, \nhaving judges who are not under the thumb of the other branches is not \nonly a vital check on the other organs of government, but also a \nbulwark against violations of individual rights.\n  Finally, there need to be constitutional assurances for ethnic \nminorities. Burma faces no greater challenge than peacefully \nintegrating its various ethnic groups. These groups have long harbored \nmisstrust of the central government and the Tatmadaw. Building \nprotections for ethnic minorities into the Constitution would, I \nsuspect, go a long way toward making the ethnic groups more receptive \nto the new government. Such provisions would also be underscored by an \nindependent judiciary to help enforce these protections.\n  As we know as Americans, amending a Constitution is not easy, nor \nshould it be. But over the years, we in this country have amended our \nConstitution to make it more democratic and to provide greater \nprotection of individual liberties.\n  Reforming the Burmese Constitution in areas such as the four I just \nraised is a necessary next step in Burma's own journey toward democracy \nand peaceful, national reconciliation.\n  There is still time for Burma to act ahead of the 2015 election and \ncorrect these problems. I urge the country's leadership to seize the \nmoment, to take this vital step and to cement its reformist legacy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                 Keep The IRS Off Your Health Care Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, turning to the matter upon which I asked \nunanimous consent and to which the majority leader objected, and that \nis to take up legislation that I have sponsored here in the Senate, \nwhich has been passed in the House, which is the Keep the IRS Off Your \nHealth Care Act, with each passing day it seems as though more and more \nsupporters of ObamaCare are having second thoughts. As I mentioned last \nweek, three of America's most powerful labor leaders have declared the \nPresident's health care law is ``creating nightmare scenarios'' and \nthreatening to ``hurt millions of Americans.'' Those are some pretty \nremarkable words from people who were some of the foremost advocates \nfor the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare.\n  Meanwhile, the union that represents IRS employees has announced it \ndoes not want its members to receive health insurance through ObamaCare \nexchanges. In fact, earlier today the IRS Commissioner himself said he \nwants to keep his current health care policy and does not want to sign \nup for ObamaCare, as millions of other Americans will be required to \ndo.\n  Speaking of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency's political \ntargeting scandal continues to grow. I listened in my office to Senator \nHatch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, the one \nprimarily responsible for Internal Revenue oversight in the Senate, and \nI hope the questions he posed will be answered by the bipartisan \ninvestigation we are conducting. We recently learned the Internal \nRevenue Service's Chief Counsel's Office, headed by an Obama \nadministration appointee, was aware of the abuses. So much for a couple \nof rogue agents in Cincinnati, as was originally reported. We have also \nlearned that IRS officials have been improperly targeted, not only \nconservative organizations but political candidates and donors as well.\n\n  To make things worse, the same person who ran the IRS division that \ntargeted conservative groups is now running the agency's ObamaCare \noffice. I can't make this stuff up. Truth is stranger than fiction. \nAmericans might be asking: What does the IRS have to do with ObamaCare?\n  America's tax collection agency will be responsible for administering \nseveral of the law's most important provisions, including the \nindividual and employer mandates, which we have heard so much about, \nand all of the subsidies. In other words, all of the tax dollars will \ngo to fund the exchanges under ObamaCare. Those will be administered by \nthe Internal Revenue Service under the current law.\n  It is remarkable that at a time when public trust and the Internal \nRevenue Service has plummeted and IRS officials are complaining their \nstaffers are overworked and overburdened, the Obama administration \nwants to use this tax agency to administer a massive new entitlement \nprogram affecting one-sixth of our national economy. To me, that sounds \nlike another recipe for disaster.\n  Back in May I sponsored legislation that would prevent the Internal \nRevenue Service from a role in implementing ObamaCare. Last week, I \nintroduced it as an amendment to the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment appropriations bill that was pending before this Chamber.\n  Congressman Tom Price of Georgia has introduced a similar bill in the \nHouse of Representatives. Unfortunately--and this is pretty amazing--\neven before the House passed the House bill and before the Senate had a \nchance to take up the Senate bill, President Obama has already issued a \nveto threat were we to pass it. It sounds a little defensive to me. I \nunderstand ObamaCare is a deeply decisive issue in Washington, and I \nunderstand that while many have been compelled to defend the law \npreviously, they are now feeling a little skittish about it 3 years \nlater.\n  I ask my colleagues: Given all we have learned about corruption and \ninstitutional abuse at the Internal Revenue Service, does anyone truly \nbelieve we should dramatically expand the agency's power to implement \nObamaCare? Does anyone truly believe IRS agents should have access to \neven more personal financial information--not to mention medical \ninformation--about American citizens? If IRS officials conducted a \nsystematic campaign of political targeting against conservative \norganizations, why should we have any more confidence that the agency \nwill fairly and objectively implement the President's health care law?\n  Remember, the IRS has already announced it will violate the text of \nthe law and issue health care subsidies through Federal exchanges. \nLet's recall what happened. Many States said: We will pass on State-\nbased insurance exchanges upon which ObamaCare depends to be \nimplemented in the States. So what the IRS has said is: We are going to \npaper over the fact that Congress never explicitly authorized tax \ndollars to subsidize the Federal exchanges, even though the law clearly \nstates that those subsidies can be issued only through State exchanges. \nThat is another example of lawlessness when it comes to ObamaCare.\n  In other words, the agency has already shown utter contempt for the \nrule of law when it comes to implementing the President's most \ncherished legislative accomplishment. They have already shown that \ncontempt, and they don't deserve, nor have they shown themselves worthy \nof, our confidence when it comes to implementing this health care law.\n  In my view, the IRS has absolutely no business playing such a huge \nrole in the American health care system. For that matter, I ask my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle one final question: Do you still \nbelieve ObamaCare will reduce health care costs? After all, it is \nestimated that the law will cause a dramatic spike in individual \ninsurance premiums across the country--from Maryland to Florida, to \nIndiana and Ohio, to Kentucky and Missouri, to Idaho and California.\n  Earlier this week, for example, the Florida insurance commissioner \npredicted that because of ObamaCare, the\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\ncost of health insurance in the individual market and Florida will \nincrease by 30 to 40 percent. The reason for that is because the \nprovisions in ObamaCare mandate the guaranteed issuance of health \ninsurance even after a person is sick. Someone compared it to waiting \nuntil your house is on fire to buy insurance. It is not insurance \nanymore, and it drives up the cost, not to mention the fact that young \npeople--such as those sitting in front of me--are going to have to pay \nthe price of subsidizing health care for older Americans. The so-called \nage-banding requirements don't allow older citizens to pay any more \nthan three times what young people pay for health insurance, even \nthough the cost of their health care, given their age, will be higher.\n  So this is what distorts the insurance markets, which is causing \nhealth insurance premiums to skyrocket across the States because of \nObamaCare.\n  Rather than make our individual health insurance markets even more \ndistorted and more dysfunctional than they are today, we should \ndismantle ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered reforms that \ncreate a genuine national marketplace for health insurance.\n  I was just reading a story about an Oklahoma surgical center which \npublishes the price of common procedures for the public to read and \nwhich now has created--what markets always do--greater consumer \nawareness of what exactly these procedures cost. As we have seen in \nMedicare Part D, the prescription drug plan Congress passed a few years \nago, when a market is created and vendors compete for consumers' \nbusiness, prices go down and the quality of service goes up. That is \nwhat markets do. Ultimately, it benefits the consumer, and it would \nbenefit taxpayers and patients as well.\n  What do I mean by patient-centered reforms? I am talking about \nreforms that empower individual Americans by giving them more choices \nand flexibility in the health care markets--such as the example of the \nOklahoma surgical care center--by giving people more transparent \ninformation about pricing and quality and by directly assisting people \nwith preexisting conditions.\n\n  I heard the majority leader earlier when Senator McConnell offered a \nunanimous consent to extend the moratorium on the individual mandate \njust as the President has unilaterally on the employer mandate. He said \nsomething to the effect of: Republicans want people to be subjected to \npreexisting condition exclusions that are not covered. That is simply \nfalse. We don't have to embrace 2,700 pages of ObamaCare just to take \ncare of that problem or other problems we have agreement on. We should \nalso work to protect the doctor-patient relationship.\n  The last thing we ought to do on my list of things to do to reform \nthe health care system is to save Medicare from bankruptcy. It is on an \nunsustainable path. Yet any time we try to suggest reforms that will \nstrengthen and stabilize Medicare and make sure it is there for future \ngenerations, they are met with a ``stiff-arm.''\n  If we want to reduce health care costs, if we want to expand quality \ninsurance coverage and give Americans more choices and options, we \nshould equalize the tax treatment for health insurance so it is treated \nthe same whether it is provided by your employer or whether an \nindividual buys it. We should let individuals and businesses form risk \npools in the individual market, and we should let folks buy health \ninsurance across State lines.\n  Why shouldn't I be able to buy health insurance in New Hampshire or \nAlabama or somewhere else if it fits my needs? Right now that is not \npossible. It would create a market which would create competition, \nbring down costs, and make it more affordable. We should expand tax-\nfree health savings accounts so people can save their own money and \nspend it as they see fit on their health care. If they don't spend it \nthere, it is available for their retirement, much like any other \nindividual retirement account.\n  We should curb frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits. According to \none study, the annual cost of defensive medicine is a staggering $210 \nbillion. In my State, we have had a lot of success with medical \nmalpractice reform. It stabilized the cost of medical malpractice \ninsurance that physicians have to buy, and it created a huge surplus of \nphysicians who want to move to Texas and practice their profession. \nThey realize they will not lose everything they have in the litigation \nlottery. They can buy affordable coverage that will protect their \nfamily and their patients should they make mistakes.\n  We should give each State much more flexibility to design a Medicaid \nProgram that works best for their neediest residents. Medicaid is a \nwonderful program, but it is broken. This is designed to protect the \nmost vulnerable people in our society and provide for their health care \nneeds. But because of the broken Medicaid Program, only one out of \nevery three doctors in my State will actually see a new Medicaid \npatient. Medicaid reimburses at about half of what private insurance \nreimburses, and as a result many doctors can't afford to see a new \nMedicaid patient. What we have is the appearance of coverage, but there \nis no real access to the doctor of their choice. So we need to fix \nMedicaid.\n  Finally, we should establish greater provider competition in Medicare \nso the competition I mentioned a moment ago in the Medicare \nprescription drug program could also apply in other aspects of Medicare \nand help make it more affordable, shore it up, and guarantee its \navailability to generations yet to come.\n  There is no reason why Americans have to accept an unworkable health \ncare law administered by an agency such as the Internal Revenue Service \nthat has grossly abused its power and demonstrated that its current job \nis way beyond its capacity to perform.\n  I realize we will not be able to dismantle ObamaCare overnight--not \nwith President Obama still in the White House and with a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate. I realize many of these issues need to be \ndebated further, but I hope we can all agree that the Internal Revenue \nService, the IRS, should not be administering a law that affects one-\nsixth of our national economy and which so dramatically affects the \nquality of life for 320 million Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, last week in Illinois President Obama \nattempted to blame opponents of the ObamaCare for the law's broken \npromises. He lashed out at what he called ``folks out there who are \nactively working to make this law fail.'' Those were his words. He \nfurther said: ``[A] politically motivated misinformation campaign'' is \nafoot. He strongly implied that fault rests not with those who \nconceived the law but those who have not, in his estimation, \n``committed themselves to making [it] work.''\n  Think about it a minute. This flailing, of course, was nothing more \nthan an effort by President Obama to dodge and deflect accountability \nfor the law that bears his name. Let's be real. ObamaCare is not a \nfailure because so many Americans reject it, rather so many Americans \nreject ObamaCare because it is a failure. I believe we should focus on \nwhat truly matters.\n  Americans are growing increasingly anxious about how the law will \naffect them and their families. They wonder what it will mean for \nhealth insurance and tax bills. They wonder whether they will be able \nto get the care they need when they need it. They wonder whether the \nquality of American health care will remain the best in the world and, \nyes, they wonder how a government reorganization of one-sixth of the \neconomy will impact a weak jobs market. Unfortunately, neither the \noutset nor the outlook provides consolation.\n  President Obama has frequently sought to downplay the debacle \nsurrounding the rollout of his health care law. He says ``that glitches \nand bumps'' are to be expected. But as the Wall Street Journal \ncolumnist Kimberly Strassel notes, the Democrats didn't ``count on the \nhiccups turning into cardiac arrest,'' and that is what happened.\n  Since the enactment of ObamaCare, a laundry list of unworkable \nprovisions has been repealed or delayed. But recently the \nadministration announced two particularly notable delays.\n\n  First, the administration will delay implementation of the law's \nemployer mandate until 2015 because workable\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\nreporting requirements are not yet in place. This provision requires \nall employers in this country with more than 50 employees to provide \nadequate health care coverage for full-time employees, defined as those \nemployed at least 30 hours per week or pay a penalty. In anticipation \nof this mandate many employers are cutting back hours for current \nworkers and holding off on hiring new ones.\n  I welcome any relief from ObamaCare for anyone in this country, but \nwhy should such relief not apply to individuals and families as well as \nbusinesses? If the administration hasn't gotten its act together by \nnow, what leads us to believe it ever will? Instead of temporarily \ndelaying part of ObamaCare for some, I believe the best course would be \nto permanently delay all of it for everyone.\n  The administration also recently announced postponement of a critical \ntaxpayer protection under ObamaCare. Taxpayers were previously told the \ngovernment would verify that applicants actually qualify for subsidies \nbefore receiving them. Now the administration says it is not ready to \ndo that until 2015, although it will still go ahead with enrollment in \nthe program in 2014. So for the coming year, the Obama administration \nwill trust but not verify anything. The honor system, I believe, is no \ntaxpayer protection.\n  These are not run-of-the-mill glitches and bumps, as the President \nwould say. These provisions are central to the legislation and may \nforeshadow major problems to come, as we find out every day. These \nprovisions are unworkable or problematic not because people don't like \nthem but because they were poorly designed. This isn't about a lack of \ncommitment on behalf of those forced to comply with these mandates. \nRather, it is about a lack of confidence on behalf of those who \nconceived and crafted these provisions.\n  In light of the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, Americans are also \napprehensive about the cost--yes, the cost. How will all of this impact \ntheir health insurance premiums? What will be the tax burden? What will \na new entitlement program do to our $17 trillion debt, which is \ngrowing?\n  With respect to premiums, President Obama told the American people \nhis health care overhaul ``could save families $2,500 in the coming \nyears.'' Those were his words. But despite this bold claim, health \ninsurance premiums for the average American family have increased over \n$3,000 since 2008, and this is according to the Kaiser Family \nFoundation Employer Health Benefit Survey, which is very well \nrespected.\n  Moreover, a recent Wall Street Journal analysis finds that premiums \nfor healthy consumers could double or even triple under ObamaCare. Can \nwe imagine that?\n  Although ObamaCare has not decreased premiums, it has certainly \nincreased taxes. According to the Congressional Budget Office--CBO--and \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, ObamaCare imposes a $1 trillion tax \nhike on the American economy over just the first 10 years--a $1 \ntrillion tax hike. Their analysis finds 21 tax hikes in ObamaCare due \nto the law's various mandates and restrictions. Among these, several \naffect individuals making less than $200,000 and married couples making \nless than $250,000--a clear violation of President Obama's often \nrepeated campaign promise not to do so.\n  Despite this massive tax hike, ObamaCare will still add $6.2 \ntrillion--yes, $6.2 trillion--to the debt in the years ahead. This is \nbased on the Government Accountability Office projections. This clearly \nviolates yet another promise by the President that he would ``not sign \na plan that adds one dime to our deficit--either now or in the \nfuture.'' Goodness.\n  I believe ObamaCare will not only fail to control costs but will also \ndestroy the best quality health care in the world--ours. Why do I say \nthis? In 2009, Dr. Martin Feldstein, Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers under President Reagan and a Harvard professor, wrote \nan op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled ``ObamaCare Is All About \nRationing.'' He backed up his statement by citing a report issued by \nPresident Obama's own Council of Economic Advisers which explained how \nthe President would propose to reduce health spending by eliminating \ncertain treatments--by rationing.\n  Dr. Feldstein went on to compare the Obama strategy to that of the \nBritish national health service. He concluded the existence of such a \nprogram in the United States would not only deny lifesaving care but \nwould also cast a pall over medical researchers who would fear that \ngovernment experts might project their discoveries as ``too \nexpensive.''\n  Think of the implications of rationing health care. What does it mean \nfor a patient sitting in the doctor's office when they get a life-\nchanging diagnosis? I know that feeling. I have been there. It \nreassured me to know we have the best health care in the world and that \neverything possible would be done to save my life. I want others who \nencounter that situation to have the same reassurance. But will they?\n  Despite what President Obama may say, it is not just Republicans who \nhave deep concerns about health care. This week, on the same Wall \nStreet Journal opinion pages, Howard Dean, a former Democratic National \nCommittee chairman and Governor, as well as a physician, concurred with \nDr. Feldstein. Mr. Dean wrote that ObamaCare's independent payment \nadvisory board--IPAB--``is essentially a health care rationing body.'' \nBy setting doctor reimbursement rates for Medicare and determining \nwhich procedures and drugs will be covered and at what price, the IPAB \nwill be able to stop certain treatments its members do not favor by \nsimply setting rates to levels where no doctor or hospital will perform \nthem. That was the plan.\n  Mr. Dean went on to say, ``These kinds of schemes do not control \ncosts. The medical system simply becomes more bureaucratic.''\n  We all know now ObamaCare is a bureaucratic nightmare. With more than \n20,000 pages of new rules and regulations, the law expands government \nto an unprecedented level, creating 159 new boards, commissions, and \ngovernment offices. Think of it.\n  Adding to these concerns, Deloitte's 2013 Survey of U.S. Physicians \nfinds that due to recent developments in health care, ``the future of \nthe medical profession as we know it may be in jeopardy as it loses \nclinical autonomy and compensation.'' The survey by Deloitte also found \nthat ``6 in 10 physicians''--6 in 10--``say it is likely that many \nphysicians will retire earlier than planned in the next 1 to 3 years.''\n  Again, sitting in that doctor's office, I remember breathing a little \neasier to know we have not only the most advanced treatments but also \nthe most skilled and experienced physicians in the world. We don't want \nto jeopardize that, do we?\n  In addition to concerns about the quality of care, the Obama \nadministration has backtracked on still another of the President's \npromises. In 2009, he stated unambiguously: ``If you like your doctor, \nyou will be able to keep your doctor. Period.'' The President's words.\n  Despite this pledge, the Department of Health and Human Services, \nunder the Obama administration, recently posted the following on \nhealthcare.gov: ``Depending on the plan you choose in the marketplace, \nyou may be able to keep your current doctor.'' It says ``may'' be able \nto keep your doctor. That is not what the President told the American \npeople.\n  A University of Chicago study underscores this finding that more than \nhalf of current individual insurance plans do not meet ObamaCare's \nstandard to be sold on the exchanges. So much for that ironclad \npromise.\n  But there is another area: ObamaCare is a job killer. How will \nObamaCare affect jobs? In President Obama's recent Illinois speech I \nmentioned earlier, he made the following curious statement about \nRepublicans and job creation: ``They'll bring up ObamaCare despite the \nfact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this \nrecovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery when there \nwas no ObamaCare.''\n  This is a non sequitur. At a minimum, President Obama implied that \nObamaCare has not hurt job creation. At worst, he implied it has \nhelped.\n  In stark contrast, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's second quarter 2013 \nSmall Business Survey in America finds that ``71 percent of small \nbusinesses--and that is the job creation machine in this country--say \nthe health care law makes it harder to\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\nhire.'' The same survey finds that ``one-half of small businesses say \nthat they will either cut hours to reduce full-time employees or \nreplace full-time employees with part-time workers to avoid the \nmandate.''\n  In addition, Gallup finds that ``41 percent of small business owners \nsay they have held off on hiring new employees'' in response to \nObamaCare.\n  The 1-year delay on ObamaCare's employer mandate provides momentary \nrelief. But in light of sustained high unemployment in this country, I \nfind it deeply troubling that perhaps the best thing President Obama \nhas done for American business during his time in office is to provide \nonly a brief reprieve from his own signature achievement.\n  Notably, labor unions agree with businesses now, that ObamaCare will \nhurt the economy. Recently, in a scathing letter to Democratic leaders \nin Congress, the president of the Teamsters Union, the UFCW, and UNITE-\nHERE, wrote that ``ObamaCare will shatter not only our hard-earned \nhealth benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek \nthat is the backbone of the American middle class.''\n  This brings me full circle to where I began my remarks. President \nObama conveniently blames Republican opposition for the stumbles and \nfailures of ObamaCare, despite the fact that Americans across the \npolitical spectrum have spoken up about its many flaws.\n  President Obama rammed his health care legislation through Congress \nwithout a single Republican vote. Why? Because he knew he did not need \nour votes to put the entire Nation under his health care plan. Yet now \nhe claims that ObamaCare works for those who are ``committed to it.'' \nCommitted to it?\n  Republicans are committed to finding solutions that actually lower \nhealth costs, that do not tax and spend us into oblivion, that preserve \nthe world's highest quality health care, and that foster economic \ngrowth. We have said all along that ObamaCare would fail on each of \nthese counts.\n  I believe opposition to ObamaCare is not responsible for its \nfailures, and commitment to it will not negate its deep flaws. The only \nway to achieve the goals we all share is to begin by repealing this \nfailed law so we can replace it with a plan that works. I hope we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      The Economy and Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to share some remarks \nabout the economic condition of American workers, the immigration bill \nthat passed here recently, and in general about where we are as a \nNation and the difficulties we are facing.\n  I think there is a growing acceptance by most experts that we have, \nindeed, seen a decline in the wages of the middle-class and working \nAmericans relative to inflation since maybe as long ago as 1999--a \nsteady erosion of their income relative to the price of products they \nbuy. That is not a healthy trend.\n  President Obama talked about it, our Democratic colleagues talked \nabout it a lot when President Bush was President. But it has continued. \nI thought maybe it was an aberration, but I do not think so anymore. I \nthink a lot of things are happening with robotics, ObamaCare, other \nthings that are happening, that are making it more difficult for \nworkers to find jobs--unemployment remains exceedingly high--and to \nhave wage increases.\n  One of the things I noticed this week from the Republican side of the \naisle is that Congress received two letters--one from Republican \ndonors, according to some, and another from CEOs--urging that Congress \nact on immigration. This is primarily to the House Members.\n  Nearly 100 top Republican donors, they called themselves, and Bush \nadministration officials sent a letter to the House Republicans on \nTuesday urging lawmakers to pass a bill that legalizes illegal \nimmigrants. The donor letter came the same day the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and 400 other businesses and umbrella groups fired off another \nletter to the House leaders of both parties urging them to pass \nsomething.\n  One word was not mentioned in either one of those letters: Wages. Nor \nwas any discussion of jobs and unemployment raised in those letters.\n  Mr. Karl Rove--a man I know and like and a long-time friend--and \nthese groups would have us believe this legislation is about the \nproviding of amnesty to people who have been here a long time. That \ncertainly is a large part of it. Businesses know that legalizing \nillegal workers will, indeed, expand the available labor pool for \nindustries with the effect, I suggest, of bringing down wages, \nparticularly in the areas where illegal workers might have previously \nnot had access. So of the 11 million people, perhaps half, we \nunderstand, do not have fake documents, are not able to work in the \nlabor force, effectively, and they take marginal jobs. If this bill \nwere to pass, all would immediately be given Social Security Numbers, \nand they could apply to any job in America.\n  That is both a good thing and a difficult thing. It is good that they \nwould be able to work. It is not so good if you wanted one of the jobs \nthat would be taken.\n  But there is a phrase in the letter which has gotten too little \nattention and which explains what this is all about. Mr. Rove and the \ndonors say, the legislation must ``provide a legal way for U.S.-based \ncompanies to hire the workers they need.''\n  So we are supposed to pass a law that guarantees American companies \nthe right to hire whoever they need, whoever they say they need, \nwhoever they believe is best for them. That means the best worker at \nthe lowest price. That is what free markets are all about. That is what \nthe law of supply and demand is all about. It has not been repealed, by \nthe way, the law of supply and demand.\n  First and foremost, that cannot be the goal of an immigration policy \nof the United States of America. It cannot be the overriding policy of \nour system to provide and to make sure that whatever workers our \ncompanies want at whatever price, apparently, they are willing to pay \nor want to pay--that we allow workers to come in from abroad and take \nthose jobs, regardless of the unemployment rate in America, regardless \nof the number of people who are on welfare, on unemployment \ncompensation, who have not had a good paycheck in a number of years, \nperhaps.\n  Our responsibility and our goal is to serve the people of this \ncountry and to try to create a climate, an economic agenda that allows \nthem to prosper and to actually find jobs and actually get pay raises, \nnot pay reductions.\n  Of course, there is already a legal way for U.S.-based companies to \nhire workers they need. They can hire the people living here today who \nare unemployed. Or they can hire some of the million-plus immigrants \nwhom we lawfully admit each year. We have a very generous immigration \npolicy. No one is talking about ending that and not allowing \nimmigration to continue. We allow about 1.1 million immigrants a year \ncome to America lawfully, plus guest workers who come specifically to \nwork. That is very generous. But this bill would double the number of \nguest workers and increase substantially the number of people who come \nthrough immigration to become permanent residents in our country, at a \ntime of high unemployment--much higher unemployment than we had in \n2007. That bill would have allowed much fewer people to come into the \ncountry, and it was rejected by the American people.\n  No one is saying these programs cannot and should not exist, and that \nthey should not be improved. But I am afraid the businesses want the \nchoicest pick of labor at the lowest cost they can get it. That is what \nbusinesses do. That is what businesses want every day. When they go out \nand interview people, they want the best person they can get at the \nleast cost. That is what their stockholders demand. So they believe the \nimmigration policy for the entire Nation should exist to create an \nabundance of low-cost labor. I do not agree with that.\n\n  They, in their bubble they live in, think lower wages are good. You \nhear\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\nabout it: There are concerns over rising wages. It might drive up \nprices, you hear the Wall Street Journal say.\n  Well, maybe some politicians think that way too. They are not \nconcerned with how the plan impacts workers, the immigrants themselves, \npublic resources, the education system, or taxpayer dollars. They are \nnot focused on the broader economic and social concerns that happen \nwhen someone is not able to get a job for years at a decent wage. The \nfocus tends to be on the reduction of the cost of labor.\n  But America has a larger concern. That concern is unemployment. It is \nworkplace participation. It is wages. And it is the cost of social \nservices to those in need. We all agree we must make America more \ncompetitive globally. Workers must be productive and competitive. But \nhow do we close the income gap? How do we deal with that?\n  The best way to do that is not to reduce our wages and workers' \nquality of life. The way to do that is with a less burdensome Tax Code, \na less intrusive regulatory system, and a tougher, smarter, fair trade \npolicy. These policies would make us more competitive and help wages \nand working conditions improve.\n  So when these business voices and establishment figures say the GOP \nneeds to support a comprehensive immigration bill, what they are really \nsaying is the GOP and the Congress of both parties--which in the \nSenate, of course, a minority of Republicans voted for the bill, and \nevery single Democrat voted for the bill. They would have done the \nthings I am concerned about.\n  Now they are worried about the Republican House and they are trying \nto put the pressure on them. What they are saying is, we need to \nincrease low-skill immigration, when we do not have enough jobs now. \nThe Senate bill, based on CBO analysis, would provide legal status to \n46 million people--mostly lower skilled immigrants--by 2033--46 \nmillion. Here is what the National Review editorialized on the subject:\n\n       By more than doubling the number of so-called guest workers \n     admitted each year, the bill would help create a permanent \n     underclass of foreign workers. The 2007 Bush-Kennedy proposal \n     was rejected in part because it would have added 125,000 new \n     guest workers. The Gang of Eight bill--The one we just passed \n     in the Senate--would add 1.6 million in the first year, and \n     about 600,000 a year after that and that is on top of a 50 \n     percent or more increase in the total level of legal \n     immigration. The creation of a large population of second-\n     class workers is undesirable from the point of view of the \n     American national interest, which should be our guiding force \n     in this matter. The United States is a nation with an \n     economy, not an economy with a nation.\n\n  This Nation owes certain things to its citizens, the people who are \nhere now. We have a lot--300 million--and many of them are hurting. We \nowe them the best opportunity--owe them the best opportunity--to be \nsuccessful and have a decent job with increasing wages, not declining.\n  Here is what conservative writer Yuval Levin wrote in a recent op-ed. \nI am saying this because these are conservative writers.\n\n       The Left's economic policies (and the legacy of decades of \n     right-wing confusion about the difference between being pro-\n     market and being pro-business too) are making the American \n     economy less and less like the vision of capitalism that \n     conservatives should want to defend. They should consider \n     what now would be best for the cause of growth and \n     prosperity--the cause of free markets and free people.\n       Capitalism is fundamentally democratic, after all--we today \n     might say fundamentally populist and recovering this \n     understanding of conservative economics would help today's \n     Republicans see an enormous public need, and an enormous \n     political opportunity, they tend to miss, and to which \n     conservatism could be very usefully applied. It would point \n     to a conservative agenda to help working families better \n     afford life in the middle class, and to give more Americans a \n     chance to rise.\n  So this is, I guess, directed--too late now to deal with the Senate. \nIt passed the Senate, but not too late to deal with in the House, which \ndoes have a Republican majority. If Members of Congress want to broaden \ntheir appeal, the answer lies in speaking to the real and legitimate \nconcerns of millions of hurting Americans whose wages have declined and \nwhose job prospects have diminished.\n  The New York Times talked about this in 2000. They forgot about all \nof this now. But in 2000, they editorialized against an amnesty bill, \nwhat they called a ``hasty call for amnesty'' and warned that ``between \nabout 1980 and 1995 the gap between wages of high school dropouts and \nall other workers widened substantially.'' That is what the New York \nTimes said then. It remains true.\n  Professor George Borjas, himself an immigrant to America as a young \nman from Cuba, now at Harvard, perhaps the most effective and \nknowledgeable and respected scholar of wages and immigration in the \nworld, certainly in the United States, estimates--get this--that 40 \npercent, almost half, of the trend downward in wages today can be \ntraced to immigration from unskilled workers. Businesses do not have to \nbid up salaries to get good workers if you constantly have a flow of \npeople come in.\n  That data he reported has been updated. High levels of low-skilled \nimmigration between 1980 and 2000--and those levels would be greatly \nincreased if this bill that passed the Senate were to become law--have \nalready reduced wages of native workers without a high school diploma \nby 8 percent, according to Professor Borjas. He has analyzed Labor \nDepartment statistics, census data, and all kinds of data, according to \nthe highest academic standards.\n  Professor Borjas said their wages have fallen from 1980 to 2000 by 8 \npercent in real dollars as a result of the current flow of immigration. \nSo that is about $250 a month. You think that does not make a \ndifference to working Americans and their families, to lose $250 a \nmonth?\n  Oh, we do not want to talk about that. That is not a problem. The \nimmigration bill will increase wages, we are told. Professor Borjas \nsaid it has already reduced wages enough to be very painful to people \nwho are trying to take care of their families today. Wages continue to \nfall.\n  This is not only an economic problem, but it is a social problem. The \nidea that dramatically increasing the number of foreign workers to take \na limited number of American jobs will reduce unemployment and raise \nwages is so ridiculous it is hard to think it worth discussing. The \nvery idea of this is beyond my comprehension. Yet we have the President \nout there today sending out documents claiming just the opposite--the \nPresident of the United States. The law of supply and demand has not \nbeen eliminated. Wages today are lower than in 1999. Median household \nincome has declined 8 percent in that time. Some 47 million of our \nresidents are on food stamps today, including 1 in 3 households in \nDetroit. According to the Associated Press, four out of five U.S. \nadults struggle with joblessness, near poverty, or reliance on welfare.\n  There is no shortage of labor in the United States. There is a \nshortage of jobs in the United States. Our goal must be to help our \nstruggling Americans move from dependency to being independent, to help \nthem find steady jobs and rising pay, not declining pay. Our policy \ncannot be to simply relegate more and more of our citizens to \ndependence on the government while importing a steady stream of foreign \nworkers to take the available jobs. That is not in the interest of our \ncountry or the people of this country.\n  Some contend our unemployed do not have the needed skills. Well, \nlet's train them. We now spend over $750 billion a year on means-tested \nwelfare-assistance type programs. That is the largest item in the \nbudget, bigger than Social Security, bigger than defense, bigger than \nMedicare. Of that amount, for every $100 we spend on those programs, we \nonly spend $1 on job training. So we need to wake up here. We need to \nquit paying people not to work, quit delivering money that creates \ndependence, and shift our policies in a way that puts people to work \nand gets them trained to take the jobs that are here today.\n  As we leave for recess, my message to my colleagues in the House is \nthis: Do the right thing. Make your priority restoring the rule of law, \ndefending working Americans, and helping those struggling, immigrant \nand native born.\n  People who immigrate here lawfully want to go to work here and see \ntheir wages rise too. Their wages are being pulled down if the flow of \nimmigration is too large. It is amazing to me how the coalition has \nbeen put together. Some of the comments about it kind of take my breath \naway.\n  Here is what the President said today in his paper, claiming that \neverything\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nis going to be great with this huge increase of immigration that was in \nthe bill he wants to see passed in the House. This is their report. The \nbroader leisure and hospitality industry, one of the fastest growing \nsectors in the U.S. economy, also stands to benefit significantly from \ncommonsense immigration reform.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the leisure and \nhospitality industry has consistently added jobs over the last 3 years. \nThese sectors remain a source of robust economic activity and continue \nto exceed expectations. Leaders of these industries have been long-time \nproponents of legislation that would legalize workers in the United \nStates and facilitate the lawful employment of future foreign-born \nworkers.\n  The head of the American Hotel and Lodging Association this year \napplauded the Senate--I bet he did--on behalf of the lodging industry \nfor its bipartisan commitment to immigration reform that ``creates \njobs, boosts travel and tourism, preserves hoteliers' access to a \nstrong seasonal workforce, and stimulates economic growth.''\n  Well, sure. He would rather be able to have a large flow of workers \nfrom abroad take the jobs. What happens to the Americans who are not \ngetting jobs? Are they on the food stamp rolls, the assistance rolls? \nAre they on unemployment compensation? Are they otherwise struggling to \nget by with government assistance? Would it not be better for our \nAmericans to have those jobs?\n  I mean, think about it, the President of the United States out here \ncelebrating special interests, hotel magnates, casino magnates who want \ncheap foreign labor so they do not have to hire American workers who \nare unemployed. That is what we are talking about. I think it is time \nfor the Republicans to stand up to the Republican 100 donors writing \nthat letter. Give me a break. We need to reject their advice and the \npremise of their letter that the public policy of the United States \nshould be based on giving U.S. companies a legal basis for hiring all \nthe low-cost foreign workers they say they need.\n  They are not entitled to demand that. We are supposed to set national \npolicy here. We are supposed to set policy that serves the national \ninterest. We do not work for those donors and special interests. So the \nnational interest is to reduce unemployment, certainly, and to create \nrising wages. That is our responsibility in this body. Let's get on \nwith it.\n  I want to say how great it is to see my friend Senator Enzi. I am \ntaking up his time. I hope I have not kept him too late. He works late \nanyway. But he has been a great principled supporter of immigration \nreform and is opposed to the bill that came before us. I thank the \nSenator for his work on so many of these issues but immigration reform \nis on my mind today. It is great to see the Senator.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, a lot of Americans are worried right now \nabout their health insurance. They know what is coming. Seniors have \nbeen turned down by their doctors for Medicare treatment because the \ndoctors are not adequately compensated. If they have not been turned \ndown, they know someone who has been turned down.\n  Medicaid is uncertain and a stigma. On the one hand, advances in \nmedical technology and the capabilities and knowledge of our health \ncare providers mean we are living longer and have more tools at hand \nthan ever before to address diseases and illnesses.\n  However, on the other hand, this increasing life expectancy, coupled \nwith the aging of our population and the steady increases in health \ncare costs, means our health care system is on the verge of becoming \ncompletely unsustainable financially.\n  All across the country health insurance rates are skyrocketing. \nFamilies are struggling to cope with the higher costs and less choice. \nEmployees are losing coverage and they are losing working hours. \nBusinesses are not hiring. At the center of this uncertainty is the \nPresident's health care law. A number of provisions have already gone \ninto effect, but we will not experience the full force of the law until \n2014; that is, January.\n  The Democrats' ``go it alone'' health care reform plan in 2009 was \nthe first major piece of legislation to pass Congress without a \nbipartisan vote. Let me repeat that again. The Democratic ``go it \nalone'' health care reform plan in 2009 was the first major piece of \nlegislation to pass Congress without a bipartisan vote. When you have a \npartisan bill you get partisan results.\n  After 20,000 pages of regulations and still a lot more to come, they \nare a little behind on those, and after over 150 new bureaucratic \nboards, agencies, and programs, the Federal Government still cannot \nfigure out how to make the law work and has had to delay it, in part.\n  What I have seen to date is enough to convince me that we need a \ndifferent path. I opposed the health care law initially and I support \nfull repeal of the law. Fixing our health care system does not have to \nbe divisive or partisan. There are clear differences in the approach to \nfixing health care from all across the political ideological spectrum. \nHowever, the least we have to do is to dismantle the worst parts of the \nlaw and replace them with reforms that actually work, reforms that \nlower cost and expand choice, reforms that do not bankrupt the country \nand every taxpayer.\n  The Federal Government needs to support viable solutions when needed \nand refrain from handcuffing innovative private designs with the \nexcessive regulations for narrowed political interests. We need more \ncompetition, not less.\n  Unless we take concrete steps now, we will soon be unable to switch \noff the track toward government-run health care. When I first got here, \nI was warned that there were people who did not care who ran the train \nof health as long as it wrecked. Then we could have universal single-\npay, government-run health care. I am not sure that is not still the \ngoal.\n  One clear example of how convoluted this law is comes from the \ndefinition of who an employee is. I used to work in the shoe business, \nso I understand the difference between full-time work, which was 40 \nhours a week, and part-time work, which was under 40 hours a week.\n  However, under the health care law, there are now full-time employees \nand full-time equivalents. What this means is the law requires \nemployers, and particularly small businesses, to determine how many of \ntheir part-time employees it takes to equal a full-time employee. They \ndon't come under the full force of the law until they hit 50 employees. \nThere are businesses that understand that, and they are trying to avoid \ngetting to the 50th employee. But there are some catches in this law.\n  First of all, the health care law sets full time at 30 hours, not 40 \nhours per week but 30 hours. It was news to me. It always was 40 hours.\n  Second, the law requires these employers to take everyone working 29 \nhours a week or less, combine all of their time for a week, and then \ndivide by the number 30 to establish how many full-time equivalents \nthese part-time workers represent. I don't think a lot of people \nplanned on that.\n  If you are still following along at this point, congratulations. You \ncan see how costly the taxes imposed by this law will be.\n  What if the rule forces you to add all of your employees' hours and \ndivide by 30 hours to determine your full-time employees? What if you \nhave 10 employees who are working 40 hours? That would be 400 hours. If \nyou divided that by 30 and find out that you are paying 10 people, but \nyou actually have 13\\1/3\\ employees at the full-time requirement, that \ncould put you over the 50 and put you into a whole different category \nof costs and penalties.\n  If you have 10 employees and you watched it so that there are only 29 \nhours, that comes to 290 hours. If you divided that by 30, you would \nfind out that even though none of these people are full-time employees, \nyou have 9\\2/3\\ full-time employees. You can see how they could do a \nlittle miscalculation, suddenly be at the 50, and be into a whole new \nseries of penalties.\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\n  The Obama administration also had to admit recently that the employer \nmandate, one of the key pieces of the law, isn't ready.\n  One of the most economically crushing and burdensome regulations will \nnot be implemented until past 2014, past the 2014 election in 2015. I \ndon't think that was a mistake on their part. I think it was \nintentional--to come after the election.\n  There is another little complication that gets thrown in here though. \nIf those employers are not providing the health insurance and not being \nfined for not providing the health insurance, then the people who work \nfor them have to go on the exchange to get their health insurance. If \nthey go on the exchange to get their health insurance, they can't be \nsubsidized by the businesses they worked for. That is going to be a \nsurprise to a lot of employees too.\n  The delay will force more people to enroll in health care exchanges \nor face the tax penalty if they don't. A lot of people don't realize if \nthey do go on the exchange, there is also a surcharge on the cost of \ntheir health insurance. They are going to be paying a 3.5 percent tax \nfor buying the insurance. Of course, if they don't buy the insurance, \nthen they get a penalty.\n  The delay was also made for the businesses without congressional \napproval, done administratively. The Congressional Budget Office and \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation informed Senator Hatch this week that \nthis delay will increase the cost of the new insurance program \nestablished by law by $12 billion. It is not as if we had an extra $12 \nbillion laying around here.\n  In particular, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimated that the Federal Government will be \nrequired to pay an additional $3 billion in subsidies for people on the \nexchanges. A lot of extra costs were just kicked in there. This delay \nnot only increases the costs on hard-working Americans, but it fails \nthe original intent of health care reform, and that is to provide \nAmericans with high quality, affordable health care.\n  In addition, the law requires the administration to set up health \ninsurance exchanges in a number of States, including Wyoming. We are \nsparsely populated, low numbers. The numbers wouldn't work out to do \nour own exchange.\n  One problem is the administration has yet to tell anyone exactly how \nthey are going to do those exchanges or what even a basic plan is. If \nyou are going to have a range of plans that insurance companies can bid \non, that you can look up on the computer, doesn't it seem, before you \ncan even start, that you would have to know what the basic plan is?\n  How the President can argue that everyone will love the health care \nlaw once it goes into effect is beyond me. This administration can't \neven tell anyone where they can buy their insurance, what plan options \nwill be available, and, most importantly, what the costs will be.\n  Remember what Nancy Pelosi said before they passed the law? They will \nhave to pass the bill before we get to know what is in it. The \nadministration is shopping its own version of that statement.\n  As the Senate Finance Committee chairman put it recently: this law is \na train wreck waiting to happen. That is the Democratic Senate Finance \nCommittee chairman.\n  Of course, on top of all of this, the law relies in part on new taxes \nand tax subsidies to support the coverage expansion.\n  This means the IRS will be involved in implementation. I have \nsignificant concerns with the ability of the IRS, particularly in the \nwake of the current scandal. The fact that this organization, the IRS--\ntainted by such political behavior--is involved in implementing the new \nhealth care law has increased my belief that the health care law is not \nsomething the country wants or needs. Of course, the IRS employees \ndon't want to come under this law either. I don't know of anybody who \nreally wants to come under it.\n  I will take a close look at proposals to remove the IRS from any \nimplementation activities, but I do think they should be subject to the \nlaw too. At the same time, I will continue to work to provide folks \nwith relief from the health care law as a whole.\n  One of the things they have said if you are going on the exchange is, \nif you are in certain income categories, then you get a subsidy from \nthe government to help you purchase your insurance. We are told now \nthat will be self-reporting and will not be subject to audit. Doesn't \nthat sound like something that could be fraught with a lot of fraud, \nwhere you say you just make enough to get into the biggest subsidies? \nEverybody wouldn't do that, of course, but I think there are some who \nwould.\n\n  How is the government doing on some of the things that they already \nput into effect? I saw a little article on high-risk pools. When the \nbill went in, a lot of the States already had high-risk pools, and we \nworked with States to make those viable, but the Federal Government \nsaid we could do it for less. They put in a high-risk pool.\n  To keep people from jumping from the State ones, which, yes, are more \nexpensive, over into the Federal one, which is less expensive, they \nsaid you couldn't make the jump unless you were without insurance for 6 \nmonths. People who are in the high-risk pool can't afford to be without \ninsurance for 6 months.\n  There wasn't a big jump to the high-risk pool. But in spite of the \nfact that there wasn't a jump to the high-risk pool, the Federal high-\nrisk pool went broke. It ran out of money.\n  Here is the disturbing part of that article. They said, well, they \nwould just shift that cost over to the States. The States are already \ndoing it, and they are doing the right thing. Now they are going to be \nasked to pick up the additional costs. How many parts of ObamaCare are \ngoing to get shifted over to the States? The States have had a lot of \npromises. Can any of those promises be met? Will they be met? A lot of \ndecisions are being based on what the Federal Government promised.\n  Of course, in truth, we are out of money. The new law also tried to \naddress the problem of rising health care costs. I believe the Federal \nfiscal situation is untenable, and we need to implement significant and \nfar-reaching spending cuts to get our fiscal house in order. We cannot \ncontinue on our current path.\n  The President and his administration will argue that the new law will \nexpand access and lower costs. While the law certainly increases access \nto insurance, it also moved billions of dollars from the Medicare \nProgram to pay for this new insurance program. That is not exactly \nsaving the government money.\n  The projections for lower costs also don't add up for the average \nAmerican either. Insurance premiums and rates are increasing. Small \nbusinesses are unable to continue to provide health insurance for their \nworkers.\n  Businesses in general have delayed hiring or are only hiring people \npart time--although I hope they listen to the part that I gave about \nthe little part-time catch that is built into the law.\n  All of these decisions are directly driven by the economic impact of \nthe health care law. My Senate Republican colleagues and I are focused \non developing proposals that address the worst aspects of the health \ncare law. The law increases premiums and health care costs, forces \nemployers to stop offering insurance to their employees, and slashes \nbenefits for millions of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I support repealing both the cap on health savings accounts, flexible \nspending accounts, and the prohibition on over-the-counter purchases \nincluded in the health care law.\n  Flexible spending accounts help make consumers more aware and engage \nin their health care spending.\n  Health savings accounts are something that young, healthy staffers of \nthe Senate like to do. They can do the math real easy. They can look at \nthe regular program and see how much that would cost or they could take \na look at health savings accounts. The difference in the price, in only \n3 years they could cover the whole deductible part as long as they were \nhealthy for 3 years. They would be covered for that part until \nsomething major happened--and they were covered for catastrophic--so \nthey found that to be a real bargain. But not anymore.\n  Additionally, a number of other Senators and I have put forward bills \nto repeal the taxes imposed by the President's health care law. That \nwould be\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nrelief from new taxes on prescription drugs, relief from new taxes on \nmedical devices, and relief from new taxes on health insurance plans. I \nwish to provide relief to employers from new regulations imposed on \nthem by the law.\n  These ideas preserve competition in a private market for health care \ncoverage and lower the cost of care for the consumer. All of these \nsteps are commonsense reforms to the health care law that take us off \nthe path toward a national, Federal health care system.\n  One of the most effective ways Congress can address the rising costs \nof health care is to focus on the way it is delivered as part of the \nNation's current cost-driven and ineffective patient care system. \nAmerica's broken fee-for-service structure is driving our Nation's \nhealth care system further downward.\n  Today's method of payment encourages providers to see as many \npatients and prescribe as many treatments as possible, but it does \nnothing to reward providers who keep patients healthy. Maligned \nincentives created by the fee-for-service system drive up costs and \nhurt patient care.\n  Tackling this issue is a good start to reining in rising health care \ncosts. The health care law championed by President Obama and the \nmajority party in the Senate did little to address these problems \nbecause the vast majority of the legislation involved a massive \nexpansion of the government price controls found in the fee-for-service \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs.\n  If we wish to address the threat posed by out-of-control entitlement \nspending, we need to restructure Medicare to better align incentives \nfor providers and beneficiaries. This will not only lower health care \ncosts, it will also improve the quality of care for millions of \nAmericans. It is very important that we protect access to rural health \ncare services too.\n  There is more that can be done to better align Federal programs to \nmeet the needs of rural and frontier States. The criteria that \ndetermine eligibility for Federal funds to support rural health care \nprograms are based on factors that make it difficult to prove the needs \nof the underserved, rural, and frontier areas.\n  For example, one provider for 3,500 people in New York City is \nentirely different than the 3,500 people living in Fremont, Campbell \nCounty or, perhaps more so, Niobrara County. I use Niobrara County \nquite a bit, for example, because Niobrara County is the size of \nDelaware and has 2,500 people living in it. It is 90 miles tall, 75 \nmiles wide, and near the bottom of the center is a town called Lusk. \nThis is where almost all of the people live. They do have a hospital \nthere.\n  When they have a doctor or a physician's assistant, the hospital is \nopen. When they do not, they are 104 miles from a trauma center.\n  You can't apply the same rules to that hospital that you apply to New \nYork City hospitals. In addition, we need to think more creatively \nabout how to use technology services, to improve telemedicine \ncapabilities, particularly for the rural areas so that where a person \nlives has less impact on the level of care they are able to receive.\n  The advancement of more powerful, wireless technologies has \nsubstantial potential to remotely link individuals across the country \nto deliver health care in more accessible settings. Our Nation has made \ngreat strides in improving the quality of life for all Americans. We \nneed to remember that every major legislative initiative that has \nhelped transform our country has been forged in the spirit of \ncooperation. These qualities are essential to the success and longevity \nof crucial programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n  When it comes to health care decisions being made in Washington \nlately, the only thing the government is doing well is increasing \npartisanship and legislative gridlock. The President and Democrats need \nto listen. It is time to admit that this partisan experiment in \ngovernment-run health care is failing. In order for this to get better, \nthey must acknowledge the problem. Some of the law's authors and \nbiggest supporters admit this law is a mess, and it will only get \nworse.\n  However, those in the Democratic leadership continue to support \nflawed health care laws out of pride, politics, or a belief that the \ngovernment knows best. It makes no sense to stubbornly cling to a law \nthat is so massive, burdensome, bureaucratic, and confusing that it is \ncollapsing under its own weight.\n  By focusing on positive changes, Congress can give the failed law's \nproponents a way out. The key is finding common ground. More often than \nnot, the country hears about what divides Congress instead of what \nunifies us. We could come together and focus on commonsense solutions \nwith the kinds of step-by-step reforms that would protect Americans. I \nbelieve Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle can agree on 80 \npercent of an issue 100 percent of the time.\n  I want to be clear that this isn't compromise. When you compromise, \neach side gives up something they believe in, and in the end they get \nsomething no one believes in. I am about agreeing on common ground \nwithout compromise, without sacrificing each party's principles, by \nleaving out parts of the issue to look for a solution later.\n  Congress also needs to stop deal-making and start legislating. We \nneed to stop developing comprehensive bills and then marketing them as \nthe only option. To me, comprehensive means incomprehensible. The \nlarger a bill is, the harder it is to agree. And, of course, you can \ntuck some things in there that people never see. This is especially \ntrue when we pass a bill that no one has fully read and then afterwards \nwe find out what is in it.\n  No party has all the good ideas. By working together, the end result \nshould be something that not only works but moves the country forward \nin a responsible way.\n  We still need health care reform, but it has to be the right way, \nwith strong bipartisan support on individual health care issues. What \nhappened to individual choice on a policy? What happened to liability \nreform? What about the sale of insurance across State lines or pooling \nthrough an association so they have leverage against the insurance \ncompanies? What happened to adequate compensation for providers? All of \nthese have been left out. Providing Americans with access to affordable \nhealth care at a high quality is something Republicans and Democrats \nshould be able to agree upon.\n  The challenges of the American health care system are not going away. \nIf we improve health care in a practical instead of a political way, we \ncan make its better. Good policy is good politics. Why do I have some \nhope this is going to happen? Congress is more interested now than they \nhave ever been, and the reason is there was a Republican--yes, there \nwas one Republican provision in the bill that forced Congress to go \ninto the exchanges too. We and our staffs have to live under the law we \npassed. That is how it should be. But the result is hitting everyone in \ntheir offices right now. Every Senator and every Representative is \nlooking at what may happen to their staff on January 1, and their \nstaffs are concerned. It has changed the tenor of some of the hearings \nwe are having. It is pretty hard-hitting on both sides. So with that, I \ndo have hope.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, most of our colleagues have finished, a \nlot of them packed up and are heading back to their home States to \nbegin the August recess. I wish them all well, especially the one who \njust preceded me on the floor tonight.\n  I stand between the staff here and the pages who are wrapping up \ntheir summer with us--at least a month with us. They will be heading \nback to their home States across America. We had one of our pages--a \npage, actually, in the last group, at the beginning of the summer--from \nDelaware, and we are very proud of her and all the ones who have been \nhere. I have told them they are among the best group we have ever had--\neven that guy from Arkansas, whose mom used to sit right down here in \nthe row next to Mark Pryor and me.\n  I thank the staff for their hard work throughout the course of this \nyear. I think we are in a good place, and the Senate is starting to act \nmore like the Senate of old. We are beginning to govern a little more \nfrom the center, and Democrats and Republicans are looking to find new \nways to work together on a wide range of issues.\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\n  I am especially pleased with the progress we made on the Federal \nstudent loan program, again trying to make sure the program is \navailable and at a reasonable interest rate cost to help make sure a \nlot of students, young and old, if they need help, can sign up for \nstudent loans late this summer and fall and then go back to school and \ncomplete their education.\n  Senator Enzi used the numbers 80-20. In the time I have known him, he \nhas talked about the 80-20 rule, of which he may be the architect. The \n80-20 rule is something like this: Around here, we agree on about 80 \npercent of the stuff and may disagree on about 20 percent of the stuff. \nBut in the end, why don't we just focus on the 80 percent we agree on \nand set aside the 20 percent we don't agree on and then take that up \nanother day?\n  That is the spirit Senator Tom Coburn, who is the ranking Republican \non the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nI have taken to an issue that needs to be addressed, and that is a path \nforward in making sure we have a strong postal system in this country, \nas we have had for over 200 years. We need to have a strong, vibrant, \nfinancially strong, and sustainable postal system for a long time, for \nas long as we are going to be a country.\n  The nature of our needs and the way we communicate has changed \ndramatically. I remember finding in my parents' home, oh gosh, about 5 \nor 6 years ago, when, after my dad had died, my mom was going to move \nout of her home in Florida up close to my sister in Kentucky, this \ntreasure trove of love letters my parents exchanged during World War \nII. For others of you whose parents have been in similar situations and \nwhose folks were part of the ``greatest generation,'' you may have \nuncovered a treasure trove of letters like that as well. They wrote \nliterally every day--just about every day through the war.\n  I remember that the happiest days I spent in Southeast Asia, in the \nseveral tours I served there in the early 1970s, the happiest days for \nus each week were the days we got the mail. Those were the best days--\nletters from home, cards, postcards, newspapers, magazines. Those were \ngreat days.\n  Our troops in Afghanistan still get mail. They still get letters and \npostcards and birthday cards, Father's Day and Mother's Day cards, but \nit is different because they have Skype and cell phones and a lot of \nother ways to communicate.\n\n  I asked my staff recently to go back 12 years ago to when I first \ncame here and tell me how many e-mails we got for every letter we \nsent--tell me how many e-mails we got for every letter we sent and \nreceived. It turns out for every 1 e-mail we received, we received 10 \nor 12 letters. That was just like 10 or 12 years ago. Then I asked them \nto tell me what it is today, and it has flipped. It is just the \nopposite. For every letter we get, we receive roughly 10 or 12 e-mails. \nSo the way we communicate in this country has changed, and that is just \none clear example of it for us here on Capitol Hill.\n  The Postal Service has struggled much like the U.S. auto industry did \nin the last decade or two to try to make a go of it. The auto industry \nfound themselves in a situation where they had more plants than they \nneeded, more suppliers than they needed, they had really in some ways \nmore different models than they needed, and they had, sadly, more \nemployees than they needed given their market share, which was about 85 \npercent when I was in Southeast Asia, and it dropped to about 45 \npercent 3 or 4 years ago. Fortunately, the auto industry in this \ncountry has revived, is vibrant, and is coming back. They are hiring \nand building cars--award-winning, highly energy efficient cars.\n  The auto industry was an industry that had to retool itself and right \nsize itself for the 21st century, and they have done that and done it \nwell. The big three in the United States are back and building some of \nthe best cars in the world. We are proud of the work they do, and they \nare not only hiring people but are paying bonuses to their people, and \nit has turned out to be a really great success story. These were \ncompanies that were literally going into bankruptcy--GM, Chrysler--not \nthat many years ago. They are back, and we are a better country. Thank \nGod we helped them get back. And Ford builds great vehicles.\n  What do we do about the Postal Service? The Postal Service has about \n7 million people working for it or who have jobs that are related or \nare connected directly or indirectly to the Postal Service--7 million \njobs. What do we do about them?\n  I think what we need to do and are trying to do is contained in the \nlegislation Dr. Coburn and I are introducing tonight, which we have \nworked on for the last 6 months. I really thank him and his staff, \nespecially Chris Barkley, who is here on the floor with us, who has \nworked very closely and hard with John Kilvington, who is a member of \nthe majority staff at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  We want to thank a lot of people, Democratic and Republican staff, \nmajority and minority staff, for the terrific work they have done to \ntry to find the middle, to focus on that 80 percent we can agree on, \nand the 20 percent we can't agree on, we will put off until another \nday.\n  The legislation we have written, put simply, addresses how we make \npossible and ensure that this Postal Service--which was literally \nspelled out and called for in our Constitution all those years ago--is \nstill relevant today; that it is able to be financially viable today \nand help meet our communication needs today in a different age, in a \ndigital age. They can do this. They can do this. There is a lot in the \nlegislation that will help make that possible.\n  We have not written a perfect bill. The ones I have ever written or \ncoauthored or authored, believe it or not, are not perfect. We do our \nbest, and then we introduce the legislation and ask other people who \nhave similar or different views to tell us what they like about our \nlegislation and what they do not like.\n  In introducing this legislation, we would invite folks from around \nthe country, whether they happen to be residents, consumers, people \nliving in homes, families who rely on the mail, whether they happen to \nbe businesses that use the mail broadly or whether they happen to be \nfolks who send out magazines or catalogs or other nonprofit groups or \nother folks who work for the Postal Service, the employees, those who \nare retired, the customers of the Postal Service--we welcome their \ninput as they have a chance to look over what we have written. We ask \nthem to see if they can help us make it better.\n  Over in the House of Representatives, Congressmen Issa and Cummings \nhave been working, along with their colleagues, on legislation. It has \nbeen reported out of committee over there, I think on a party-line \nvote.\n  One of the things that was important to me was to write a bipartisan \nbill. Dr. Coburn wanted us to write a bipartisan bill. Neither one of \nus got everything we wanted. The nature of compromise is there are some \nthings that, frankly, you are not all that enamored with, and that is \nthe case here. Our pledge going forward is to continue to work \ntogether, to ask Democrats and Republicans to help us improve on this \nlegislation.\n  The challenge for us is this: In a digital age where people use Skype \nand Internet and Twitter and all, how do we enable the Postal Service \nto use what is truly unique--and it is a unique company, if you will; \nit is a public-private company, although a big company, the second \nlargest employer in the country, and it is a business that goes to \nevery mailbox in this country 5 to 6 days a week--to make a profit, to \nbe financially sustainable, and to meet our communication needs without \na huge ongoing reliance from the taxpayer, from the Treasury, to do \nthat? I think they can do it. I think they can do it. I think the \nlegislation we have written will help make that possible.\n  I want to say a special thanks to a number of folks. I want to thank \nthe Postal Service, led by Pat Donahoe, the Postmaster General; the \nBoard of Governors there, which is part of the Postal Service: the \nfolks who represent hundreds of thousands of postal workers through the \nunion; the businesses across the country that use and rely on the \nPostal Service; and a lot of customers--regular people who have given \nus their ideas and shared their ideas with us from towns large and \nsmall, cities and States large and small. We\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\nlook forward to their input and their criticism--constructive, we \nhope--to make this legislation even better.\n  I would again say to our staffs who worked so hard to get us to this \npoint a very special thank you.\n  To our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we look forward to \nworking with you to make what we think is a good bill even better. I \nlike to say that everything I do, I know I can do better. If it isn't \nperfect, make it better. And my last thought on this is that the road \nto improvement is always under construction.\n  So we have some more work to do, and we will take what is a good \nbipartisan bill and hopefully make it a lot better.\n  Madam President, with that, I will say good night to you. I look \nforward to seeing you in about 5 or 6 weeks. My best to you and the \npeople you so ably represent in New Hampshire. God bless.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about a Federal court \nruling handed down yesterday that represents a tremendous victory for \nconsumers and Main Street businesses across America.\n  This ruling has to do with debit card swipe fees. Yesterday, a \nFederal judge in D.C. called for the Federal Reserve to lower the \napproximately 24 cent cap it set on debit swipe fees to a level that \nmore closely reflects the actual cost of a debit transaction.\n  This decision is a major win for Main Street merchants and their \ncustomers.\n  It was urgently needed, because this decision corrects flaws in the \nFed's rulemaking that had allowed Visa and MasterCard to triple the \nswipe fees they impose on many coffeeshops, convenience stores, \nrestaurants and other merchants.\n  I had filed an amicus brief in this court case, since the case \ninvolved a rulemaking based on a law that I had authored. I am very \npleased that the court ruled the way it did, and I will take a minute \nto explain why.\n  For years, I have been sounding the alarm about swipe fees, also \nknown as interchange fees.\n  The swipe fee is a hidden fee that is charged on every debit or \ncredit card transaction. It is a fee that a merchant has to pay to a \nbank when the merchant accepts a credit or debit card that the bank \nissued. The fee is taken as a cut out of the transaction amount.\n  These swipe fees are harmful to consumers and to our economy. They \nare hidden, they are anti-competitive, and they end up raising the \nprice of everything we buy at retail.\n  It is important to understand how these fees work.\n  The vast majority of bank fees are set in a transparent and \ncompetitive market environment, with each bank setting its own fee rate \nand competing over them. But that is not the case with swipe fees.\n  With swipe fees, the big banks decided they would designate the two \ngiant card companies, Visa and MasterCard, to set fees for all of them. \nThat way each bank could get the same high fee on a card transaction \nwithout having to worry about competition.\n  Swipe fees have no transparency. Most customers and most merchants \nhave no idea what kind of swipe fee is being charged when they use a \ndebit or credit card.\n  The swipe fee system became an enormous money-maker for Visa, \nMasterCard and the banks. They were collecting an estimated $16 billion \nin debit swipe fees and $30 billion in credit fees each year.\n  Those billions are paid by every merchant, charity, school, and \ngovernment agency that accepts payment by card--and the costs are \npassed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices.\n  By 2010, the U.S. swipe fee system was growing out of control with no \nend in sight. U.S. swipe fee rates had become the highest in the \nworld--far exceeding the actual costs of conducting a debit or credit \ntransaction.\n  There were no market forces serving to keep fees at a reasonable \nlevel. There was no competition and no choice. Merchants and their \ncustomers were being forced to subsidize billions in windfall fees to \nthe big banks.\n  I knew we had to change this situation.\n  This is an issue of fundamental importance to our economy. Our nation \nis moving from a currency based on paper cash and checks to a system \nwhere American dollars are mostly exchanged through electronic \ntransactions.\n  We cannot allow Visa, MasterCard and the big banks to dominate the \nelectronic payments system and use it to enrich themselves at \nconsumers' expense. Remember, this is America's currency we are talking \nabout. We have to ensure transparency, competition and fairness when it \ncomes to electronic payments involving U.S. dollars.\n  So I stepped in and introduced an amendment to the 2010 Wall Street \nReform bill that for the first time placed reasonable regulation over \ndebit swipe fees.\n  My amendment said that if the Nation's biggest banks are going to let \nVisa and MasterCard fix swipe fee rates for them, then the rates must \nbe reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing a transaction. \nNo more unreasonably high debit swipe fees for big banks.\n  My amendment passed the Senate with 64 votes and it was signed into \nlaw with the rest of Wall Street reform.\n  The swipe fee reform law that I wrote directed the Federal Reserve to \nissue regulations to bring down debit swipe fee rates.\n  In December 2010, the Fed issued a proposed rulemaking that called \nfor debit swipe fees to be capped at 7 to 12 cents per transaction.\n  This was a significant reduction from what had been a 44 cent average \ndebit swipe fee, though it still allowed banks\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nto easily cover their debit transaction costs, which the Fed pegged at \njust a few cents.\n  However, after the Fed issued the draft rule, the big banks and card \nnetwork giants turned their lobbyists loose on them. It was a lobbying \nstampede.\n  They pressured the Fed to raise the debit swipe fee cap to a level \nfar higher than 12 cents, because they claimed that there were all \nsorts of additional costs that the Fed forgot to include in its \nanalysis.\n  The Fed gave in, and in June 2011 issued a final rule that raised the \ncap level to about 24 cents--much higher than the actual cost of a \ndebit transaction.\n  Predictably, Visa, MasterCard and the big banks took advantage of \nthis watered-down regulation that they had lobbied for. Visa and \nMasterCard promptly jacked up any swipe fee rates that were below 24 \ncents so that this 24 cent ceiling became a floor.\n  With Visa and MasterCard's rate increases, stores that mainly handle \nsmall dollar purchases like coffeeshops, convenience stores, and fast \nfood restaurants are now paying far more in swipe fees than they did \nbefore.\n  These merchants used to be charged debit fees that were a percentage \nof the purchase amount, and now they are charged around 24 cents no \nmatter how small the purchase. Their customers ultimately pay the \nprice.\n  This was not a flaw in the law, which required a ``reasonable and \nproportional'' fee. Instead, it showed the danger of watering down the \nregulations that implement these laws. The banks and card companies \nlobbied the Fed for a loophole and when they got one, they ran through \nit.\n  After the Fed issued its final rule and Visa and MasterCard promptly \nraised their swipe fee rates to the cap level wherever they could, a \ncoalition of merchants led by the convenience stores filed a lawsuit in \nfederal court.\n  They argued that the Fed failed to follow the law in issuing its \nfinal regulation. They urged the court to order the Fed to rewrite its \nregulation in compliance with the statute.\n  I filed an amicus brief in this case in support of the merchants' \nposition. In my brief, I pointed out that when the Fed doubled its \nswipe fee cap between the initial rulemaking and the final rulemaking, \nthe Fed cited the need to cover certain costs that the statute \nexplicitly prohibited the Fed from including.\n  The bottom line, I argued, was that the Fed came far closer to \nfollowing the statute in its draft rulemaking than after it had bent \ntoward the banks in its final rulemaking.\n  The court agreed, and yesterday it ordered the Fed to rewrite its \nrules in compliance with what the law provides.\n  Here's a key quote from the court's opinion: ``The court concludes \nthat the Board has clearly disregarded Congress's statutory intent by \ninappropriately inflating all debit card transaction fees by billions \nof dollars.''\n  The court also pointed out the problem with Visa and MasterCard's \nswipe fee increases on small dollar transactions. The Court said:\n\n       By including in the interchange fee standard costs that are \n     expressly prohibited by the statute, the final regulation \n     represents a significant price increase over pre-Durbin \n     Amendment rates for small-ticket debit transactions under the \n     $12 threshold. Congress did not empower the Board to make \n     policy judgments that would result in significantly higher \n     interchange rates.\n\n  The court concluded that the Fed must rewrite its regulation to lower \nthe debit fee cap and to halt Visa and MasterCard's fee increases on \nmerchants for small dollar transactions.\n  Now, this process of rewriting the regulations will take some time, \nand I suspect there may be more litigation before this issue is over.\n  But this court ruling marks a tremendous win for Main Street \nmerchants and their customers who deserve the swipe fee relief that the \nlaw provided for.\n  Fortunately for the Fed, there are some clear roadmaps for how it can \nfix its regulation. I pointed out in my amicus brief that the Fed's \ninitial rulemaking, with its 7 to 12 cent cap, came far closer to \nreflecting the actual costs that Congress instructed the Fed to look \nat.\n  The Fed should look again to its initial rulemaking as it works to \nrewrite its final rule.\n  And just last week, the European Commission announced that it would \nseek to cap debit swipe fee rates throughout the European Union at 0.2 \npercent of the transaction.\n  Given that the average debit transaction is about $38, that works out \nto an average cap of about 7 cents- right where the Fed was in its \ninitial rule.\n  Congressman Peter Welch and I sent a letter last week urging the Fed \nto closely review the European Commission's debit fee cap and to \nincorporate it in the Fed's debit fee regulation. I believe the Fed \nwill find the Commission's analysis and conclusions to be very helpful \nin rewriting its final rule.\n  As we move forward on the path of reasonable swipe fee reform, I \nshould note that Visa, MasterCard and the banking industry are probably \nnot too pleased with this court decision.\n  I suspect they will be up here on Capitol Hill very soon, screaming \nbloody murder and arguing that this court decision means the end of the \nworld.\n  I just want to point out that the banks and card companies have been \nspreading myths and using scare tactics about swipe fee reform for \nyears. None of them have come true.\n  They argued that swipe fee reform would devastate small banks. Yet \nseparate studies by the Fed, GAO and the FTC have all found that the \nexemption I wrote in the law for small banks has worked as intended.\n  As it turns out, small banks and credit unions have thrived since \nthis law took effect. Why? Because under my amendment, small banks and \ncredit unions can continue to receive the same high interchange rates \nfrom Visa and MasterCard they got before far higher than the rates that \ntheir big bank competitors now receive.\n  Also, the big banks argued that they would have to jack up fees on \nconsumers to make up for the lost revenue from swipe fees.\n  But we haven't seen that happen either, because there is transparency \nand competition when it comes to bank fees on consumers. In fact, we've \ngotten more transparency on these fees in the past few years as many \nbanks have adopted a fee disclosure form developed by the Pew \nCharitable Trusts that I have strongly supported.\n  As the banks' other scare tactics have faded away, they have resorted \nto arguing that the problem with swipe reform is that merchants haven't \npassed along enough swipe fee savings to consumers.\n  This was a pretty hypocritical argument for them to make, because \nthey knew that Visa and MasterCard had raised many swipe fee rates \nafter reform took effect--a direct result of the higher cap that they \nhad lobbied for.\n  But even though many merchants have suffered under those swipe fee \nincreases, we have still seen aggressive price competition and \ndiscounting by retailers since swipe fee reform took effect. Consumers \nhave benefitted from this price competition, and they will benefit even \nmore from this court ruling.\n  In closing, I note that yesterday's court decision marks another \nimportant step in the effort to make sure the electronic payments \nsystem is reasonable and fair for American consumers and businesses. \nOur work is not over yet, but we are making great progress.\n  I want to thank my colleagues and all the consumers, merchants and \nadvocates across America who have joined me in this effort. This marks \na big win for Main Street over Wall Street, and it wouldn't have been \npossible without this excellent coalition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6182-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6182-S6183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GLENN POSHARD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to thank Dr. Glenn Poshard \nfor all he has done for Southern Illinois University and for his 40 \nyears of public service to Illinois.\n  After more than 7 years as president of Southern Illinois University, \nDr. Poshard will be retiring next year. Under Dr. Poshard's leadership, \nSouthern Illinois University has been able to keep tuition costs low \nand the university's finances sound, despite the financial problems \nthat have plagued the State.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Poshard worked for the people of southern \nIllinois. He was born in Herald, IL, and graduated from Carmi Township \nHigh School. He left Illinois to serve his country in the U.S. Army in \nKorea,\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nwhere he received a commendation for outstanding service.\n  Following his military service, Dr. Poshard returned to Illinois and \nused the G.I. bill to earn a bachelor's degree in secondary education, \na master's degree in health education, and a Ph.D. in higher education \nadministration. He received all three degrees from Southern Illinois \nUniversity at Carbondale.\n  Appointed to the Illinois State Senate in 1984, Dr. Poshard held the \nseat until the people of the 22nd Congressional District sent him to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives in 1989. During his 10 years in \nCongress, Dr. Poshard was a strong proponent of campaign finance \nreform. When he ran for Governor in 1998, he limited individual \ndonations to his campaign and refused to accept contributions from \npolitical action committees.\n  Following his tenure in Congress, Dr. Poshard and his wife Jo founded \nthe Poshard Foundation for Abused Children. For the last 14 years, the \nPoshard Foundation has helped children who have been victims of abuse, \nabandonment, or neglect in southern Illinois.\n  After a 40-year affiliation with the university, Dr. Poshard is \nleaving his beloved SIU in good shape.

Mr. President, over the years I have come to the floor to \nraise the plight of political prisoners being held around the globe. \nThese have included journalists, activists, bloggers, musicians, and \nopposition candidates who all had the misfortune of landing in an \nautocrat's jail for exercising or advocating for basic freedoms that \nmost of the world takes for granted.\n  Many of these cases are ones that have received little attention or \nare not in the world's media spotlight, including: Gambian journalist \nEbrima Manneh, who has been held incommunicado since 2006 and probably \nhas died in detention; Vietnamese blogger Dieu Cay, who was jailed for \n12 years for anti-state propaganda and is in poor health due to a \nhunger strike amid his president's recent visit to Washington; Saudi \nblogger Hamza Kashgari, who was grabbed off a plane in Malaysia while \nfleeing for his safety and returned to Saudi Arabia to face charges of \nblasphemy; Turkmen political dissident and human rights activist \nGulgeldy Annaniyazov, who has been in jail since 2008; and Belarusian \nopposition candidate Mikalai, who was thrown in jail for having the \ntemerity to run against his country's strongman, President Lukashenko.\n  Many of my colleagues here have helped with these efforts, including \n11 other Senators who recently joined in a letter to Uzbek President \nKarimov asking for the release of activist Akzam Turgunov and \njournalists Dilmurod Saidov and Salijon Abdurakhmanov.\n  Others have also championed the cause of political freedom around the \nworld, including Senators McCain and Cardin, who have been leaders in \ntrying to hold our Russian friends to a higher standard of political \nand human rights freedom.\n  In fact, Senator Cardin was tireless in his effort to pass the \nMagnitsky law--a law that I supported--that tried to bring about some \nmeasure of accountability regarding the death of Russian lawyer Sergei \nMagnitsky, who was jailed after exposing official corruption and later \ndied from mistreatment while in custody.\n  I have also watched with great dismay the deterioration of democracy \nand human rights in Russia.\n  A few years ago I had the chance to speak to the Lithuanian \nParliament on that country's--the country of my mother's birth--20th \nanniversary of independence from the Soviet Union. One of the other \nspeakers on that memorable occasion was Russian democrat small ``d'' \ndemocrat--Yuriy Afanasyev.\n  Many probably did not realize or have forgotten that during those \nheady days in the early 1990s a number of countries--such as \nLithuania--were early in declaring independence and, as a result, \nhelped change history in Eastern Europe.\n  And who helped support many such efforts?\n  Russian democrats in the streets of Moscow--the same ones who were \nalso instrumental in bringing a transition to democracy in their own \ncountry.\n  Afanasyev was just such a Russian. He helped lead large public \nprotests in Moscow during the January 1991 crackdown against \nLithuania's independence movement.\n  That is why I find myself so saddened by what is happening in Russia \ntoday--the systematic state-sponsored harassment and dismantling of \nthose Russian citizens and organizations that are still hoping for a \ndemocratic and free Russia so many years later.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Russian government tried and convicted popular \nopposition leader and candidate for mayor of Moscow Alesksei Navalny on \ncharges that had already been thrown out as baseless after a local \ninvestigation.\n  If his conviction is upheld, he will be banned from public office for \nlife.\n  Navalny's case is just one of a long list of politically motivated \ncharges and actions in recent years used to squash any criticism of the \nRussian government or those who might want to run for political office:\n  A few weeks ago, hundreds of protesters were detained by Russian \nInterior Ministry personnel when protesting Navalny's dubious \nconviction--a fate met by scores of nonviolent protesters in recent \nyears;\n  As of March of this year, the Russian Federal Security Service \naccompanied by tax enforcement and other government personnel has \nraided thousands of NGOs across Russia, seizing documents and \ninterrogating staff--all in an orchestrated intimidation campaign;\n  Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov has been arrested multiple times for \npeacefully protesting government policies;\n  Deputy editor-in-chief of Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta Sergei \nSokolov fled Russia after the chief federal investigator took him into \nthe forest and threatened to decapitate him;\n  Doctor of Political Sciences at Kuban State University Mikhail Savva, \nwho was a member of the that region's Public Oversight Committee and an \noutspoken voice against corruption was arrested in April and has been \nheld without bail on flimsy charges;\n  Leader of For Human Rights, Lev Ponomaryov, a prominent human rights \nadvocacy group in Moscow, was kicked and beaten during a forceful \neviction of his organization from their headquarters. The assault was \ncarried out by men dressed in civilian clothing, but was observed by \nriot police officers;\n  Lastly--and very symbolic of the hundreds arrested at recent \nprotests--human rights activist Nikolay Kavkazsky was arrested last \nyear at his home for allegedly hitting a policeman during a protest \nalthough an independent investigation implies he was in fact dodging \nblows from a policeman.\n  Let me take a moment to pause and mention an extraordinary story and \nphoto from the Washington Post of Russian schoolteacher Marina \nRozumovskaya, standing alone in front of Moscow City Hall in the \nfreezing Russian winter in January of 2011.\n  In the photo she is holding an 8 by 11 inch sign that said ``Freedom \nto political prisoners'' in response to the arrest and jailing of a \nprominent opposition leader who had criticized the Russian government.\n  Watching and waiting for her to break the law across the street in \nthe 10 degree weather were a dozen or so Russian police officers.\n  This brave schoolteacher told the Washington Post, ``If you don't \nexercise your rights as a citizen, nothing will ever change.''\n  The Russian government has also used almost paranoid legislation to \nrestrict Russian human rights and election monitoring organizations \nfrom doing their work.\n  For example, in March of 2013, Russian officials raided the offices \nof hundreds of non-governmental organizations, including Amnesty \nInternational.\n  Equally troubling, Russia's largest elections watchdog GOLOS, and its \nexecutive director Lilia Shibanova, were\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\nfined for failing to register as a ``foreign agent,'' even after \nreceiving the prestigious Sakharov Prize by the Norwegian Helsinki \nCommittee and rejecting the monetary portion of the award.\n  Russia has also passed draconian laws that include fines equivalent \nto an average annual salary for taking part in unsanctioned protests, \nstiffer libel penalties, a broader definition of treason, and \nrestrictions on websites--laws that former Soviet leader Mikhail \nGorbachev has denounced as an ``attack on the rights of citizens.''\n  Earlier this year Gorbachev also warned Russian President Putin ``not \nto be afraid of his own people.''\n  Remember Sergei Magnitsky, the Russian who tried to draw attention to \nmassive police and tax fraud who died in Russian custody? He was \nconvicted a few weeks ago of perpetrating fraud himself--4 years after \nhe died.\n  After what many brave Russian democrats did for countries such as \nLithuania and others breaking free from the Soviet Union, we owe it to \nspeak up for those who are fighting for basic political freedoms today \nin Russia.\n  These endless show trials are not for criminals or foreign agent \norganizations. They are not worthy of a great nation.\n  These are petty attacks on patriotic Russians who want the freedom to \npeacefully criticize and improve their government, to run for office, \nto have clean elections, and to have an independent judiciary that is \nnot used to quash political opponents.\n  The Russian people--our friends--deserve better than to have such \naspirations so brazenly and so shortsightedly repressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6184-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6184-S6185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SMARTER SENTENCING ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yesterday, I introduced the Smarter \nSentencing Act, bipartisan legislation that would reform our drug \nsentencing laws to make Federal sentencing policy smarter, fairer, and \nmore fiscally responsible.\n  This bill, which is cosponsored by Republican Senator Mike Lee and \nJudiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy, would reduce certain \nmandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and give \nFederal judges more ability to impose individualized sentences for \ncertain offenders. These modest changes will allow Federal law \nenforcement to focus limited government resources on the most serious \noffenders and public safety risks.\n  Why is this legislation needed? Let's look at where we are as a \ncountry. We incarcerate more individuals, including per capita, than \nany other nation in the world. Our rivals, with far lower incarceration \nrates, include countries like Rwanda, Cuba, China, and the Russian \nFederation.\n  And our incarceration rates are only growing over time. We have 500 \npercent more inmates in our Federal prisons than we did 30 years ago. \nFor example, in 1980 we had fewer than 25,000 in Federal custody, and \ntoday there are more than 219,000.\n  Our Federal prison system is at nearly 40 percent over capacity--with \nmore than 50 percent overcrowding at high-security facilities. As the \nGovernment Accountability Office has explained, this overcrowding is \nnot only creating financial strain, but it is jeopardizing the safety \nof both inmates and prison guards.\n  And who are we incarcerating with our limited resources? Nearly 50 \npercent of Federal inmates are serving sentences for drug offenses.\n  Let's be clear: The price tag for this system is unsustainably high \nin terms of both financial and human costs. What we spend on Federal \nincarceration has increased more than 1100 percent in the last 30 \nyears. The number was less than $330 million in 1980 and had \nskyrocketed to more than $6.6 billion by last year.\n  Our current incarceration policies are swallowing our limited law \nenforcement budget and forcing choices that many lawmakers and \ntaxpayers would not agree with. Incarceration and detention costs \naccount for nearly a third of the Department of Justice's discretionary \nbudget. This threatens funding for Federal prosecutions, Federal law \nenforcement, funding and grant money for State and local law \nenforcement, and support for treatment, intervention, and reentry \nprograms.\n  In the era of sequestration, we are faced with a choice: We can \neither change our sentencing policies or potentially suffer an erosion \nin public safety. We need to take steps to control Federal prison \nspending now or we will face significant cuts in the resources \navailable for other pressing criminal justice priorities like making \nsure there are police on the streets, crime prevention programs in \nplace, and an ability for offenders to reintegrate into their \ncommunities rather than become safety risks.\n  Many States across the country recognize that we are at a crossroads \nand they are pursuing important reforms with a high degree of success. \nA New York Times article published this week explains the ``new \napproach to crime'' many States are taking and the resulting decline in \nState prison populations. The Federal Government should follow suit.\n  And let's never forget the human costs. We hear every day about \nheartbreaking cases of mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, and children \nwho are behind bars for far too long sometimes decades--for nonviolent \noffenses. This harms communities and families.\n  One such case is a woman I came to know well, Eugenia Jennings. \nBecause of unjust sentencing laws, she was incarcerated in Federal \nprison at the age of 23 for more than two decades for a nonviolent drug \noffense involving the exchange of a small amount of drugs for clothing. \nEugenia had three children who were forced to grow up without their \nmother.\n  Even the sentencing judge acknowledged the injustice of Eugenia's \nsentence, lamenting ``there is nothing this court could do'' because of \nthe laws that existed. Eugenia was a model prisoner winning awards, \ncompleting substance abuse programs, and serving as a model employee \nwho worked at a call center and sewed thousands of pairs of shorts for \nthe military. Eugenia suffered from a serious and rare form of cancer \nwhile in Federal custody. Eugenia would still be serving a sentence \ntoday--a sentence that would be costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands \nof dollars and depriving children of a mother--had it not been for the \nhighly unusual grant of a Presidential commutation. Who benefited from \nthe many years Eugenia spent in prison?\n  How do we fix this problem or at least take an important step toward \nsolving it? We have learned that our exploding prison population is in \nlarge part due to ineffective sentencing laws and the increasing number \nand length of Federal mandatory minimum sentences. Mandatory sentences, \nparticularly drug sentences, can take individualized review out of a \njudge's hands by requiring a one-size-fits-all sentence imposed by \nCongress. And the number of Federal mandatory sentences has doubled \nduring the last 20 years.\n  More than 60 percent of Federal district court judges agree that \nexisting mandatory minimums for all offenses are too high. Many think \nthey are just bad policy. Justice Anthony Kennedy said: ``I am in \nagreement with most judges in the federal system that mandatory \nminimums are an imprudent, unwise and often unjust mechanism for \nsentencing.''\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States, which represents all \nFederal judges, has ``consistently opposed mandatory minimum sentences \nfor more than 50 years.'' The bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission \nrecently said, after studying this issue in a 369-page report, ``[T]he \nCommission unanimously believes that certain mandatory minimum \npenalties apply too broadly, are excessively severe, and are applied \ninconsistently. . . .''\n  We subject our Federal judges to a rigorous confirmation process. \nCongress should allow these judges to use their legal and law \nenforcement expertise to do their jobs and not micromanage their \nsentencing decisions. It is important in achieving both justice and \npublic safety to have sentences tailored to the individual facts, \nbackground, and circumstances of each case and defendant. Only the \njudge who hears a case has the ability to set such a sentence.\n  We are at a crucial moment in history. We can no longer afford \nsentencing policies that are not working, are draining limited Federal \nfunds, are leading to unjust sentences, and are failing to make our \nfamilies and communities safer.\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\n  As a result of these problems, some of the country's leading \nsentencing experts have called for the repeal of all Federal mandatory \nminimums. The Smarter Sentencing Act takes more modest but important \nsteps in modernizing drug sentencing policy.\n  First, it modestly expands the existing Federal safety valve, which \nallows Federal judges to sentence certain nonviolent drug offenders \nbelow existing mandatory minimum sentences. This change will only apply \nto certain nonviolent drug offenses that do not involve weapons. It is \nsupported by nearly 70 percent of Federal district court judges.\n  Second, the bill will permit those serving sentences that Congress \nhas determined are unjust and racially disparate to petition for a \nreduction in their sentence. I authored the bipartisan Fair Sentencing \nAct in 2009 to help reduce the sentencing disparity between crack and \npowder cocaine offenses and to eliminate the mandatory minimum sentence \nfor simple possession of crack cocaine. While African Americans were \napproximately 30 percent of crack users, they comprised more than 80 \npercent of those convicted of Federal crack offenses.\n  The bill passed the Senate unanimously. As one Judiciary Committee \nRepublican stated, ``[W]e are not able to defend'' the unfair sentences \nthat existed before the Fair Sentencing Act--sentences that \ndisproportionately affected African Americans. Another stated that \nthese changes were ``long overdue'' and that ``Congress should act \nwithout any more delay to start to reduce the sentencing disparity.'' A \nthird Republican member of the Judiciary Committee stated, ``The law \ncreated inequities. . . . We are working and will continue to work to \nroll back the injustice that was done.''\n  Because of the timing of their sentences, some individuals are still \nin jail serving lengthy, pre-Fair Sentencing Act sentences that \nCongress has determined are unfair. To be clear, the Smarter Sentencing \nAct does not automatically reduce a single sentence in this respect. \nBut it allows individuals sentenced under the old crack-powder \nsentencing disparity to petition courts and prosecutors for a review of \ntheir case, consistent with changes in the law made by the Fair \nSentencing Act. Considering all of the circumstances, including public \nsafety and the nature of the offense, a judge can grant or deny any \npetition. Federal courts successfully and efficiently conducted similar \ncrack-related sentence reviews after 2007 and 2011 changes to the \nSentencing Guidelines. Based on recent U.S. Sentencing Commission data, \nthis change in the law alone could significantly reduce prison \novercrowding and save taxpayers more than $1 billion.\n  Third, the bill lowers mandatory penalties for certain nonviolent \ndrug offenses. These modifications do not apply to, for example, \nstatutory penalties involving firearms or bodily injury. And this bill \ndoes not repeal any mandatory minimum sentences. Rather, it reduces \ncertain nonviolent drug mandatory sentences so that judges can \ndetermine, based on individual circumstances, when the harshest \npenalties should apply. Let's allow these judges to do their jobs.\n  This bill crosses party lines it is a bipartisan compromise from a \nRepublican from Utah and a Democrat from Illinois. This bill is the \nright thing to do, which is why it is endorsed by faith leaders from \nthe National Association of Evangelicals to the United Methodist \nChurch. This bill would improve public safety, which is why it is \nendorsed by the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nExecutives. And this bill is good policy, which is why it is endorsed \nby groups on the right and left, ranging from Heritage Action to the \nACLU. It is endorsed by Justice Fellowship of Prison Fellowship \nMinistries, Grover Norquist, the Leadership Conference on Civil and \nHuman Rights, the NAACP, the Sentencing Project, Open Society Policy \nCenter, the ABA, the Constitution Project, the National Association of \nCriminal Defense Lawyers, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nFamilies Against Mandatory Minimums, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil \nRights Under Law, Drug Policy Alliance, and Brennan Center for Justice, \namong others.\n  I thank my partner in this effort, Senator Lee. We have taken many \nmonths to study this problem and work together on a bipartisan \nsolution.\n  I am grateful to Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for joining this effort and, as always, for his leadership \non criminal justice reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Smarter Sentencing Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6185-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6185-S6186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REMEMBERING EDDY SIZEMORE, HERMAN `LEE' DOBBS, AND JESSE JONES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the \nvictims of a tragic accident that occurred recently in Clay County, KY. \nThree heroes were lost when a medical helicopter came down in the \nparking lot of Paces Creek Elementary School outside the town of \nManchester on June 6 of this year. Crewmembers Eddy Sizemore, the \npilot, Herman ``Lee'' Dobbs, the flight paramedic, and Jesse Jones, the \nflight nurse, sadly died in this crash.\n  The crew of this medical helicopter was returning back to their \nManchester base after transporting a patient in urgent need of care to \na hospital in London, KY. Medical helicopters help transport patients \nin remote areas to hospitals where they can receive all necessary \nmedical attention. Sadly, these three crewmembers who worked to save \nothers' lives lost their own.\n  Pilot Eddy Sizemore was 61 years old and a native of Laurel County, \nKY. He was a former chief deputy in the Laurel County Sheriff's Office. \nHe worked most of his life in law enforcement, and was a veteran of the \nU.S. Army; he served his country in Vietnam and was awarded the Bronze \nStar Medal and the Purple Heart. He is remembered by his three \ndaughters, Stacey Johnson, Kacey Bolton, and Jessica Sizemore; his son, \nJustin Sizemore; his father, Frank Sizemore; his brother, Jerry \nSizemore; the mother and stepmother of his children, Pam Brock \nSizemore; 10 grandchildren; and many other family members and friends.\n  Flight paramedic Herman ``Lee'' Dobbs, of London, KY, was 40 years \nold. He had worked for Knox County EMS and had a love of horses that \nled to his being put in charge of a horseback search unit for the Knox \nCounty Special Operations Response Team. He is remembered by his wife, \nEmilee Dobbs; his parents, Herman Dobbs and Patsy Light Dobbs; his \nchildren, Jordan, Hayden, and Walker Dobbs; his sister, Lori Crawford; \nhis brother, Chad Dobbs; his aunt, Sherri Blakely; his uncle, Dale \nLight; his mother-in-law, Candace Hutton; and many other family members \nand friends.\n  Flight nurse Jesse Jones was 28 and from Bell County, KY. He \ngraduated from Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College as a \nregistered nurse in 2007 and then pursued his dream of becoming a \nflight nurse. He is remembered by his grandparents, Mac and Ruby Jones; \nhis son, Tyson Lee Jones; his father, Eddie Gene Jones; his stepmother, \nPatricia Maye Jones; his brother, Wiley Gene Jones; and many other \nfamily members and friends.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that was \npublished recently in a southeastern Kentucky publication describing \nthe very moving memorial service held for the three crewmembers of the \ntragic Air Evac 109 flight be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Whitley County Times-Tribune, June 17, 2013]\n\n                      ``God Speed and Blue Skies''\n\n\n                      Air Evac 109 Crew Remembered\n\n                            (By Jeff Noble)\n\n       Corbin.--After the funerals of three of their crew members \n     last week, it was time for Air Evac Lifeteam to remember Eddy \n     Sizemore, Jesse Jones and Lee Dobbs.\n       On Saturday morning the company did just that, during an \n     emotional and moving memorial service in London.\n       Outside the North Laurel High School Gymnasium, the weather \n     was sunny and the skies blue, when an estimated 300 persons--\n     including the families of the three who died, as well as Air \n     Evac crews and first responders from Kentucky and other \n     states as far away as Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota and North \n     Carolina--came to say goodbye to their brothers who paid the \n     ultimate price while doing their duty.\n       For all of them, the memory of what happened on that late \n     Thursday night, June 6, will forever be seared in their \n     hearts and minds.\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\n       Sizemore was the pilot. Jones was the flight nurse. Dobbs \n     was the flight paramedic. All three died when their medical \n     helicopter crashed in the parking lot of Paces Creek \n     Elementary School in Clay County, just about 150 yards from \n     the helipad where the crew is based in Manchester.\n       For the crews, it was their time to mourn. To persevere. \n     And to have closure.\n       It was Pastor Donald Sims, of the City of Hope Community \n     Fellowship in Manchester, whose opening prayer began the \n     memorial service.\n       ``Lord, be with the families, their friends, and bring \n     hope, healing and comfort to all who are here,'' he prayed.\n       From the St. Louis suburb of O'Fallon, Missouri, came Air \n     Evac Lifeteam's president, Seth Myers. He was the first \n     speaker at the service, and told the audience and his \n     employees, ``It with a heavy heart that I stand here. To \n     honor the life of Eddy Sizemore, Lee Dobbs and Jesse Jones.''\n       He spoke of the three who perished, and spoke of the many \n     first responders who came to pay their respects.\n       ``I see uniforms of all colors. They all represent one \n     thing. That's the dedication to serve others. The attendance \n     today is a testament of these three people who served. They \n     loved doing what they did, and the crews working with them. \n     They helped to save lives and make a difference in peoples' \n     lives. They're gone from us today, but they'll never be \n     forgotten,'' Myers said.\n       He then read a letter from a woman, thanking the crews for \n     their service.\n       ``I can't imagine the emotions at this time, but you will \n     work as a team and persevere . . . For Eddy, Lee and Jesse, \n     their impact lives on in the life of every person they saved \n     . . . I challenge you to move forward. A Japanese proverb \n     said, `Fall down seven times, stand up eight.' Signed, Mandy \n     Curley,'' the letter said.\n       Eulogies were given for all three members of the helicopter \n     crew by friends and family. Eddy Sizemore was remembered \n     first.\n       ``My definition of a hero is someone laying down their life \n     helping someone they don't know. All three of those men did. \n     I'm alive and able to stand on this stage today, because of \n     Eddy's experience as a helicopter pilot. Eddy saved my \n     life,'' said Officer Chuck Johnson of the Laurel County \n     Sheriff's Department.\n       Johnson recalled riding with Sizemore as a spotter during a \n     marijuana search in 2005 when both worked together with the \n     sheriff's office. They were in the air when the chopper hit \n     guy wires, then plunged to earth, hit the ground and skidded \n     96 feet on the blacktop. Johnson said it was Sizemore's \n     skills, and cool in the hot seat, that brought the chopper \n     down safely.\n       ``I believe that God has a plan of a mission of all of us \n     here on Earth. On that day, our mission wasn't finished. On \n     June 6th, Eddy's mission was complete, and he was called \n     home,'' he pointed out.\n       There was another side to Sizemore. A lighter side that \n     permeated the workplace, and gave Johnson and his co-workers \n     a wealth of what he affectionately called ``Eddy Stories.''\n       ``He loved to sit and laugh and loved to cut up with us. \n     Eddy loved to keep people entertained. He also liked to cheat \n     at playing Rook during our times we worked the night shift \n     years ago with the Sheriff's Office . . . Eddy always had our \n     back. All of us who worked with him will continue to mourn. \n     There was only one Eddy Sizemore,'' Johnson said.\n       Kathy Guyn spoke next. She remembered when Jesse Jones was \n     in her nursing classes at the Pineville campus of Southeast \n     Community and Technical College.\n       ``He was the type of student everyone liked. Fun-loving, \n     and had a good time. Jesse was very intelligent. He wanted to \n     be a nurse. He made his patients feel very important, and \n     that they were the most important person in the hospital. He \n     loved to hunt. On more than one occasion he would remind me \n     and the other teachers that it was the beginning of deer \n     season. And he loved his family, especially his grandparents. \n     When he graduated, he told me he wanted to be a flight nurse. \n     He was meant to be in the skies. If I needed a flight nurse, \n     I would want Jesse Jones, because I know he was the best,'' \n     she stated.\n       Eliza Brooks started her nursing career with Jones at \n     Pineville Community Hospital. She also spoke on behalf of \n     Jesse's family.\n       ``He had an eagerness to learn more. My husband also worked \n     at the hospital, and he and Jesse became friends . . . We \n     would serve lasagna for Jesse every deer season, and on \n     Christmas, our family had a camouflage stocking for Jesse. To \n     the family, we want to thank you for sharing Jesse with us. \n     He loved all of you. He lived life every day to the fullest. \n     He was always loving, kind and compassionate. He knew what to \n     do, and never looked back. The sky was not the limit for \n     Jesse,'' she said, holding back tears.\n       Letch Day, of Air Methods Corporation, gave the first of \n     two eulogies for Lee Dobbs, the last of the crew of three \n     that Day called ``Our fallen heroes, our fallen brothers.''\n       ``To know Lee was an honor. He was a strong-willed person. \n     EMS was his job. It was his life. It was his passion. The one \n     letter to describe Lee was `C' character, caring, compassion, \n     commitment, companion, and childhood hero. His character was \n     what propelled him to excellence. He loved and cared for his \n     family. And he cared for his family and others with \n     compassion and commitment. He was to others a companion, and \n     to his children, a childhood hero to them,'' he said.\n       Day then looked at Dobbs's three sons and told them, ``Your \n     Dad. He is a hero. Don't ever forget that.''\n       Lee's own father, Herman Dobbs, took the stage next. His \n     voice cracked as he began to weep, while talking about the \n     son he lost almost two weeks ago.\n       ``Knowing Lee as my son, he would have said, Dad, did you \n     tell the Jones family, and the Sizemore family, I'm sorry for \n     their loss? They were my partners.' That's what he'd want me \n     to say. He was my son. We tried to bring him up that way. I'm \n     just so thankful the Lord gave me a son like that,'' Dobbs \n     said, his voice choked with emotion.\n       In the place where the North Laurel High Jaguars held \n     court, there were three wreaths on the stage--one each for \n     the three fallen crew members. In the middle of each wreath \n     was a picture of each of them. On each side of the stage was \n     a large video screen, which showed pictures and moments of \n     the lives of Lee, Eddy and Jesse. The seats on the gym floor \n     were reserved for family members and Air Evac employees. When \n     the doors opened at 10 a.m. for the service, the seats \n     quickly filled, with other Air Evac crews and first \n     responders joining the general public on the home side of the \n     bleacher seats.\n       Two Air Methods Corporation employees from Missouri--Ray \n     Haven and his wife, Veronica--sang the inspirational song ``I \n     Will Rise.'' Ray played acoustic guitar, while he and \n     Veronica sang the duet.\n       Towards the end of the service, three recorded songs were \n     played over the speakers while the audience watched the \n     visual montage of the three men they called ``their family.''\n       One was the song ``You Never Let Go,'' followed by ``Shine \n     Your Light,'' a tribute to first responders by Robbie \n     Robertson, a former member of The Band. The set ended with an \n     encore of ``You Never Let Go.''\n       When that ended, Brian Jackson, the program director of Air \n     Evac 109 in Manchester, came to the stage, accompanied by \n     nine crew members. Some of the crew shared stories and \n     lighthearted moments about their work with Lee, Jesse and \n     Eddy.\n       Several in the audience got some good laughs from the \n     stories, which a nearby person in the bleacher seats said \n     they needed.\n       Jackson told the crews and first responders, ``Thank you \n     for your prayers and your support during this time. It really \n     means a lot. We agree. They were brothers to us. They would \n     want me to tell you, Crawl back on that ambulance. Crawl back \n     on that truck. Crawl back on that airplane. Do what you do \n     best.'''\n       When the Manchester crew finished their final thoughts, \n     they pinned the wings on the wreaths of Dobbs, Sizemore and \n     Jones.\n       Letch Day returned, and presented a framed print in memory \n     of the three crewmen to the Air Evac 109 base in Manchester.\n       ``We're asking them to be our `Guardian Angels' in memory \n     of the job they did so well,'' he said.\n       Jackson and the base crew proudly accepted the print.\n       Kentucky state flags were presented to the families of the \n     three crewmen by Mike Poynter, the state EMS director. Air \n     Evac Lifeteam flags were also given to the three families, as \n     were three fire helmets brought to them in memory of their \n     fathers, by the Manchester Fire Department.\n       The tones were heard over the speakers, and the Last Call \n     was given by a dispatcher. When that ended, a piper played \n     ``Amazing Grace'' on the bagpipes as the color guard left the \n     gymnasium. And the service ended.\n       Nearly everyone who attended went outside to wait for an \n     aircraft flyover. Six helicopters and one airplane hovered \n     overhead for the next five minutes, each one's pilot and crew \n     showing in their own way their own respect and honor for \n     their fallen comrades.\n       For those up in the air, and on the ground, this past \n     Saturday was their time to remember.\n       It's a good bet that many of them will forever remember \n     those final words when they heard the crew's last call inside \n     the gymnasium.\n       ``November One-One-Nine Alpha Echo is out of service. God \n     speed and blue skies.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6186-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6186-S6187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to speak briefly about how \nthe immigration reform bill affects access to health insurance \ncoverage. In particular, I am pleased that the Senate-passed \nlegislation preserves the ability for States to cover lawfully residing \npregnant women and children under Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program CHIP. Importantly, States may extend full benefits \nunder these programs to individuals who gain legal status as a result \nof the bill, including those granted Registered Provisional Immigrant \nRPI, Blue Card, and V-visa status.\n  My home State of Washington is one of 27 that have decided to \nexercise the option to extend these health care benefits to children or \npregnant women. We do this because we know that when women have access \nto prenatal care, children are born healthier. We all benefit when \nchildren receive the immunizations they need and are able to see a \ndoctor when they are sick.\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\n  During the debate on S. 744, two of my colleagues, Chairman Leahy and \nSenator Rockefeller, came to the floor to discuss this issue. I join \nthem in support of preserving States' rights to extend Medicaid and \nCHIP benefits to lawfully residing noncitizen children and pregnant \nwomen. I thank my colleagues for addressing an issue that is critical \nto my home State and I echo their comments on the intention of the \nSenate with regard to this issue.\n  Madam President, I would also like to speak today about the need for \ncomprehensive immigration reform by highlighting the work of one of my \nconstituents.\n  I was touched when I read a poem written by 10-year-old Erin Stark of \nBellevue, WA. I met Erin last month at a welcoming ceremony for new \nimmigrants in my home State of Washington. She told me about her \npassion for writing and explained that she won a national writing \ncontest with the submission of her poem on immigration. I think her \nwords exemplify the diversity and extraordinary contributions made by \nimmigrants to this country.\n\n    ``What Would You Miss About Immigrants, If They Didn't Come to \n                               America?''\n\n     Would you miss the food?\n     The pot stickers, sushi, and dumplings,\n     Pizza, spaghetti, curry, or crepes?\n     Just think about it for a minute or two,\n     Could you survive eating fish at every meal?

Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to my colleague \nRohit Kumar, who will soon, unfortunately, be leaving Senate service \nfor other pursuits.\n  Rohit stood by me and others here in the Senate as we navigated \nthrough deep challenges faced by our Nation, and he has consistently \nand vigilantly worked for the American people to promote a lot of good, \nand to prevent a lot of bad from happening.\n  Rohit is a consummate Senate professional whose skills and \naccomplishments have provided a long strand of service to this body and \nto the country. He is a rarity, combining a razor-sharp intellect, \nlogical patterns of thought, and an ability to obtain fair and balanced \nassessments of challenges that typically involve tradeoffs across a \nhost of competing interests. He adds to that an uplifting disposition \nand a keen wit.\n  Rohit possesses mastery of policy, politics, rules of the Congress, \nand more. While most of us would be content having mastery of any one \nof those realms, Rohit has managed to master them all. He is a complete \npackage.\n  Rohit has been an asset to me, to my caucus, to Senate Leadership, \nand to the country, and his presence will be missed by all of us.\n  All of us here in the Senate are also indebted to Rohit's beautiful \nfamily, which has endured the often-rigorous demands that his Senate \nservice has placed on them. I can think of more than a few occasions \nwhere Rohit was negotiating issues that are deeply important for the \nfuture of our Nation in stressful, around-the-clock marathon sessions.\n  If you were to ask me to construct a template for an ideal person to \nhave by your side to navigate through the tough decisions, tradeoffs, \nand negotiations we face in Congress, I would simply point to Rohit \nKumar.\n  We are all very sad to see Rohit leave. We trust that he will be able \nto take a bit more time with his family, and will pursue future \nendeavors with more of the same rigor and industriousness he has \nconsistently shown in his service to the country while working in the \nSenate. Wherever he goes, without doubt, those around him will benefit \ntremendously.\n  I wish to thank Rohit for the many years of outstanding assistance he \nhas provided to me, to my colleagues in the Senate, and to the country. \nI also thank his family for sharing Rohit with us, and for persevering \nas we often tapped his talents around the clock. I am proud to have \nworked with Rohit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6187-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HARRY BYRD JR.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to pay special tribute to a \nman I admired for many years, former U.S. Senator Harry Byrd Jr. Sadly, \nHarry passed away July 30, 2013, leaving behind a lasting legacy that \ngarnered the respect of many throughout our State and Nation.\n  Senator Byrd made history in 1970 when he became the first person to \nwin election to the U.S. Senate as an independent candidate. He used \nthat independence to be a voice for good and was someone people \nrespected for his deliberative manner.\n  Senator Byrd was not one to introduce unnecessary legislation and in \nfact believed legislation was not always the answer. However one of his \nproudest moments as a legislator was his work on a bill that mandated a \nbalanced Federal budget in 1978. He set the tone for my own commitment \nto this principle that I have continued to fight for throughout my \nservice in the Senate.\n  I had the pleasure of getting to know Harry during my early years as \na Senator. In fact, after the important and difficult Labor Law Reform \nbattle I waged 2-years into office, I received a note from Harry that I \ntreasure to this day. This Independent Senator praised my work and \ndeclared that ``. . . the American people are indebted to you.'' Strong \nwords from a strong man that I looked up to and admired as a very \njunior Senator just learning the ropes.\n  Senator Byrd not only conquered the political world--he was a highly \nrespected voice in the newspaper business--two entities not always \nknown for cohesive relationships. He spent many decades in publishing \nand served as editor and publisher for two newspapers; as well as the \nvice president of the Associated Press.\n  His service in the Senate was matched by his service to his country \nin the U.S. Navy as a Lieutenant Commander during World War II. His \nlove for America and the ideals it represents could be found throughout \nthe good works he performed throughout his life.\n  Our nation lost a truly wonderful man. I know that many people will \ntruly miss his strength, leadership, and wisdom.\n  Elaine and I convey our deepest sympathies to his three children and \ntheir families. May our Heavenly Father bless them with peace and \ncomfort at this time. The contributions and impact Senator Byrd made on \nhis family, his community, and our Nation will be felt and appreciated \nfor generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6187-3", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6187-S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNITED STATES-ISRAEL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the United States-Israel Strategic \nPartnership Act of 2013 reaffirms the strong relationship the United \nStates has with Israel. As the legislation states, our countries share \na deep and unbreakable bond, forged by over 60 years of shared \ninterests and shared values.\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\n  S. 462 includes provisions that will enhance cooperation between our \ncountries in the areas of energy, defense, homeland security, and \nagriculture.\n  While I support the end goal of the bill, I do have reservations \nabout a section dealing with the visa waiver program. The visa waiver \nprogram was created by Congress but is largely overseen and maintained \nby the executive branch. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, may designate any country as \na participant if certain qualifications are met. Congress laid out the \ncriteria, which include low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate; machine \nreadable passport program; law enforcement and security interests; \nreporting lost and stolen passports; repatriation of aliens; and \npassenger information exchange.\n  Once a country meets these requirements, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity allows the country to participate in the visa waiver program. \nYet, S. 462 would amend the statute and allow Israel in the program \neven if all the criteria are not met. Specifically, under the \nlegislation, Israel would not have to abide by the low nonimmigrant \nvisa refusal rate. Currently, 37 countries participate in the visa \nwaiver program without needing a special exception.\n  I am concerned about section 9 of the bill because it sets a \nprecedent for other countries not to have to abide by all the terms of \nthe program. Participating in the visa waiver program is a great \nbenefit. Congress should not be making exceptions.\n  So, while I support the bill and am cosponsoring it today, I will \nadvocate that section 9 be amended before it is passed by this body. \nThe Senate should accept the House language, which simply includes a \nstatement of policy and requires the Secretary of State to report on \nthe extent to which Israel satisfies the requirements specified in law.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with me on this section, and I look \nforward to helping pass this bill in the Senate to reaffirm the \npartnership of United States with Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6188-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Kirk A. Owen\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I pay tribute today to a true American \nhero, Army SSG Kirk A. Owen of Sapulpa, OK who died on August 2nd, \n2011, serving our Nation in Paktya Province, Afghanistan. Staff \nSergeant Owen was assigned as a scout to Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade \nCombat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.\n  Staff Sergeant Owen died of injuries sustained when the vehicle in \nwhich he was riding was attacked with an improvised explosive device in \nthe Lajah District, Paktya Province while conducting combat operations. \nHe was 37 years old.\n  Kirk enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard at the age of 31 as a \nChaplain's Assistant after seeing a recruiting commercial on television \nand deployed in support of disaster relief operations following \nHurricane Katrina. Kirk then deployed again to Iraq in 2007 as an \ninfantryman and rose through the ranks to Staff Sergeant. He served as \na full time Army National Guard Soldier. He strived to be the best in \neverything he did and was repeatedly recognized for his excellence as \nthe Hero of the Battlefield and the outstanding soldier in the 45th \nInfantry Brigade Combat Team for his performance at the Joint Readiness \nTraining Center, and presented the Unsung Hero Award when he attended \nthe Ranger Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leader Course for his scout \ntraining. He also was Soldier of the Cycle for basic training and given \nDistinguished Honors at Advanced Individual Training.\n  A true warrior and leader, Kirk died while escorting an Explosive \nOrdnance Disposal team to disarm dangerous explosive devices in Paktya \nProvince. Kirk was a loving husband, endearing father, and faithful \nfriend. His loving presence, strong faith, incredible sense of duty and \nhonor, and his wonderful sense of humor left a lasting impression on \nevery heart he touched.\n  First Baptist Church Pastor Doyle Pryor said, ``Kirk is one of those \nguys who had a natural sense of duty and honor. He really believed his \nmilitary service was a calling from God.''\n  Major General Myles Deering, the Oklahoma National Guard Adjutant \nGeneral, said, ``He was an outstanding non-commissioned officer, \ndedicated to loyally serving his country and fellow Soldiers. His loss \nis being felt across the state and he will be greatly missed.''\n  His daughter Kylie wrote:\n\n       My dad was a fantastic leader. All of his guys looked up to \n     him. My nickname for him was Ironman. There was nothing to me \n     that he couldn't do. He loved Jesus with all his heart and \n     that's where my peace is coming from. I can just see him up \n     in heaven following Jesus around wanting to know everything. \n     A few weeks before he left we were at the grocery store and \n     my dad and little sister were walking down the marshmallow \n     aisle and he turned to her and said `Kayci, I think heaven \n     will smell like marshmallows.' I hope it does. The memory of \n     my dad will live on forever and his good looks will too.\n\n  In July 2012, the town of Sapulpa dedicated a neighborhood park where \nthe Owen family still lives as a tribute to Kirk and his service to our \nNation. There is a lasting monument in his honor.\n  Kirk lived a life of love for God, his wife and daughters, family, \nfriends, and country. He leaves behind a wonderful and loving family: \nhis wife, Tiffany and daughters, Kylie and Kayci. He will be remembered \nfor his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our nation. I am \nhonored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go \ninto the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for our protection and \nfreedom. We will keep them in our thoughts and prayers, always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6188-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6188-S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HYDROPOWER REGULATORY EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I rise today to express my support for the Hydropower \nRegulatory Efficiency Act of 2013, H.R. 267. This important legislation \nwill encourage and facilitate the development of clean and renewable \nhydropower capacity in the United States.\n  Hydropower has played a key role in the economic and industrial \ndevelopment of the State of Alabama over the last 100 years. In fact, \naccording to the National Hydropower Association, Alabama ranks among \nthe top ten States in hydropower generation, with over 8,700,000 \nmegawatt-hours of conventional hydrogeneration. I believe hydropower \nwill continue to make important contributions to meet Alabama's energy \nneeds well into the future. For that reason, I believe the Hydropower \nRegulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 is an important piece of legislation \nthat merits this body's full support. I would like to recognize the \nexcellent work of the Senate Energy Committee, including the chairman \nand ranking member, on this legislation. At this time, I wish to ask \nthe ranking member for permission to engage her in a brief colloquy \nconcerning her understanding of Section 6 of this legislation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I welcome an exchange for the record.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague for her willingness to discuss \nthis legislation. Section 6 of the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act \nof 2013 promotes hydropower development by directing the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, FERC, to investigate the feasibility of a more \nstreamlined licensing process for certain hydro projects that should \nnot be subjected to the lengthy and expensive licensing process that \nwas designed for projects with many more complicated issues and \nstakeholder interests.\n  Under H.R. 267, two types of projects would be eligible for the 2-\nyear licensing process: new hydro developments at existing nonpowered \ndams and closed-loop pumped storage hydro. It is my understanding that \nadding generation capacity at existing nonpowered dams would tap into \nan important and substantial renewable energy resource at projects \nwhere the impacts of dam construction have already been realized.\n  For hydropower developers to take full advantage of any streamlined \nlicensing process that FERC may develop as contemplated in Section 6 of \nthe act, I believe there needs to be a good understanding of what types \nof pumped storage projects would be considered ``closed-loop pumped \nstorage projects.'' This term is not defined in the act, and I am not \naware of any generally accepted engineering or industry definition for \nthat term.\n  In order that I might have a better understanding of the types of \nhydropower projects that would be eligible\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\nfor a streamlined licensing process that FERC may develop in accordance \nwith Section 6 of the act, would the ranking member kindly provide a \ndescription of the types of pumped storage projects that she would \nconsider to be ``closed-loop pumped storage''?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator for his support of this \nlegislation and for his inquiry about Section 6 of the Act. \nStreamlining the licensing process for ``closed-loop pumped storage'' \nprojects will encourage development of new and important sources of \nrenewable energy that will help balance the country's energy resources \nand provide critical support to the Nation's power grid.\n  Section 6 of the bill directs FERC to develop criteria for \nidentifying projects featuring ``closed loop pumped storage'' that \nwould be appropriate for licensing within a 2-year process. This term \nwas used in the bill to generally describe pumped storage projects that \nhave a low impact on the various resources considered by FERC during \nthe licensing process such as environmental, recreational, and \nnavigation interests.\n  For example, pumped storage projects that are removed from major \nstreams are likely to have fewer significant resource impacts and \nissues to be addressed and resolved, which makes them appropriate for \nthe 2-year licensing process. Accordingly, the types of pumped storage \nprojects considered ``closed loop'' and, therefore, eligible for FERC's \nexpedited licensing process under this bill, would include projects \nwhere the upper and lower reservoirs do not impound or directly \nwithdraw water from a navigable stream and projects that are not \ncontinuously connected to a naturally-flowing water feature.\n  These types of ``closed loop pumped storage'' designs are candidates \nfor a 2-year licensing process because the resource impacts associated \nwith such projects can be minimal as compared to more traditional \npumped storage hydro designs and other conventional hydro projects for \nwhich the existing FERC licensing process was designed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Ranking Member Murkowski for her explanation. \nAgain, I applaud her for her work on the Hydropower Regulatory \nEfficiency Act of 2013 and for her leadership in this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6189-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to an incredible \nwoman--former Congresswoman and Ambassador Lindy Boggs--who was a \ntrailblazer for women and a passionate advocate for the people of \nLouisiana and people across the country who too often don't have a \nvoice in Washington.\n  When I first became a Member of Congress in 1983, Lindy was one of \nonly 21 women serving in the House of Representatives. I will always be \ngrateful for the kindness and generosity she showed in taking me under \nher wing--and it was the same for so many other women who followed her \nin Congress and found in her a role model of such dignity and strength.\n  No one will ever forget her courage in the face of unspeakable \ntragedy--the loss of her husband, Congressman Hale Boggs, whose plane \ndisappeared during a campaign trip to Alaska in 1972. Louisianans, \nincluding her husband's closest friends, urged her to run for the seat \nin a special election the next year, and she became the first woman \nelected to Congress from the State where she was beloved.\n  I remember visiting Lindy's home State of Louisiana years later and \nbeing overwhelmed at the outpouring of love and respect the people she \nrepresented had for her--and with good reason. Throughout her time in \nCongress, she was a champion for civil rights, women's equality, and \nsocial justice.\n  During her first term in Congress, Lindy was assigned to the House \nBanking Committee. At one point, the committee was considering an \namendment to a lending bill banning discrimination on the basis of \nrace, age or veteran status.\n  Seizing the opportunity, Lindy quickly added the words ``sex or \nmarital status'' to the amendment and ran to a copy machine to make \ncopies for each Member. She told her colleagues:\n\n       Knowing the Members composing this committee as well as I \n     do, I'm sure it was just an oversight that we didn't have \n     `sex' or `marital status' included. I've taken care of that, \n     and I trust it meets with the committee's approval.\n\n  That is how sex discrimination was made illegal in the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act of 1974.\n  She was a skilled lawmaker who used her immense personal charm, \npolitical savvy and intellect to win over colleagues on issues that \nwere critical to her State and the country. One of her Republican House \ncolleagues remarked:\n\n       It was impossible not to like Lindy. She liked everybody. \n     She was nice to everybody. She achieved more with less huff \n     and puff and bluster than any of the rest of us did.\n\n  Lindy stood up for equality and racial justice, even when her views \nwere not popular with some voters in her own district. When she left \nCongress in 1991 after serving nine terms, she was the only White \nMember to represent a Black-majority district.\n  She led the fight for equal pay for women in government jobs and for \ngreater access to government contracts for women business owners. She \nworked to protect women from domestic violence, and inspired so many \nyoung people--women and men--to follow her into public service.\n  Lindy was a pioneer in so many ways--the first woman to chair a major \npolitical party's nominating convention, the first woman to serve as \nU.S. Ambassador to the Vatican, and the first woman to have a room in \nthe Capitol named in her honor. But because of her leadership and \nmentorship, Lindy made sure that she would not be the last and that \ngenerations of other women would be able to follow in her extraordinary \nfootsteps.\n  My heart goes out to her family, her friends and all of those whose \nlives she touched. She will be dearly missed.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, today I honor and celebrate the life \nof an extraordinary American: Marie Corinne Morrison Claiborne Boggs, \nwho we all knew as ``Lindy.'' She was a remarkable national leader, \ntrailblazer for women everywhere, wife, mother, and a friend. Lindy \ntaught me--and an entire generation of Louisianians, both men and \nwomen, through her example--to answer the call of public service.\n  With her death last Saturday, July 28, 2013, our entire State is in \nmourning but we are also celebrating a life well lived.\n  Throughout her life, she shaped the world to become a better and more \njust place. When she was born in 1916, women could not vote and \nsegregation reigned supreme. But she refused to accept the world as it \nwas and set about to change it. She lived through both World Wars and \nthe Great Depression. Despite all of these daunting obstacles, Lindy--a \ngraceful woman with a strong, passionate calling to serve others--was \nnot deterred.\n  Like many women of her time, she married a man of great promise--and \nultimately great power--Hale Boggs. But\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nwhen he was lost in a tragic plane accident in Alaska, she--unlike \nmany--stepped up and into his shoes, trusting God to lead her forward.\n  She was elected to succeed her husband in Congress on March 20, 1973, \nand became the first woman elected to the House of Representatives from \nour State. At the time, there were only 15 women in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and none in the U.S. Senate.\n  But Lindy never let the novelty of this, the pressure of work and \nfamily, or any other challenge she faced throughout her career stand in \nher way or deter her from serving her State and her country.\n  Her keen political mind, iron will and graceful Southern charm helped \nher become one of the most formidable forces Congress has ever known. \nShe was known for bridging the gap between Republicans and Democrats \nand convincing her colleagues to do what was right with poise, kindness \nand reason.\n  As her colleague Bill Frenzel, a Republican from Minnesota said of \nher: ``It was impossible not to like Lindy. She liked everybody. She \nwas nice to everybody. She achieved more with less huff and puff and \nbluster than any of the rest of us did.''\n  She used her formidable influence to help lead the fight for civil \nrights, pay equity for women and the right for women to hold a mortgage \non her own home without the necessity of a husband's signature.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee she inserted a provision barring \ndiscrimination over sex or marital status into the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act of 1974. She did not tell her colleagues before she did \nit and simply told them:\n\n       Knowing the members composing this committee as well as I \n     do, I'm sure it was just an oversight that we didn't have \n     `sex' or `marital status' included. I've taken care of that, \n     and I trust it meets with the committee's approval.\n\n  There was no objection! And tens of millions of women were given \naccess to credit, opportunity and a future of their own.\n  Lindy never tired in her fight to expand opportunities for women, \nwhether it was helping women as candidates for public office at all \nlevels of government, pressing Federal cabinet secretaries and agency \nheads to promote women to senior leadership and policy positions in \ngovernment, supporting women that work two to three jobs to keep food \non the table and a roof over their head or speaking out for victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  In fact today, there is a place named ``Lindy's Place'' in New \nOrleans that carries on her work to support abused and battered women.\n  In 1976, she nominated a young woman from New Orleans to the U.S. \nMilitary Academy as soon as the Army dropped the gender bar, and then \nquickly nominated women to all four service academies. She applauded \nNASA when Sally Ride was the first female American astronaut to go into \nspace. She knew women could really excel at anything whether it was on \nthis planet or beyond.\n  Following her retirement from Congress in 1991, she once again \nanswered the call to serve as the first female ambassador to the Holy \nSee where she continued to exhibit the same strength, intelligence and \nrespect that she was known for throughout her life. She was most \ncertainly the only person to call the Pope ``darlin'!''\n  Lindy's decades of service to her family, community, Nation and \nchurch reminds us all to give of ourselves fully to a worthy cause, and \nis an example of what we can achieve when we do. She has certainly set \nthe gold standard for public service.\n  But knowing Lindy as well as I did, I believe she was most proud of \nher 3 children, 8 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.\n  As many of you know, the special cloakroom for the women of the House \nbears Lindy's name. A few months ago when we celebrated the 40th \nanniversary of Lindy's election, she said she was proud of that room, \nbut that ``Maybe, someday, the women will have to relinquish the room \nwhen women are the majority in the House.''\n  I know that Lindy will be proud when women achieve this milestone. \nEven after that day comes, Lindy's legacy will continue to inspire us \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6190-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING WILLIAM H. GRAY III\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, today I wish to honor and remember the \nfull life of Congressman William H. Gray, III, and his exceptional \nservice to his community, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and our \ncountry.\n  Bill was born in Baton Rouge, LA, the second child of Dr. William H. \nGray, Jr., and Hazel Gray. Though he spent the first 8 years of his \nlife in Florida, Bill moved to Philadelphia in 1949 and remained a \ndistinguished resident of our Commonwealth until his recent passing.\n  Bill was a pastor and shepherd for his congregation, a respected \nmember of the U.S. House of Representatives, and a powerful advocate \nfor higher education. Today we honor his life, his good works, and his \nlegacy.\n  As a pastor, Bill followed in the footsteps of his father and \ngrandfather and led Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church for more \nthan 33 years. Knowing that the ministry was not just something you did \non Sunday morning, Bill always believed strongly in the principle of a \n``whole ministry,'' that the church must tend to all the needs of its \nentire congregation. Under Bill's leadership, that congregation quickly \ngrew to over 4,000 parishioners, but Bill remained committed to his \n``whole ministry'' and made sure to continue his important advocacy \nwork on issues ranging from housing, to economic justice, to excellent \neducation for all. Bill often said that his position as pastor of \nBright Hope was the most important job he had ever had, one that \ncultivated the skills and priorities that shaped his life's work.\n  As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Bill proudly \nrepresented the Second District of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1991 and \nbuilt a reputation as a thoughtful and effective leader. Bill quickly \nrose through the ranks of leadership during his 12 years in Congress \nand assumed the chairmanship of the Budget Committee, after only 6 \nyears in office. Three years later, in 1988, he was elected to chair \nhis party's House caucus, and then in 1989 he became the House majority \nwhip, the third-ranking leadership position in the House.\n  As a lifelong advocate for higher education, Bill chose to leave \nCongress at the pinnacle of his career to accept the position of \npresident and CEO of the United Negro College Fund. He said at the time \nthat ``Woodrow Wilson used to say, `My constituency is the next \ngeneration,' and you know, that's why I left Congress, because my \nconstituency, really, is the next generation.'' Bill's 12-year tenure \nat UNCF brought unexpected growth in support for historically Black \ncolleges, and he constantly sought innovative ways to both attract new \ninvestment and increase existing funding. By the time he left UNCF 12 \nyears later, Bill and his team had raised more than $1.54 billion.\n  Bill never rested and was never satisfied with one job at a time. \nWhile leading the UNCF, he was asked by President Clinton in 1994 to \nlead the efforts to restore democracy in Haiti. His work there earned \nhim the Medal of Honor from the President of Haiti. In 2004, Bill \nstarted Gary Global Strategies, Inc., and served as a director on \nmultiple corporate boards, including at Dell, JPMorgan Chase, and \nPfizer. He also served as vice chairman for the Pew Commission on \nChildren in Foster Care and on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.\n  Bill often said that he had ``always been taught by my folk, parents, \ngrandparents, that service is sort of the rent you pay for the space \nyou occupy. And so, what I've tried to do is direct my life towards \nservice based on faith and commitment, and social justice.'' As Bill's \nfamily and friends mourn his passing, I pray that they will be \ncomforted by the knowledge that this great Nation will never forget the \ncommitment Bill demonstrated to each of us, to his ``whole ministry.'' \nMay he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6190-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6190-S6191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BLAISE MESSINGER\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, today I wish to recognize Blaise \nMessinger, Connecticut's 2013 Teacher of the Year.\n  Every year the Connecticut State Department of Education selects one \nteacher for this prestigious title who\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\nthen serves as an ambassador for education throughout the State and \nalso represents Connecticut on a national scale, working on panels and \nadvisory committees with other State teachers of the year, as well as \nwith the National State Teacher of the Year Program and the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. This year's Connecticut Teacher of the Year, \nBlaise Messinger, was selected from 4 finalists, 15 semifinalists, and \nover 80 district teachers of the year for this tremendous distinction.\n  Mr. Messinger makes an extraordinary difference in the lives of his \nstudents and their families and at his school. He is an inspiration to \nhis colleagues. At Woodside Intermediate School in Cromwell, CT, he is \nwell known for his commitment to making fifth grade engaging and \ninteresting. An actor in Los Angeles and New York City for many years, \nMr. Messinger dedicates this thespian acumen and ability to his \nstudents' progress. By making school fun and relevant, his students \nremember what he teaches and come out of his classroom as enthusiastic \nlearners. When addressing fellow educators as Connecticut Teacher of \nthe Year, he advised his colleagues to ``think back to that teacher you \ncan still hear in your head.'' I am grateful that Mr. Messinger came to \nConnecticut to apply his talents, high energy, and positive spirit as a \ncommunity leader.\n  One personal inspiration for Mr. Messinger's incredible impact as a \nteacher is his own family--especially his two sons, Ethan and Caleb, \nwho live with him and his wife Kimberley in Cromwell. Mr. Messinger has \nsaid that his love for them--and his witnessing how teachers impacted \ntheir lives, especially his son Ethan who has autism--drives his desire \nto change the lives of children.\n  I thank the Connecticut State Department of Education and the \nNational Teacher of the Year Program for representing the voices of \npassionate, talented teachers and recognizing their heroic efforts. Mr. \nMessinger has already done great work on a national level, sparking \nimportant discussions about changing the way we educate our future \ngenerations. I am very proud that he represents Connecticut as 2013 \nTeacher of the Year and invite my colleagues to join me in applauding \nhis invaluable contributions to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6191-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6191-S6192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I wish to speak about the crisis in \nSyria and the role that one company in one nation is playing in \nperpetuating the strife.\n  Every day Syria descends deeper into chaos and civil war. Since March \n2011, more than 100,000 Syrians have been killed, an estimated 5 \nmillion have been internally displaced, and at least 1.6 million have \nfled their war-torn land. By the end of 2013, half of Syria's \npopulation may have left their homes.\n  The pressure on neighboring countries, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and \nIraq, is only increasing. Beyond the refugee crisis, the resulting \nchaos threatens unprecedented violence and instability for all of \nSyria's neighbors. As Syria's conflict grows increasingly radical, its \nborders are increasably insecure.\n  In August 2011, now nearly 2 years ago, President Obama declared that \nSyria's dictator, Bashar Asad, had lost all legitimacy and ``must go.'' \nAt the time of that statement, the number of Syrians butchered by the \nAsad regime numbered a then-shocking 6,000. There were frequent grim \ncomparisons to Bashar al-Asad's father Hafez, who shelled Hama for days \nin 1982, killing perhaps 20,000. Now, today we see a nation on a path \nto destruction and Hafez Asad's 20,000 dead is just a fraction of the \nnumber his son has killed.\n  America must take seriously its commitment to doing what it can to \nbring an end to the Asad regime. We must not tolerate the empowerment \nof forces antithetical to our interests. And we certainly must not be \ncomplicit in their behavior.\n  The triumph of the Asad regime would validate and encourage the \nmurderous behavior of leaders who spurn democracy and the rule of law. \nIt would empower the belligerent regime in Tehran and offer support to \nIranian proxies who seek to annihilate Israel and ultimately threaten \nour own nation.\n  While we view the Asad regime with rebellion, some others have \nstepped up support for him, facilitating Asad's brutal success. Among \nthese is the Government of Russia. Russia has demonstrated time and \nagain its support for Bashar Asad and its opposition to our own \nhumanitarian and democratic values.\n  Russia has consistently thwarted multilateral efforts to stem the \nviolence in Syria, including vetoing a United Nations Security Council \nresolution that would have penalized Asad's failure to carry out a \npeace plan. It has made clear its unwavering support for Asad's \nbrutality. Addressing the compounding challenges posed by Russian \nintransience has proven increasingly difficult. The Obama \nadministration has made a serious effort to engage in a direct dialog \nover matters related to Syria, most recently along the sidelines of the \nG8.\n  But that effort has not been fruitful. Indeed, the Russian Government \nhas demonstrated no genuine interest in achieving a resolution to the \nSyria conflict. Moscow appears to simply enjoy the political cover that \nU.S.-Russian talks provide. Russia remains unwavering in its support \nfor an Asad regime that has hosted its bases, served Russian economic \ninterests, and anchored what remains of Russia's influence in the \nregion.\n  At the same time, Moscow continues to flout international norms. \nRussia is acting antagonistically toward our Nation. It perpetuates \nhuman rights abuses at home. It sacrifices the well-being of Russia's \norphans for the sake of political gains. And it is sheltering the \nfugitive Edward Snowden.\n  Russia's state-owned arms export firm, Rosoboronexport, has \nexacerbated the crisis in Syria. Instead of promoting a path to peace, \nRosoboronexport has provided the Syrian Government with the means to \nperpetrate widespread and systemic attacks on its own people. It has \nsupplied Asad with guns, grenades, tank parts, attack aircraft, anti-\nship cruise missiles, and air defense missiles, which his regime in \nturn uses to perpetuate its rule and murder innocent civilians. \nRosoboronexport also has made a commitment to provide Syria with S-300 \nadvanced anti-aircraft missiles that would protect Syrian air dominance \nand facilitate its continued attacks on its civilian population.\n  These weapons do not threaten the Syrian people alone. They challenge \nAmerican interests in the region, including the safety and security of \nIsrael.\n  Let's look at one particular example that has received a good deal of \ninternational attention. It is certainly possible that NATO or our own \nNation may decide it is necessary to create a no-fly zone over Syria to \nstop the carnage. Russian-provided S-300s would present a major threat \nto U.S. or allied aircraft and pilots seeking to establish such a zone. \nThey would also pose a direct threat to Israeli civil and military air \ntraffic.\n  The Russian transfer of weapons to Syria is not just inhumane, but it \nis a violation of U.S. law. The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human \nRights Act of 2012 and the Iran, North Korea, and Syria \nNonproliferation Accountability Act, as well as Executive Orders 13382 \nand 13582 all demand sanctions against ``those entities that materially \nassist, or provide support for, the Government of Syria.''\n  In addition, the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act \nprohibits contracts with Rosoboronexport, and section 1233 of S. 1197, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which was \npassed by the Senate Armed Services Committee, prohibits the use of \nfunds to enter contracts with Rosoboronexport.\n  In light of the lack of progress of diplomatic efforts to end Russian \nsupport for the Asad regime and the direct nature of the threat these \nescalating arms sales pose, it is incumbent upon the U.S. Government to \npursue more aggressive measures as mandated by U.S. law to create \nincentives for the Russians to change their behavior. Indeed, Senator \nKelly Ayotte and I have written to the President urging that he take \nthis course.\n  With the exception of particular circumstances of true military \nnecessity, the administration must end all financial dealings with \nRosoboronexport and begin to impose sanctions against Rosoboronexport.\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\n  We must also impose sanctions against any Russian manufacturers that \nprovide military equipment such as advanced anti-aircraft systems to \nSyria in contravention of U.S. law.\n  In my view, it is unconscionable for us to provide Russia with the \nrecently announced $550 million contract for 30 additional Mi-17 \nhelicopters, a purchase the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction has strongly advised against.\n  American taxpayer dollars should not be provided to a Russian state-\nowned corporation that is complicit in the murder of tens of thousands \nof innocent Syrian men, women, and children. The Department of Defense \nhas the authority to end this contract with Rosoboronexport, which \nfails to meet the requirements of the Afghan military, and I have \njoined many of my colleagues in urging the administration to review \nthis sale.\n  The United States must not be complicit in the arming of the Asad \nregime nor in the empowerment of countries like Iran, which will \ntriumph if Asad succeeds. I urge the administration to impose sanctions \non Rosoboronexport and to demonstrate to Russia that its behavior in \nSyria will not be cost-free in its relations with our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6192-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING PETER SORBO\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, today I wish to honor the service of Mr. \nPeter Sorbo, of Connecticut, whose family resides in Waterbury, CT. In \nJanuary 1943, 18 year-old Peter Sorbo enlisted in the Army to serve his \ncountry during World War II. Deployed to the European theater and \nassigned to Bombardment Group 384, Squadron 545, he served as a waist \ngunner on a B-17 Flying Fortress and perished on August 12, 1943 after \nhis plane was shot down above the Rhine.\n  I would like to have printed in the Record an article from the \nWaterbury Republican American that outlines this fascinating story \nabout one of Connecticut's brave soldiers.\n  Many of Connecticut's sons, like Peter Sorbo, gave their lives \ndefending our freedom and they deserve our perpetual gratitude. I ask \nthat this body devote itself to remembering these courageous men and \nwomen by honoring their sacrifices and forever preserving their \nmemories.\n  The following article written by Mike Patrick appeared in the July \n29, 2013 edition of the Waterbury Republican-American. Madam President, \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                        The Truth . . . Finally\n\n\n  It took decades, but Waterbury sisters learn about their brother's \n                         death in World War II\n\n       Waterbury.--A family friend, some Internet research and the \n     handwritten notes of prisoners of war have unearthed a story \n     of tragic heroism that after seven decades has at last \n     brought closure for two Waterbury sisters whose brother died \n     in World War II.\n       ``He was a good kid, a really good boy,'' Marie Debiase \n     said through tears. ``After 70 years, we're finally finding \n     out what happened to him.''\n       All she knew all these years, she said, was that her \n     brother, Peter Sorbo, died when his plane was shot down over \n     the Rhine in 1943.\n       But recently, her sister Joann Devino met Carmen Mancuso, \n     one of their brother's old friends, at church. Mancuso said \n     his son Richard was pretty handy at Internet research and may \n     be able to learn a little more about the circumstances of \n     Sorbo's death.\n       The sisters gave them some of their brother's letters and \n     other documents, and Richard Mancuso, a sales manager from \n     Madison and self-described history buff, got to work.\n       ``I read a few of them it struck my interest,'' he said. \n     ``I started Googling it.''\n       Mancuso discovered a treasure trove of information, \n     including reports of Sorbo's death written by the men who \n     served with him that day.\n       The following story was pieced together from those reports, \n     and from family recollections.\n       Peter Sorbo was working in the United Cigar store late in \n     1942 when a woman came in and chided him with something like, \n     ``What are you doing working here when my son is overseas?''\n       The tall, quiet 17-year-old took it to heart. He quit \n     school, to the consternation of his parents, and enlisted in \n     January 1943.\n       ``I remember every bit of that day he went into the Army,'' \n     Debiase said. ``It was a terrible blizzard that day.''\n       For the next several months, he wrote his family letters \n     from the European Theater, mostly general, mundane greetings. \n     Those letters would later prove helpful to Mancuso in \n     learning how he died.\n       In August that same year, the waist gunner on a recently \n     formed B-17 Flying Fortress squadron went AWOL. Sorbo, by \n     then a staff sergeant, was assigned to take his place on a \n     bombing mission over a synthetic fuel plant in Germany.\n       It was an extremely dangerous operation. B-17s were large, \n     obvious and difficult for their gunners to defend. That was \n     especially so for waist gunners, who endured sub-zero \n     temperatures and thin oxygen while shooting Axis fighter \n     planes through a very small window into a powerful airstream \n     that made it hard to lock onto a target.\n       The plane was hit by a 20-mm shell that caught Sorbo in the \n     neck.\n       The plane started to go down under continuous enemy fire. \n     The crew prepared to bail out. One tried desperately to get a \n     parachute onto Sorbo, who was already dying from his neck \n     wound.\n       Then the plane exploded.\n       Six airmen parachuted out, including one who said the blast \n     blew him out of the craft, and another who said he saw the \n     plane go down as he drifted into the Rhine.\n       All six survivors were captured by the Nazis. Sorbo and \n     three others were killed, including the crewman who tried to \n     save him.\n       Devino said she often thinks of that heroic airman.\n       ``I thought of the family,'' she said. ``If he didn't stop \n     to try and get a parachute on Peter, he might have just been \n     a POW.''\n       The family didn't know any of this for decades.\n       After the plane was shot down, the military sent a letter \n     saying Sorbo was missing in action.\n       ``All those years, we were hoping maybe he was a prisoner, \n     maybe he would get back,'' Debiase said. ``My mother never \n     stopped hoping.''\n       It wasn't until the war was over that the government \n     acknowledged the plane and Sorbo's remains had been found, \n     and asked the family if it would like them to be returned for \n     burial.\n       Debiase said her family doubted from the beginning that the \n     remains were his, but figured it was a service member who \n     needed burial anyway, so they accepted them.\n       ``Who we got, I don't know, but we respect it as my \n     brother,'' Debiase said. ``We visit the cemetery and put the \n     flags on when they need to be put on.''\n       Sorbo's loss devastated his family. His father was so \n     distraught that he walked off a 20-year job as a tool setter \n     at Chase Brass & Copper.\n       ``He couldn't handle it,'' Devino said.\n       The parents doted on and spoiled their remaining son. He \n     ended up drafted into the Korean War, returned an alcoholic, \n     and died young.\n       Debiase and her husband, Michael, live in a lovely house \n     with a dining room table long enough to accommodate their \n     many family gatherings.\n       Her brother Peter, she said, wanted to go into radio. He \n     was funny and kind and protective--all the things an eldest \n     brother should be to his siblings.\n       ``We at least know what really happened,'' she said. ``We \n     never knew. I'm glad my parents never really knew.''\n       Her memories of Peter, she said, she has ``stored away in \n     my heart'' since she was 9, the age she was when he died. \n     She's 79 now and Devino is 83.\n       Debiase looked over at that dining room table, on this day \n     strewn with Sorbo's sepia-toned service photographs.\n       ``Every holiday you sit down and say, There should be \n     another chair,''' she said. ``But there isn't.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6192-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6192-S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        SANDWICH, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, today I wish to honor Sandwich, \nNH--a town in Carroll County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary \nof its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State \nin recognizing this historic event.\n  Sandwich is a picturesque community situated in the shadow of the \nSandwich Dome, that has through the hard work and dedication of its \ncitizens retained the look and feel of a traditional colonial New \nHampshire village.\n  Sandwich was granted a charter by Governor Benning Wentworth on \nOctober 25, 1763, and derives its name from John Montague, the 4th Earl \nof Sandwich. Today, the population has grown to include over 1,300 \nresidents.\n  Carpenters, wheelwrights, and blacksmiths formed the base of \nSandwich's vibrant artisan history. The beauty of the region, and its \nrich history, has attracted a variety of artists to Sandwich.\n  In 1920, Sandwich Home Industries was founded. Today it is known \nstatewide as the League of New Hampshire Craftsmen.\n  Sandwich is also home to one of New Hampshire's premier agricultural \nfairs. Held every year on Columbus Day weekend, the Sandwich Fair has \nbeen providing a venue for the celebration of\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\nNew Hampshire's agrarian history for the past 125 years.\n  Named for the owner of the nearby grist mill, the historic covered \nDurgin Bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, \nand has been a part of the community since 1869. Before being washed \naway in 1865, a previous span served as a connection to North Conway \nfor the Underground Railroad.\n  Sandwich is a place that has contributed much to the life and spirit \nof the State of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards \nto the people of Sandwich as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6193-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ROSHOLT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I wish to pay \ntribute to the 100th anniversary of the founding of Rosholt, SD. \nRosholt is a thriving agricultural community in northeastern South \nDakota.\n  Rosholt was named for Julius Rosholt, an entrepreneur whose efforts \nbrought the railroad to the townsite. Lots were first sold in the newly \nplatted town on August 11, 1913, and shortly thereafter residents began \nto start businesses that would serve the growing community. The \nvisionary spirit of these early pioneers is evident 100 years later, as \nthe town gathers for their centennial celebration.\n  Today, folks in Rosholt are as hard-working and determined as ever, \nexhibiting the small-town South Dakota values that make our State a \ngreat place to live. Numerous prosperous businesses line Main Street \nand the town is home to the region's largest grain elevator. Rosholt's \neducators and students set a high standard of academic excellence that \nserves as a model for the rest of our State. The Rosholt School has \nrecently been recognized by the South Dakota Department of Education as \na ``Distinguished School.''\n  Rosholt's history teaches us that when a community comes together it \ncan do great things. The citizens of Rosholt have an undeniable pride \nin their community that will serve them well for many generations to \ncome. I am proud to congratulate them on reaching this historic \nanniversary and wish them the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6193-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL TIM SCHEPPER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, today I wish to \nrecognize LTC Tim Schepper, who on July 15, 2013, became the first \npilot to log 5,000 hours in the B-1 aircraft.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Schepper is a senior evaluator for the 28th \nOperations Group and a B-1 pilot at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South \nDakota. His impressive flying record on the B-1 highlights an Air Force \ncareer that spans 27 years, including two stints totaling over 14 years \nat Ellsworth. His record of 5,000 hours is well ahead of any other B-1 \npilot in the Air Force. It is nearly 1,800 hours more than any pilot at \nEllsworth and nearly 800 hours more than anyone Air Force-wide. Over \none-quarter of his flying time, 1,300 hours, are combat hours.\n  He grew up on a ranch near Vargas, MN and joined the Air Force in \n1986. In addition to his various duty assignments at Ellsworth, \nLieutenant Colonel Schepper has also been stationed at bases in \nCalifornia, Texas, Mississippi and North Dakota and served 3 years as \nB-1 Functional Area Manager, B-1 Realistic Training Manager, Deputy \nChief Flight Operations and Training Branch at Air Combat Command \nHeadquarters in Langley, VA. From June 2010 to June 2011, he served as \nDeputy Commander, 379th Expeditionary Operations Group, in Southwest \nAsia.\n  His major awards and accomplishments include the Bronze Star Medal; \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal; Afghanistan Campaign Medal; \nAir Force Commendation Medal with three oak leaf clusters; Air Force \nCombat Action Medal; Meritorious Unit Award with one oak leaf cluster; \nCombat Readiness Medal with five oak leaf clusters; National Defense \nService Medal with bronze star; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; \nMeritorious Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters; Aerial \nAchievement Medal; and Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters.\n  Lt. Col. Schepper's feat underscores the great work of all B-1 \npersonnel in the Air Force as well as civilian personnel from Boeing, \nwho have been working on the B-1 program since it was introduced to the \nAir Force 30 years ago. According to Boeing's Dan Ruder, who was on \nhand for Lieutenant Colonel Schepper's record-setting flight arrival \nback at Ellsworth, the B-1 ``has nearly 10,000 combat missions logged \nand has been deployed for 8 consecutive years. This day solidifies how \nthe B-1 is still a critical element to our national security.''\n  Like many Air Force personnel, Lieutenant Colonel Schepper and his \nwife are quick to credit family as well as the military and civilian \ncommunities for their support over the years. ``My family has always \nsupported me significantly,'' said the Ellsworth pilot. ``I've had five \ndeployments over the past 10 years, and obviously as everyone knows, \nwhen you're away from home there are a lot of things that still need to \nbe done. My wife and my kids had to endure and do a lot of things to \nmake up for when I wasn't around.''\n  Added his wife, Tania, ``We have been part of this community for so \nlong. He didn't just accomplish this on his own. It takes maintenance, \nand it takes the help and support of other pilots, and community \nmembers.''\n  Lieutenant Colonel Schepper will be retiring in August, and I \ncongratulate him on his impressive flying record, as well as his \ndistinguished military service career, both of which serve as great \nstandards of achievement for military personnel and the civilian \ncommunity. I wish him all the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6193-3", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING KIP YOSHIO TOKUDA\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to a \ndedicated community leader, compassionate public servant, and advocate \nfrom the State of Washington, Kip Tokuda.\n  I am proud to recognize Kip as the kind of civic champion who did so \nmuch for all of the communities he touched, especially for children and \nfamilies in need.\n  Mr. Tokuda was born in Seattle in 1946 and eventually served his home \ndistrict in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1994 to \n2002. Through his work on behalf of his constituents and Washington \nState, he earned a reputation as a deeply principled legislator and \nrespect from both sides of the aisle.\n  In addition to his service as an elected official, Kip also cofounded \nthe Asian Pacific Islander Community Leadership Foundation, an \norganization that empowers young people from Asian Pacific Islander \ncommunities to seek leadership positions in government and nonprofit \norganizations. He helped start the Japanese Cultural & Community Center \nof Washington and last year was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun \nfrom the Emperor of Japan for his work to build and maintain strong \nties between the United States and Japan. Most recently, he was \nappointed to the city of Seattle's Community Police Commission, where \nhe worked to create a more diverse police force.\n  But most importantly, he was a dedicated father, husband, friend, and \nmentor to many.\n  People respected Kip because he respected them, and even though he \naccomplished so much in his life and earned a position of influence, \nyou could always count on Kip to listen.\n  As a longtime Seattle resident, his kindness and passion inspired all \nwho knew him.\n  Kip passed away on July 13, 2013 from a heart attack at the age of \n66.\n  Kip is survived by his wife Barb and their two children, Molly and \nPei-Ming.\n  He will be missed by many, but his legacy of service will live on \nthrough the organizations he founded and the lives he touched.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to Kip Tokuda. He lived a full life and our thoughts are with \nhis loved ones at this time of great and sudden loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6193-4", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6193-S6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           50TH ANNUAL ARKANSAS STATE CHAMPIONSHIP HORSE SHOW\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, it is with pleasure that I rise today to \nhonor\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nthe 50th Annual Arkansas State Championship Horse Show. In 1963, three \nhorse show associations in Arkansas joined efforts to hold a State \nequestrian championship. This championship show originated when the \nHillbilly Horse Show Association, the Central Arkansas Horse Show \nAssociation, and the Northeast Central Arkansas Horse Show Association \njoined together to host a championship competition. Over the years, \nthis partnership has expanded to include 12 horse show associations \nfrom across the great State of Arkansas. For the past 50 years, the top \n5 contenders from each association compete to earn the honor of being \nnamed the Champion Rider of Arkansas.\n  Arkansans have long enjoyed riding horses for sport and pleasure. \nHorse shows across the State attract fans seeking to witness the \nathleticism and agility of the sportsmen and the horses. While these \nriders make it look easy, horse riding requires a great deal of \nbalance, coordination, and physical strength. Each rider must also \nexemplify self-discipline, responsibility, and patience with their \nhorse. Horse riding is important to the people of my State, and I \nsupport keeping this heritage strong.\n  At the 50th Annual Arkansas State Championship Horse Show later this \nsummer, competitors will again showcase their talent by riding \ndifferent breeds in a variety of equestrian disciplines. They will \ncompete with great sportsmanship and at the end of the show one rider \nwill be named as the best in Arkansas. The competitive events will \ninclude the talents of Arkansans of all ages and hailing from each \ncorner of the State.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the Arkansas \nState Championship Horse Show on its 50th anniversary and in wishing \nits competitors and fans a wonderful day of celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6194-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          QUALE'S ELECTRONICS\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, family-owned small businesses are \na crucial part of America's landscape. They supply a demand in \nlocations all across the United States, and are built on the sweat and \ndedication of their owners and employees. It is for this reason that \ntoday I wish to rise to honor Quale's Electronics, its founder Mel \nQuale, and all those who now manage and work for this longstanding \nfamily business.\n  In 1966, Mr. Quale opened Quale's Electronics, located in Twin Falls, \nID. Quale's Electronics began humbly as a television repair shop, but \nafter only a year in business Mr. Quale expanded his business to \ninclude retail television and home electronics sales. Small businesses \noften have trouble obtaining deals to outlet products from top brands, \nbut Mr. Quale's persistence in the late 1960s through early 1970s paid \noff with several high-level brands in the electronics industry signing \nthem on as a local dealer. Sales quickly took off. Quale's Electronics \nexpanded to a new and larger location in 1976. Always striving to stay \nahead of the curve, Mr. Quale sought out and procured deals to sell \nmany of the exciting new electronics that debuted in the 1970s, 1980s, \nand 1990s. Quale Electronics to this day remains a family business. \nToday, Helen Quale, and Mr. Quale's sons, Bruce and Steve, spearhead \nthe ownership and management responsibilities.\n  In addition to running a successful small business, Mr. Quale also \ntakes a keen interest in his community, offering his time and funding \nto important local causes and projects. Mr. Quale has previously served \nas a member of the Bureau of Land Management Resource Advisory Council \nfor 9 years, public lands advisor for the Magic Valley Trail Machine, \nand 20 years as a precinct committeeman for the Twin Falls Republican \nParty. Additionally, Mr. Quale is an active member of the Twin Falls \nRotary Club.\n  The success Mr. Quale has found in his business and the work he has \ndone for his community is a testament to the important economic and \ncivic good that is created by self-employed entrepreneurs all across \nthe U.S. and a prime example of the spirit of Idaho's entrepreneurs. It \nis inspirational to see a family-owned business with decades-old roots \nspanning more than one generation continue to grow and succeed. Such \nbusinesses are vital not only to the local and national economy, but \nalso to their home communities, and will always have a prominent place \nin the fabric of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6194-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HAMPTON FIRST RESPONDERS\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to recognize first \nresponders from New Hampshire who heroically worked together to save \ntwo swimmers who were struggling to make their way back to shore at \nHampton Beach in Hampton, NH, on July 25, 2013.\n  On the night of July 25, Hampton Fire & Rescue and the Hampton Police \nDepartment received notification that three individuals swimming in the \nwater at Hampton Beach were unable to make their way back to shore. \nFirst responders from the departments immediately sprang into action \nand quickly arrived at Hampton Beach. While one of the three \nindividuals was rescued by fellow beachgoers, two young men remained in \nthe water not far from shore, struggling in riptide conditions and \nunable to swim back to land.\n  Hampton firefighters including Fire Chief Christopher Silver, Deputy \nFire Chief Jameson Ayotte, Captain William Kennedy, Lieutenant Michael \nBrillard, Greg Smushkin, Jed Carpentier, Nate Denio, Jason Newman, Kyle \nJameson, Kyle Averill, Buck Frost, Matthew Clement, Donald Thibeault \nand Hampton Police Officer James Deluca worked together to save the two \n28-year old men who were caught in the water. The first responders \nworked in varying capacities, with some in the water, some aboard the \nHampton Fire Department's rescue boat and others on shore, and acted as \na unified team to successfully pull the swimmers to safety.\n  First responders are fundamental to the safety of individuals and \ncommunities in New Hampshire and throughout the country, as evidenced \nby the lives that were so recently rescued at Hampton Beach. These \npublic servants came together from across different departments and \ndivisions, as they often do, to perform their selfless work on behalf \nof people in need. The work of heroes like those in Hampton often goes \nunnoticed, but it is important that we do not take for granted the \ndaily efforts made by all first responders to make our communities \nsafer and improve the quality of life of all Americans.\n  I commend these gentlemen for their selfless actions on the night of \nJuly 25. The Hampton-area community and all New Hampshire residents \napplaud the work that dedicated first responders do every day.

Madam President, I wish to to commemorate the \n250th anniversary of the town of Alstead, NH.\n  Alstead was first chartered by Massachusetts Governor Jonathan \nBelcher as one of nine forts established in 1735 to protect \nsouthwestern New Hampshire from attack. Once New Hampshire was decreed \nits own province, New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth granted the \nland, then called Newton, in 1752. The area was finally incorporated in \n1763 and renamed Alstead in honor of Johann Heinrich Alsted, a German \nprofessor and encyclopedist, whose works were popular at Harvard \nCollege. Alstead was a predominantly agricultural community, but its \nwaterways also provided sufficient power to run a number of small \nmills, including New Hampshire's first paper mill, built in 1793.\n  Alstead boasts a quintessentially New Hampshire history with the \nexception of a small misstep in 1781 when the town voted to join the \nState of Vermont. Alstead was not alone in this wavering allegiance \nafter the Revolutionary War, but I am very pleased to report that \nresidents came to their senses the following year and rejoined the \nGranite State.\n  Two hundred and fifty years later, Alstead's views of Feuer State \nPark and Warren Pond serve as a beautiful backdrop to the community's \nrich history and small town charm. From August to October, Alstead will \ncelebrate their sestercentennial with historical plays and tours, \nparades, lectures and exhibits.\n  I congratulate Alstead on this milestone in their history and thank \nthis\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\ncommunity for its great contributions to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6195-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CANDIA, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the 250th \nanniversary of the town of Candia, NH.\n  Candia was first settled in 1743 and was colloquially known as \n``Charmingfare,'' perhaps due to its many bridle paths and lovely \nscenery. Gov. Benning Wentworth incorporated the town in 1763 and \nrenamed it Candia, likely in honor of the principal city of the Greek \nisland of Crete, which he had visited after his graduation from Harvard \nCollege.\n  With some of the earliest farmed land in New Hampshire, Candia grew \ninto a strong industrial center with the help of the railroad and well-\nestablished mills which dominated its economy. Today, Candia has become \na popular tourist destination for its quaint New England feel, family-\nfriendly attractions, beautiful scenery and ease of travel.\n  I was pleased to welcome award-winning Candia Vineyards to Washington \nthis past June for our annual Experience New Hampshire reception, where \nGranite Staters and Washingtonians alike could sample their wonderful \nwares.\n  Candia will honor this 250th milestone through a yearlong series of \ncelebrations commemorating their long and rich history.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize an \nimportant milestone for the town of Gilsum, NH, upon the occasion of \nits semiquincentennial anniversary. Situated in scenic southwest New \nHampshire, Gilsum actually received its first charter in 1752 under the \nname Boyle but was never settled. Governor Benning Wentworth re-\nchartered this land in 1763 to five proprietors, including Samuel \nGilbert and his son-in-law Thomas Sumner. The name ``Gilsum'' was a \ncompromise reached to resolve Gilbert and Sumner's ongoing dispute over \nthe name of their new settlement.\n  Historically, Gilsum was a farming and manufacturing community, \nmaking use of the nearby Ashuelot River to power multiple factories by \nthe 1850s. Gilsum also boasted a productive mine, which provided \nimportant economic stability for the town during its early years of \ndevelopment. Today, Gilsum is home to the W.S. Badger Company, a \nquintessential New Hampshire small business success story that now \nsells its wonderful skincare products, including its ``Badger Balm,'' \nacross the country.\n  Gilsum will mark its 250th anniversary in August with a parade, \ntalent show, community exhibits and music to commemorate its proud \nheritage. I rise today to wish Gilsum a joyful celebration of this \nimportant milestone and thank all its citizens for their contributions \nto New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6195-4", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HAMPTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate \nthe town of Hampton, NH, on the occasion of its 375th anniversary.\n  Coastal Hampton is one of the 4 original New Hampshire townships \nchartered by the General Court of Massachusetts. It was first settled \nin 1638 under the name Winnacunnet, an Algonquian word meaning \n``pleasant pines. `` One year later, Winnacunnet's Puritan settlers \nrenamed the town ``Hampton'' to honor the birthplace of their leader \nReverend Stephen Bachiler, a colorful figure whose descendants still \npopulate Hampton today.\n  Hampton was a modest but bustling community whose early industry \ncentered around farming and fishing. All that changed with the arrival \nof the railroad in 1840. Visitors from Boston and other cities soon \ndiscovered the charms of Hampton's stunning coastline, aided by the \nExeter, Hampton and Amesbury Trolley line, which connected inland mill \ntowns to the seacoast. Today, thousands of visitors flock to Hampton's \nbeaches to surf, sunbathe, or take to the high seas on chartered \nfishing or whale watching expeditions.\n  The Hampton Historical Society will host a series of events \nthroughout 2013 to commemorate this important milestone through a \nseries of lectures and town-wide activities. I congratulate this \nbeautiful town on 375 years of success and thank them for their \ncontributions to our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6195-5", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HAVERHILL, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to celebrate and \nrecognize the 250th anniversary of the town of Haverhill, NH.\n  Haverhill, first known as Lower Coos, was settled by citizens from \nHaverhill, MA and incorporated by Governor Benning Wentworth in 1763. \nHaverhill is situated on our State border, next to the mouth of the \nAmmonoosuc River, and shares much of its heritage with its sister city \nof Newbury in Vermont across the Connecticut River. Haverhill's \nlocation at the end of the Old Province Road was critical to its rapid \ndevelopment; this road, one of the earliest highways in New Hampshire, \nserved as a supply route connecting the northern and western \nsettlements with the seacoast. Haverhill's village of Woodsville hosted \na railway supply enterprise that played an important role in the early \nyears of the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad. Haverhill may have \nlooked remote on a map, but it was clearly a town on the move.\n  Today, visitors to Haverhill may visit the oldest covered bridge \nstill in use in New Hampshire, the Haverhill-Bath Bridge, built in 1829 \nand listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Haverhill \nHistoric Society has painstakingly curated many artifacts from the \ntown's long and industrious history and hosts fascinating lectures \nthroughout the year. Haverhill is also home to the Museum of American \nWeather, which offers an unusual and insightful view into New England \nhistory through its exhibits documenting weather events across our \nregion.\n  The town of Haverhill will celebrate its semiquincentennial jointly \nwith Newbury, VT through a series of events this year, culminating in \nan old-fashioned skating party in December. I congratulate Haverhill on \n250 years of accomplishments, and thank its citizens for their many \ncontributions to the Granite State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6195-6", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6195-S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LISBON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I congratulate the residents of \nthe town of Lisbon, NH as they celebrate its 250th anniversary.\n  Lisbon's roots date back to 1749, when Samuel Martin went on a \nhunting trip with his son in the wilderness along the Ammonoosuc River \nin the White Mountains. This beautiful region made a lasting impression \non Martin, who returned to build a small cabin on Henry Pond with his \nfamily. This area would soon be settled and named the Gunthwaite \nsettlement, which grew in size as soldiers returned from the \nRevolutionary War. In 1824, Gov. Levi Woodbury renamed the town Lisbon \nin honor of his friend Colonel William Jarvis, who had been appointed \nby President Thomas Jefferson to be the United States consul in Lisbon, \nPortugal.\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\n  The Ammonoosuc River provided a natural source of power for mills and \nfactories that bolstered Lisbon's industry and helped it grow into a \nbustling town. At one time, Lisbon's Parker Young Company was the \nlargest manufacturer of piano sounding boards in the world. Lisbon was \nalso the first site in New Hampshire to have a ski rope tow.\n  Many of Lisbon's residents are descended from the town's original \nsettlers and feel a strong commitment to preserving their town's \nhistory. Lisbon proudly honors New Hampshire's State flower during its \nannual Lilac Festival, held every Memorial Day weekend. Lisbon is also \nknown for its public library, which houses nearly 10,000 volumes and \nserves neighboring towns Lyman and Landaff. On August 10, 2013, Lisbon \nresidents and friends will come together to commemorate their 250th \nanniversary with music and community events to celebrate their past, \npresent and future.\n  I wish the town of Lisbon a wonderful celebration and congratulate \nits citizens on this milestone in New Hampshire history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6196-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NEW BOSTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish today to honor the town \nof New Boston, NH, which celebrates its 250th anniversary this year. As \nits name suggests, New Boston's long and admirable history bridges that \nof New Hampshire and our neighbor Massachusetts.\n  New Boston's first settlers came north in search of new opportunity. \nThe land was originally granted in 1736 by the regional governor of \nMassachusetts and New Hampshire, Jonathan Belcher. Records show that \nlocals had originally planned to christen the town ``Lanestown,'' but \nover time referred to the property as New Boston in honor of their \nformer home. From 1736 until 1763, New Boston was legally part of \nMassachusetts; but during the course of those 30 years, the original \ngrantees failed to establish a proper claim. In 1763, New Boston was \nformally incorporated and recognized as part of New Hampshire by \nGovernor Benning Wentworth.\n  From its first census, we know that New Boston's residents quickly \nestablished a bustling community, building a lumber mill and clearing \n200 acres of land. By the early 19th century, New Boston boasted 16 \nschool houses, a bark mill, clothing mills, over 25 saw mills and even \na tavern to host both travelers and townsfolk after a long day. \nUnfortunately, many documents depicting New Boston's origins were \ndestroyed by the Great Village Fire of 1887, which ravaged the town and \nset over 40 of its buildings ablaze. New Boston's residents were \nundeterred by this tragedy, taking stock and quickly rebuilding their \nindustrial center.\n  By 1893, New Boston had a railroad station, allowing merchants to \nmove goods and services through their town into Massachusetts and \nfurther northeast. In the 1940s, New Boston became the proud home of \ntwo military institutions: the Gravity Research Foundation, which \nconducted research in hopes of creating a gravitational shielding \nsystem, and the New Boston Air Force Station, which tracks military \nsatellites.\n  New Boston continues to inspire our State with its industrious and \ncreative spirit. There is much to celebrate in New Boston's 250 years, \nand I am sure that the next 250 years will be equally or even more \nsuccessful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6196-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PLYMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to congratulate the town \nof Plymouth, NH on their 250th anniversary.\n  Plymouth sits at the geographic center of New Hampshire on the west \nbank of the Pemigewasset River. Gov. Benning Wentworth granted this \nplot of land to returning soldiers from the French and Indian War and \nnamed it New Plymouth, after the original Plymouth Colony in \nMassachusetts. Plymouth's unparalleled views of mountains, fields and \nforests provide a stunning backdrop to a bustling town noted for its \nfocus on industry and education, as well as its historical \nsignificance.\n  Plymouth's educational commitment began with its earliest settlers, \nwhose children were predominantly literate. This devotion to education \ncontinues today through Plymouth State University, one of the area's \noldest and finest institutions that counts Poet Laureate Robert Frost \nas a former faculty member. Every September, the Plymouth population \ndoubles from 4,000 to 8,000 as students return to campus to take \nadvantage of the rich opportunities offered at this university.\n  Plymouth was originally an industrial center known for its buck glove \nindustry, its farming and its logging industry. It was also home to \nDraper and Maynard, a renowned sporting goods purveyor that supplied \nbaseball gloves to Babe Ruth and his Boston Red Sox teammates.\n  Plymouth's strong tourism and skiing tradition dates back to the \n1930s, when the once ubiquitous snow trains brought hundreds of skiers \nfrom Boston and other cities to the slopes of the White Mountains. \nPlymouth has taken great strides to preserve this history and heritage \nthrough the recently opened Museum of the White Mountains, which houses \ntreasured art and artifacts from more than a century ago. The town \ncontinues to attract tourists hoping to see a quintessential New \nEngland town in action and remains a popular year-round destination for \ncamping, hiking and winter sports.\n  I congratulate Plymouth on its 250th anniversary and wish all its \ncitizens a joyous year of celebration of their proud history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6196-3", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SANDWISH, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to honor the town of \nSandwich, NH, on the occasion of its 250th anniversary.\n  Sandwich is a quintessential New England village between the \nfoothills of the White Mountains and breathtaking Squam Lake. Sandwich \nwas chartered in 1763 by Governor Benning Wentworth and named for John \nMontagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich. Lord Sandwich held various \ndistinguished positions in British politics and its military, but is \nperhaps best known for his purported invention of a slice of meat \nbetween two slices of bread to sustain him while playing cards.\n  Sandwich's land would later double in size due to many concerns that \nthe original grant was too inaccessible for a permanent settlement. In \nfact, from this expansion, Sandwich remains one of the largest towns in \nNew Hampshire today. The first settlers arrived 4 years later, and by \nthe early 19th Century the town of Sandwich had grown from uncharted \nwilderness into a bustling community of farms, schools, churches, \ntraders, and artisans.\n  Sandwich's local fair is a wonderful New Hampshire tradition that \ncelebrated its 100th anniversary last year. The Sandwich Fair has \norigins as far back as 1886, when local farmers gathered together to \nshow off their livestock in hopes of drawing a crowd to trade and sell \ntheir goods. The event quickly grew to include community events such as \nband performances, beautiful baby contests, and, in the 21st Century, \ncarnival rides. Sandwich's vibrant community, natural beauty, outdoor \nactivities and historic and cultural events continue to draw visitors \nyear-round.\n  I congratulate Sandwich on this important milestone and wish all \ncitizens of Sandwich the best for their next 250 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6196-4", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6196-S6197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THORNTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to recognize of the \n250th anniversary of Thornton, NH. Nestled in the beautiful \nPemigewasset River Valley in the White Mountains, the land that became \nThornton was originally granted to a small group of settlers on July 6, \n1763 and subsequently incorporated in 1781. Thornton is named for one \nof those original settlers, Matthew Thornton, who would later become \nthe first speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives and New \nHampshire's delegate to the Continental Congress. Thornton, who signed \nDeclaration of Independence, was an early and vocal advocate for \ncompete independence from England.\n  Thornton was also the birthplace of Moses Cheney, an abolitionist and \nconductor on the Underground Railroad. Cheney founded and oversaw the \nprinting of the Morning Star, an abolitionist Freewill Baptist \nnewspaper distributed in New England from 1833 to\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\n1874. Cheney's two sons added to their father's legacy through their \nown notable contributions to New England. Elder son Oren Cheney was the \nfounder and first president of Bates College in Maine, and his younger \nbrother Person Cheney served as a U.S. Senator and Governor of New \nHampshire.\n  Thornton's original colonial meetinghouse, built in 1789, still \nstands in the center of town. Meetinghouses like this are considered \nthe birthplace of small town democracy. This building hosted town \nmeetings from 1790 to 1954. Today, it is being painstakingly restored \nby the Thornton Historical Society for future use as a museum to house \nthe town's artifacts and documents from its long and proud history.\n  I honor this town's strong heritage and wish its citizens a wonderful \nsestercentennial celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6197-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WARREN, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today I wish to celebrate the \n250th anniversary of Warren, NH. Situated in the White Mountain region \njust south of Franconia Notch, residents of Warren are surrounded by \nstunning wooded scenery that is quintessential North Country. Warren is \na truly perfect example of small town New Hampshire.\n  In 1763, Gov. Benning Wentworth granted a tract of land to John Page, \nwho settled on this land 4 years later. The area would be officially \nincorporated in 1770 by Benning Wentworth's nephew and successor, Gov. \nJohn Wentworth. Warren is one of two towns in New England that were \nnamed for Admiral Sir Peter Warren of County Meath, Ireland. Admiral \nWarren, a high ranking officer in the British Royal Navy, commanded a \nfleet that joined forces from Massachusetts to lay siege and capture \nthe fort at Louisbourg, Nova Scotia in 1745. This victory united the \ncolonies against Canada, as well as providing them with crucial fishing \nand fur trading rights.\n  For the better half of the 20th century, the Glencliff State \nSanatorium operated in the village of Glencliff in Warren. Before the \nadvent of antibiotics, it was thought that the thin, pure mountain air \nof the North Country could cure tuberculosis, and nearly 4,000 patients \nsought respite and cure in the White Mountains facility until its \nclosing and conversion to Glencliff Home for the Elderly in 1970. While \nmodern medicine has advanced by leaps and bounds, we certainly \nunderstand why a patient would seek the serene beauty of the North \nCountry as a cure for any ill.\n  Warren's most famous landmark is a Redstone Ballistics Missile, which \nstands in the center of the village green today. These missiles were \ncommissioned by the U.S. Army in West Germany during the Cold War as \ndefense against the former Soviet Union and were the first to carry \nlive nuclear warheads. This decommissioned missile was placed in the \ncenter of town to honor Senator Norris Cotton, a Warren native who \nserved a long career in both the New Hampshire General Court and the \nUnited States Congress.\n  I honor Warren's sestercentennial and congratulate its residents on \nthis important milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6197-2", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WOODSTOCK, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today I wish to congratulate \nthe town of Woodstock, NH, on their sestercentennial anniversary.\n  Woodstock actually began as Peeling, NH, as decreed by Governor \nBenning Wentworth's 1763 charter. After a number of controversial name \nchanges, the town eventually became known as Woodstock in 1840, \npossibly thanks to inspiration from the name of a novel by Sir Walter \nScott. Appropriately, logging was thickly-forested Woodstock's primary \nindustry, aided by the Pemigewasset River's power to run their saw \nmills and transport timber down to Lowell, MA. The arrival of the \nGordon Pond Railroad helped the industry but also leveled thousands of \nacres of Woodstock forest.\n  These areas have long since recovered and 80 percent of Woodstock's \nland area is now protected under the White Mountain National Forest, \nwhich draws droves of tourists each year. In fact, Woodstock's and \nneighboring Thornton's forests make up Hubbard Brook Experimental \nForest, one of the world's longest running ecosystem studies. For 50 \nyears, Hubbard Brook has provided scientists and researchers with \ncritical data and resources that identify and address environmental \nissues.\n  Woodstock is also home to local favorite Woodstock Inn Station and \nBrewery, a five time regional restaurant winner of New Hampshire \nMagazine's ``Best of New Hampshire'' feature. I was pleased to welcome \nthis business to Washington in June for our annual Experience New \nHampshire reception, where they shared their delicious craft beers and \nother products with Senators and their fellow Granite Staters.\n  I congratulate Woodstock on this important milestone and wish the \ncommunity continuing success for their next 250 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6197-3", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6197-S6198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DELAWARE'S DREAM TEAM\n\n Mr. COONS. Madam President, Delaware is known as the First \nState, and I rise today to commemorate a first in my State. Forty years \nago, the Howard High men's basketball team became the first boys' \nbasketball team in the State-tournament era to complete an undefeated \nseason. The 1973 Wildcats were honored for that achievement in \nWilmington earlier this year, but today I would like to honor them on \nthe Floor of the Senate.\n  You see, the story of the '73 Wildcats tells you something about my \nhome State. They were never the tallest team out there--the tallest \nplayer was Lonnie Sparrow at 6 feet 3 inches--and they were never \nconsidered the team to beat. They were not even considered the best \nteam at Howard High. The highly touted '72 squad had included John \nIrving who is still one of only two players in Hofstra University \nhistory to accumulate 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds, and led them to \ntheir first two NCAA tournament appearances. They could only draw from \na small student body of about 700 to 800 students, in contrast to some \nof the other local high schools.\n  But what Sparrow, Mike Miller, Eric Fuller, Kenny Hynson, Wayne \nParson, Dave Roane, Istavan Norwood, Lemuel Glover, Rich Miles, Joe \nRobinson, Isaiah Reason, and Ernest Coleman had was better than height \nor the praise of outsiders. They had coaches that believed in them in \nJay Thomas and Stan Hill, and they had a tight-knit group of supporters \nin the school and the community. Most of all, they had each other, and \nby playing ball together, they accomplished what no other team had done \nin Delaware history. Their amazing story includes last-minute buzzer \nshots to make it to the championships, and even a climactic showdown \nwith long-time rivals Wilmington High, who had ended the school's \ndreams of a championship the previous year. It is a story made for \nHollywood. In a fitting epilogue, they each continue their tradition of \nquality through teamwork as teachers, coaches, counselors, ministers, \nbusinessmen, members of the Armed Services, and civil servants.\n  But there is one more thing that must be noted. Named after the same \nCivil War general that Howard University honors and built around the \nsame time, Howard was the first--and for many years only--African-\nAmerican high school in Delaware. During the 1950's the shameful \nneglect towards the institution led to a court case challenging \nseparate-but-equal laws that went on to become one of the five decided \nin the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision. By the time of the '73 \nWildcats, schools were desegregated but the poison of decades of racism \npersisted.\n  It was in this context that the all-black Howard team relied on each \nother, and did the impossible in Delaware. As such, they are an example \nto all of us--especially, I think, to those of us in the Senate faced \nwith tough challenges for the future. You see, when everyone is betting \nagainst us, when it seems like we somehow lack the stature to get the \njob done, or when the world around us is tumultuous and seems more than \nany one of us alone can handle, we need to join together, find ways to \ntrust each other, and get the job done.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts memorializing the federal \n     government of the United States to prioritize distribution of \n     veterans' benefits; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, including active duty members of the Massachusetts \n     National Guard, have honorably and with great distinction \n     served their country and have earned the right to be welcomed \n     home with all honors and benefits prescribed by law by a \n     grateful nation; and\n       Whereas, the words of our first president, George \n     Washington, are a reminder of the importance of honoring \n     promises made to our veterans and their families, when he \n     said, ``the willingness with which our young people are \n     likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be \n     directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of \n     earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation''; \n     and\n       Whereas, veterans' benefits must be delivered in a timely \n     fashion out of respect for the significant sacrifice and \n     valiant service of those to whom such benefits are owed, \n     especially given the fact that today's veterans urgently need \n     jobs, health care, housing, education and training in order \n     to successfully re-enter civilian life; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     is reported to be unable to keep up with a torrent of \n     benefits claims, and the backlog leaves many service members \n     waiting for well over a year after first filing their forms, \n     according to a report from the Center for Investigative \n     Reporting; and\n       Whereas, according to the center's report, the average wait \n     time for veterans benefits is 273 days, and that veterans \n     filing their first claim, including those who served in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, wait nearly two months longer, between 316 \n     and 327 days, and in some major population centers wait up to \n     twice as long--642 days in New York, 619 days in Los Angeles \n     and 542 days in Chicago; and\n       Whereas, the ranks of veterans waiting more than a year for \n     their benefits grew from 11,000 in 2009 to 245,000 in \n     December 2012, an increase of more than 2,000 per cent, and \n     the Veterans Administration is predicting that the situation \n     will get worse, as the number of veterans waiting on the \n     Department to process their claims is expected to reach 1 \n     million by the end of March, 2013: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S6204]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts Senate hereby requests \n     that the Federal Government of the United States provide \n     sufficient funding and personnel to process veterans' claims \n     in a more timely manner so that the tangible gratitude of the \n     nation can be promptly distributed to all who have earned \n     such recognition; and be it further\n       Resolved, That resolved, that a copy of these resolutions \n     be transmitted forthwith by the Clerk of the Senate to the \n     President of the United States, the leaders of the Congress \n     of the United States and to each United States senator and \n     representative from Massachusetts.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-120.

A bill to promote research, development, and demonstration \nof marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Murkowski and I are \nintroducing legislation to promote a new form of hydropower, marine \nhydrokinetic renewable energy, or MHK. An MHK project generates energy \nfrom waves, currents, and tides in the ocean, an estuary or a tidal \narea as well as from the free-flowing water in a river, lake, or \nstream.\n  Our bill will help commercialize MHK technologies through research \nand development and a more efficient and timely regulatory process for \nthe siting of pilot projects intended to demonstrate the viability of \nthese technologies. It is an ideal follow-up to a pair of bills, H.R. \n267 and H.R. 678, to streamline the regulatory process for low-impact \nconventional hydropower that were reported by the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources by unanimous bipartisan votes a few months ago. \nConsidered together, the two conventional hydropower bills approved by \nthe Committee along with this MHK legislation are a major step forward \nin advancing carbon-free hydropower technologies.\n  MHK has tremendous potential to generate a substantial amount of \nclean renewable energy in the United States and across the globe. It is \npoised to be a key participant in the transition to a low carbon \neconomy.\n  What distinguishes MHK from conventional hydropower is that it \ngenerates energy without the use of a dam or other impoundment. This \ngets MHK off on the right foot in terms of minimizing any adverse \nenvironmental impact. Investments to capture our nation's rich domestic \nmarine energy resources can also play a major role in the creation of \nessential domestic engineering and manufacturing jobs.\n  The energy contained in predictable waves, tidal flows and currents \nis the basis for worldwide investments in this emerging industry. Water \nis approximately 800 times denser than air, providing great potential \npower density along with predictability. These characteristics mean \nthat MHK technologies could provide predictable\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\nbase-load renewable power in the future.\n  At the present time there are many different types of MHK \ntechnologies with multiple applications under development that are \nintended to capture the power contained in waves, tides and currents.\n  Wave energy devices capture the heave and/or surge power of waves and \nconvert them via hydraulic or geared direct drive systems into \nelectricity. Some of these devices are moored to the ocean floor, some \nare floating on the surface, while others are attached to breakwaters \nnear shore. By last count, there are over 100 wave energy devices under \ndevelopment worldwide. Tidal energy technologies capture the ebb and \nflow of tides. It is estimated that 60 different tidal energy \ntechnologies are under development worldwide. There are other \ntechnologies that include run-of-river systems and offshore ocean \ncurrent technologies. Most of these technologies under development \ncapture uni-directional water flows and look similar to the tidal \ndevices.\n  The United States has not been a world leader in the development of \nthese cutting edge technologies to date. Instead, our country is seen \nas a huge potential market for our international competitors in this \nnew industrial sector. The United States has significant wave, tidal, \ncurrent and in-stream energy resources. The Electric Power Research \nInstitute has estimated that the commercially available wave energy \npotential off the coast of the United States is roughly 252 million \nmegawatt hours--equal to 6.5 percent of today's entire generating \nportfolio. This is approximately the amount of electricity presently \nbeing produced by the existing fleet of American conventional \nhydroelectric dams.\n  The Department of Energy, DOE, has released two nationwide resource \nassessments that indicate the waves, tides, and ocean currents off the \nnation's coasts could contribute significantly to the United States' \ntotal annual electricity production. DOE is currently developing an \naggressive strategy to support its vision of producing at least fifteen \npercent of our nation's electricity from water power, including \nconventional hydropower, by 2030.\n  Our goal should be the establishment of a commercially viable U.S. \nMHK renewable energy industry, supported by a robust domestic supply \nchain for fabrication, installation, operations and maintenance of MHK \ndevices. The development of a substantial marine hydrokinetic industry \nin the U.S. could drive billions of dollars of investment in heavy \nindustrial and maritime sectors, as well as in advanced electrical \nsystems and materials common to many renewable technologies. Federal \ninvestments would stimulate private funds and jobs in the construction, \nmanufacturing, engineering, and environmental science sectors.\n  I am very pleased that my home State of Oregon has made a strategic \ndecision to be an international leader in the commercialization of the \nmarine renewable energy industry. Led by the Oregon Wave Energy Trust, \nthe Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center co-located at \nOregon State University, and several private companies that are part of \nthe MHK supply chain, Oregon is positioning itself to be a leading \nforce supporting this newly emerging industry.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. is falling behind in the race to capture the \nrich energy potential of our oceans and the jobs that will come with \nthis new industry. The United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, Scotland, \nAustralia, and other countries are committed to producing emission-\nfree, renewable energy from MHK sources. Scotland has had a grid-\nconnected, wave energy convertor unit in operation since 2001 and \nmaintains a national goal of producing 2 GW of generation capacity from \nMHK renewable energy. The U.K. and Ireland have also set aggressive \ngoals for MHK generation by 2020.\n  The Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition, the industry's trade group here \nin Washington DC, calculates that more than $782 million has been spent \nby the UK government on wave energy R over the past 10 years. That \ntotal approaches $1 billion over the same period if you add in the \ncommitments to ocean energy R from France, Portugal, Spain, Norway, \nand Denmark.\n  Early funding support, along with development of full-scale device \ntesting centers, demonstrates that the significant technological \nadvances and the competitive advantages in this industry are trending \nin Europe's direction. As an example of the disparity in investments, \nEurope currently has several wave and tidal energy test facilities, led \nby the European Marine Energy Center in Scotland, that are helping \ntechnology developers commercialize their wave and tidal energy \nconvertors. The United States clearly has a need for such \ninfrastructure. I know that Oregon State University has a strong desire \nto compete for funding to help establish a testing center in the \nPacific Northwest. Unfortunately, recent funding levels have not \nsupported development of such offshore testing infrastructure in the \nU.S. to date.\n  Given this internationally competitive situation, I believe that \nCongress must make targeted Federal investments to close the gap. \nCommercialization of technologies to harness marine renewable energy \nresources will require Federal funding to augment research and \ndevelopment efforts already underway in the private sector. Just as the \nwind and solar industries have received DOE funding support for over 3 \ndecades, which has resulted in the rapid deployment of these \ntechnologies in recent years, the nascent marine energy industry seeks \nsimilar Federal assistance to develop promising technologies that are \non the verge of commercial viability.\n  Unfortunately, in addition to the limited private sector funding \navailable to these startup companies, permitting and regulatory \nobstacles are tremendous disincentives to technology developers of \nmarine energy projects in the United States. While other countries have \nadopted permitting and regulatory regimes that appear to be more \nefficient, the United States is still struggling with how to permit and \nregulate these technologies. I cannot overstate the seriousness of this \nproblem. To give just one example, it took one MHK developer 5 years \nand $2 million to obtain a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission for a 1.5 megawatt project.\n  The regulatory situation is simply unacceptable and is greatly \nslowing progress in the MHK industry. Until companies get projects in \nthe water, Congress and the public will not learn about the \nenvironmental impacts, engineering challenges or the true costs of \noffshore renewables.\n  Capturing the benefits of our vast marine-based renewable resources \nwill require a mix of new incentives, updated regulatory regimes and \ngeneral outreach and education. However, the most important actions \nthat can be taken by the Federal Government in the short term are to \nprovide the necessary resources for research, development and \ndemonstration of various marine renewable energy technology platforms \nand a workable and efficient regulatory process. Increased federal \nsupport will accelerate deployment of these technologies, create \nthousands of high paying jobs, give confidence to investors, and help \nattract private capital.\n  The Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Act of 2013 helps \naccomplish these goals in a number of ways. It reauthorizes the DOE's \nMHK research, development and demonstration 3 programs, including the \nNational Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and \nDemonstration Centers.\n  Increased resources for the DOE Water Power Program will enable the \nUnited States to leverage its technological superiority in shipbuilding \nand offshore oil and gas production. This will create jobs and \ndiversify these maritime industries. In the absence of such funding, \nhowever, the United States will have to depend on foreign suppliers for \nocean energy technologies, and will have missed a significant \nopportunity to expand our economic competiveness in this renewable \nenergy sector.\n  The regulatory component of the bill makes the regulatory process for \nMHK of not more than 10 MW more efficient and timely. It modifies and \nimproves the FERC ``pilot license'' process in many ways. Improvements \ninclude a goal to complete the pilot license process in 12 months or \nless; a designation of FERC as the ``Lead Agency'' for the purpose of \ncoordinating environmental review; a clarification that any shut\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\ndown requirement be ``reasonable,'' and a clarification that an MHK \nproject does not need to be removed when it is shut down if FERC deems \nleaving it in place is preferable for environmental and other reasons\n  MHK is a clean, home-grown, emissions-free source of electricity that \ncan improve the security and reliability of the electric grid. \nInvesting in MHK research, development and demonstration today will pay \ngreat dividends in the future. MHK has tremendous potential to benefit \nthe United States and the entire world. Now is the time to move forward \non MHK and the Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Act is the way \nto do it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1419\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide for \ntransparency of payments made from the Judgment Fund; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation that I am \nintroducing in the U.S. Senate today, the Judgment Fund Transparency \nAct.\n  As my colleagues may or may not know, the Judgment Fund is \nadministered by the Treasury Department and is used to pay certain \ncourt judgments and settlements against the Federal Government. It is \nessentially an unlimited amount of money available to pay for Federal \nGovernment liability. It is not subject to the annual appropriations \nprocess, and even more remarkably, the Treasury Department has no \nreporting requirements, so these funds are paid out with very little \noversight or scrutiny.\n  This is no small matter, as the Judgment Fund disburses billions of \ndollars in payments per year. In recent years, Treasury has paid the \nfollowing from the Fund: fiscal year 2012--$2.9 billion, fiscal year \n2011--$2.2 billion, fiscal year 2010--$1.1 billion, fiscal year 2009--\n$2.3 billion, fiscal year 2008--$790 million, fiscal year 2007--$1 \nbillion, and fiscal year 2006--$628 million.\n  Before the Judgment Fund was established, claims against the \ngovernment were assigned to a Congressional committee that would \nappropriate funds in order to pay liability, attorneys' fees, and costs \nassociated with the claim. Once the Judgment Fund was established in \n1956, however, Congressional committees stopped appropriating funds \nexplicitly for this purpose. Now, if a government agency does not use \nits own annual budget to cover the costs, Treasury simply pays the bill \nout of the Fund.\n  Because the Treasury Department has no binding reporting \nrequirements, few public details exist about where the funds are going \nand why, and the information that is readily accessible is only made \navailable at the administration's discretion.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlighted the nature of this problem \nin an article about the Judgment Fund written by Bill Kovacs on \nFebruary 1, 2013:\n\n       Without knowing who is being paid under the Judgment Fund \n     and for what reason, not to mention the validity of the \n     claim, Congress cannot oversee and control the federal \n     governments litigation costs, risks and exposure. Simply, \n     without disclosure Congress is being denied the opportunity \n     to take effective mitigation measures against improper agency \n     action that results in claims against the federal government. \n     Non-disclosure of Judgment Fund payments hides from Congress \n     what might be excessive markers of agency mismanagement and/\n     or structural defects in statutes and programs. And due to a \n     lack of reporting, Congress is denied the opportunity to \n     understand claims against agencies that might shed light on \n     how to improve agency operations.\n\n  The National Cattlemen's Beef Association has also decried the lack \nof oversight of the Judgment Fund by stating, ``Certain groups \ncontinuously sue the federal government, and Treasury simply writes a \ncheck to foot the bill without providing Members of Congress and \nAmerican taxpayers basic information about the payment.''\n  The Judgment Fund Transparency Act seeks to address these problems by \nrequiring a public accounting of the taxpayer funds distributed via the \nJudgment Fund to parties who bring successful claims against the \nFederal government.\n  The Judgment Fund Transparency Act promotes transparency and \noversight by requiring the Treasury Department to post on a publicly \naccessible website the claimant, counsel, agency, fact summary, and \npayment amount for each claim from the Judgment Fund, unless a law or \ncourt order otherwise prohibits the disclosure of such information.\n  The Judgment Fund Transparency Act would increase transparency and \noversight of the Fund and would provide Members of Congress and the \npublic with the ability to see how taxpayers' dollars are being spent.\n  I am proud to introduce the Judgment Fund Transparency Act today and \ninvite my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1421. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable tax credit for the installation of sprinklers and \nelevators in historic structures; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, each year fire destroys hundreds of \nvulnerable historic buildings that serve as the anchors of America's \nvibrant villages and downtowns. These fires leave gaping holes in Main \nStreets all across the country. All have destroyed property. Some have \ntaken lives. And many could have been prevented by sprinkler systems. \nThis upfront but costly investment could have helped prevent the loss \nof life, reduced property damage, and decreased federal expenditures on \nrebuilding efforts after these fires.\n  To prevent fires from destroying buildings in historic downtowns and \nto preserve access to upper-story office, retail, and housing space in \nthese buildings, I am introducing legislation today--the Historic \nDowntown Preservation and Access Act--that will create a 50 percent \nrefundable tax credit, capped at $50,000, for the installation of fire \nsprinklers and elevators in older, multi-use buildings in historic \ndowntowns.\n  Since 2000, Vermont has had more than a dozen significant downtown \nfires causing tens of millions of dollars of damage and taking at least \nthree lives. The original owners of at least 8 of these buildings were \nunable to rebuild--leaving the critical task of rebuilding both the \nbuilding and the community to nonprofit entities that rely primarily on \nFederal funds. These 8 projects cost the Federal Government $20 million \nin Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Community Development Block-Grant \nbuilding, and HOME funding. Only one of these 8 buildings had a \nsprinkler system. If the building owners had installed sprinklers in \nall eight buildings using the credit created by this legislation, the \nFederal Government may have saved $19.6 million, dozens of Vermonters \nwould still be in their homes, more than a dozen businesses would have \nbeen sparred, and at least three Vermonters might still be alive today.\n  According to the National Fire Sprinkler Association, housing units \nwith sprinklers receive 69 percent less property damage during a fire \nthan units without sprinklers, the death rate per fire in a home with a \nsprinkler is 83 percent less than in a home without a sprinkler, and \nfirefighters are 65 percent less likely to be injured in a fire where a \nsprinkler is present than in a fire where a sprinkler is not present.\n  This legislation also incentivizes the installation of elevators \nbecause too often upper story office, retail, and housing space in \nhistoric downtown buildings goes unused due to accessibility \nrequirements.\n  Financial cost-benefit modeling and existing federal incentives for \nrehabbing an historic building with sprinklers or an elevator fail to \nadequately incentivize building owners to install these assets. For \ninstance, the Qualified Rehabilitation Tax Credit requires significant \nrehabilitation to a building equal to the value of the building before \nrenovation in order to claim the credit. Asset depreciation tax \nbenefits take decades for a building owner to offset the cost of a \nsprinkler or elevator system, and building owners who make no profit or \nminimal profit have no use for existing tax credits.\n  The new refundable tax credit I am introducing today--modeled after \nthe State of Vermont's highly successful\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\ndowntown historic tax credit--would allow private entities with little \ntax liability and nonprofits alike to install these important property- \nand life-saving devices in historic buildings.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1421\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \nrespecting the scoring of preventive health savings; to the Committee \non the Budget.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nmodernize the Congressional budget scoring process with respect to \nhealth spending and the effects of preventive health care.\n  Although the United States spends more than any other Nation in the \nworld on health care, $2.6 trillion in 2010, our citizens' health \nstatus lags behind that of most developed countries, and we have the \nhighest rate of preventable deaths among 19 industrialized nations. One \nreason is that the United States' expenditures for the treatment of \ndisease far exceed our investments in preventive health.\n  Our neglect of prevention has been costly. Spending on the treatment \nof chronic diseases is overwhelming our health care budgets, \nparticularly those of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The following \nstatistics come from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention: 7 out of 10 deaths among Americans each year are from \nchronic diseases. Heart disease, cancer and stroke account for more \nthan 50 percent of all deaths each year.\n  In 2005, 133 million Americans almost 1 out of every 2 adults had at \nleast one chronic illness.\n  About \\1/4\\ of people with chronic conditions have one or more daily \nactivity limitations.\n  Arthritis is the most common cause of disability, with nearly 19 \nmillion Americans reporting activity limitations.\n  Diabetes continues to be the leading cause of kidney failure, \nnontraumatic lower-extremity amputations, and blindness among adults, \naged 20-74.\n  Excessive alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause \nof death in the U.S., behind diet, physical activity, and tobacco.\n  CDC also tells us that four health risk behaviors--lack of physical \nactivity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol \nconsumption--are responsible for much of the illness, suffering, and \nearly death related to chronic diseases.\n  More than \\1/3\\ of all adults do not meet recommendations for aerobic \nphysical activity based on the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for \nAmericans, and 23 percent report no leisure-time physical activity at \nall in the preceding month.\n  In 2007, 22 percent of high school students and only 24 percent of \nadults reported eating 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per \nday.\n  More than 43 million American adults, approximately 1 in 5, smoke. \nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, and cigarette smoking \ncauses almost all cases. Compared to nonsmokers, men who smoke are \nabout 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer and women who smoke \nare about 13 times more likely. Smoking causes about 90 percent of lung \ncancer deaths in men and almost 80 percent in women. Smoking also \ncauses cancer of the voicebox, mouth and throat, esophagus, bladder, \nkidney, pancreas, cervix, and stomach, and causes acute myeloid \nleukemia.\n  Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to over 54 different \ndiseases and injuries, including cancer of the mouth, throat, \nesophagus, liver, colon, and breast, liver diseases, and other \ncardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal health \nproblems.\n  Binge drinking, the most dangerous pattern of drinking, defined as \nconsuming more than 4 drinks on an occasion for women or 5 drinks for \nmen, is reported by 17 percent of U.S. adults, averaging 8 drinks per \nbinge.\n  By addressing just these four behaviors, we can alter the trajectory \nof chronic disease and the health costs associated with them. That is \nthe power of prevention. As Dr. Albert Reece of the University of \nMaryland School of Medicine once said, ``Lifestyle is primary care.''\n  Prevention also means early screening. In addition to increasing \nsurvival rates, identifying diseases early reduces health care costs. \nIn the case of colorectal cancer, Medicare will pay under $400 for a \ncolonoscopy, but if the patient is not diagnosed until the disease has \nmetastasized, the costs of care can exceed $58,000 over the patient's \nlifetime. A screening mammography costs the Medicare program a small \nfraction of the tens of thousands of dollars that treatment of breast \ncancer costs, depending on when the cancer is found and the course of \ntreatment used. One drug used to treat late stage breast cancer can \ncost as much as $40,000 a year.\n  Research has shown that increasing to 90 percent the number of women \naged 40 and older who have been screened for breast cancer in the past \ntwo years would save more than 100,000 lives each year in the United \nStates.\n  One of the most compelling cases for prevention is in the area of \noral health. The tragic, preventable death of 12 year-old Marylander \nDeamonte Driver in 2007 illustrated the consequences of poor access to \noral health care. His untreated tooth abscess spread to his brain and \nafter two extensive operations, he died. Although a tooth extraction \nwould have cost about $80, the final total cost of his medical care \nexceeded $250,000.\n  The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry tells us that dental \ndecay is the most common chronic childhood disease among children in \nthe United States. It affects one in five children aged 2 to 4, half of \nthose aged 6 to 8, and nearly \\3/5\\ of 15 year olds. But it is also the \nmost preventable disease if basic oral care is provided starting at an \nearly age.\n  The good news in that for nearly every category of chronic disease we \ncan reduce its prevalence by making preventive health care a priority. \nAll around us are examples of why prevention is an essential part of \nhealth care\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\nand why effective use of preventive measures, such as screening and \nsmoking cessation can save lives and lower health care costs in the \nlong run.\n  But the current Congressional budget process has hindered our ability \nto get appropriate credit for the cost savings that prevention can \nbring. For this reason, investing in initiatives that can move our \nNation forward toward optimal health often requires us to cut funding \nin other important areas because of the budget rules.\n  Today, budget resolutions, budget reconciliation, and CBO scoring \nanalyses use a ten-year ``scoring'' window. But the research performed \nat the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD and at research \ncenters across the nation has demonstrated that some expenditures for \npreventive services result in cost savings when considered in the long \nterm. Unfortunately, Congressional budget scoring rules only permit \ntaking into account the first ten years, a time frame in which savings \nmay not be apparent.\n  We want to change that. Today, with Senators Mike Crapo, Angus King, \nTom Udall, and Jeanne Shaheen, I am introducing the Preventive Health \nSavings Act of 2013. It would allow the Chairman or Ranking Member of \nthe House or Senate Budget Committee, or the health committees--HELP, \nFinance, Ways and Means, or Energy and Commerce--to request an analysis \nof preventive measures extending beyond the existing 10-year window to \ntwo additional ten-year periods.\n  Re-evaluating our budget rules is not a new phenomenon. In recent \nyears, Congress has increasingly looked for ways to assess long-term \nbudget consequences. For example, Congress currently requests that CBO \nreport on measures that would cause a large future increase in the \ndeficit--more than $5 billion in the following four decades.\n  The Preventive Health Savings Act would direct CBO to incorporate \ncredible data on prevention. Because we want to ensure that CBO's \nprojections are tied to scientific data, our bill would define \npreventive health as ``an action designed to avoid future health care \ncosts that is demonstrated by credible and publicly available \nepidemiological projection models, incorporating clinical trials or \nobservational studies in humans, longitudinal studies, and meta-\nanalysis.'' This narrow, responsible approach encourages a sensible \nreview of health policy that Congress believes will promote public \nhealth, and it will make it easier for us to invest in proven methods \nof saving lives and money.\n  CBO would be required to conduct an initial analysis to determine \nwhether the provision would result in substantial savings outside the \n10-year scoring window and to include a description of those future-\nyear savings in its budget projections.\n  The broad coalition of groups supporting this bill includes: the \nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Aetna, Allscripts, American \nAssociation of Diabetes Educators, American College of Occupational \nMedicine, American College of Preventative Medicine, American Diabetes \nAssociation, BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee, Building Healthier \nAmerica, Care Continuum Alliance, Council for Affordable Health \nCoverage, Dialysis Patient Citizens, The Endocrine Society, Healthcare \nLeadership Council, Healthways, IHRSA: International Health Racquet & \nSportsclub Association, Johnson & Johnson, Marshfield Clinic, Memorial \nCare Health System, National Association of Public Hospitals and Health \nSystems, National Retail Federation, National Kidney Foundation, Novo \nNordisk, the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease, Sanofi, Texas Health \nResources, and Weight Watchers.\n  I also wish to applaud the bipartisan House sponsors of this \nlegislation--two physicians--Representatives Michael Burgess of Texas \nand Donna Christensen of the U.S. Virgin Islands, for their vision in \nintroducing the companion bill, HR 2663, which now has 19 cosponsors.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation, which will give \nour budget process the flexibility needed to dramatically bend the \nhealth care cost curve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Ms. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, and Mr. Heinrich):\n  S. 1423. A bill to amend the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act of 2000 to strengthen the quality control \nmeasures in place for part B lung disease claims and to establish the \nAdvisory Board on Toxic Substances and Worker Health for the contractor \nemployee compensation program under subtitle E of such Act; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak about \nbipartisan legislation I am introducing today with Senator Alexander to \nprovide much needed help to our Cold War patriots.\n  In 2000, Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program to help Cold War workers like those from Rocky \nFlats in my home state of Colorado and other nuclear weapons facilities \naround the country. This effort was designed to get these patriots the \nhelp they need to treat cancer and other illnesses they developed as a \nresult of exposure to radiation. Since then, the program has been \nplagued by procedural inconsistencies and delays preventing former \nnuclear workers from accessing the benefits they are owed.\n  In March 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a \nreport on the efficacy of EEOICPA, confirming workers' ongoing \nfrustrations with the program and recommending that Congress consider \ncreating an advisory board. More recently, in March 2013, the Institute \nof Medicine issued a report recommending that an external advisory \npanel be created to review the health effects of the Department of \nLabor's approach to awarding benefits.\n  Today, Senator Alexander and I are reintroducing our bill requiring \nthe President to establish an independent advisory panel to do just \nthat. This advisory board would add much needed transparency and \ncertainty to decisions made affecting workers' compensation and access \nto benefits.\n  Some 600,000 Cold War era workers, including thousands of workers at \nRocky Flats, put their health on the line to preserve our national \nsecurity during one of the most uncertain times in our nation's \nhistory. They were exposed to radiation and are sick and dying. Our \ncountry made a commitment to these patriots, but so far that promise \nhas not been kept. Coloradans find that unacceptable. We cannot let \nanother family suffer through the uncertainty of delays caused by \nbureaucratic red tape or see their loved ones denied the benefits they \ndeserve. It is time for us to do right by these workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Alexander in this fight \nby cosponsoring this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal):\n  S. 1425.

A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to \nclarify the rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of \ngovernmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under \nchapter 12 bankruptcies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of \n2013. We introduced similar legislation in the 112th Congress, but the \nSenate never had a chance to consider the bill. The bill addresses the \n2012 United States Supreme Court case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 \ndecision, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision I inserted into the \n2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act did not \naccomplish what we in Congress intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy \nClarification Act of 2013 corrects this and clarifies that bankrupt \nfamily farmers reorganizing their debts are able to treat capital gains \ntaxes owed to a governmental unit, arising from the sale of farm assets \nduring a bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will remove \nthe Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a bankruptcy \nreorganization plan's confirmation, giving the family farmer a chance \nto reorganize successfully.\n  In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide \na specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 \nwas made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects \nworked and did not work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. \nOne problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in \norder to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family \nfarmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund \na reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. \nUnfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling \nland that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost \nbasis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a \nsubstantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service \nreceive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive \npayment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated \ndifferently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the \ncash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal \nRevenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\npower over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the \nplan will not be confirmed. This does not make sense if the goal is to \ngive the family farmer a fresh start. Thus, in 2005 Congress said that \nin these limited situations, the taxes owed to the Internal Revenue \nService would be stripped of their priority and treated as general, \nunsecured debt. This removed the government's veto power over plan \nconfirmation and paved the way for family farmers to reorganize.\n  Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that \ndespite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language \ninserted into the Bankruptcy Code in 2005 conflicted with the Tax Code. \nThe Hall case was one of statutory interpretation. There is no question \nwhat Congress was trying to do; rather, did Congress use the correct \nlanguage? My goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family \nfarmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax \nliabilities to the federal government. Justice Breyer noted this in the \ndissent: ``Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of \ncollecting capital gains tax debts that arose during, and were \nconnected with, the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . The \nmajority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, \nit feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong \nplace.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 1882, 1897 (2012) (Breyer, \nJ., dissenting) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now \nfind themselves caught in a tough spot. The rules have now changed and \nmust be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. \nThe Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2013 will provide the \nclarity needed to help family farmers.\n  This bill, which has been worked on over the past year to make sure \nthe problem is addressed correctly, adds a new section 1232 to title 11 \nof the United States Code. This new section, along with other \nconforming changes to the Bankruptcy Code, will provide clarity to \npractitioners and courts as to how these claims are to be treated \nduring bankruptcy. I am pleased that what we are introducing today, \nbuilding from the bill we introduced last Congress, is an improved \nproduct that can help family farmers who are facing hard times. The \nFamily Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2013 will ensure that \nwhat Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. In the wake of the \nHall decision, clarification is needed to help family farmers \nreorganize successfully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the continued use of certain water \ndiversions located on National Forest System land in the Frank Church-\nRiver of No Return Wilderness and the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness in \nthe State of Idaho, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill called the \nIdaho Wilderness Water Facilities Act. This bill is identical to the \nHouse version, H.R. 876, which was introduced and carried through the \nHouse by my colleague from Idaho, Representative Mike Simpson, who did \nyeoman's work on pursuing this and putting it together and shepherding \nit through. It passed unanimously in the House. I thank him on behalf \nof all Idahoans for his work on this issue.\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\n  The need for this legislation is simple. The Frank Church River of No \nReturn Wilderness, which was designated by Congress in 1980, abuts the \nSelway-Bitterroot Wilderness area, which was designated by Congress in \n1964. These areas contain some of the largest and most rugged remote \ntracts of land in the lower 48 States. It is magnificent in its \nbeauty--substantially better, in my opinion, than the Alps.\n  There are a number of water diversions within the Idaho wilderness \nareas that have existed since the time of this legislation--since the \ntime these wilderness areas were established. Although the diversions \ncontinue to exist, the owners currently lack authority to maintain and \nrepair the facilities.\n  Predating the existence of these two wilderness areas, private \nlandowners had received permits to maintain and repair water diversions \nthat existed on National Forest System lands. The water is used for a \ncombination of many things, including, but not limited to, drinking \nwater for private cabins and ranches and also for generating \nelectricity in some places on a very small scale. Many of the permits \nhave since expired, leaving those who own the water diversions without \nany options for mechanically maintaining their water systems. In some \ncases, this lack of management threatens the environment and the \nwatersheds in which they exist.\n  The Idaho Wilderness Water Facilities Act will give the Secretary of \nAgriculture the authority to reissue and issue special use \nauthorizations to the owners of these diversion facilities within the \nFrank Church and the Selway Wilderness areas for the continued \nmaintenance of their water facilities. The permits would only be issued \nif the owner could prove the facility existed prior to those lands \nbeing designated as wilderness, the facility has been used to deliver \nwater to the owner's land since the designation, and the owner had a \nvalid water right and it would not be practical to move the facility \noutside of the wilderness area. Undoubtedly, in exercising the \ndiscretion, the Secretary would ensure that in no way would it \ndenigrate these wilderness areas. There are several different \nindividuals or businesses that have water diversions in these \nwilderness areas that meet the description I have given.\n  Earlier this week the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources held a hearing on H.R. 876. The U.S. Forest Service appeared \nat that hearing and testified in support of this bill. I look forward \nto working with Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Murkowski to pass \nthis bill quickly so as to allow for the maintenance of this water \ninfrastructure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. HIRONO:\n  S. 1432. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating portions of the Ka'u Coast \nin the State of Hawaii as a unit of the National Park System; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ka`u Coast \nPreservation Act of 2013, a bill directing the National Park Service to \nassess the feasibility of designating certain coastal lands on the Ka`u \nCoast of the island of Hawaii as units of the National Park System.\n  The National Park Service conducted a reconnaissance survey in 2006 \nthat made a preliminary assessment of whether the Ka`u Coast would meet \nthe National Park Service's demanding criteria as a resource of \nnational significance. The reconnaissance survey concluded that ``based \nupon the significance of the resources in the study area and the \ncurrent integrity and intact condition of these resources, a \npreliminary finding of national significance and suitability can be \nconcluded.'' The report goes on to recommend that Congress proceed with \na full resource study of the area.\n  Since the time of the initial reconnaissance report and my \nintroduction of this Act in previous Congresses, two additional \nproperties in the Ka`u that deserve evaluation have come to my \nattention: the Kahuku Coastal Property, also known as Sands of South \nKona and Road to the Sea, and the Nani Kahuku `Aina property adjacent \nto Pohue Bay. I have added these areas to the study area for the full \nresource study.\n  The coastline of Ka`u is still largely unspoiled. The study area \ncontains significant natural, geological, and archeological features. \nThe northern part of the study area is adjacent to Hawaii Volcanoes \nNational Park and contains a number of noteworthy geological features, \nincluding an ancient lava tube known as the Great Crack, which the \nNational Park Service has expressed interest in acquiring in the past.\n  The study area includes both black and green sand beaches as well as \na significant number of endangered and threatened species, most notably \nthe endangered hawksbill turtle, at least half of the Hawaiian \npopulation of this rare sea turtle nests within the study area, the \nthreatened green sea turtle, the highly endangered Hawaiian monk seal, \nthe endangered Hawaiian hawk, the endangered Hawaiian bat, native bees, \nthe endangered and very rare Hawaiian orange-black damselfy, the \nlargest population in the State, and a number of native birds. Humpback \nwhales and spinner dolphins also frequent the area. The Ka`u Coast also \nboasts some of the best remaining examples of native coastal vegetation \nin Hawaii.\n  The archeological resources related to ancient Hawaiian settlements \nwithin the study area are also very impressive. These include dwelling \ncomplexes, heiau, religious shrines, walls, fishing and canoe houses or \nsheds, burial sites, petroglyphs, water and salt collection sites, \ncaves, and trails. The Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail runs through \nthe study area.\n  The Ka'u Coast is a truly remarkable area: its combination of \nnatural, archeological, cultural, and recreational resources, as well \nas its spectacular viewscapes, are an important part of Hawaii's and \nour nation's natural and cultural heritage.\n  As this process evolves, the successful preservation of this pristine \nland will depend on the federal government working closely with local \nstakeholders, seeking their input, and collaborating with them to \naddress concerns as they arise. I encourage the National Park Service \nto continue working with all involved to ensure this coastline is \npreserved for decades to come.\n  I believe a full feasibility study, which was recommended in the \nreconnaissance survey, will confirm that the area meets the National \nPark Service's high standards as an area of national significance.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 1437. A bill to provide for the release of the reversionary \ninterest held by the United States in certain land conveyed in 1954 by \nthe United States, acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land \nManagement, to the State of Oregon for the establishment of the \nHermiston Agricultural Research and Extension Center of Oregon State \nUniversity in Hermiston, Oregon; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that will \ngive Oregon State University the flexibility to continue its important \nagricultural work in Hermiston, Oregon. I am pleased to be joined on \nthis bill with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkely. I look \nforward to working with Senator Merkley, other colleagues, and \nsupporters of the bill to update the federal interests in the land to \nmatch current needs and conditions.\n  The Hermiston Agricultural Research & Extension Center, HAREC, \nprovides support to one of the most unique and important agricultural \nareas in the world: the Columbia Basin region of Oregon and Washington. \nAs one of Oregon State University's, OSU, 12 Agricultural Experiment \nStations, HAREC concentrates on the discovery and implementation of \nagricultural opportunities while also providing solutions to production \nissues for regional growers and beyond.\n  Research at HAREC emphasizes identification of new crop \nopportunities, improved production practices that save money while \nreducing inputs, plant breeding and varietal evaluation of cereals and \npotatoes. Through this work it has developed new lines with higher \nnutritional value, integrated pest management of insects and insect-\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\ntransmitted diseases, and provided information related to environmental \nissues and salmon restoration. In recent years the center provided \nleadership, research, and new knowledge essential to allow growers to \ndiversify production and convert 30,000 acres of commodity crops to \nhigh-value crops. The station has led efforts to cultivate value-added \nagriculture in Morrow and Umatilla counties, resulting in over \n$50,000,000 in annual economic return.\n  The history of HAREC and a Umatilla agricultural research center \nspans more than a century. The Federal Government paved the way in the \ndevelopment of farming and ranching in the Umatilla Basin. In 1954, the \nBureau of Land Management granted land to the State of Oregon on the \ncondition that the land is used for cooperative agricultural \nexperimental work. Over the past nearly 60 years, OSU has developed a \ncenter with state-of-the-art laboratories, irrigation technology \nabilities, greenhouses, screenhouses and research and extension \nfaculty. HAREC now supports nearly 500,000 acres of irrigated \nagriculture.\n  Just as agriculture in the Columbia Basin has grown by leaps and \nbounds since 1954, so has the community of Hermiston. This bill removes \nthe reversionary clause from the original land grant while conditioning \nthat any consideration gained by OSU from the sale, lease, or other use \nof the land be put back into agricultural experimental and research \nwork. It gives OSU the flexibility to adapt to the population growth \nand city expansion that will ultimately necessitate the relocation of \nHAREC from inside the urban growth boundary to a more rural location. \nWithout this bill, moving the station would mean triggering the federal \nreversionary clause and losing HAREC land and all the buildings and \nimprovements over nearly six decades to the Federal Government. I'm \nsponsoring this bill to ensure HAREC can continue for another hundred \nyears.\n  Regional leaders and Oregon State University support removing the \nbarriers to the continued operation of the center. I express my \ngratitude for their work with me on this legislation. I also look \nforward to working with Senator Merkley to advance this bill and \nsupport the agricultural heart of the regional economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hermiston Agricultural \n     Research and Extension Center Land Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Research center land.--The term ``research center \n     land'' means the approximately 290 acres of land in \n     Hermiston, Oregon, identified as the ``Reversionary Interest \n     Area'' on the map entitled ``Hermiston Agricultural Research \n     and Extension Center'' and dated July 23, 2013, including any \n     improvements to, and building on, the land.\n       (2) Patent.--The term ``patent'' means the patent granted \n     by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (acting on \n     behalf of the United States) to the State, numbered 130889, \n     and dated September 17, 1954.\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of Oregon \n     (acting through the Oregon State Board of Higher Education on \n     behalf of Oregon State University).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to allow the use of \nphysical damage disaster loans for the construction of safe rooms; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home state of Louisiana: \ndisaster preparedness. As you know, along the Gulf Coast, we keep an \neye trained on the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. This is \nfollowing the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nof 2005 as well as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. Unfortunately, \nour region also has had to deal with the economic and environmental \ndamage from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 and more recently \nHurricane Isaac. For this reason, as Chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, ensuring Federal disaster programs \nare effective and responsive to disaster victims is one of my top \npriorities. While the Gulf Coast is prone to hurricanes, other parts of \nthe country are no strangers to disaster. For example, the Midwest and \nSoutheast have tornadoes, California experiences earthquakes and \nwildfires, and the Northeast sees crippling snowstorms. So no part of \nour country is spared from disasters--disasters which can and will \nstrike at any moment. This certainly hit home when the northeast was \nstruck by Hurricane Sandy in October of last year and when Moore, \nOklahoma was hit by a massive tornado earlier this summer. With this in \nmind, we must ensure that families have the resources they need to be \nbetter prepared the next time disasters strike their communities.\n  In order to give families in tornado prone areas more resources to \nprotect lives and property, I am proud to file the Tornado Family \nSafety Act of 2013. Representative Tom Cole from Oklahoma is filing the \nHouse companion bill today as well. I want to thank him for being my \npartner in this effort as his district has seen firsthand how \ndestructive these tornadoes can be to homes and businesses. In \nparticular, our bill would allow U.S. Small Business Administration, \nSBA, disaster home mitigation loans to go towards the construction of \ntornado safe rooms. Under current law, SBA can increase the size of a \nhome disaster loan by 20 percent of the total damage to decrease future \ndisaster risk. The Small Business Act lists out examples of mitigation \nactivities such as ``. . . retaining walls, sea walls, grading and \ncontouring land, relocating utilities and modifying structures . . .'' \nThe bill would add safe rooms as an eligible activity so homeowners \nwould have access to these low-interest loans. It does not replace or \nduplicate other programs, but instead provides a backstop for families \nin disaster prone areas.\n  Under guidelines from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, \nand the International Code Council, ICC, a safe room should withstand \n250 mph winds and the impact of a 15-pound plank hitting a wall at 100 \nmiles per hour, according to the Insurance Institute for Business and \nHome Safety, IBHS. Safe rooms designed to the FEMA and ICC standards \nare recommended for both tornadoes and hurricanes. For individual \nhomes, a safe room could range anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000.\n  The concept for the bill came about after discussions with the FEMA \nand the SBA on recent disasters. We learned that safe rooms are not \nallowable under FEMA preparedness grant programs. Safe rooms would be \nconsidered construction and FEMA only allows for limited construction \nunder the preparedness grants for very specific items, such as \ncommunications towers, as specified in the appropriations acts. Safe \nrooms are an eligible activity under the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant \nProgram, HMGP. States decide how they use their HMGP, and reimbursing \nsafe room construction for homeowners could be eligible. However, given \nthe larger cost involved in reimbursing individual homeowners, HMGP \nfunded safe rooms are oftentimes community-owned not residential.\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\n  As I have indicated, FEMA Individual Assistance does not allow the \nconstruction of safe rooms. FEMA does allow HMGP grants for safe rooms \nand states can decide to reimburse safe room construction for \nhomeowners. However, most are typically community-owned not residential \nsince HMGP funds both single and multi-use facilities--schools, \ncommunity centers, etc. For example, according to FEMA data, out of 21 \nstates funding safe rooms, only four states, Oklahoma, Alabama, \nMississippi, and Arkansas, represent the bulk of residential safe \nrooms, appproximately 21,600 of the 21,880 funded.\n  But let me give you an example of how the needs for these types of \nstructures are often outpacing the resources currently available. \nFollowing the May 20, 2013 tornado there, Moore, OK, Mayor Glenn Lewis \nproposed a requirement that all new homes built in the city include a \nsafe room. Oklahoma Governor Fallin also told the Associated Press that \nonly 100 of the 1,752 public schools in Oklahoma have a safe room. In a \nsubsequent June 9, 2013, interview, Albert Ashwood, Director of the \nOklahoma Department of Emergency Management, estimated that putting \nsafe rooms in 1,000 Oklahoma schools, via traditional FEMA grant \nprograms, would cost between $500 million to $1 billion alone. So in \nthe near future, there is likely to be less, not more, Federal funding \navailable at the State level for these types of residential safe rooms. \nOur bill would allow a backstop to homeowners in the event that other \nFederal/State funds are not available for safe rooms for that \nparticular disaster.\n  In closing, I believe that this commonsense disaster reform will \ngreatly benefit homeowners impacted by future tornadoes and other \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tornado Family Safety Act of \n     2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. USE OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE DISASTER LOANS.\n\n       Section 7(b)(1)(A) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     636(b)(1)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``the Administration may increase'' and \n     inserting ``the Administration may, subject to section 18(a), \n     increase''; and\n       (2) by striking ``and modifying structures'' and inserting \n     ``, and modifying structures (including construction of a \n     safe room or similar storm shelter designed to protect \n     property and occupants from tornadoes or other natural \n     disasters)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 1443. A bill to facilitate the remediation of abandoned hardrock \nmines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing \nlegislation designed to help promote the cleanup of abandoned and \ninactive hard rock mines that are a great detriment to the environment \nand public health throughout the country, but especially to the West. I \nwant to thank my colleague Senator Bennet for joining me in this \neffort.\n  For over one hundred years, miners and prospectors have searched for \nand developed valuable ``hard rock'' minerals--gold, silver, copper, \nmolybdenum, and others. Hard rock mining has played a key role in the \nhistory of Colorado and other states, and the resulting mineral wealth \nhas been an important contributor to our economy and the development of \nessential products.\n  Too often, however, the miners would abandon their work and move on, \nseeking riches over the next mountain. The resulting legacy of unsafe \nopen mine shafts and acid mine drainages can be seen throughout the \ncountry and especially on public lands in the West where mineral \ndevelopment was encouraged to help settle our region.\n  Unfortunately, many of our current environmental laws designed to \nmitigate the impact from operating hard rock mines are of limited \neffectiveness when applied to abandoned and inactive mines. As a \nresult, many of these old mines continue to pollute streams and rivers \nand pose a risk to the health of people who live nearby or downstream.\n  The bill I am reintroducing today will help address this impediment \nand make it easier for volunteers, who had no role in creating the \nproblem, to help clean up these sites and improve the environment. It \ndoes so by providing a new permit program under the Clean Water Act \nwhereby volunteers can, under an approved plan, reduce the water \npollution flowing from an abandoned mine. At the same time, volunteers \nwill not be exposed to the full liability and ongoing responsibility \nprovisions of the Clean Water Act.\n  I would be remiss not to thank the Environmental Protection Agency \nfor its work in addressing this issue. Most recently, EPA issued a \nmemorandum on December 12, 2012, to reduce the Clean Water Act legal \nvulnerability faced by ``Good Samaritans'' by clarifying that parties \nwho volunteer to clean up these abandoned sites are generally not \nresponsible for obtaining a permit under the Clean Water Act both \nduring and following a successful cleanup. While this was an important \nstep forward, my legislation will provide binding legal protections for \nGood Samaritans, allowing them to move forward--knowing the long-term \ncertainty of their rights--with the imperative work of mine cleanup.\n  The new permits proposed in this bill would help address problems \nthat have frustrated federal and state agencies throughout the country. \nAs population growth continues near these old mines, more and more \nrisks to public health and safety are likely to occur. We simply must \nbegin to address this issue--not only to improve the environment, but \nalso to ensure that our water supplies are safe and usable. This bill \ndoes not address all the concerns some would-be Good Samaritans may \nhave about initiating cleanup projects and I am committed to continue \nworking to address those additional concerns, through additional \nlegislation and in other ways. However, this bill can make a real \ndifference, and I think it deserves approval without unnecessary delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 1444. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide payment under part A of the Medicare Program on a reasonable \ncost basis for anesthesia services furnished by an anesthesiologist in \ncertain rural hospitals in the same manner as payments are provided for \nanesthesia services furnished by anesthesiologist assistants and \ncertified anesthetists in such hospitals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President. I am honored to join my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Johnny Isakson, in introducing a bill essential to \nexpanding health care options for rural hospitals and beneficiaries \nliving in rural areas, the Medicare Access to Rural Anesthesiology Act.\n  As it stands today, low Medicare Part B anesthesia payments and low \npatient volume in rural areas makes it difficult for rural hospitals to \nattract and retain anesthesiologists. Our legislation would take an \nimportant step towards leveling the playing field between urban and \nrural health care by ensuring that rural Medicare beneficiaries have \nsimilar access to anesthesia services.\n  Generally, Medicare pays for anesthesia services under the Medicare \nPart B fee schedule, but in order to attract anesthesia providers to \nrural areas, a statutory exception was created in the 1980s that allows \neligible rural hospital to use Part A funds to employ or contract with \nnon-physician anesthesiologist assistants, AA, or certified registered \nnurse anesthetists, CRNA. This policy however, does not permit eligible \nhospitals to use pass-through funds to pay anesthesiologists. Leaving \nanesthesiologists out also prevents AAs from receiving pass through \npayment because AAs must have an anesthesiologist on premises in order \nto practice. As a result, many folks in rural areas only have access to \none type of anesthesia provider compared to folks in urban areas who \ncan easily visit an anesthesiologist, CRNA, or an AA.\n  Our legislation would allow eligible rural hospitals to use ``pass-\nthrough'' Part A funds to employ CRNAs, AAs, and anesthesiologists. \nThis common\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nsense change would give eligible rural hospitals the power to choose \nthe anesthesia providers that best suit the medical needs of their \npatients, and would provide these hospitals with another tool to \nrecruit and retain anesthesiology professionals as well as expand the \navailability of anesthesiology care in medically underserved areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted In the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1444\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Access to Rural \n     Anesthesiology Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MEDICARE PART A PAYMENT FOR ANESTHESIOLOGIST SERVICES \n                   IN CERTAIN RURAL HOSPITALS BASED ON CRNA PASS-\n                   THROUGH RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1814 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395f) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n\n    ``Anesthesiologist Services Provided in Certain Rural Hospitals\n\n       ``(m)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \n     coverage and payment shall be provided under this part for \n     physicians' services that are anesthesia services furnished \n     by a physician who is an anesthesiologist in a rural hospital \n     described in paragraph (3) in the same manner as payment is \n     made under the exception provided in section 9320(k) of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended by \n     section 6132 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395k note) (relating to payment on a reasonable \n     cost, pass-through basis), for certified registered nurse \n     anesthetist services furnished by a certified registered \n     nurse anesthetist in a hospital described in such section.\n       ``(2) No payment shall be made under any other provision of \n     this title for physicians' services for which payment is made \n     under this subsection.\n       ``(3) A rural hospital described in this paragraph is a \n     hospital described in section 9320(k) of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1986, as so amended (42 U.S.C. 1395k \n     note), except that--\n       ``(A) any reference in such section to a `certified \n     registered nurse anesthetist' or `anesthetist' is deemed a \n     reference to a `physician who is an anesthesiologist' or \n     `anesthesiologist', respectively; and\n       ``(B) any reference to `January 1, 1988' or `1987' is \n     deemed a reference to such date and year as the Secretary \n     shall specify.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to services furnished during cost reporting \n     periods beginning on or after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1449. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat income attributable to certain passenger cruise voyages beginning \nor ending in the United States shall be treated as effectively \nconnected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United \nStates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing comprehensive \nlegislation to repeal corporate tax loopholes that allow the cruise \nindustry to avoid paying its fair share of U.S. corporate income taxes.\n  These bills change the treatment of the revenue that foreign-based \ncruise lines earn from ships that embark or disembark nearly 15 million \npassengers a year in the United States. A string of recent incidents \nhas demonstrated that when cruise ships get into trouble, the companies \nrely on the resources and assistance of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. \nThe industry also uses the services of over 20 other U.S. agencies to \nthe tune of millions of taxpayer dollars every year.\n  The majority of cruise companies are organized as foreign \ncorporations, even though many of their headquarters and executives are \nlocated in the United States. By incorporating in foreign countries, \nthe cruise industry enjoys a special exemption under section 883 of the \nInternal Revenue Code, which provides that certain foreign corporations \nare not subject to U.S. taxes on income derived from the international \noperation of ships, even if the source of the income is in the United \nStates.\n  Today, I am introducing two bills, S. 1449 and S. 1450. The first \nwould eliminate the section 883 special exemption for cruise industry \nincome derived from passenger cruise voyages that embark or disembark \npassengers in the United States. This income would be treated as being \nU.S. sourced and effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, \nso it would be subject to U.S. taxes at the same rate as other income.\n  The second bill would impose a 5 percent excise tax on gross income \nfrom cruises where passengers embark or disembark in the United States. \nFunds generated from the excise tax will help fund a national program \nto make infrastructure improvements vital to the efficient \ntransportation of goods and services.\n  For too long, the cruise industry has been able to use taxpayer \nprovided services without actually paying for them. It is time the \ncruise industry begins to pay for the services it uses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TAXATION OF UNITED STATES CRUISE INDUSTRY INCOME \n                   OF NONRESIDENT ALIENS AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.\n\n       (a) United States Cruise Industry Income Treated as \n     Effectively Connected to the Conduct of a Trade or Business \n     Within the United States.--\n       (1) Income from sources without the united states.--\n       (A) In general.--Paragraph (4) of section 864(c)

  ``(C) United states cruise industry income.--\n       ``(i) In general.--United States cruise industry income \n     shall be treated as effectively connected with the conduct of \n     a trade or

A bill to provide for environmental restoration activities \nand forest management activities in the Lake Tahoe Basin, to amend \ntitle 18, United States Code, to prohibit the importation or shipment \nof quagga mussels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to again discuss the need \nto restore and protect Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is a national treasure. \nHer alpine beauty has drawn and inspired people for centuries: artists \nand poets, John Muir and Mark Twain, and countless millions the world \nover.\n  As a girl, I went to Lake Tahoe to ride horses through the woods, to \nswim in the clear blue waters and to bike around the magnificent Basin.\n  For over 16 years, representatives from different ends of the \npolitical spectrum have come together to Keep Tahoe Blue.\n  The challenges are great. Climate change and drought have created a \npersistent threat from catastrophic wildfire. Sedimentation and \npollution threaten water quality and the lake's treasured clarity. And \ninvasive species threaten the economy of the region.\n  The time to act is now, and the federal government must take a \nleading role--78 percent of the land surrounding Lake Tahoe is public \nland, primarily the Eldorado, Toiyabe and Tahoe National Forests.\n  That is why today I am reintroducing the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act \nof 2013, which is co-sponsored by Senators Harry Reid, Dean Heller and \nBarbara Boxer.\n  The bill would continue the Federal commitment at Lake Tahoe by \nauthorizing $415 million over ten years to improve water clarity, \nreduce the threat of catastrophic fire, combat invasive species, and \nrestore and protect the environment in the Lake Tahoe Basin.\n  Specifically, it would do the following:\n  Provide $243 million over 10 years for the highest priority \nrestoration projects, according to scientific data. The legislation \nauthorizes at least $138 million for stormwater management and \nwatershed restoration projects scientifically determined to be the most \neffective ways to improve water clarity.\n  This bill also requires prioritized ranking of environmental \nrestoration projects and authorizes $80 million for State and local \nagencies to implement these projects with costs being split evenly \nbetween the Federal agencies and non-federal partners.\n  Eligible projects must demonstrate their cost effectiveness, \nstakeholder support, ability to leverage non-federal contributions and \nmeet environmental improvement goals.\n  Implementation of priority projects will improve water quality, \nforest health, air quality and fish and wildlife habitat around Lake \nTahoe.\n  Authorizes $135 million over ten years to reduce the threat of \nwildfire in Lake Tahoe. These funds will finance hazardous fuels \nreduction projects including grants to local fire agencies, who must \ncontribute at least 25 percent of project costs.\n  The bill also authorizes important restoration work related to the \ndevastating 2007 Angora fire, which destroyed 242 residences and 67 \ncommercial structures. Fuels treatment on Washoe Tribal lands, wildfire \nprevention planning, and improvements to\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\nlocal water district infrastructure to fight wildfires that reach urban \nareas are eligible for grant funding.\n  The bill also creates incentives for local communities to have \ndedicated funding for defensible space inspections and enforcement.\n  Protecting Lake Tahoe from the threat of quagga mussels and other \ninvasive aquatic species. Protecting Lake Tahoe from the threat of \nquagga mussels and other invasive aquatic species is a major priority \nbecause of the serious threats posed to Lake Tahoe.\n  University of California, Davis and University of Nevada, Reno \nscientists report that they have found up to 3,000 Asian clams per \nsquare meter at spots between Zephyr Point and Elk Point in Lake Tahoe. \nThe spreading Asian clam population could put sharp shells and rotting \nalgae on the Lake's beaches and help spread other invasive species such \nas quagga mussels.\n  The bill would authorize $30 million for watercraft inspections and \nremoval of existing invasive species. It would require all watercraft \nto be inspected and decontaminated if they are determined to be a risk \nto the lake.\n  These invasive species threats are serious. For example, one quagga \nor zebra mussel can lay 1 million eggs in a year. This means that a \nsingle boat carrying quagga could devastate the lake's biology, local \ninfrastructure, and the local economy.\n  The threat to Lake Tahoe cannot be overstated. In 2007 quagga mussels \nwere discovered in Lake Mead. In the 6 years since, there population \nhas swelled exponentially. Today there are more than 3 trillion. The \ninfestation is probably irreversible.\n  There is good news. There is promising news on this front. Scientists \nhave begun testing a new strategy by placing long rubber mats across \nthe bottom of Lake Tahoe to cut off the oxygen to the Asian clams. \nEarly research suggests that these mats were very effective at killing \nthe clams. We continue to learn from this important research about how \nbest to manage invasive species.\n  We can fight off these invaders. But it will require drive and \nimagination and the help authorized within this bill.\n  Supports reintroduction of the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The \nlegislation authorizes $20 million over 10 years for the Lahontan \nCutthroat Trout Recovery Plan. The Lahontan Cutthroat Trout is an \niconic species that has an important historic legacy in Lake Tahoe.\n  When John C. Fremont first explored the Truckee River in January of \n1844, he called it the Salmon Trout River because he found the Pyramid \nLake Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The trout relied on the Truckee River \nand its tributaries for their spawning runs in spring, traveling up the \nentire river's length as far as Lake Tahoe and Donner Lake, where they \nused the cool, pristine waters and clean gravel beds to lay their eggs. \nBut dams, pollution and overfishing caused the demise of the Lahontan \nCutthroat Trout.\n  Lake Tahoe is one of the historic 11 lakes where Lahontan Cutthroat \nTrout flourished in the past, and it's a critical part of the strategy \nto recover the species.\n  Funds scientific research. The legislation authorizes $30 million \nover ten years for scientific programs and research which will produce \ninformation on long-term trends in the Basin and inform the most cost-\neffective projects.\n  Prohibiting mining operations in the Tahoe Basin. This legislation \nwould prohibit new mining operations in the Basin, ensuring that the \nfragile watershed and Lake Tahoe's water clarity are not threatened by \npollution from mining operations.\n  Increases accountability and oversight. Every project funded by this \nlegislation will have monitoring and assessment to determine the most \ncost-effective projects and best management practices for future \nprojects.\n  The legislation also requires the Chair of the Federal Partnership to \nwork with the Forest Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and \nWildlife Service and regional and state agencies, to prepare an annual \nreport to Congress detailing the status of all projects undertaken, \nincluding project scope, budget and justification and overall \nexpenditures and accomplishments.\n  This will ensure that Congress can have oversight on the progress of \nenvironmental restoration in Lake Tahoe.\n  Provides for public outreach and education. The Forest Service, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service and Tahoe \nRegional Planning Agency will implement new public outreach and \neducation programs including encouraging Basin residents and visitors \nto implement defensible space, conducting best management practices for \nwater quality and preventing the introduction and proliferation of \ninvasive species. In addition, the legislation requires signage on \nfederally financed projects to improve public awareness of restoration \nefforts.\n  Allows for increased efficiency in the management of public land. \nUnder this legislation, the Forest Service would have increased \nflexibility to exchange land with state agencies which will allow for \nmore cost-efficient management of public land. There is currently a \ncheckerboard pattern of ownership in some areas of the Basin.\n  Under this new authority, the Forest Service could exchange land with \nthe California Tahoe Conservancy and the California Department of Parks \nand Recreation of approximately equal value without going through a \nlengthy process to assess the land.\n  For example, if there are several plots of Forest Service land that \nsurround or are adjacent to Tahoe Conservancy or California State Parks \nland, the state could transfer that land to the Forest Service so that \nit can be managed more efficiently.\n  This legislation is needed because the ``Jewel of the Sierra'' is in \nbig trouble. If we don't act now, we could lose Lake Tahoe, lose it \nwith stunning speed, to several devastating threats.\n  Anyone doubting that climate change poses a severe threat to Lake \nTahoe should read an alarming recent report by the UC Davis Tahoe \nEnvironmental Research Center.\n  It was written for the U.S. Forest Service by scientists who have \ndevoted their professional careers to studying Lake Tahoe. And it \npaints a distinctly bleak picture of the future for the ``Jewel of the \nSierra.''\n  Among its findings are the Tahoe Basin's regional snowpack could \ndecline by as much as 60 percent in the next century, with increased \nfloods likely by 2050 and prolonged droughts by 2100.\n  Even ``under the most optimistic projections,'' average snowpack in \nthe Sierra Nevada around Tahoe will decline by 40 to 60 percent by \n2100, according to the report.\n  This would likely bankrupt Tahoe's ski industry, threaten the water \nsupply of Reno and other communities, and degrade the lake's fabled \nwater clarity. It is devastating.\n  According to the UC Davis report, an all-out attack on pollution and \nsedimentation may be the lake's last best hope.\n  Geoff Schladow, director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research \nCenter and one of the report's authors, noted the need to restore \nshort-term water quality in Lake Tahoe--while there's still time to do \nit.\n  ``Reducing the load of external nutrients entering the lake in the \ncoming decades may be the only possible mitigation measure to reduce \nthe impact of climate change on lake clarity . . . ,'' the report said.\n  Without such an effort, the ``internal loading of nutrients'' could \nfundamentally change the lake and fuel algal growth, creating a \ndownward spiral in water quality and clarity.\n  Water clarity is one of the central problems the legislation would \naddress.\n  Pollution and sedimentation have threatened Lake Tahoe's water \nclarity for years now. In 1968, the first year UC Davis scientists made \nmeasurements using a device called a Secchi disk, clarity was measured \nat an average depth of 102.4 feet. Clarity declined over the next three \ndecades, hitting a low of 64 feet in 1997.\n  There has been some improvement in this decade. Last year scientists \nrecorded average clarity at 75.3 feet--the clearest readings in a \ndecade. But it is a fragile gain. Sedimentation and stormwater runoff \npose a persistent threat.\n  Climate change has already made itself apparent at Lake Tahoe. It \nmakes the basin dry and tinder-hot, raising the risks of catastrophic \nwildfire. Daily air temperatures have increased 4 degrees since 1911. \nSnow has\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\ndeclined as a fraction of total precipitation, from an average of 52 \npercent in 1910 to just 36 percent in recent years.\n  Climate change has caused Lake Tahoe's surface water temperature to \nrise over 2 degrees in 44 years. That means the cyclical deep-water \nmixing of the lake's waters will occur less frequently, and this could \nsignificantly disrupt Lake Tahoe's ecosystem.\n  This legislation is intended to address these problems.\n  Last year, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported \nout the bill favorably, but there was not enough time for a floor vote. \nIt is my hope that this legislation can move through committee quickly \nand be passed later this year.\n  A lot of good work has been done. But there's a lot more work to do, \nand time is running out.\n  Mark Twain called Lake Tahoe ``the fairest picture the whole world \naffords.'' We must not be the generation who lets this picture fall \ninto ruin. We must rise to the challenge, and do all we can to preserve \nthis ``noble sheet of water.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1451\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lake Tahoe Restoration Act \n     of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

It is also endorsed by a number of small business, public \ninterest, and good government groups, including the Main Street \nAlliance, American Sustainable Business Council, National Money \nTransmitters Association, AFL-CIO, SEIU, Global Financial Integrity, \nGlobal Witness, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Transparency \nInternational, Public Citizen, Project on Government Oversight, Jubilee \nUSA Network, Tax Justice Network USA, Human Rights Watch, Friends of \nthe Earth, Open Society Policy Center, Revenue Watch Institute, the \nFACT Coalition, and more. .\n  This is the fourth Congress in which this bill has been introduced to \nprovide a solution to a problem that has gained only more urgency with \ntime. In 2008,\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\nwhen the bill was first introduced, President Obama was a member of the \nU.S. Senate and an original cosponsor. In 2013, President Obama stood \nwith other international leaders at a G8 summit in June to condemn \ncorporations with hidden owners who commit crimes, tax evasion, and \nother wrongdoing. The G8 leaders made a joint commitment to combat that \nproblem. President Obama immediately responded with a U.S. action plan \nthat, among other measures, calls for enacting legislation to end the \nshameful practice in this country of forming U.S. corporations with \nunnamed owners and unleashing them on, not only our own communities, \nbut the international community as well.\n  A World Bank study found that the United States forms more \ncorporations per year than all the rest of the countries in the world \nput together. Under current law, those U.S. corporations can be \nestablished anonymously, by hidden owners who don't reveal their \nidentity. According to another recent study by Griffith University \nexamining multiple jurisdictions, it is easier to obtain an anonymous \nshell company in the United States than almost anywhere else in the \nworld. That study also found that ``only a tiny portion of U.S. \nproviders of any kind met the international standard of requiring \nnotarized identity documents.''\n  Right now, in the United States, it takes more information to get a \ndriver's license or to open a U.S. bank account than to form a U.S. \ncorporation. Our bill would change that by requiring any State that \naccepts crime-fighting grants from the Department of Justice to add one \nnew question to their existing incorporation forms asking applicants to \nidentify the company's true owners.\n  That is it. One new question on an existing form. It is not a \ncomplicated question, yet the answer could play a key role in helping \nlaw enforcement do their jobs. Our bill would not require States to \nverify the information, but penalties would apply to persons who submit \nfalse information. States, or licensed formation agents if a State has \ndelegated the task to them, would supply the ownership information to \nlaw enforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons.\n  The Problem. We have all seen the news reports about U.S. \ncorporations involved in wrongdoing--from facilitating terrorism to \nmoney laundering, financial fraud, tax evasion, corruption, and more. \nLet me give you a few examples that indicate the scope of the problem.\n  We now know that some terrorists use U.S. corporations to carry out \ntheir activities. Viktor Bout, an arms dealer who was found guilty in \nNovember 2011 of conspiring to kill U.S. nationals and selling weapons \nto a terrorist organization, used corporations around the world in his \nwork, including a dozen formed in Texas, Delaware, and Florida. At the \ntime of Mr. Bout's extradition to face justice here in America, \nAttorney General Eric Holder stated: ``Long considered one of the \nworld's most prolific arms traffickers, Mr. Bout will now appear in \nfederal court in Manhattan to answer to charges of conspiring to sell \nmillions of dollars worth of weapons to a terrorist organization for \nuse in trying to kill Americans.'' It is unacceptable that Mr. Bout was \nable to set up corporations in three of our States and use them in \nillicit activities without ever being asked for the names of the \ncorporate owners.\n  In another case, a New York company called the Assa Corporation owned \na Manhattan skyscraper and, in 2007, wire transferred about $4.5 \nmillion in rental payments to a bank in Iran. U.S. law enforcement \ntracking the funds had no idea who was behind that corporation, until \nanother government disclosed that it was owned by the Alavi Foundation \nwhich had known ties to the Iranian military. In other words, a New \nYork corporation was being used to ship millions of U.S. dollars to \nIran, a notorious supporter of terrorism.\n  U.S. corporations with hidden owners have also been involved in \nfinancial crimes. In 2011, a former Russian military officer, Victor \nKaganov, pled guilty to operating an illegal money transmitter business \nfrom his home in Oregon, and using Oregon shell corporations to wire \nmore than $150 million around the world on behalf of Russian clients. \nU.S. Attorney Dwight Holton of the District of Oregon used stark \nlanguage when describing the case: ``When shell corporations are \nillegally manipulated in the shadows to hide the flow of tens of \nmillions of dollars overseas, it threatens the integrity of our \nfinancial system.''\n  Another financial fraud case involves Florida attorney Scott \nRothstein who, in 2010, pled guilty to fraud and money laundering in \nconnection with a $1.2 billion Ponzi investment scheme, in which he \nused 85 U.S. limited liability companies to conceal his participation \nand ownership stake in various business ventures. In still another case \nearlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission suspended \ntrading in 61 shell corporations suspected of being misused to defraud \ninvestors.\n  Shell corporations are also notorious for their role in health care \nfraud. One example involves an individual named Michel Huarte who \nformed 29 shell companies in several states including Florida, \nLouisiana, and North Carolina, used them to make fraudulent health care \nclaims, and bilked Medicare out of more than $50 million. In 2010, he \nwas sentenced to 22 years in prison. He is one in a long line of \nfraudsters who have hidden behind U.S. corporations to defraud Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  Tax evasion is another type of misconduct which all too often \ninvolves the use of U.S. corporations with hidden owners. One \nSubcommittee investigation showed, for example, how Kurt Greaves, a \nMichigan businessman, worked with Terry Neal, an offshore promoter, to \nform shell corporations in Nevada, Canada, and offshore secrecy \njurisdictions, to hide more than $400,000 in untaxed business income. \nBoth Mr. Greaves and Mr. Neal later pled guilty to federal tax evasion. \nThe Subcommittee also showed how two brothers from Texas, Sam and \nCharles Wyly, created a network of 58 trusts and shell corporations to \ndodge the payment of U.S. taxes, including using a set of Nevada \ncorporations to move offshore over $190 million in stock options \nwithout paying taxes on that compensation.\n  Still another area of abuse involves corrupt foreign officials using \nU.S. corporations to hide and spend their illicit funds. One example \ninvolves Teodoro Obiang, who is the son of the President of Equatorial \nGuinea, holds office in that country, and has purchased luxury homes, \ncars, and even a personal jet here in the United States. A Subcommittee \ninvestigation disclosed that, as part of his actions, Mr. Obiang used \nU.S. lawyers to form several California shell corporations with names \nlike Beautiful Vision, Unlimited Horizon, and Sweet Pink to open bank \naccounts in the names of those corporations, move millions of dollars \nin suspect funds into the United States, and use those funds to support \nan affluent lifestyle. The Department of Justice has since filed suit \nto seize his U.S. property, alleging that Mr. Obiang acquired it \nthrough corruption and money laundering.\n  One last example involves 800 U.S. corporations whose hidden owners \nhave stumped U.S. law enforcement trying to investigate their suspect \nconduct. In October 2004, the Homeland Security Department's division \nof Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE identified a single Utah \ncorporation that had engaged in $150 million in suspicious \ntransactions. ICE found that the corporation had been formed in Utah \nand was owned by two Panamanian entities which, in turn, were owned by \na group of Panamanian holding corporations, all located at the same \nPanama City office. By 2005, ICE had located 800 U.S. corporations in \nnearly all 50 states associated with the same shadowy group in Panama, \nbut was unable to obtain the name of a single natural person who owned \nany one of the corporations. ICE had learned that the 800 corporations \nwere associated with multiple U.S. investigations into tax fraud and \nother wrongdoing, but no one had been able to find the corporate \nowners. The trail went cold, and ICE closed the case. Yet it may be \nthat many of those U.S. corporations are still enaged in wrongdoing.\n  These examples of U.S. corporations with hidden owners facilitating \nterrorism, financial crime, health care fraud, tax evasion, corruption, \nand other misconduct provide ample evidence of the need for legislation \nto find out who is behind the mayhem. That's\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\nwhy law enforcement officials are among the bill's strongest \nsupporters.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association or FLEOA, which \nrepresents more than 26,000 Federal law enforcement officers, has \nexplained its strong support for the bill as follows:\n\n       Suspected terrorists, drug trafficking organizations and \n     other criminal enterprises continue to exploit the anonymity \n     afforded to them through the current corporate filing process \n     in a few states. Hiding behind a registered agent, these \n     criminals are able to incorporate without disclosing who the \n     beneficial owners are for their company(s). This enables them \n     to establish corporate flow-through entities, otherwise known \n     as shell companies,' to facilitate money laundering and \n     narcoterrorist financing.\n       Even through the due process of proper service of a court \n     order, law enforcement officers are unable to determine who \n     the beneficial owners are of these entities. This has to \n     stop. While we fully recognize and respect the privacy \n     concerns of law abiding citizens, we need to install a \n     baseline of checks and balances to deter the criminal \n     exploitation of our corporate filing process.\n\n  The Fraternal Order of Police, which has 330,000 members across the \ncountry, offers a similar explanation for its support of the bill:\n\n       For years corporations have been used as front \n     organizations by criminals conducting illegal activity such \n     as money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion. . . . This bill \n     is critical to our work because, all too often, \n     investigations are stymied when we encounter a company with \n     hidden ownership. . . . [T]he sharing of beneficial ownership \n     information with law enforcement will greatly assist our \n     investigations. When we are able to expose the link between \n     shell companies and drug trafficking, corruption, organized \n     crime and terrorist finance, the law enforcement community is \n     better able to keep America safe from these illegal \n     activities and keep the proceeds of these crimes out of the \n     U.S. financial system.\n\n  The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, which \nrepresents more than 1,500 federal prosecutors, has urged Congress to \ntake legislative action to strengthen inadequate state incorporation \npractices: ``[M]indful of the ease with which criminals establish \n`front organizations' to assist in money laundering, terrorist \nfinancing, tax evasion and other misconduct, it is shocking and \nunacceptable that many State laws permit the creation of corporations \nwithout asking for the identity of the corporation's beneficial owners. \nThe legislation will guard against that and no longer permit criminals \nto exploit the lack of transparency in the registration of \ncorporations.''\n  Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. has publicly urged \nCongress to enact this bill. He wrote: ``I have spoken with many \ncolleagues in the law enforcement community, and every one of us \nsupports the bill as a simple and common sense movement to help prevent \nwhite collar crime. . . . Because there is no national standard \nrequiring disclosure of beneficial ownership, criminals can set up U.S. \ncorporations anonymously and use them as fronts for all kinds of \nillicit activity without having to identify who actually controls and \nprofits from the activity. In a simple stroke, the proposed bill would \neliminate this needless barrier to the detection and prosecution of \nfinancial crimes.''\n  Some members of the U.S. financial industry with obligations under \nU.S. anti-money laundering laws to know their customers, including when \ndoing business with a shell corporation, support the legislation \nbecause it will help them know who is behind U.S. corporations seeking \nto open accounts with them. The National Money Transmitters \nAssociation, NMTA, for example, which represents state-licensed money \ntransmitters, has written in support of the bill, explaining: ``The \nNMTA urges you to give us the KYC, know-your-customer, tools we need to \ndo our job efficiently and make sure that our nation's standards are \nbrought up to a level equal to that of other advanced countries.''\n  We need legislation not only to stop the abuses being committed by \nU.S. corporations with hidden owners, but also to meet our \ninternational commitments. In 2006, the leading international anti-\nmoney laundering body in the world, the Financial Action Task Force on \nMoney Laundering--known as FATF--issued a report criticizing the United \nStates for its failure to comply with a FATF standard requiring \ncountries to obtain beneficial ownership information for the \ncorporations formed under their laws. This standard is one of 40 FATF \nstandards that this country has publicly committed itself to \nimplementing as part of its efforts to promote strong anti-money \nlaundering laws around the world.\n  FATF gave the United States two years, until 2008, to make progress \ntoward complying with the FATF standard on beneficial ownership \ninformation. But that deadline passed five years ago, with no real \nprogress. Enacting the bill we are introducing today would help bring \nthe United States into compliance with the FATF standard by requiring \nthe States to obtain beneficial ownership information for the \ncorporations formed under their laws. It would help ensure that the \nUnited States meets its international anti-money laundering \ncommitments.\n  Combating the misuse of corporations with hidden owners has \nincreasingly become a global priority. In a letter to President Obama \nearlier this year, prominent prosecutors and corruption hunters from \nacross the globe urged the United States to collect company beneficial \nownership information to fight wrongdoing. According to the letter: \n``Grand corruption would not be possible without the help of the global \nfinancing system--in particular, banks that accept corrupt assets and \nsecrecy rules that allow money launderers to disguise their activity. . \n. . We believe that part of the solution is for governments to require \nexisting company registers to collect information on the ultimate \nowners of companies.''\n  As I mentioned earlier, countries around the world have begun to take \naction to tackle the problem. Just last month, during the G8 summit in \nNorthern Ireland, leaders announced their commitment to ending the \npractice of establishing anonymous shell companies and declared: \n``Companies should know who really owns them and tax collectors and law \nenforcers should be able to obtain this information easily.'' To \nimplement that principle, the G8 leaders pledged to publish national \nAction Plans outlining the concrete steps each country will take to \nensure that law enforcement and tax authorities have ready access to \ninformation on who owns and controls the companies formed under their \nlaws.\n  In announcing the U.S. Action Plan, the White House expressed its \ncommitment to ensuring that law enforcement and tax authorities have \naccess to ownership information for companies formed within U.S. \nborders. The Plan explicitly calls for enactment of legislation that \nmeets certain principles, all of which are met by the bill introduced \ntoday. Those principles are the following:\n  ``Requirements for covered legal entities to disclose beneficial \nownership to states or regulated corporate formation agents at the time \nof company formation.\n  ``Requirements for verification of the identity of the beneficial \nowner.\n  ``Options for covering legal entities depending on whether the \napplicant forms the legal entity directly or uses a regulated company \nformation agent.\n  ``Requirements for law enforcement authorities, including tax \nauthorities, to be able to access beneficial ownership information upon \nappropriate request through a central registry at the state level.\n  ``An extension of anti-money laundering obligations to company \nformation agents, including an obligation to identify and verify \nbeneficial ownership information.\n  ``A mandate that entities provide updated information when changes of \nbeneficial ownership occur within 60 days; and\n  ``The imposition of civil and criminal penalties for knowingly \nproviding false information.''\n  The White House and the international community have made the \ncollection of beneficial ownership information for corporations a \nglobal priority this year. It is time for Congress to step up to the \nplate and take the necessary action.\n  The bill introduced today is the product of years of work by the \nSenate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. Over \ntwelve years ago, in 2000, the Government Accountability Office, at my \nrequest, conducted an investigation and released a report entitled, \n``Suspicious Banking\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\nActivities: Possible Money Laundering by U.S. Corporations Formed for \nRussian Entities.'' That report revealed that one person was able to \nset up more than 2,000 Delaware shell corporations and, without \ndisclosing the identity of any of the beneficial owners, open U.S. bank \naccounts for those corporations, which then collectively moved about \n$1.4 billion through the accounts. It is one of the earliest government \nreports to give some sense of the law enforcement problems caused by \nU.S. corporations with hidden owners. The alarm it sounded years ago is \nstill ringing.\n  In April 2006, in response to a second Subcommittee request, GAO \nreleased a report entitled, ``Corporation Formations: Minimal Ownership \nInformation Is Collected and Available,'' which reviewed the corporate \nformation laws in all 50 States. GAO disclosed that the vast majority \nof the States do not collect any information at all on the beneficial \nowners of the corporations and limited liability companies, or LLCs, \nformed under their laws. The report also found that several States had \nestablished automated procedures that allow a person to form a new \ncorporation or LLC in the State within 24 hours of filing an online \napplication without any prior review of that application by State \npersonnel. In exchange for a substantial fee, at least two States will \nform a corporation or LLC within one hour of a request. After examining \nthese State incorporation practices, the GAO report described the \nproblems that the lack of beneficial ownership information caused for a \nrange of law enforcement investigations.\n  In November 2006, our Subcommittee held a hearing on the problem. At \nthat hearing, representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice, the \nInternal Revenue Service, and the Department of Treasury's Financial \nCrimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN testified that the failure of \nStates to collect adequate information on the beneficial owners of the \nlegal entities they form had impeded federal efforts to investigate and \nprosecute criminal acts such as terrorism, money laundering, securities \nfraud, and tax evasion. At the hearing, the Justice Department \ntestified: ``We had allegations of corrupt foreign officials using \nthese [U.S.] shell accounts to launder money, but were unable--due to \nlack of identifying information in the corporate records--to fully \ninvestigate this area.'' The IRS testified: ``Within our own borders, \nthe laws of some states regarding the formation of legal entities have \nsignificant transparency gaps which may even rival the secrecy afforded \nin the most attractive tax havens.'' As part of its testimony, FinCEN \ndescribed identifying 768 incidents of suspicious international wire \ntransfer activity involving U.S. shell corporations.\n  The next year, in 2007, in a ``Dirty Dozen'' list of tax scams active \nthat year, the IRS highlighted shell corporations with hidden owners as \nnumber four on the list. It wrote:\n\n       4. Disguised Corporate Ownership: Domestic shell \n     corporations and other entities are being formed and operated \n     in certain states for the purpose of disguising the ownership \n     of the business or financial activity. Once formed, these \n     anonymous entities can be, and are being, used to facilitate \n     underreporting of income, non-filing of tax returns, listed \n     transactions, money laundering, financial crimes and possibly \n     terrorist financing. The IRS is working with state \n     authorities to identify these entities and to bring their \n     owners into compliance.\n\n  In 2008, we first introduced our bipartisan legislation to stop the \nformation of U.S. corporations with hidden owners. It was a Levin-\nColeman-Obama bill, S. 2956, back then. When asked about the bill in \n2008, then DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote: ``In countless \ninvestigations, where the criminal targets utilize shell corporations, \nthe lack of law enforcement's ability to gain access to true beneficial \nownership information slows, confuses or impedes the efforts by \ninvestigators to follow criminal proceeds.''\n  In 2009, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held two hearings which examined not only the problem, but \nalso possible solutions, including our revised bill, S. 569. At the \nfirst hearing entitled, ``Examining State Business Incorporation \nPractices: A Discussion of the Incorporation Transparency and Law \nEnforcement Assistance Act,'' held in June 2009, DHS testified that \n``shell corporations established in the United States have been \nutilized to commit crimes against individuals around the world.'' The \nManhattan District Attorney's office testified: ``For those of us in \nlaw enforcement, these issues with shell corporations are not some \nabstract idea. This is what we do and deal with every day. We see these \nshell corporations being used by criminal organizations, and the record \nis replete with examples of their use for money laundering, for their \nuse in tax evasion, and for their use in securities fraud.''\n  At the second hearing, ``Business Formation and Financial Crime: \nFinding a Legislative Solution,'' held in November 2009, the Justice \nDepartment again testified about criminals using U.S. shell \ncorporations. It noted that ``each of these examples involves the \nrelatively rare instance in which law enforcement was able to identify \nthe perpetrator misusing U.S. shell corporations. Far too often, we are \nunable to do so.'' The Treasury Department testified that ``the ability \nof illicit actors to form corporations in the United States without \ndisclosing their true identity presents a serious vulnerability and \nthere is ample evidence that criminal organizations and others who \nthreaten our national security exploit this vulnerability.''\n  The 2009 hearings also presented evidence of dozens of Internet \nwebsites advertising corporate formation services that highlighted the \nability of corporations to be formed in the United States without \nasking for the identity of the beneficial owners. Those websites \nexplicitly pointed to anonymous ownership as a reason to incorporate \nwithin the United States, and often listed certain States alongside \nnotorious offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations in which to \nform new corporations, essentially providing an open invitation for \nwrongdoers to form entities within the United States.\n  One website, for example, set up by an international incorporation \nfirm, advocated setting up corporations in Delaware by saying: \n``DELAWARE--An Offshore Tax Haven for Non US Residents.'' It cited as \none of Delaware's advantages that: ``Owners' names are not disclosed to \nthe state.'' Another website, from a U.K. firm called \n``formacorporation-offshore.com,'' listed the advantages to \nincorporating in Nevada. Those advantages included: ``Stockholders are \nnot on Public Record allowing complete anonymity.''\n  During the 2009 hearings, I presented evidence of how one Wyoming \noutfit was selling so-called shelf corporations--corporations formed \nand then left ``on the shelf'' for later sale to purchasers who could \nthen pretend the corporations had been in operation for years. A June \n2011 Reuters news article wrote a detailed expose of how that same \noutfit, Wyoming Corporate Services, had formed thousands of U.S. \ncorporations all across the country, all with hidden owners. The \narticle quoted the website as follows: ``A corporation is a legal \nperson created by state statute that can be used as a fall guy, a \nservant, a good friend or a decoy. A person you control . . . yet \ncannot be held accountable for its actions. Imagine the \npossibilities!''\n  The article described a small house in Cheyenne, Wyoming, which \nWyoming Corporate Services used to provide a U.S. address for more than \n2,000 corporations that it had helped to form. The article described \n``the walls of the main room'' as ``covered floor to ceiling with \nnumbered mailboxes labeled as corporate suites.'' The article reported \nthat among the corporations using the address was a shell corporation \ncontrolled by a former Ukranian prime minister who had been convicted \nof money laundering and extortion; a corporation indicted for helping \nonline-poker operators evade a U.S. ban on Internet gambling; and two \ncorporations barred from U.S. federal contracting for selling \ncounterfeit truck parts to the Pentagon. The article observed that \nWyoming Corporate Services continued to sell shelf corporations that \nexisted solely on paper but could show a history of regulatory and tax \nfilings, despite having had no real U.S. operations. That's the type of \ndeceptive conduct going on right now, here in our own backyard, with \nrespect to U.S. corporations with hidden owners.\n  Despite the evidence of U.S. corporations being misused by organized\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\ncrime, terrorists, tax evaders, and other wrongdoers, and despite years \nof law enforcement complaints, many of our States are reluctant to \nadmit there is a problem in establishing U.S. corporations and LLCs \nwith hidden owners. Too many of our States are eager to explain how \nquick and easy it is to set up corporations within their borders, \nwithout acknowledging that those same quick and easy procedures enable \nwrongdoers to utilize U.S. corporations in a variety of crimes and tax \ndodges both here and abroad.\n  Beginning in 2006, the Subcommittee worked with the States to \nencourage them to recognize the law enforcement and national security \nproblem they'd created and to come up with their own solution. After \nthe Subcommittee's 2006 hearing on this issue, for example, the \nNational Association of Secretaries of State or NASS convened a 2007 \ntask force to examine state incorporation practices. At the request of \nNASS and several States, I delayed introducing legislation while they \nworked on a proposal to require the collection of beneficial ownership \ninformation. My Subcommittee staff participated in multiple \nconferences, telephone calls, and meetings on the issue.\n  In July 2007, the NASS task force issued a proposal. Rather than cure \nthe problem, however, the proposal had multiple serious deficiencies, \nleading the Treasury Department to state in a letter that the NASS \nproposal ``falls short'' and ``does not fully address the problem of \nlegal entities masking the identity of criminals.''\n  Among other shortcomings, the NASS proposal would not require States \nto obtain the names of the natural individuals who would be the \nbeneficial owners of a U.S. corporation or LLC. Instead, it would allow \nStates to obtain a list of a corporation's ``owners of record'' who can \nbe, and often are, offshore corporations or trusts with their own \nhidden owners. The NASS proposal also did not require the States to \nmaintain the beneficial ownership information, or to supply it to law \nenforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons. Instead, law \nenforcement would have to get the information from the suspect \ncorporation or one of its agents, thereby tipping off the corporation \nto the investigation. The proposal also failed to require the \nbeneficial ownership information to be updated over time. These and \nother flaws in the proposal were identified by the Treasury Department, \nthe Department of Justice, and others, but NASS continued on the same \ncourse.\n  NASS enlisted the help of the National Conference of Commissioners on \nUniform State Laws or NCCUSL, which produced a proposed model law for \nStates that wanted to adopt the NASS approach. NCCUSL presented its \nproposal at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's \nJune 2009 hearing, where it was subjected to significant criticism. The \nManhattan District Attorney's office, for example, testified: ``I say \nwithout hesitation or reservation--that from a law enforcement \nperspective, the bill proposed by NCCUSL would be worse than no bill at \nall. And there are two very basic reasons for this. It eliminates the \nability of law enforcement to get corporate information without \nalerting the target of the investigation that the investigation is \nongoing. That is the primary reason. It also sets up a system that is \ntime-consuming and complicated.''\n  The Department of Justice testified: ``Senator, I would submit to you \nthat in a criminal organization everyone knows who is in control and \nthis will not be an issue of determining who is in control. What we are \nconcerned about here from the law enforcement perspective are the \ncriminals and the criminal organizations and so what we are asking is \nthat when criminals use shell companies, they provide the name of the \nbeneficial owner. That is the person who is in control, the criminal in \ncontrol, as opposed to the NCCUSL proposal where they are suggesting \nthat instead two nominees are provided--two nominees between law \nenforcement and the criminal in control.''\n  Despite these criticisms, NCCUSL finalized its model law in July \n2009, issuing it under the title, ``Uniform Law Enforcement Access to \nEntity Information Act.'' At the November 2009 hearing, law enforcement \nagain criticized the NCCUSL model for failing to provide the names of \nthe true owners of the corporations being formed. The Justice \nDepartment testified: ``To allow companies to provide anything less \nthan the beneficial owner information merely provides criminals with an \nopportunity to evade responsibility and put nominees between themselves \nand the true perpetrator.'' With regard to NCCUSL's proposal, Treasury \ntestified: ``[T]here is not an obligation for that live person to not \nbe a nominee. And what I think is important in the legislation is that \nwe get at the true beneficial owner and not someone who may be a \nnominee.''\n  In addition to its flaws, the NCCUSL model law has proven unpopular \nwith the States for whom it was written. Despite the effort and fanfare \nattached to the uniform model, after four years of sitting on the \nbooks, not a single State has adopted it or given any indication of \ndoing so.\n  It is deeply disappointing that the States, despite the passage of \nmany years, have been unable to devise an effective proposal to stop \nthe formation of corporations with hidden owners. One key difficulty is \nthat the States are competing against each other to attract persons who \nwant to set up U.S. corporations. That competition creates pressure for \neach individual State to favor procedures that allow quick and easy \nincorporations, with no questions asked. It's a classic case of \ncompetition causing a race to the bottom, making it difficult for any \none State to do the right thing and ask for the identity of the persons \nbehind the corporations being formed.\n  That is why Federal legislation in this area is critical. Federal \nlegislation is needed to level the playing field among the States, set \nminimum standards for obtaining beneficial ownership information, put \nan end to the practice of States forming millions of legal entities \neach year without knowing who is behind them, and bring the United \nStates into compliance with its international commitments.\n  The bill's provisions would require the States to ask incorporation \napplicants for a list of the beneficial owners of each corporation or \nLLC formed under their laws, to maintain this information for a period \nof years after a corporation is terminated, and to provide the \ninformation to law enforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons. \nThe bill would also require corporations and LLCs to update their \nbeneficial ownership information on a regular basis. The ownership \ninformation would be kept by the State or, if a State maintains a \nformation agent licensing system and delegates this task, by a State's \nlicensed formation agents.\n  The particular information that would have to be provided for each \nbeneficial owner is the owner's name, address, and a unique identifying \nnumber from a State driver's license or a U.S. passport. The bill would \nnot require States to verify this information, but penalties would \napply to persons who submit false information.\n  In the case of U.S. corporations formed by individuals who do not \npossess a driver's license or passport from the United States, the bill \nwould permit them to submit their names, addresses, and identifying \ninformation from a non-U.S. passport to a formation agent residing \nwithin the State. They would have to include a copy of a passport \nphotograph. The incorporation application would have to include a \nwritten certification that the formation agent had obtained the \ninformation and verified the identity of the non-U.S. corporate owners. \nThe formation agent would have to retain the information in the State \nfor a specified period of time and produce it upon receipt of a \nsubpoena or summons from law enforcement.\n  To ensure that its provisions are tightly targeted, the bill would \nexempt a wide range of corporations from the disclosure obligation. It \nwould exempt, for example, virtually all highly regulated corporations, \nbecause we already know who owns them. That includes all publicly-\ntraded corporations, banks, broker-dealers, commodity brokers, \nregistered investment funds, registered accounting firms, insurers, and \nutilities. The bill would also exempt corporations with a substantial \nU.S. presence, including at least 20 employees physically located in \nthe United States, since those individuals could provide law \nenforcement with the leads needed to trace a corporation's true\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\nowners. In addition, the bill would exempt businesses set up by \ngovernments, churches, charities, and nonprofit corporations, since \ndisclosure of their beneficial ownership information would not advance \nthe public interest or assist law enforcement. These exemptions \ndramatically reduce the number of corporations who would actually have \nto file beneficial ownership information on state incorporation forms \nin order to ensure that the bill's disclosure obligations focus only on \nowners whose identities are currently hidden.\n  The bill does not take a position on the issue of whether the States \nshould make beneficial ownership information available to the public. \nInstead, the bill leaves it entirely up to the States to decide \nwhether, under what circumstances, and to what extent to make \nbeneficial ownership information available to the public. The bill \nexplicitly permits the States to place restrictions on providing \nbeneficial ownership information to persons other than government \nofficials. The bill focuses instead on ensuring that law enforcement \nwith a subpoena or summons is given ready access to the beneficial \nownership information.\n  Relative to the costs of compliance, the bill provides States with \naccess to two separate funding sources, neither of which involves \nappropriated funds. For the first three years after the bill's \nenactment, the bill requires both the Justice and Treasury Departments \nto make funds available from their individual forfeiture programs to \nStates incurring reasonable expenses to comply with the Act. These \nforfeiture funds do not contain taxpayer dollars; instead they contain \nthe proceeds of forfeiture actions taken against persons involved in \nmoney laundering, drug trafficking, or other wrongdoing. The bill would \ndirect a total of $40 million over 3 years to be provided to the States \nfrom the two funds to carry out the Act. These provisions would ensure \nthat States have adequate funds for the modest compliance costs \ninvolved with adding a new question to their incorporation forms \nrequesting the names of the covered corporations' beneficial owners.\n  The compliance costs would be modest, because the bill does not \nrequire any State to change its laws, set up new forms, create new \ndatabases of information, or verify the information provided. To the \ncontrary, the only steps that a State would need to take would be to \nadd one question to its existing incorporation form asking for the \ncorporation's beneficial owners, keep that incorporation application on \nfile which all States do already, and make the ownership information \navailable to law enforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons.\n  It is common for bills establishing minimum Federal standards to seek \nto ensure State action by making some Federal funding dependent upon a \nState's meeting the specified standards. Our bill, however, states \nexplicitly that nothing in its provisions authorizes the withholding of \nfederal funds from a State for failing to modify its incorporation \npractices to meet the beneficial ownership information requirements of \nthe act. Instead, the bill calls for a GAO report within 5 years of \nenactment to identify any States that had failed to strengthen their \nincorporation practices as required by the act. After getting this \nstatus report, a future Congress can decide what steps to take in the \nevent there are any noncompliant States.\n  The bill also contains a provision that would require corporations \nbidding on federal contracts to provide the same beneficial ownership \ninformation to the federal government as provided to the relevant \nState. The Subcommittee has become aware of instances in which the \nfederal government has found itself doing business with U.S. \ncorporations whose owners are hidden, including owners under \ninvestigation for suspect conduct. It is important that when the \nfederal government contracts to do business with someone, it knows who \nit is dealing with.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Treasury Department to issue a \nrule requiring U.S. formation agents to establish anti-money laundering \nprograms to ensure they are not forming U.S. corporations or LLCs for \nwrongdoers. The bill requires the programs to be risk based so that \nformation agents can target their preventative efforts toward persons \nwho pose a high risk of being involved with wrongdoing. GAO would also \nbe asked to conduct a study of existing State formation procedures for \npartnerships, trusts, and charitable organizations to see if additional \nownership disclosure requirements are warranted.\n  We have worked with the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and \nHomeland Security to craft a bill that would address, in a fair and \nreasonable way, the significant law enforcement problems created by \nStates allowing the formation of millions of U.S. corporations and LLCs \nwith hidden owners. When those corporations commit crimes, they affect \nnot only interstate commerce with U.S. victims, but also our \nrelationships with other countries whose citizens may become victims of \nU.S. corporate wrongdoing. What the bill comes down to is a simple \nrequirement that States strengthen their incorporation applications to \nadd a single question requesting identifying information for the true \nowners of the corporations they form. That is not too much to ask to \nprotect this country and the international community from wrongdoers \nmisusing U.S. corporations.\n  For those who say that, if the United States tightens its \nincorporation rules, new corporations will be formed elsewhere, it is \nappropriate to ask exactly where they will go. A recent report found \nthat virtually every other country is already tougher than the United \nStates in terms of demanding and verifying beneficial ownership \ninformation. Most offshore tax havens, for example, already require \nthis information to be collected, including the Bahamas, Cayman \nIslands, and the Channel Islands. Countries around the world already \nrequest beneficial ownership information, in part because of their \ncommitment to FATF's international anti-money laundering standards. Our \n50 States should be meeting the same standards, but there is no \nindication that they will, unless required to do so.\n  I wish Federal legislation weren't necessary. I wish the States could \nsolve this law enforcement problem on their own, but ongoing \ncompetitive pressures make it unlikely that the States will do the \nright thing. It's been nearly seven years since our 2006 hearing on \nthis issue and more than four years since the States came up with a \nmodel law on the subject, with no progress to speak of, despite \nrepeated pleas from law enforcement.\n  Federal legislation is necessary to reduce the vulnerability of the \nUnited States to wrongdoing by U.S. corporations with hidden owners, to \nprotect interstate and international commerce from criminals misusing \nU.S. corporations, to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to \ninvestigate suspect U.S. corporations, to level the playing field among \nthe States, and to bring the United States into compliance with its \ninternational anti-money laundering obligations.\n  There is also an issue of consistency. For years, I have been \nfighting offshore corporate secrecy laws and practices that enable \nwrongdoers to secretly control offshore corporations involved in money \nlaundering, tax evasion, and other misconduct. I have pointed out on \nmore than one occasion that corporations were not created to hide \nownership, but to protect owners from personal liability for corporate \nacts. Unfortunately, today, the corporate form has too often been \ncorrupted into serving those who wish to conceal their identities. It \nis past time to stop this misuse of the corporate form. But if we want \nto stop inappropriate corporate secrecy offshore, we need to stop it \nhere at home as well.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation and putting an end to incorporation practices that promote \ncorporate secrecy and render the United States and other countries \nvulnerable to abuse by U.S. corporations with hidden owners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n SUMMARY OF INCORPORATION TRANSPARENCY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE \n                                  ACT\n\n       To protect the United States from U.S. corporations being \n     misused to support terrorism, money laundering, tax evasion, \n     and other misconduct, the Levin-Grassley-Feinstein-Harkin \n     Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act \n     would:\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\n       Beneficial Ownership Information.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act with \nrespect to the guidelines for specification of certain disposal sites \nfor dredged or fill material; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today, my colleague Senator Mark Warner and \nI are introducing the Commonsense Permitting for Job Creation Act of \n2013, a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation to address an aspect \nof water permitting law that has touched several economic development \nprojects.\n  In my home State of Virginia, there is a county that has been working \non securing a permit for the proposed site of a business center, where \none or multiple firms could establish job-creating manufacturing \nplants. This area--Henry County, on the North Carolina border, has seen \nprofound economic challenges in recent years. The county's 5-year \naverage unemployment rate is 11 percent. In the county's largest city, \nMartinsville, the 5-year average unemployment rate is over 17 percent. \nThis part of Virginia would benefit greatly from the jobs this site \ncould bring.\n  Henry County has worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on site \npreparation. However, the Corps has been reluctant to issue the permit \nbecause no company has yet committed to the site and prepared detailed \nblueprints. The problem is that a company will not relocate to the site \nwithout an approved permit, but a permit cannot be approved without a \ncompany willing to relocate.\n  Henry County, the Martinsville-Henry Co. Economic Development Corp., \nand the Commonwealth of Virginia have together devoted more than $16 \nmillion to this project. They have worked in good faith, at great cost \nin money and personnel hours, to promote economic development in line \nwith environmental protection and all requirements of the law. Yet due \nto this regulatory ambiguity, this process is unable to move forward.\n  Our legislation clarifies that ambiguity. It specifies that the lack \nof a committed end-user shall not be a reason to deny a Corps permit \nthat meets all other legal requirements. I believe this bill will allow \nthe site in Henry County, and similar sites elsewhere, to move forward, \nwhile maintaining all environmental protections.\n  Senator Warner and I have introduced this legislation in partnership \nwith our friends and Virginia colleagues in the House, U.S. \nRepresentatives Robert Hurt and Morgan Griffith. We believe this will \nexpedite the approval of important economic development projects, and \nwe are proud to be able to work across the aisle and with state and \nlocal officials on this commonsense, bipartisan solution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal):\n  S. 1476. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe denial of deduction for certain excessive employee remuneration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator \nBlumenthal, the Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses \nAct. This bill closes a loophole that allows publicly traded \ncorporations to deduct an executive's pay over $1 million from their \ntax bill.\n  Under current tax law, when a public corporation calculates its \ntaxable income, generally it is permitted to deduct the cost of \ncompensation from its revenues, with limits up to $1 million for some \nof the firm's most senior executives. However, a loophole has allowed \nmany public corporations to avoid such limits and freely deduct \nexcessive executive compensation. For example, because of this \nloophole, if a CEO receives $15 million in compensation in a given \nyear, that amount can cause the corporation's taxable income to decline \nby $15 million. With the current corporate tax rate at 35 percent, the \ncorporation in this case would pay less tax to the U.S. Treasury, up to \n35 percent of $15 million, leaving the corporation's shareholders to \nbear only $9.75 million of the $15 million cost of executive pay, while \nU.S. taxpayers foot the remaining $5.25 million.\n  The Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act would \nallow a public corporation to deduct compensation up to only $1 \nmillion. Using the same example, this would mean that corporate \nshareholders would bear $14.65 million of the $15 million in \ncompensation.\n  Over a ten-year window, the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated \nthis legislation would close a loophole that costs U.S. taxpayers over \n$50 billion by making some simple changes to existing law.\n  First, our legislation extends section 162(m) of the tax code to all \nemployees of publicly traded corporations so that all compensation is \nsubject to a deductibility cap of $1 million. Publicly traded \ncorporations would still be permitted to pay their executives as much \nas they want, but compensation above and beyond $1 million would no \nlonger be bankrolled, in part, through our tax code.\n  Second, our bill removes the exemption for performance-based \ncompensation, which currently permits compensation deductions above and \nbeyond $1 million when executives have met performance benchmarks set \nby the corporation's Board of Directors. As a result, publicly traded \ncorporations would still be able to incentivize their executives, but \nall such incentives would be subject to a corporate deductibility cap \nof $1 million.\n  Finally, our legislation makes a technical correction to ensure that \nall publicly traded corporations that are required to provide quarterly \nand annual reports to their investors under Securities and Exchange \nCommission rules and regulations are subject to section 162(m). \nCurrently, this section of the tax code only covers some publicly \ntraded corporations who are required to provide these periodic reports \nto their shareholders. Discouraging unrestrained compensation packages \nshouldn't hinge on whether a publicly traded corporation falls into one \nSEC reporting requirement or another, and my bill closes this technical \nloophole.\n  With this legislation, we aim to put an end to some of the \nextravagant tax breaks that exclusively benefit public corporations. \nThis is simply a matter of fairness at a time of fiscal belt \ntightening, when so many of our constituents have already sacrificed.\n  I want to thank Senator Blumenthal and his staff for working with me \non this issue, and I urge our colleagues to\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\njoin us by cosponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/08/01/senate-section/article/S6236-1", "month": "08", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          SENATE RESOLUTION 212--COMMENDING DAVID J.

USE OF ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN \n                   FEDERAL BUILDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Private sector funding and expertise can help address \n     the energy efficiency challenges facing the United States.\n       (2) The Federal Government spends more than $6 billion \n     annually in energy costs.\n       (3) Reducing Federal energy costs can help save money, \n     create jobs, and reduce waste.\n       (4) Energy savings performance contracts and utility energy \n     savings contracts are tools for utilizing private sector \n     investment to upgrade Federal facilities without any up-front \n     cost to the taxpayer.\n       (5) Performance contracting is a way to retrofit Federal \n     buildings using private sector investment in the absence of \n     appropriated dollars. Retrofits seek to reduce energy use, \n     improve infrastructure, protect national security, and cut \n     facility operations and maintenance costs.\n       (b) Implementation of Identified Energy and Water \n     Efficiency Measures.--Section 543(f)(4) of the National \n     Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(4)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(4) Implementation of identified energy and water \n     efficiency measures.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the \n     completion of each evaluation under paragraph (3), each \n     energy manager shall consider--\n       ``(i) implementing any energy- or water-saving or \n     conservation measure that the Federal agency identified in \n     the evaluation conducted under paragraph (3) that is life \n     cycle cost-effective; and\n       ``(ii) bundling individual measures of varying paybacks \n     together into combined projects.\n       ``(B) Measures not implemented.--The energy manager, as \n     part of the certification system under paragraph (7) and \n     using guidelines developed by the Secretary, shall provide \n     reasons for not implementing any life cycle cost-effective \n     measures under subparagraph (A).''.\n       (c) Annual Contracting Goal.--Section 543(f)(10)(C) of the \n     National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. \n     8253(f)(10)(C)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Each Federal agency'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(i) In general.--Each Federal agency''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new clauses:\n       ``(ii) Tracking.--Each Federal agency shall use the \n     benchmarking systems selected or developed for the agency \n     under paragraph (8) to track energy savings realized by the \n     agency through the implementation of energy- or water-saving \n     or conservation measures pursuant to paragraph (4), and shall \n     submit information regarding such savings to the Secretary to \n     be published on a public website of the Department of Energy.\n       ``(iii) Consideration.--Each Federal agency shall consider \n     using energy savings performance contracts or utility energy \n     service contracts to implement energy- or water-saving or \n     conservation measures pursuant to paragraph (4).\n       ``(iv) Contracting goal.--It shall be the goal of the \n     Federal Government, in the implementation of energy- or \n     water-saving or conservation measures pursuant to paragraph \n     (4), to enter into energy savings performance contracts or \n     utility energy service contracts equal to $1,000,000,000 in \n     each year during the 5-year period beginning on January 1, \n     2014.\n       ``(v) Report to congress.--Not later than September 30 of \n     each year during the 5-year period referred to in clause \n     (iv), each Federal agency shall submit to the Secretary \n     information regarding progress made by the agency towards \n     achieving the goal described in such clause. Not later than \n     60 days after each such September 30, the Secretary, acting \n     through the Federal Energy Management Program, shall submit \n     to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the Senate a report describing the progress made \n     by the Federal Government towards achieving such goal.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1841.

Mr. COONS (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Reed) submitted \nan amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 1392, to \npromote energy savings in residential buildings and industry, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n  Subtitle B--Weatherization Enhancement and Local Energy Efficiency \n                     Investment and Accountability\n\n     SEC. 411. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State energy program established under part D of \n     title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6321 et seq.) (referred to in this section as ``SEP'') \n     and the Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income \n     Persons established under part A of title IV of the Energy \n     Conservation and Production Act (42 U.S.C. 6861 et seq.) \n     (referred to in this section as ``WAP'') have proven to be \n     beneficial, long-term partnerships among Federal, State, and \n     local partners;\n       (2) the SEP and the WAP have been reauthorized on a \n     bipartisan basis over many years to address changing \n     national, regional, and State circumstances and needs, \n     especially through--\n       (A) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6201 \n     et seq.);\n       (B) the Energy Conservation and Production Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6801 et seq.);\n       (C) the State Energy Efficiency Programs Improvement Act of \n     1990 (Public Law 101-440; 104 Stat. 1006);\n       (D) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13201 et \n     seq.);\n       (E) the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 et \n     seq.); and\n       (F) the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 \n     U.S.C. 17001 et seq.);\n       (3) the SEP, also known as the ``State energy conservation \n     program''--\n       (A) was first created in 1975 to implement a State-based, \n     national program in support of energy efficiency, renewable \n     energy, economic development, energy emergency preparedness, \n     and energy policy; and\n       (B) has come to operate in every sector of the economy in \n     support of the private sector to improve productivity and has \n     dramatically reduced the cost of government through energy \n     savings at the State and local levels;\n       (4) Federal laboratory studies have concluded that, for \n     every Federal dollar invested through the SEP, more than $7 \n     is saved in energy costs and almost $11 in non-Federal funds \n     is leveraged;\n       (5) the WAP--\n       (A) was first created in 1976 to assist low-income families \n     in response to the first oil embargo;\n       (B) has become the largest residential energy conservation \n     program in the United States, with more than 7,100,000 homes \n     weatherized since the WAP was created;\n       (C) saves an estimated 35 percent of consumption in the \n     typical weatherized home, yielding average annual savings of \n     $437 per year in home energy costs;\n       (D) has created thousands of jobs in both the construction \n     sector and in the supply chain of materials suppliers, \n     vendors, and manufacturers who supply the WAP;\n       (E) returns $2.51 in energy savings for every Federal \n     dollar spent in energy and nonenergy benefits over the life \n     of weatherized homes;\n       (F) serves as a foundation for residential energy \n     efficiency retrofit standards, technical skills, and \n     workforce training for the emerging broader market and \n     reduces residential and power plant emissions of carbon \n     dioxide by 2.65 metric tons each year per home; and\n       (G) has decreased national energy consumption by the \n     equivalent of 24,100,000 barrels of oil annually;\n       (6) the WAP can be enhanced with the addition of a targeted \n     portion of the Federal funds through an innovative program \n     that supports projects performed by qualified nonprofit \n     organizations that have a demonstrated capacity to build, \n     renovate, repair, or improve the energy efficiency of a \n     significant number of low-income homes, building on the \n     success of the existing program without replacing the \n     existing WAP network or creating a separate delivery \n     mechanism for basic WAP services;\n       (7) the WAP has increased energy efficiency opportunities \n     by promoting new, competitive public-private sector models of \n     retrofitting low-income homes through new Federal \n     partnerships;\n       (8) improved monitoring and reporting of the work product \n     of the WAP has yielded benefits, and expanding independent \n     verification of efficiency work will support the long-term \n     goals of the WAP;\n       (9) reports of the Government Accountability Office in \n     2011, Inspector General's of the Department of Energy, and \n     State auditors have identified State-level deficiencies in \n     monitoring efforts that can be addressed in a manner that \n     will ensure that WAP funds are used more effectively;\n       (10) through the history of the WAP, the WAP has evolved \n     with improvements in efficiency technology, including, in the \n     1990s, many States adopting advanced home energy audits, \n     which has led to great returns on investment; and\n       (11) as the home energy efficiency industry has become more \n     performance-based, the WAP should continue to use those \n     advances in technology and the professional workforce.\n\n               PART I--WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 421. REAUTHORIZATION OF WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 422 of the Energy Conservation and Production Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6872) is amended by striking ``appropriated--'' \n     and all that follows through the period at the end and \n     inserting ``appropriated $450,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2014 through 2018.''.\n\n     SEC. 422.

Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Bennet) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 1392, to \npromote energy savings in residential buildings and industry, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4___. ENHANCED ENERGY EFFICIENCY UNDERWRITING.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Covered agency.--The term ``covered agency''--\n       (A) means--\n       (i) an executive agency, as that term is defined in section \n     102 of title 31, United States Code; and\n       (ii) any other agency of the Federal Government; and\n       (B) includes any enterprise, as that term is defined under \n     section 1303 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial \n     Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4502).\n       (2) Covered loan.--The term ``covered loan'' means a loan \n     secured by a home that is issued, insured, purchased, or \n     securitized by a covered agency.\n       (3) Homeowner.--The term ``homeowner'' means the mortgagor \n     under a covered loan.\n       (4) Mortgagee.--The term ``mortgagee'' means--\n       (A) an original lender under a covered loan or the holder \n     of a covered loan at the time at which that mortgage \n     transaction is consummated;\n       (B) any affiliate, agent, subsidiary, successor, or \n     assignee of an original lender under a covered loan or the \n     holder of a covered loan at the time at which that mortgage \n     transaction is consummated;\n       (C) any servicer of a covered loan; and\n       (D) any subsequent purchaser, trustee, or transferee of any \n     covered loan issued by an original lender.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Housing and Urban Development.\n       (6) Servicer.--The term ``servicer'' means the person or \n     entity responsible for the servicing of a covered loan, \n     including the person or entity who makes or holds a covered \n     loan if that person or entity also services the covered loan.\n       (7) Servicing.--The term ``servicing'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 6(i) of the Real Estate Settlement \n     Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2605(i)).\n       (b) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) energy costs for homeowners are a significant and \n     increasing portion of their household budgets;\n       (B) household energy use can vary substantially depending \n     on the efficiency and characteristics of the house;\n       (C) expected energy cost savings are important to the value \n     of the house;\n       (D) the current test for loan affordability used by most \n     covered agencies, commonly known as the ``debt-to-income'' \n     test, is inadequate because it does not take into account the \n     expected energy cost savings for the homeowner of an energy \n     efficient home; and\n       (E) another loan limitation, commonly known as the ``loan-\n     to-value'' test, is tied to the appraisal, which often does \n     not adjust for efficiency features of houses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (A) improve the accuracy of mortgage underwriting by \n     Federal mortgage agencies by ensuring that energy cost \n     savings are included in the underwriting process as described \n     below, and thus to reduce the amount of energy consumed by \n     homes and to facilitate the creation of energy efficiency \n     retrofit and construction jobs;\n       (B) require a covered agency to include the expected energy \n     cost savings of a homeowner as a regular expense in the \n     tests, such as the debt-to-income test, used to determine the \n     ability of the loan applicant to afford the cost of \n     homeownership for all loan programs; and\n       (C) require a covered agency to include the value home \n     buyers place on the energy efficiency of a house in tests \n     used to compare the mortgage amount to home value, taking \n     precautions to avoid double-counting and to support safe and \n     sound lending.\n       (c) Enhanced Energy Efficiency Underwriting Criteria.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, in consultation \n     with the advisory group established in subsection (f)(2), \n     develop and issue guidelines for a covered agency to \n     implement enhanced loan eligibility requirements, for use \n     when testing the ability of a loan applicant to repay a \n     covered loan, that account for the expected energy cost \n     savings for a loan applicant at a subject property, in the \n     manner set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3).\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\n       (2) Requirements to account for energy cost savings.--The \n     enhanced loan eligibility requirements under paragraph (1) \n     shall require that, for all covered loans for which an energy \n     efficiency report is voluntarily provided to the mortgagee by \n     the mortgagor, the covered agency and the mortgagee shall \n     take into consideration the estimated energy cost savings \n     expected for the owner of the subject property in determining \n     whether the loan applicant has sufficient income to service \n     the mortgage debt plus other regular expenses. To the extent \n     that a covered agency uses a test such as a debt-to-income \n     test that includes certain regular expenses, such as hazard \n     insurance and property taxes, the expected energy cost \n     savings shall be included as an offset to these expenses. \n     Energy costs to be assessed include the cost of electricity, \n     natural gas, oil, and any other fuel regularly used to supply \n     energy to the subject property.\n       (3) Determination of estimated energy cost savings.--\n       (A) In general.--The guidelines to be issued under \n     paragraph (1) shall include instructions for the covered \n     agency to calculate estimated energy cost savings using--\n       (i) the energy efficiency report;\n       (ii) an estimate of baseline average energy costs; and\n       (iii) additional sources of information as determined by \n     the Secretary.\n       (B) Report requirements.--For the purposes of subparagraph \n     (A), an energy efficiency report shall--\n       (i) estimate the expected energy cost savings specific to \n     the subject property, based on specific information about the \n     property;\n       (ii) be prepared in accordance with the guidelines to be \n     issued under paragraph (1); and\n       (iii) be prepared--\n\n       (I) in accordance with the Residential Energy Service \n     Network's Home Energy Rating System (commonly known as \n     ``HERS'') by an individual certified by the Residential \n     Energy Service Network, unless the Secretary finds that the \n     use of HERS does not further the purposes of this section; or\n       (II) by other methods approved by the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the advisory \n     group established in subsection (f)(2), for use under this \n     section, which shall include a third-party quality assurance \n     procedure.\n\n       (C) Use by appraiser.--If an energy efficiency report is \n     used under paragraph (2), the energy efficiency report shall \n     be provided to the appraiser to estimate the energy \n     efficiency of the subject property and for potential \n     adjustments for energy efficiency.\n       (4) Required disclosure to consumer for a home with an \n     energy efficiency report.--If an energy efficiency report is \n     used under paragraph (2), the guidelines to be issued under \n     paragraph (1) shall require the mortgagee to--\n       (A) inform the loan applicant of the expected energy costs \n     as estimated in the energy efficiency report, in a manner and \n     at a time as prescribed by the Secretary, and if practicable, \n     in the documents delivered at the time of loan application; \n     and\n       (B) include the energy efficiency report in the \n     documentation for the loan provided to the borrower.\n       (5) Required disclosure to consumer for a home without an \n     energy efficiency report.--If an energy efficiency report is \n     not used under paragraph (2), the guidelines to be issued \n     under paragraph (1) shall require the mortgagee to inform the \n     loan applicant in a manner and at a time as prescribed by the \n     Secretary, and if practicable, in the documents delivered at \n     the time of loan application of--\n       (A) typical energy cost savings that would be possible from \n     a cost-effective energy upgrade of a home of the size and in \n     the region of the subject property;\n       (B) the impact the typical energy cost savings would have \n     on monthly ownership costs of a typical home;\n       (C) the impact on the size of a mortgage that could be \n     obtained if the typical energy cost savings were reflected in \n     an energy efficiency report; and\n       (D) resources for improving the energy efficiency of a \n     home.\n       (6) Limitations.--A covered agency shall not--\n       (A) modify existing underwriting criteria or adopt new \n     underwriting criteria that intentionally negate or reduce the \n     impact of the requirements or resulting benefits that are set \n     forth or otherwise derived from the enhanced loan eligibility \n     requirements required under this subsection; or\n       (B) impose greater buy back requirements, credit overlays, \n     insurance requirements, including private mortgage insurance, \n     or any other material costs, impediments, or penalties on \n     covered loans merely because the loan uses an energy \n     efficiency report or the enhanced loan eligibility \n     requirements required under this subsection.\n       (7) Applicability and implementation date.--Not later than \n     3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and before \n     December 31, 2016, the enhanced loan eligibility requirements \n     required under this subsection shall be implemented by each \n     covered agency to--\n       (A) apply to any covered loan for the sale, or refinancing \n     of any loan for the sale, of any home;\n       (B) be available on any residential real property \n     (including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives) \n     that qualifies for a covered loan; and\n       (C) provide prospective mortgagees with sufficient guidance \n     and applicable tools to implement the required underwriting \n     methods.\n       (d) Enhanced Energy Efficiency Underwriting Valuation \n     Guidelines.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) in consultation with the Federal Financial Institutions \n     Examination Council and the advisory group established in \n     subsection (f)(2), develop and issue guidelines for a covered \n     agency to determine the maximum permitted loan amount based \n     on the value of the property for all covered loans made on \n     properties with an energy efficiency report that meets the \n     requirements of subsection (c)(3)(B); and\n       (B) in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, issue \n     guidelines for a covered agency to determine the estimated \n     energy savings under paragraph (3) for properties with an \n     energy efficiency report.\n       (2) Requirements.--The enhanced energy efficiency \n     underwriting valuation guidelines required under paragraph \n     (1) shall include--\n       (A) a requirement that if an energy efficiency report that \n     meets the requirements of subsection (c)(3)(B) is voluntarily \n     provided to the mortgagee, such report shall be used by the \n     mortgagee or covered agency to determine the estimated energy \n     savings of the subject property;

Madam President, there are two things I wish to mention \nbefore we close.\n  First, the Presiding Officer has worked for years on an energy \nefficiency bill. We are finally going to be able to get to that. This \nis the first Energy bill we have had in, I think, 5 years.\n  It is a bipartisan piece of legislation, but the impetus behind this \nlegislation is this Presiding Officer. I commend her, applaud her, and \nrecognize how fortunate the people of New Hampshire are to have her as \na Senator.\n  I also wish to mention the pages. This is their last day here.
