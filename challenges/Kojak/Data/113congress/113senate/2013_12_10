Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 243, S. \n1356.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 243, S. 1356, a bill to \n     amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to strengthen the \n     United States workforce development system through innovation \n     in, and alignment and improvement of, employment, training, \n     and education programs in the United States, and to promote \n     individual and national economic growth, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of Senator \nMcConnell, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the \nnomination of Patricia Millett to be U.S. circuit judge for the DC \nCircuit and immediately vote on confirmation of that nomination.\n  Senators should expect additional votes this morning with respect to \nreconsideration of the cloture vote on the nomination of Mel Watt to be \nDirector of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\n\n                      millett and watt nominations\n\n  Mr. President, this morning the Senate will consider the nomination \nof Patricia Millett to serve on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, \nconsidered by many to be the second highest court in the land. We \npostponed this vote last night out of consideration for a number of \nSenators whose flights were delayed by bad weather. I thank my \ncolleagues for their patience. And I am pleased that today Ms. Millett \nwill finally get the fair, up-or-down vote she deserves.\n  Ms. Millett is exceedingly qualified for this position. She graduated \nat the top of her class from the University of Illinois at Urbana and \nattended Harvard Law School. Ms. Millett has argued more than 32 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court, including one while her husband was deployed \noverseas with the U.S. Navy. She also served as Assistant Solicitor \nGeneral under both President Bill Clinton and President George Bush.\n  She enjoys bipartisan support from a variety of law enforcement \nofficials, legal professionals, and military organizations. And it is \nmy honor to help confirm a woman whom colleagues have called fair-\nminded, principled, and exceptionally gifted.\n  I will also move to reconsider the nomination of Congressman Mel Watt \nto serve as Administrator of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n  Congressman Watt graduated from the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill and Yale Law School. He has represented North Carolina's \n12th Congressional District since 1993 and served as chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus. And as a senior member of the House \nFinancial Services Committee, Mr. Watt understands the mistakes that \nled to the housing crisis.\n  Yet last month Senate Republicans blocked Congressman Watt's \nnomination--the first time a sitting Member of Congress has been \nfilibustered since 1843, since before the Civil War. They denied \nCongressman Watt even the courtesy of an up-or-down vote.\n  Congressman Watt proposed legislation to crack down on the worst \nabuses in mortgage lending and helped pass the Dodd-Frank bill to \nprevent predatory lending. By any measure, Congressman Watt is \nqualified to help struggling homeowners recover from the worst economic \ndownturn in generations.\n  And at a moment when America still faces difficult economic times--\nand as the housing market is finally beginning to recover--it is \ncrucial the Senate confirm the most talented and dedicated individuals \nto serve in the executive branch of government.\n  It is critical that the Senate confirm Congressman Watt to lead the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency.\n  This week the Senate will also consider a number of other highly \nqualified judicial and executive branch nominees.\n  The 13 district court nominees on the calendar have been waiting an \naverage of 56 days for a confirmation vote--almost twice as long as the \naverage at this point in President Bush's second term.\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\n  One of these district court nominees, Elizabeth Wolford, has been \nwaiting 130 days.\n  There are also 75 executive branch nominees currently ready to be \nconfirmed by the Senate who have waited an average of 140 days for \nconfirmation.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that, as always, there is an easy way \nand a hard way to process these nominations. And the more time the \nSenate wastes burning the hours and days between votes, the more likely \nthe Senate will hold late-night and weekend votes this work period.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Remembering Nelson Mandela\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, tens of thousands gathered today in \nSoweto to pay their last respects to a man who symbolized so much for \nso many, and it is not hard to see why. Politicians come and go, \nPresidents rise and fall, but Nelson Mandela was more than a \npolitician, more than just a foreign leader. He was a symbol--a symbol \nof freedom and hope, not only for his own people but for all people. We \nalso remember Nelson Mandela as a symbol of reconciliation, especially \nwhen he had every reason not to be. How many of us could spend so many \nyears in confinement--away from people we love, with little to do but \nmull the circumstances of our incarceration--and emerge so forgiving \ntoward our captors?\n  To me it was telling to see that one of the many people paying \nrespects to Nelson Mandela this week was an Afrikaner named Christo \nBrand. The two men struck up an improbable but lasting friendship \nduring Mandela's time on Robben Island. I say ``improbable'' because \nBrand was his jailer.\n  The story goes that years after his release from prison, President \nMandela was attending a ceremony and greeting Members of Parliament \nwhen he spotted Brand out across the room. Mandela lifted his arms and \nannounced to everyone that this man had been his warden but he was also \nhis friend. Then he asked Brand to join him in a group photo. ``You \nmust stand next to me,'' he insisted. ``We belong together.'' I think \nthat says it all.\n  Nelson Mandela could have followed the example of other leaders in \nthe region; he could have led South Africa down the path of Zimbabwe, \nbut he did not. He urged his country to embrace inclusion and freedom \nand democracy instead. He asked his countrymen to stand with him \nbecause he knew that, as he once said to Christo Brand, his people \n``belong together.'' So this morning the Senate joins the world in \nmourning the loss of Nelson Mandela. May his commitment to freedom and \nreconciliation continue to inspire.\n\n\n                          Advancing an Agenda\n\n  Now, Mr. President, on to the business at hand.\n  I want to start out by saying that I think it was important for all \nof us to get back home and hear from our constituents over the past \ncouple weeks. I talked with a lot of Kentuckians, and I can tell you \nthere is a lot of anxiety and a lot of frustration out there. Folks are \nfrustrated and upset by what is happening with their health care under \nObamaCare, and they are outraged at the tactics and the outright \ndeception--deception--that led to its passage.\n  It is now clear that the President knew perfectly well that a lot of \nfolks would not be able to keep the plans they had and liked, despite \nthe endless assurances to the contrary they heard from the President \nhimself. Many are also starting to realize that the talking points they \nheard about their premiums and keeping their doctors were not worth the \npaper they were written on either.\n  The response they have gotten from the White House in the face of all \nthis is just as bad. In the face of all the hardship and disruption \nthis law is causing for literally millions of Americans, the White \nHouse is defiant. In the face of all of this, the President is trying \nto convince people that somehow we are the problem. According to the \nPresident, the problem is not the law. The problem is the people who \nare unhappy with it. The people who are unhappy with it, the President \nsays, are the problem. This is exactly what folks are frustrated with--\nthe idea that Washington knows best.\n  So we are going to keep fighting this fight. If anybody needed any \nproof that Big Government liberalism does not work, they have gotten a \nclinic over the past 2 months. It is clearer now than ever that we need \nto replace this law with commonsense, patient-centered reforms that \nwill actually drive down costs and increase innovation.\n  The idea that making our health care system more like the Department \nof Motor Vehicles will somehow improve the final product has now been \nthoroughly discredited, and a thousand Presidential speeches are not \ngoing to change that.\n  But here is the larger story: ObamaCare is not an isolated case. It \nmay be the most obvious example of this administration's determination \nto advance its agenda by any means possible, but it is one example of \nmany.\n  The latest example was the administration's complicity in the power \ngrab we saw last month in the Senate. News reports suggest that the \nPresident, who denounced this tactic when Republicans thought about it \nback in 2005, was actively lobbying for it ahead of the majority \nleader's fateful decision to pull the trigger.\n  So the President and the majority leader were for the protection of \nminority rights in the Senate until they were no longer in the \nminority. At that point, minority rights, the rules of the Senate, and \nthe principle of a meaningful check on the Executive became an \ninconvenience--an inconvenience--that stood in the way of their desire \nfor more power.\n  As I indicated last month, this was a pure power grab, plain and \nsimple. If the majority party cannot be expected to follow the rules, \nthen there are not any rules.\n  So this was a grave mistake, and it was a grave betrayal of trust, \nsince some of the main players had previously vowed they would never do \nit, and then they did--just as the President had vowed that if you like \nyour health care you could keep it. For the President and his enablers \nin Congress, the ends now clearly justify the means, and that is a very \ndangerous place for us to be.\n  So Republicans will continue to speak out against these offenses \nagainst our institutions and against the American people, who have a \nright to expect elected leaders to keep their commitments and respect \nthe rules and our laws. The American people have a right to that.\n  The American people have given us divided government. The \nadministration needs to accept that fact. They need to work with the \ngovernment that the people have given them, not the one they wish they \nhad. They need to stop viewing the rules that govern the rest of us as \nmere suggestions to follow as they wish, while the American people are \nleft to suffer the consequences.\n  As I have indicated, we see the results of this mindset most \npowerfully with ObamaCare--a law that this administration was \ndetermined to force through--determined to force through--by hook or by \ncrook, regardless of what half-truths it had to repeat to get there, \nregardless of which Senators it had to coax and cajole.\n  But the pattern did not end with the law's passage. The \nadministration has repeatedly--repeatedly--invoked executive power to \nchange whatever parts of the law prove inconvenient. Its friends begged \nfor relief from the law, so they carved out special loopholes. \nStatutory deadlines became an irritation, so they waived them. \n``Incorrect promises'' made to sell the law became an embarrassment, so \nthey changed entire sections on the fly.\n  To many Washington Democrats, this is all fine--not because they \nnecessarily want to circumvent the law, perhaps, but because they feel \njustified in doing so if that is what it takes to enact their agenda.\n  We have seen Democrats use this same approach with immigration \npolicy, with welfare reform, with recess appointments. We have seen \nthem use it to justify government-sanctioned harassment of entire \ngroups of people over at the IRS.\n  Two weeks ago, we saw Washington Democrats take this ends-justifies-\nthe-means approach to a whole new level entirely, by eliminating--\neliminating--the right of the minority party to be heard in the \nSenate--something they themselves had warned against for\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\nyears when they were in the minority, something the Vice President \ncalled ``a naked power grab'' when he was in the Senate.\n  Washington Democrats changed our democracy irrevocably--irrevocably. \nThey did something they basically promised they would never do. And to \nwhat end? To what end? To pack the courts with judges they expect will \nrubberstamp the President's partisan agenda, to eliminate one of the \nlast remaining obstacles standing between the President and the \nenactment of his agenda through executive fiat. In short, because they \nwanted power that the voters have denied them at the ballot box, they \ntried to get it another way.\n  So before we all vote this morning, I just want to make sure \neverybody understands what this vote is all about. Two weeks ago the \nPresident and his Democratic allies defied two centuries of tradition, \ntheir own prior statements, and--in the case of some Democratic \nleaders--their own public commitments about following the rules of the \nSenate.\n  They did this for one reason: to advance an agenda the American \npeople do not want. It is an agenda that runs straight through the DC \nCircuit. So now they are putting their people in place, to quote one \nmember of their leadership, ``one way or another.''\n  This vote is not about any one nominee. It is not about Patricia \nMillett. It is about an attitude on the left that says the ends justify \nthe means--whatever it takes. They will do whatever it takes to get \nwhat they want. That is why we are here today, and that is why I will \nbe opposing this nomination.\n  Washington Democrats, unfortunately, are focusing their energy on \nsaying and doing anything--anything it takes--to circumvent the \nrepresentatives of the people. But, ultimately--ultimately--they will \nbe accountable to the American people, and the American people will \nhave their say again very soon--sooner than many of our colleagues \nmight hope.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Patricia Ann Millett, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will finally have the \nopportunity to vote on the confirmation of Patricia Millett to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Over the course of her 25-year \nlegal career, Ms. Millett has risen through the ranks of government and \nprivate practice to earn a place among the best appellate practitioners \nin the country. She has argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court. She \nworked in the Justice Department under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. She is unquestionably qualified and deserves to be \nconfirmed without further delay so she can get to work for the American \npeople.\n  Patricia Millett's career mirrors that of the last DC Circuit judge \nto occupy the very seat to which she is nominated--that of John \nRoberts, Jr. I voted for his confirmation to both the DC Circuit and \nlater to the Supreme Court. I knew at the time of those votes that I \nwould not agree with every decision he would make on the bench, but I \nvoted for him because of his temperament and his excellent reputation \nas a lawyer. John Roberts was confirmed unanimously to the DC Circuit \non the day the Judiciary Committee completed consideration of his \nnomination and reported it to the Senate--at a time when the caseload \nof the DC Circuit by any measure was lower than it is today. If only \nSenate Republicans had been willing to apply the same standard for Ms. \nMillett. Instead, they decided to filibuster her nomination even though \nthey had promised to only filibuster nominations under ``extraordinary \ncircumstances''. If those Senators had been true to their word, I do \nnot believe we would have reached the tipping point on the use of the \nfilibuster.\n  By refusing to allow a vote for any existing vacancy on the DC \nCircuit, Republicans took their determined obstruction to an \nunprecedented level. As the senior most Senator serving today, I \napproach changes to the tradition and history of the Senate with great \nreluctance. I have always believed in the Senate's unique protection of \nthe minority party. I have held to my belief that the best traditions \nof the Senate would win out; that the 100 of us who stand in the shoes \nof more than 310 million Americans would do the right thing.\n  Now that the Senate has changed its precedents to overcome the \nescalating obstruction of some, I hope reasonable Republicans will join \nus in restoring the Senate's ability to fulfill its constitutional \nduties. I hope this will include a vote to confirm Patricia Millett to \nthe DC Circuit.\n  Ms. Millett is a nominee with unquestionable integrity and character. \nShe has engaged in significant community service and committed herself \nto pro bono work. She helps the neediest among us, volunteering through \nher church to prepare meals for the homeless and serving regularly as \nan overnight monitor at a local shelter.\n  Through her legal work, Ms. Millett has earned broad bipartisan \nsupport. This includes the support of Peter Keisler, Carter Phillips, \nKenneth Starr, Theodore Olson, and Paul Clement, and a bipartisan group \nof 110 appellate practitioners, as well as 37 Deputy Solicitors General \nand Assistants to the Solicitor General from both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. She is supported by the national president \nof the National Fraternal Order of Police, Chuck Canterbury, and many \nothers.\n  Patricia Millett's service to our Nation is not limited to her legal \ncareer or her humanitarianism. She is part of our Nation's storied \nmilitary family, a family that we have called on repeatedly in the past \ndecade. Her husband is a retired Navy reservist, and as a military \nspouse, Ms. Millett is part of our Nation's military fabric. She \nunderstands personally what we ask of our servicemembers and their \nfamilies. At the height of Patricia Millett's legal career, her husband \nreceived orders to deploy in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. For \nnearly a year, she balanced Supreme Court arguments and the demands of \nbeing a single parent all while reassuring her children that their \nfather would return home safe.\n  But not only is Ms. Millett committed to her own military family, she \nhas helped to secure employment protections for members of our National \nGuard and Reserve through her pro bono legal work. In a case decided by \nthe Supreme Court in 2011, Ms. Millett represented an Army Reservist \nwho was fired, in part, because some of his co-workers did not like his \nmilitary absences. The successful arguments that Ms. Millett helped \ncraft have made it easier for all members of our Reserve and National \nGuard to protect their rights under the Uniformed Services Employment \nand Reemployment Rights Act.\n  Patricia Millett embodies what we ask our military families to do on \nbehalf of their country. Military spouses juggle all the challenges \nthat every American family faces--but often with the added pressure of \ndeployments and extended separations. I want to thank all the military \nspouses who are in the Senate gallery today and those watching on C-\nSPAN who have worked tirelessly to support the nomination of ``one of \ntheir own''. We should recognize, honor and support our military \nfamilies not just through words, but through meaningful action. A vote \nto confirm Patricia Millett is that meaningful action.\n  Today the Senate finally has the opportunity to vote for the \nconfirmation of Patricia Millett. I urge my fellow Senators to join me \nin supporting this outstanding nominee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the past few months, here on the \nSenate floor, in the Judiciary Committee, and in op-eds in national \npublications, I have explained why the pending nominees to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit should not be confirmed. Neither \nthose facts nor the conclusion they compel have changed and\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\nso I will vote against confirming the nominee before us.\n  The majority changed more than 200 years of Senate practice, taking \naway one of the few tools the minority has to participate in either the \nconfirmation or legislative process. On nothing more than a party line \nvote, the majority deployed a premeditated parliamentary maneuver to \nprohibit the very filibusters that majority Senators once used.\n  Getting these three individuals on this particular court at this \nparticular time is apparently so important that the majority is willing \nto change the very nature of this institution to do it. I believe the \nreason is the majority's belief that, as DC Circuit judges, these \nnominees will reliably support actions by the executive branch agencies \nthat are driving much of President Obama's political agenda.\n  Democrats enthusiastically embraced the filibuster when they used it \nto block Republican nominees to positions in both the executive and \njudicial branches. They used the filibuster to defeat nominees to be \nAssistant Secretary of Defense, Undersecretary of Agriculture, and U.N. \nAmbassador. They used the filibuster to defeat nominees to the Fifth \nCircuit, the Sixth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit. They filibustered \nMiguel Estrada's nomination a record seven times to keep him off the DC \nCircuit. Three-quarters of all votes for judicial nominee filibusters \nin American history have been cast by Democrats. The majority leader \nalone voted to filibuster Republican judicial nominees no less than 26 \ntimes.\n  That was then, this is now. Simply turning on a political dime and \nopposing today what Democrats used so aggressively just a few years ago \nwould be bad enough. But this radical institutional change is being \njustified by patently false claims. The majority leader claims as proof \nof ``unprecedented obstruction'' that there have been 168 nominee \nfilibusters in American history, half of them during the Obama \nadministration.\n  It turns out, Mr. President, that the majority leader is not even \ncounting filibusters at all. He is counting cloture motions, which are \nnothing but requests to end debate on a matter pending before the \nSenate. A filibuster occurs only when that request to end debate is \ndenied, when an attempt to end debate fails. Only 52 cloture votes on \nexecutive or judicial nominations have ever failed in American history, \nand only 19 nominees on whom cloture was filed were not confirmed. \nLooking at the Obama administration, only 14 cloture votes on \nnominations have failed and only six nominees have so far not been \nconfirmed.\n  During the Obama administration, a much lower percentage of cloture \nmotions on nominations have resulted in cloture votes, a much higher \npercentage of those cloture votes have passed, and a much higher \npercentage of nominees on whom cloture was filed have been confirmed. \nBy what I have called filibuster fraud, the majority ends up claiming \nthat confirmed nominees were obstructed and that ending debate is a \nfilibuster. The truth is the opposite of what the majority claimed as \nthe justification for ending nominee filibusters.\n  I regret that the President and the majority here in the Senate \ndeliberately set up this political confrontation. I have explained in \ndetail before how the DC Circuit's current level of eight active and \nsix senior judges is sufficient to handle its caseload, which has been \ndeclining for years, while other circuits need more judges. I likely \ncould support the nominee before us today had she been nominated to a \nseat that needed to be filled on a court that needed more judges.\n  Using false claims to justify radically changing the confirmation \nprocess in order to stack a court with judges who will rubberstamp the \nPresident's political agenda is wrong in so many ways. I hope there is \ntime to undo the damage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Patricia Ann \nMillett, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

WATT TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL HOUSING \n                             FINANCE AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Melvin L. Watt, of North \nCarolina, to be Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency for a \nterm of 5 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 15 of \nthe 113th Congress, there will now be up to 8 hours of postcloture \nconsideration of the nomination, equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nrecess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m., and that the time during the \nrecess count postcloture on the Watt nomination with the time equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nRepresentative Watt to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or \nFHFA. Unfortunately, I cannot support this nomination, and I must urge \nmy colleagues not to support it either.\n  I did not come to this decision lightly, and I regret we are placed \nin a situation where we cannot support a well-liked Member of Congress. \nHowever, by making a political appointment, the President has ignored \nthe importance that the head of the FHFA be independent and viewed as \nnonpolitical. This is not a cabinet position, where the nominee is \nsupposed to be an advocate for the President. Instead, this is an \nindependent agency with a highly complex task impacting our entire \neconomy, and it is for this reason many Senators noted the need to \navoid politics and to emphasize the technical expertise needed to fill \nthis position.\n  Regrettably, this did not occur, and we stand here today with the \nmajority party apparently willing to confirm a political figure to this \nhighly technical position. Worse yet, they appear to be ready to do it \nin a highly political manner that ignores decades of Senate rules and \nprecedents.\n  Representative Watt has led a long and distinguished career in the \nHouse of Representatives and in legal practice. He is well liked by his \ncolleagues, regardless of whether they see eye to eye with him on the \nissues, and he has a tremendously compelling personal story. My \nopposition to this nomination has nothing to do with Representative \nWatt from a personal perspective. To the contrary, there are many \npositions in government to which Representative Watt could have been \neasily confirmed.\n  In demonstration of that point, it is worth noting that most of the \nPresident's nominees that have come through the Banking Committee have \nbeen confirmed with strong bipartisan votes, often with unanimous \nconsent. In fact, four nominees who appeared at a nomination hearing \nwith Representative Watt were all approved by voice vote.\n  However, this position is distinctly unique within our government. \nThus, our evaluation of any nominee requires additional scrutiny. The \nDirector of the FHFA is conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nwhich have operated under Federal control since they were taken over in \n2008 because they didn't have enough capital to support expected \nlosses.\n  Since that conservatorship began, we have seen the bill to the \nAmerican taxpayers rise to nearly $200 billion. The Housing and \nEconomic Recovery Act, or HERA, established the FHFA and the rules of \nthe conservatorship. It specifically grants the FHFA the power to \noperate Fannie and Freddie ``with all the powers of the shareholders, \nthe directors, and the officers,'' so long as they remain in \nconservatorship.\n  FHFA's conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie triggered those broad \npowers and the Director of the FHFA now stands alone as the regulator, \nthe top executive, and the shareholder of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nand their combined $5 trillion of portfolio. Because of this immense \npower vested in the Director of the FHFA, it is a position that \nrequires an in-depth knowledge of and experience with numerous aspects \nof the housing markets and mortgage industries.\n  The statute explicitly requires that, at a minimum, any nominee:\n\n       . . . have a demonstrated understanding of financial \n     management or oversight, and have a demonstrated \n     understanding of capital markets, including the mortgage \n     securities markets and housing finance.\n\n  Additionally, to be successful, it is logical that any nominee should \nalso have knowledge of and experience with investment portfolios, the \noperations of both public and private insurance and guarantees, and the \nmanagement skills necessary to oversee the nearly 12,000 employees \nemployed by both entities.\n  Since this position has virtually unchecked power to control two \nmultitrillion dollar companies, and because the companies control so \nmuch of our mortgage-backed securities market, the decisions of the \nFHFA Director will have tremendous impact on our housing market and, \ncollaterally, on the global market.\n  If we are to give anyone this much power, we must know for certain \nthat he has the experience to know how to make the right choices and, \nfrankly, the political independence to make those choices, even if they \nare unpopular.\n  One reason this is so important is the impact on the taxpayer. Even a \nfew basis points of losses could mean billions in the context of \nmultitrillion dollar companies. That would be on top of the nearly $200 \nbillion the taxpayers have already shouldered.\n  With those unique risks in mind, the FHFA has taken great strides \nduring the conservatorship to shore up the business practices of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. Underwriting standards have been tightened, \nportfolio holdings have been reduced, guarantee fees have been \nincreased, and risk is being gradually transferred from the taxpayer to \nthe private sector.\n\n  With these changes, the revenues of Fannie and Freddie have \nincreased, their risks have decreased, and, for now, they have regained \na certain amount of profitability. This current profitability creates \nits own set of challenges and questions. But one thing is certain: Any \nreturn to policies of the past, whether with social goals in mind or \nmerely by mistake due to lack of technical experience, could expose the \ntaxpayer to immense risk.\n  In addition to the risks associated with their current operations, \nthe Director will also have a substantial impact on the prospects of \nthe success of these reforms. While Congress and the White House will \ndetermine how to reform and strengthen our housing finance system, we \nneed to be able to rely on the director of the FHFA for advice and \nguidance as we proceed. For this to work effectively, the FHFA Director \nwill need to be seen as a technical expert who is not viewed as a \npolitical advocate for the President.\n  The Director of the FHFA must have the market experience to \nunderstand how any proposed changes would or would not work, how they \nwould impact access to mortgages while protecting taxpayers from \nlosses, and how they would affect our housing market and economy as a \nwhole.\n  One example: There is a lot of interest in developing markets in a \nmanner to ensure there is adequate private capital taking the first \nloss to protect the taxpayer, if there is to be some sort of government \nguarantee in the future. Some proposals call for the development of \nvarious private-sector risk-sharing mechanisms, including senior \nsubordinated deal structures, credit-linked structures, and regulated \nbond guarantors.\n  Many are looking at what the FHFA has already begun working toward as \na test for the viability of capital markets' risk-sharing transactions. \nThese risk transfer deals--known within\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nFreddie as the STACR deal, and within Fannie as the NMI and C-Deals--\nare important examples of how private capital can partake in this \nmarket at a higher level. They are also critical examples of why the \nFHFA Director must have a deep and sound understanding of the demands \nof capital market investors.\n  In constructing and monitoring these deals, we need to know that \ndecisions in how to balance the necessity of encouraging private \nmarkets with the protection of the taxpayers are being made based upon \neffective market analysis, absent the political preferences of one \nindividual.\n  Another important aspect of the transition will be development of the \ncommon securitization platform. FHFA has noted that the GSEs' \ninfrastructures are ineffective when it comes to adapting to market \nchanges, issuing securities that attract private capital, aggregating \ndata or lowering barriers to market entry. As such, there must be an \nupdating and continued maintenance of the enterprises' securitization \ninfrastructure.\n  This is an incredibly complex undertaking that will take years to \ndevelop, but it is an essential component of most reform proposals. \nBecause of this, it is incredibly important the Director, on day one, \nhas the technical expertise and the commitment to establish this \npotential utility similar to ones used in securities markets.\n  All of us are currently witnessing the consequences of political \npeople leading technical platform development as we watch the continued \nfailures of the rollout for ObamaCare. We cannot afford the same \nmistakes in the context of our $5 trillion mortgage market.\n  The management of the current assets of Fannie and Freddie is another \nessential component of the Director's task, for many reasons, both \ncurrently and in the future. When Congress passed HERA authorizing the \nFHFA Director to appoint the agency conservator of the GSEs, it \nauthorized FHFA to put the GSEs in a ``sound and solvent condition,'' \nand to ``preserve and conserve the assets of the properties'' of the \nGSEs.\n  Congress very specifically intended that the assets of Fannie and \nFreddie be managed in such a way to maximize payments to the Treasury \nin exchange for bailing out the GSEs in 2008 and to maximize their \nvalue in whatever system is designed for the future. Acting Director \nDeMarco has done a commendable job fulfilling this task.\n  However, some believe that other statutory provisions trump this \nmandate and advocate using the GSEs in manners they believe would \nachieve other policy goals. Representative Watt noted at his \nconfirmation that, if confirmed, he would decide whether there is \nsufficient capital to fund various social programs.\n  In order to ensure the taxpayers are made whole and to best position \nthe secondary market for reform, we cannot afford the FHFA Director to \nmake any decisions that do not first prioritize the preservation and \nconservation of taxpayer assets. So long as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nare in conservatorship, profits accumulated by the GSEs should not be \nused to fund social programs.\n  Additionally, we cannot return to any of the policies that \ncontributed to the housing crisis, such as further pressing the GSEs' \naffordable housing goals. Decisions affecting social housing policy \nshould be made through congressional action on housing financing \nreform.\n  One final yet incredibly important element of the unique \nqualifications is regulatory interaction. In a new housing finance \nsystem, the already complex web of regulatory interaction between \nvarious Federal banking regulators and Federal and State regulators \nbecomes further muddled. State insurance regulators and State banking \nsupervisors must communicate effectively with Federal counterparts.\n  As this system is being built, the FHFA must coordinate effectively \nwith prudential banking regulators and the CFPB to make sure we are not \nbogging down our economy with duplicative regulation. To accomplish \nthis the Director needs not only to have an understanding that is built \nof highly technical expertise, but this person must be seen by other \nregulators as acting without political intent.\n  For all of these reasons, and many more, the conservator must be an \napolitical financial regulator with the technical expertise who will \nresist political pressure from all sides of the political spectrum.\n  Joseph Smith, the last nominee for this position, failed to win \nconfirmation by the Senate because of concerns over whether he was \nindependent enough. At the time of Representative Watt's nomination, \nthe White House was fully aware that these concerns have only been \nheightened since then.\n  In the wake of repeated attempts by outside political groups and \nindividuals to influence the decisions of the conservator and in view \nof the countless complex decisions--of which I have only mentioned a \nfew--numerous Senators repeatedly called for a technocrat rather than a \npolitical figure. However, rather than acknowledging the unique aspects \nof this job, the White House chose to ignore calls to emphasize \ntechnical expertise and political independence in their search. As a \nresult, their nominee failed to be confirmed by this body just a few \nweeks ago. Yet again the White House failed to accept the advice of the \nSenate.\n  Today, because of a historical rewrite of Senate rules, we are now \nfacing another vote. Instead, this time the White House and the \nDemocrats in the Senate chose to break the rules of this body so that \nthey could push through Representative Watt and other nominees in \npartisan votes. I am disappointed with the White House and those in the \nSenate who supported this rewrite of our rules, and at some time we \nwill all likely be disappointed that these are the rules of this body \nmoving forward. However, I continue to be opposed to this nomination \nand urge my colleagues to vote no today when the vote comes before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8587-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican whip.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, 4 years ago Members of both parties came \nto this Senate floor virtually every day to discuss the problems with \nAmerica's health care system and offered suggestions for how we could \nremedy that.\n  I distinctly remember being here on Christmas Eve, 2009, at 7 in the \nmorning and witnessing a party-line vote on ObamaCare. All of our \nDemocratic friends voted for it, and all Republicans voted against it. \nI guess the most charitable thing I can say is that our Democratic \nfriends actually thought it would work while Republicans were skeptics \nabout this big government takeover of one-sixth of our national \neconomy.\n  Well, 4 years later the cost of ObamaCare has become abundantly \nclear. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that ObamaCare is the \nbiggest case of consumer fraud ever perpetrated in this country. A law \nthat\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nwas supposed to expand coverage to those without it has instead caused \nmillions of people with coverage to lose their coverage. A law that was \nsupposed to improve patient access has instead resulted in smaller \nprovider networks where people are restricted in terms of the doctors \nand hospitals they can see, making it much more likely that people will \nnot be able to keep their doctors, should they want them. A law that \nwas supposed to bend the cost curve down has instead caused individual \nand family premiums to skyrocket.\n  We have heard story after story that even if the premiums are lower, \npeople, due to copays and deductibles, are finding themselves with \nthousands and thousands of dollars of deductibles they didn't \npreviously have, meaning it is more money out of their pocket before \nthe insurance actually kicks in.\n  We were told this was supposed to make Medicaid the safety net \nprogram for the most economically disadvantaged among us.\n  We were told that Medicare for seniors was supposed to make them \nstronger. Instead it has made them weaker.\n  A law that was supposed to help our economy has instead hurt our \neconomy by discouraging full-time job creation, because if you have a \nfull-time job your employer has to pay for the full ObamaCare pricetag. \nDue to ObamaCare businesses have been moving people from full-time work \nto part-time work.\n  A number of labor organization leaders went to the White House a few \nmonths ago and called the implementation of ObamaCare a nightmare. They \nsaid it made full-time work part-time work. It is worse than that.\n  ObamaCare has hampered medical innovation by taxing the very people \nwho build medical devices here in America and is causing them to move \nthose businesses offshore or simply cut down their hiring. It has \nplaced costly new burdens on small businesses, the entities which \nproduce as much as 70 percent of the new jobs in America. It is not the \nFortune 500 companies that create the vast majority of jobs in America, \nit is the small mom-and-pop operations, the entrepreneurs who create \nthose jobs, and that is who ObamaCare hits the hardest.\n  It is no wonder our economy continues to struggle. It is no wonder \nthe labor participation rate--the number of people who are actually in \nthe workforce--is at a 35-year low. People have given up looking for \nwork, and that is an American tragedy.\n  As I stand here today, the broken promises of ObamaCare are causing \nenormous distress and financial hardship for people all across my State \nof Texas and all across America. It is undeniable that millions of \nAmericans have lost their insurance because of ObamaCare despite \nPresident Obama's almost daily recitation that if you like what you \nhave, you can keep it. He was making that promise as late as 2012, and \nwe knew it wasn't true. We knew it was not true--and he knew it wasn't \ntrue--as early as 2010 when we debated some restrictive grandfather \nregulations from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Senator Enzi, who was the ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, tried to get it fixed, and again we saw a \nparty-line vote. All of our Democratic friends said, no, let's not \nprovide flexibility for the grandfather provisions. Let's maintain the \nrigid grandfather provisions which have now resulted in more than 5 \nmillion people getting notices telling them that even though they like \nthe policies they have, they can no longer keep them. That is why I \nhave said this is one of the biggest cases of consumer fraud ever \nperpetrated in the United States by virtue of its scope and the \naudacity with which these promises were made time and time again, which \nare demonstrably not true. They are false.\n  We know ObamaCare is leading to a dramatic spike in insurance \npremiums for many people who buy their insurance in the individual \nmarket. My colleagues will recall that during and after the 2008 \nPresidential election, President Obama repeatedly told Americans his \nhealth care plan would reduce their health care premiums for a family \nof four by about $2,500. I don't know where he came up with that \nnumber, but it turned out to be just another broken promise.\n\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, annual premiums for \nemployer-based family health insurance increased by nearly $3,000 \nbetween 2009 and 2013. In other words, the President was $5,500 wrong. \nRather than going down $2,500, they went up $3,000. For that matter, a \nrecent study by the Manhattan Institute estimated that ObamaCare will \ndrive up individual premiums by an average of 41 percent.\n  I don't know many hardworking American families who can afford a 41-\npercent increase in their health care costs as a result of a law \npromising that health care would be more affordable. The single biggest \nincrease, according to this study, will be in the majority leader's \nhome State of Nevada where individual premiums are projected to rise by \nan astounding 179 percent. The increases in New Mexico, Arkansas, and \nNorth Carolina are 142 percent--that would be New Mexico; 138 percent, \nthat would be Arkansas; and 136 percent in North Carolina. What do each \nof these States have in common? They are represented by Senators who \nvoted for this bill, perhaps believing what the President said would be \ntrue, but their constituents are having to pay the price.\n  Such premium increases are particularly burdensome for senior \ncitizens and other folks on a fixed income. For example, recently in \nCopper Canyon, TX, one of my constituents wrote to me and said that \nbecause of ObamaCare, her monthly premiums were increasing by $200, \nwhich is only $27 less than her monthly Social Security income. In \nother words, it takes up almost the entire amount of her Social \nSecurity check for her to purchase this insurance. That is wrong.\n  In addition to premium hikes, many Americans entering the ObamaCare \nexchanges are facing higher deductibles. I mentioned that a moment ago. \nIn a front-page story just yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, it was \nreported that many ObamaCare deductibles are so high that people with \nmodest incomes may not be able to afford the portion of medical \nexpenses that insurance doesn't cover. What is that all about? In fact, \naccording to one study, the average deductible for the cheapest \nindividual coverage on the Federal ObamaCare exchange is 42 percent \nhigher than the average deductible for individual health insurance \nearlier this year, before most of ObamaCare kicked in--a 42-percent \nhigher deductible. As we know, many of these deductibles we are hearing \nare in the $4,000 and $5,000 range for individuals and they are up to \n$10,000 or more for married couples. I don't know many households in \nTexas or across America that can absorb $10,000 in a deductible for \ntheir health insurance policy. Certainly that doesn't strike me as a \nsuccess if the purpose is to cover health care costs and to prevent \npeople from suffering economic hardship as a result. That strikes me as \nan epic failure. In other words, ObamaCare is making it significantly \nharder for many Americans to pay their bills, to buy groceries, and \ntake care of their families.\n  Again, as I have said many times before, it didn't have to be this \nway. It didn't have to be this way. In 2009, polls demonstrated that \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans who had health insurance liked \nwhat they had, and they were broadly satisfied with it. I assume that \nis why the President said: If you like what you have, you can keep it, \nbecause about 90 percent of the respondents said: We like what we have. \nSo if you are the President trying to sell this so-called Affordable \nCare Act, you wouldn't want to scare that 90 percent of people into \nthinking they can't keep what they have even though they like it. So \nyou misrepresent what you are selling. You tell people you can keep \nwhat you have and your premiums are going to go down and it is all \ngoing to be all right.\n  If we had focused on those people who either did not have coverage or \nwho had inadequate coverage--obviously a smaller subset of Americans \nthan the whole country--if we focused on them and dealt with their \nchallenges in purchasing health insurance, we could have done much \nbetter. There were millions more who had low-quality Medicaid coverage \nthat many doctors refused to accept because, in my State, Medicaid pays \na doctor about 50 cents on the dollar compared to private insurance. \nMany doctors said: Look. I\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nwant to see more Medicaid patients, but I simply can't afford to do it. \nI have to opt for higher paying private insurance patients. We know \nMedicare was facing a fast approaching bankruptcy date. What Congress \ncould have done--what we should have done--is to enact sensible, \nnarrowly drawn, targeted reforms, No. 1, aimed at improving the \ncoverage options for each of these groups and strengthening and \npreserving Medicare and Medicaid. We needed to bring down the costs, \nnot jack up the costs.\n  If we ask most people the biggest problem they have with their health \ninsurance, they say it costs too much, and we have made it worse. It is \nworse, not better. To bring down the costs, we could have allowed \npeople to buy health insurance across State lines. I know that doesn't \nsound like a panacea, but most States have captive insurance markets \nand many State legislatures, including the Texas legislature, have \nmandated coverage that many people simply don't want, but it adds to \nthe cost of their health insurance. So I could have the choice to buy \ninsurance across State lines if we enacted this reform. If I liked the \ninsurance coverage of Wisconsin or Louisiana or somewhere else, and if \nthat suited my needs, I could buy it there and we would have a true \ncompetitive market and people would compete based on quality and price, \nbut we don't have that now.\n  What else could we have done? We could have expanded the use of tax-\nfree health savings accounts paired with high deductible plans, such as \nthe kind I talked to a number of my constituents in Austin, TX, about \nwho are employed at Whole Foods. They cover roughly 80 percent of the \nout-of-pocket costs for health insurance through health savings \naccounts and high deductible insurance, and the employees--I think it \nis still the case; it was then--still vote on an annual basis for what \nkind of coverage they want. They vote for this type of coverage because \nthey are satisfied with it and it gives them a sense of ownership, \nwhich is actually true, because the money put in a health savings \naccount they get to keep and if they don't use it on their health care, \nthen they get to save it, the same as with an IRA or something such as \nthat. But it also changes the calculation. It makes people much smarter \nshoppers and it moves us further along to a system where people can \nshop for their health insurance and their health services as they do \nwith everything else and it will bring down costs and it will improve \nquality of service as a result of competition for that business.\n\n  We could have cracked down on frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits \nwhich cause defensive medicine. Just think about it. If a doctor is \nworried about losing everything they have worked a lifetime to achieve \nin terms of assets and their medical practice, the last thing they want \nto do is be subjected to a lottery-type lawsuit. So the easiest thing \nfor those doctors to do--I know they don't do it on purpose--is make \nthe decision to provide a test or a treatment based not so much on a \npatient's clinical situation but based on their desire to not be sued \nand to not be second-guessed 2 years later when somebody comes in and \nsays you should have done this or that. So the temptation is to do \neverything and to run up the cost of health care coverage.\n  These are just a few examples. But by lowering costs across the \nboard, these reforms--which I talked about and which the President and \nhis political party rejected--could have helped people who already had \ncoverage and we could have helped those who previously could not have \nafforded coverage. Some people--if I have heard it one time, I have \nheard it a thousand times--said we need ObamaCare because people with \npreexisting conditions couldn't get coverage. That is a serious \nconcern. But we already have in place high-risk pools in the States, \nand if we needed to help those States provide coverage to people with \nthose high-risk health conditions, we could have done it a whole lot \ncheaper and a whole lot more efficiently than creating this huge \nmonstrosity, this huge bureaucracy, this huge expense known as \nObamaCare.\n  We could have increased funding to the high-risk pools that were \nalready operating in about three dozen States. The irony is that the \npeople in the high-risk pool in Texas got a letter that said their \ncoverage has been canceled effective December 31--the very people \nObamaCare was supposed to help--your coverage is canceled because \nObamaCare kicks in January 1. But because people were worried about \ntheir ability to get on the exchanges due to the Web site problems, the \nTexas legislature and the Texas Department of Insurance decided to \nextend the coverage of the high-risk health insurance pools in Texas so \npeople wouldn't fall through the cracks because of this train wreck of \na rollout of ObamaCare.\n  How about Medicaid. We hear a lot of discussion about Medicaid. I \nhave already mentioned that Medicaid only reimburses doctors about half \nwhat a private insurance policy would, so a lot of doctors simply can't \nafford to see a new Medicaid patient. In Texas, only one doctor out of \nthree will see a new Medicaid patient for that reason. It is not \nbecause they don't want to; it is simply because they can't afford to \ndo so. We could have made it a lot easier for States to bolster their \nMedicaid Program and deliver targeted policies that would allow them to \nmanage Medicaid populations, for example; create a medical home, for \nexample. But because of the redtape Washington refused to cut, Medicaid \nends up in many instances being an appearance of coverage, but people \ncan't find a doctor who will see them. What good is that? That is, to \nme, a sleight of hand and part of the reason I call this one of the \nbiggest cases of consumer fraud in American history.\n  To help Medicare patients--who are, of course, our seniors--we could \nhave increased private competition and patient choice by embracing the \npremium support model that was endorsed by 10 members of President \nClinton's Medicare Commission back in 1999. That is not a partisan \nsolution; it is one President Clinton's Medicare Commission embraced \nback in 1999.\n  The reforms I have just outlined would have given us a genuine \nnational marketplace for individual health insurance. Unfortunately, \nour friends across the aisle and our President decided to take a \ndifferent path with the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare. \nUnfortunately, the folks who designed ObamaCare consciously chose to \ndestroy the individual market and force millions of people to pay for \nWashington-mandated coverage they didn't need and they didn't want and \nat a price they can't afford. Rather than adopt measures to bring down \nthe costs and coverage issues for a subset of the population, the \nroughly 10 percent who weren't among those 90 percent who said they \nlike what they had, the President and his allies chose to wreck the \nexisting health care system--to wreck it, to make it worse, not better.\n\n  As a result, they have made the cost problem worse. They have \njeopardized physician access for millions of Americans who like their \ncurrent health plans and wish to keep them. And, of course, now the \nadministration is boasting that the Web site is mostly fixed. Indeed, \nby most objective reports, people are not experiencing the same sort of \nepic failure they did when they first tried to get into the Obama \nexchanges. But at this point the President and his allies have lost all \ncredibility with regard to other aspects of ObamaCare, which I have \nmentioned. Fixing the Web site will not fix the underlying deficiencies \nof ObamaCare. These are not glitches. These were baked in the cake. \nThese were designed. This is the way ObamaCare was created and was \nsupposed to work, notwithstanding the fact that the American people had \nbeen sold a bill of goods to the contrary.\n  Indeed, the only way to solve America's biggest health care \nchallenges is a do-over, to replace ObamaCare with the sort of patient-\ncentered reforms I mentioned a few moments ago. ObamaCare may be a \ncomplete disaster, but it is not too late for us to work together to \nfix what is broken and to start over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, with less than 2 weeks remaining \nbefore the deadline for people who need to sign up for health insurance \nthat\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\nstarts for them to be insured on January 1, there is a significant \namount of anger as well as anxiety across the country. The Web site \nwhere people are supposed to go to buy that insurance has been plagued \nwith problems that everyone in the country seems to know about, and \nthat has caused huge amounts of anxiety. I heard about it last week in \nWyoming, I hear about it on Capitol Hill with staff members, and I hear \nit pretty much anywhere I go.\n  What people have been learning is that the problems with the Web site \nare actually just the tip of the iceberg. The Obama administration has \nbeen saying that it has been fixed, that the problems with this health \ncare law are fine, that everything is good, that a majority of people \nare having good experiences. I remember listening to the President not \nlong ago, sitting with Bill Clinton, saying: Easier to use than Amazon.\n  Well, that is not what the American people found. He also said: \nCheaper than your cell phone bill. He said: You will be able to keep \nyour doctor if you like them.\n  But the law continues to leave so many Americans struggling--\nstruggling with higher costs, with greater confusion--and really with a \nlot less confidence in the administration. People all around the \ncountry are worrying about whether the administration even knows what \nit is doing.\n  So when I talk about the Web site being just the tip of the iceberg, \npeople around the country are running into higher premiums, canceled \ncoverage, finding out they cannot keep their doctor. They are running \ninto fraud and identity theft issues and issues in terms of higher \ncopays and out-of-pocket costs and deductibles.\n  People at home in Wyoming--and I went not just around communities in \nthe State, traveling to a number of different communities, but I also \nwent to my own medical office where I practiced as an orthopedic \nsurgeon at Casper Orthopedics for 24 years--were telling me how worried \nthey were about the higher costs they are seeing regarding paying for \ninsurance for next year.\n  I got a letter from one man in Cody, WY. He talked about how the \nrates he has been quoted are going to go up from about $860 a month \nthat he pays now for a family of four to $2,400 a month--$860 to $2,400 \na month. He said: ``I'm not sure what planet they think I live on, but \nthere is no way I can spend more than half of my monthly income on \ninsurance.'' Well, I hear the same thing from people all around \nWyoming. People are having this same sticker shock all over the \ncountry.\n  We know that more than 4.7 million Americans in 32 States are being \ntold they cannot keep the insurance they had. When we take a look at \nthe map, we know we do not have the numbers yet on certain States, \nincluding the State of Wisconsin. We do not have Illinois. We do not \nhave Ohio. We do not have Texas. We do not have Virginia. So we really \ndo not know how many people have lost their coverage. But we know that \nat least 4.7 million Americans were told they cannot keep the insurance \nthey had in spite of what the President may have promised them. Now \nwhat they have to do is buy new Washington-approved health coverage \nthat really may not be the right coverage for them and may likely cost \nmore than they were paying before. Millions of Americans are going to \nbe forced to use money that in the past was used to pay rent or put \ntheir children through school or to invest in their communities or in a \nbusiness or to help make repairs to their homes--now that money is \ngoing to go to pay for higher premiums as well as the incredibly high \ndeductibles people are seeing related to the health care law.\n  It is interesting, looking through the papers--this was yesterday's \nWall Street Journal, Monday, December 9. Above the fold on the front \npage: ``Deductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law Sticker Shock.'' The \narticle says:\n\n       The average individual deductible for what is called a \n     bronze plan on the exchange--the lowest-priced coverage--is \n     $5,081 a year, according to a new report on insurance \n     offerings in 34 of the 36 states that rely on the federally \n     run online marketplace.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal reports:\n\n       That is 42% higher than the average deductible of $3,589 \n     for an individually purchased plan in 2013 before much of the \n     federal law took effect.\n\n  So what people are seeing--and the Wall Street Journal reports above-\nthe-fold on the first page--are higher deductibles by a lot.\n  It is not just the Wall Street Journal. In the New York Times \nyesterday, Robert Pear had an article: ``On Health Exchanges, Premiums \nMay Be Low, But Other Costs Can Be High.'' It says:\n\n       . . . as consumers dig into the details--\n\n  Dig into the details--something this body never did. Members of that \npart of the body who voted for this health care law never did dig into \nthe details.\n\n  It says:\n\n       . . . as consumers dig into the details, they are finding \n     that the deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are often \n     much higher than what is typical in employer-sponsored health \n     plans--the plans many of these people have had in the past.\n\n  So what we are seeing are not just the higher costs, not just the \nhigher deductibles, the higher copays; there is also a lot of confusion \nabout the health care Web site itself, and I think that is only going \nto get worse. Ten weeks after the Web site launched, there is still an \nawful lot that is broken, including the parts that actually get people \nthe insurance they think they signed up for.\n  A number of my staff have applied, and they believe they have signed \nup for health insurance. They are not sure. They have not yet gotten \nconfirmation. And I know Members on Capitol Hill who have staff signing \nup are experiencing the same thing.\n  Last month one of the officials from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services testified in the House of Representatives that as much \nas 40 percent of this Web site's system still has not even been built \nyet. The Web site still has trouble transmitting information to the \ninsurance companies once someone has chosen a plan.\n  The Web site was down again earlier today. It still has not figured \nout how to automatically pay the portion of premiums covered by any \ngovernment subsidy.\n  There are still many, many security holes that can be exploited by \ncon artists, by hackers. Certain branches of the government have been \nwarning citizens to be cautious when going on the Web site because of \nthe concerns about exploitation, people who are trying to use this in a \nfraudulent way.\n  And then you hear that the administration is bragging. It is really \nsad that almost 9 weeks after the Web site opened the administration is \nnow bragging that it only has an error rate of 10 percent on one \nimportant step of the Web site. Madam President, 1 in 10 is their error \nrate. This is a President who said the Web site was going to be running \nlike amazon.com. He said that 3 or 4 days before the Web site opened. \nNow, 9 weeks later, he is delighted that the error rate is still 1 out \nof 10. Does the President actually believe Amazon would accept a 10-\npercent error rate in their customers not being able to finish their \npurchases?\n  I believe all of these flaws and failures have led to a dramatic loss \nof confidence by the American people in their government. According to \na new Gallup poll, 52 percent of Americans are in favor of scaling back \nthe health care law or repealing it entirely. People continue to turn \nagainst the law for a number of reasons, and it is not just the Web \nsite, it is the higher premiums, it is the canceled coverage, it is \nthat they cannot keep their doctor, and it is fraud and identity theft, \nhigher copays, higher deductibles, and confusion about what is going to \ngo wrong next because so many things the President and his \nadministration have said--have looked into the camera and told the \nAmerican people would be one way--turned out to be something very \ndifferent. There have been so many changing stories coming out of the \nWhite House.\n  The President said: If you like your health insurance, you can keep \nyour health insurance, and then he actually said ``period,'' with a \npunctuation mark, that that was it; no ifs, ands, or buts--just the \nperiod. People now know all across the country--those who voted for \nhim, those who did not--what they all know is that what the President \nsaid was not true.\n  The President said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor. Well, on Sunday one of the architects of ObamaCare went on FOX \nNews and admitted also that was not true. This is Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel--\nthe brother of\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nRahm Emanuel, the former Chief of Staff of the White House--who is a \nmedicine professor. What he said was, if you like your doctor and you \nwant to keep your doctor, you can pay more for insurance that includes \nyour doctor. There are a lot of places where you cannot even buy \ninsurance that will cover that doctor. This is not at all what the \nPresident promised.\n  It is interesting, even in the Financial Times yesterday, \n``Healthcare insurers cut costs by excluding top hospitals.'' So you \ncannot even go to the hospitals. There is a picture here of the \nUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. ``Plan will not cover \ntreatment at Houston cancer center.'' So we have somebody who has lost \ntheir insurance who has been going to that cancer center where their \ndoctors are--they are losing their insurance on January 1, knowing they \ncannot keep their doctor, they cannot keep their hospital. We see \nchildren's hospitals around the country, people who are not going to be \nincluded in these exchanges. So children with leukemia, come January 1, \nare going to lose their doctor, lose their hospital. But that is what \nthe President and that is what the Democrats in this body who voted for \nthis health care law have given to the American people.\n  Just before Thanksgiving, the Obama administration announced it would \nhave to delay a health insurance exchange that was supposed to let \nsmall businesses shop for insurance. I remember hearing speeches on \nthis floor about small businesses being able to find affordable \ninsurance. Well, it turns out, once again, the administration knew at \nleast 6 weeks before that they were going to have to delay the program. \nDid they admit it to the American people? Did they tell the truth? No. \nThey waited.\n  One broken promise after another, one statement after another that \nthe administration knows is not true. So is it a surprise, then, that \nthe President of the United States is viewed as untruthful by a \nmajority of the people of this country? It is a terrible situation for \nanyone to put their country in.\n  Back when we first started talking about the health care law, \nRepublicans offered ideas on how to give people what they really \nwanted, which was reform that lowered costs and improved access to \ncare. That is what people were concerned about. So many of the \ncomplaints we have heard around the country have had to do with the \ncost of care.\n  So President Obama and Democrats in Congress refused to listen, \nignored all of the warning signs, and used raw majority power to force \nthis bad law on all of the American people. I remember the vote in this \nbody, Christmas Eve morning, voting on a health care law. We watched it \ncrammed through on party-line votes.\n  Now Democrats in the Senate have decided to make another power play \nand have broken the rules of the Senate just a couple of weeks ago to \nchange the rules of the Senate. They took a drastic and unwarranted \nstep so that they could have the power once again to force more bad \nideas like the Obama health care law onto the American people.\n  They say we do not need the 60 votes now; all we need is a simple \nmajority. Let's change the way the Senate has run for well over 100 \nyears, because, once again, the Democrats say: We know better than the \nAmerican people. We know better than you.\n  That is what the President said with his health care law. Now the \nAmerican people are realizing what they knew all along. This is not \nwhat they wanted with health care reform. Regrettably it is what they \nare living with now, and they are seeing the higher premiums, the \ncanceled coverage, losing their doctor, the fraud and identity theft, \nhigher copays, and higher deductibles.\n  It is interesting; even today in the Washington Post, the front page \nabove the fold said: ``Under health law, insurers limiting drug \ncoverage.'' Costs may soar. It talks about many different ailments, \nincluding for those with HIV. That is a result of the health care law. \nIf this health care law would not have passed, forced down the throats \nof the American people with the President telling one falsehood after \nanother, deliberately designed to mislead the American people, you \nwould never have seen a headline like this today.\n  If President Obama really wants to help the American people, he is \ngoing to sit down with the Republicans and talk about the real issues \nto reduce costs, to get rid of all of this confusion that he and the \nDemocrats have caused and to restore people's confidence in America, as \nwell as in him.\n  There is a better way. Republicans agree we need to reform America's \nhealth care system. We think that those reforms could have been done \nwithout the kind of harm caused by the President's health care law.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, once again I come to the floor to discuss \nthe negative impacts ObamaCare is having on my constituents in South \nDakota and to countless Americans across the Nation. Since this health \ncare law was enacted in 2010, I have come to the floor on numerous \noccasions to discuss the number of promises the President made to the \nAmerican people, promises that have been broken. My colleagues and I \nhave highlighted the fact that the President's promise, ``if you like \nyour health care plan, you can keep your health care plan--period,'' \nsimply isn't true.\n  Reports indicate that more than 5 million Americans already have \nreceived cancellation notices from their insurance companies and much \nof the ObamaCare policy has not even been implemented yet. What is \nworse, the administration knew they would never live up to this \npromise. Instead of finding a permanent solution to the problem, they \nproposed a political solution.\n  Today I would like to highlight yet another broken promise made by \nthe President that is resulting in sticker shock as many Americans \npurchase health insurance.\n  While campaigning for the Presidency, and in speeches leading up to \nthe passage of ObamaCare, President Obama promised the American people \nthat their premiums would decrease by up to $2,500 per family. Instead, \nmany families are facing sticker shock. Since enactment of ObamaCare, \nhealth care premiums have actually increased by more than $2,500 per \nfamily--that according to the Kaiser Family Foundation annual survey. \nAs a result, many American families are sitting around their kitchen \ntable trying to figure out how they are going to shift their finances \naround to afford health care when they were promised their premiums \nwere going to go down by $2,500 per family.\n  As the President has said, this law is more than just a Web site. We \nagree with that; this law is more than just a Web site. This law is a \nseries of broken promises that are resulting in higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, and higher out-of-pocket costs for middle-class families, \nmoney the families could be using to help pay off student loans, save \nfor a house, or start a business. Those are now going to be used to pay \nfor government-approved health care.\n  Recent reports out this week by the New York Times and Wall Street \nJournal highlight the fact that deductibles and other costs under \nObamaCare have surged. The Wall Street Journal reports that the average \nindividual deductible for a bronze level plan on the exchanges is over \n$5,000 a year. This means a policyholder would need to pay over $5,000 \nin order for their insurer to start making payments.\n  One of my constituents recently informed me that her family's health \ninsurance plan was cancelled and the new policy she was offered would \ndouble their deductible to $5,000 per individual. She and her husband \nhave three children. In addition to a higher deductible, this family \nfaces higher premiums, higher copayments, and a higher out-of-pocket \nmaximum. She goes on to say, ``Please explain how this new coverage is \nconsidered `affordable' under the Affordable Care Act?''\n  Another couple in my State of South Dakota informed me, in the form \nof an email, that their premiums were going up by $400 a month and the \ndeductibles were going up by $1,400 on their policy.\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nTheir question was, What is the Federal Government doing? The gentleman \nsays I feel like the Federal Government just stole $5000 from me.\n  That is the frustration people across the country are feeling as a \nresult of ObamaCare. The middle class is faced with higher costs, while \ntheir take-home pay and hours are being reduced.\n  As more and more Americans begin to formulate their family budget for \n2014, they are going to learn that yet another promise by the President \nhas been broken. Not only are they losing the plan they were promised \nthey could keep, they are facing sticker shock over the increased cost \nof health care coverage. This flawed law will continue hitting middle-\nclass Americans in their pocketbooks as the Nation's economy continues \nto struggle to regain its footing.\n  The flawed rollout of ObamaCare is no secret. We have all seen what \nwere described as the countless glitches associated with the rollout. \nBut to make matters worse, recent reports indicate that in October, one \nin four ObamaCare enrollees faced a glitch not many were aware of. This \nglitch, called an 834 error, has prevented insurers from receiving the \nproper information regarding people who believed they had successfully \nenrolled in a health care plan. In essence, 25 percent of the initial \nenrollees in ObamaCare, after persevering through the errors on a Web \nsite that was not ready for prime time, may not have proper coverage \ncome January 1 of 2014.\n  What is even more troubling is that the administration estimates that \n10 percent of new enrollees will continue to face this problem. Here we \nare, 23 days before January 1, and those who worked through the \nheadaches of healthcare.gov may or may not have coverage. \nUnfortunately, this administration continues to refuse to seriously \naddress these problems.\n  Even though they have unilaterally delayed several portions of this \nlaw from taking effect and have previously failed to meet half of the \nrequirements mandated by the law, the administration will not provide \nthe same relief for the individual Americans as it has for big \nbusinesses.\n  This law is fundamentally broken and we need to start over. Rather \nthan expand the government's role in providing health care, we need to \nenact policies that make the private insurance market more competitive \nto ensure that individuals and families have choices when it comes to \ntheir health care. Yet the unfortunate reality for middle-class \nfamilies is that their premiums, their deductibles, their out-of-pocket \ncosts under ObamaCare are not glitches, they are a harmful reality that \nis resulting in sticker shock for literally millions of Americans.\n  We can do better; we should do better. This is more than just a Web \nsite. It is the substance of this law that was built upon a faulty \nfoundation that is leading to canceled policies, higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles, higher taxes, fewer jobs, and lower take-home pay \nfor the American people. This is a direct shot at the heart of the \nAmerican middle class.\n  The President last week got up and made a speech where he talked \nabout income inequality. What he should have focused on is the best way \nto get rid of income inequality is to repeal this health care law \nbecause what is going to happen to middle-class families and middle-\nclass Americans under this health care law is much higher costs, much \nlower take-home pay, many fewer jobs for them and for their children, \nand a lower standard of living and lower quality of life than they have \nenjoyed in the past. This will be the impact upon middle-class \nAmericans as a result of this law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss what I call \nthe Washington exemption from ObamaCare. One of the few real victories \nthe American people had in the ObamaCare debate was we actually got an \namendment included in the Senate consideration of the bill that said \nmuch of Washington--all Members and all of our congressional staff--\nhave to go to the ObamaCare exchanges for our health care, just like \nmillions of other Americans. We had to get it there.\n  Unfortunately, I guess this was an example of what Nancy Pelosi said \nwhen she said we need to pass the bill in order to understand what is \nin it.\n  After the ObamaCare statute passed with that very clear and very \nspecific provision in it, a lot of folks around here read it and said: \nOh, you know what. How are we going to deal with this? A furious \nbehind-the-scenes lobbying effort then began. It went on for months. It \nwas to essentially get around that provision and the pain it would \ncause--the pain being subjecting Members of Congress and all of our \nstaff to the same circumstance and experience as other Americans.\n  That ended with President Obama getting personally involved and the \nObama administration issuing a special rule, and that rule is just an \nend run around the specific statutory provision. I think it is \ncompletely illegal for that reason, because it is in conflict with that \nstatutory provision.\n  One of the key issues of that rule says--well, the statute says all \nofficial staff will go to the exchange, but we really don't mean that \nso we are going to leave it up to each individual Member to decide what \nstaff are official and what staff will go to the exchange.\n  As a result, there is a huge loophole some Members are using to \nexempt much--in some cases even all--of their staff from going to the \nexchange.\n  As mandated clearly by the ObamaCare statute, we have to walk the \nwalk of other Americans, and we have to share in that experience.\n  Sadly, according to press reports, the distinguished majority leader \nMr. Reid is one of those Members actively taking advantage of that \nloophole and exempting much of his staff. Because of that, I have \nwritten the majority leader today and asked him to answer some very \nimportant and straightforward questions about that situation.\n  In order to make my point, I will simply read the letter into the \nRecord. It was sent to the distinguished majority leader in the last \nseveral hours.\n\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid.\n       It has been reported that you were the only Member of top \n     Congressional leadership--House and Senate, Democrat and \n     Republican--who has exempted some of your staff from having \n     to procure their health insurance through the Obamacare \n     Exchange as clearly required by the Obamacare statute.\n       Millions of Americans are losing the health care plans and \n     doctors they wanted to keep and are facing dramatic premium \n     increases, all as Washington enjoys a special exemption. \n     Given this, I ask you to publicly and in writing answer the \n     four important questions below regarding your office's \n     exemptions. I will also be on the Senate floor to discuss \n     this at approximately 4:15 pm today and invite you to join me \n     there.\n       First, how did you designate each member of your staff, \n     including your leadership staff, regarding their status as \n     ``official'' (going to the Exchange) or ``not official'' \n     (exempted from Exchange)? Did you delegate that designation \n     to the Senate Disbursing Office, which would have the effect \n     of exempting all of your leadership staff from going to the \n     Exchange?\n       Second, if any of your staff is designated as ``not \n     official'' (exempted from Exchange), are any of those staff \n     members receiving official taxpayer-funded salaries, \n     benefits, office space, office equipment, or any other \n     taxpayer support?\n       Third, if any of your staff is designated as ``not \n     official'' (exempted from Exchange), did any of these staff \n     members assist you in drafting or passing Obamacare into law? \n     If so, which staff members exactly?\n       Fourth, how are the above designations of yours consistent \n     with the clear, unequivocal statement you made on September \n     12: ``Let's stop these really juvenile political games--the \n     ones dealing with health care for Senators and House members \n     and our staff. We are going to be part of exchanges, that's \n     what the law says and we'll be part of that.''\n       I look forward to your clear, written responses to these \n     important questions. I also look forward to having fair up-\n     or-down votes on the Senate floor on my ``Show Your \n     Exemptions'' and ``No Washington Exemptions'' proposals in \n     the new year.\n       Sincerely, David Vitter.\n\n  This letter lays it out clearly. I think this is an important debate \nthe American people care about. As I said in the letter, millions of \nAmericans face real dislocation and pain under ObamaCare. They are \nlosing--in millions upon millions of cases--the health care plan they \nwanted to keep and they were promised they could keep. They are\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nlosing their ability to see the doctor they love and were promised they \ncould continue to see. That number in Louisiana alone is 93,000 \nfamilies.\n  They face skyrocketing premiums in many cases. Yet, as all of that \ngoes on, Washington enjoys this Washington exemption from ObamaCare. \nSome Members of Congress, in particular--apparently, according to press \nreports, that includes the majority leader Mr. Reid--are using this end \nrun around the clear language of the ObamaCare law and exempting much \nof their staff.\n  I think it is incumbent upon the distinguished majority leader to \ncome clean and answer these four very legitimate, very straightforward \nquestions in an open, transparent, written, and straightforward way.\n  I am sorry he could not join me on the floor right now to discuss \nthis matter. I welcome that conversation at any point in the near \nfuture, and I certainly look forward to his written responses to these \nquestions. I think the American people deserve that, at a very minimum.\n  I also think they deserve--at a very minimum--what I have been \nfighting for months: Fair up-or-down votes on my Show Your Exemptions \nproposal and No Washington Exemptions from ObamaCare proposal. The \nfirst is real simple. It simply mandates that every Member disclose how \nthey are handling their office. It is the same sort of question and \ngoes to the same sort of information I am asking directly of Senator \nReid.\n  The No Washington Exemptions from ObamaCare ends the end run around--\nends that special status, that special treatment for Congress and our \nofficial staff. It would also put them in the same category of having \nto go to the exchanges with no special treatment or subsidy. It would \ninclude the President, Vice President, White House staff, and political \nappointees.\n  Unfortunately, again, the majority leader has blocked all of my \nattempts to simply get a vote on these matters. I am not asking \neveryone to agree with me; it is a free country, but I think I deserve \na vote. I think the American people deserve a debate and a vote, and so \nI will continue fighting for fair up-or-down votes on the Senate floor \non both my disclosure proposal, Show Your Exemptions, and the ultimate \nfix, No Washington Exemptions from ObamaCare.\n  I will continue that work, and I look forward to the majority \nleader's response to this letter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate has considered several well-\nqualified nominees this week. One of those is Congressman Mel Watt, the \nPresident's nominee to be Director of the Federal Housing Finance \nAgency. Congressman Watt has the institutional knowledge, legislative \nexperience, and vision to transform our housing market and ensure that \nthe mortgage crisis doesn't happen again.\n  Congressman Watt has vast experience working with the housing market. \nHe practiced law for 22 years prior to his congressional career, \nexecuting countless real estate transactions. Since being elected to \nserve in North Carolina's 12th District in 1993, Congressman Watt has \nfought tirelessly to restore integrity to our financial system.\n  He serves on the House Financial Services Committee, where he \nsponsored legislation that would eventually become part of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to ensure that \nmortgage applicants can, in fact, meet their mortgage obligations. What \nis more, he recognized that lenders were engaging in predatory \npractices when underwriting mortgage loans well before the foreclosure \ncrisis.\n  Since 2004, he has advocated for legislation to combat predatory \nmortgage practices. He has also been working for 10 years toward reform \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I share his goal, and I want the right \nperson at the helm when Congress begins that process.\n  Before responsible reform can happen, we need to come to some \nconsensus about what we want the secondary mortgage market to look \nlike. Families should have access to traditional 30-year mortgages. And \nwe don't want to cut off access to capital for multifamily housing, \nwhich provides affordable housing for millions of families. Congressman \nWatt's experience delving into these issues will be invaluable in his \nrole as the new Director of FHFA.\n  The mortgage crisis that took our Nation's economy to the brink in \n2008 is still hurting American homeowners and our economy. About 15 \npercent of all borrowers--more than 7 million Americans--are still \nunder water on their mortgages and high rates of foreclosure continue \nto plague communities across the country. The housing market still has \na long way to go.\n  There is more that FHFA can do to help the housing market recover--\nfrom working with State and local governments to maintain vacant \nforeclosed properties held by Fannie and Freddie, to targeted principal \nreduction to help families stay in their homes. I look forward to \nworking with Congressman Mel Watt to address the challenges still \nfacing the housing market.\n  Time and again, some of my colleagues threaten to block confirmation \nof nominees to further sometimes unrelated agendas. Sometimes it is \nsimply because President Obama nominated these individuals. I hope that \nmy colleagues will carefully consider the struggling homeowners in \ntheir respective States as they do this.\n  FHFA has gone without a Director for more than 4 years. This \nimportant agency needs a Director that will stand up for homeowners and \nwork with Congress to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  FHFA deserves to be fully staffed so it can serve the best interests \nof taxpayers and homeowners. I urge my colleagues to support \nCongressman Watt's confirmation and look forward to working with him as \nhe becomes the new Director of the FHFA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The question is, Will the \nSenate advise and consent to the nomination of Melvin L. Watt, of North \nCarolina, to be Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency for a \nterm of 5 years?\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.

Mr. President, today, for the second time in a month, we \nare debating whether to allow a confirmation vote on the nomination of \nNina Pillard to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. \nYesterday, we were finally able to vote on the nomination of Patricia \nMillett after many months of being filibustered by Senate Republicans. \nI am glad we are making more progress today on another exceptional \nnominee.\n  The DC Circuit is often considered to be the second most important \ncourt in the Nation and should be operating at full strength. Today we \nwill take a step towards making this court operate at full strength for \nthe American people.\n  In late November, a bipartisan majority of Senators voted in favor of \nmoving to an up-or-down vote on Nina Pillard's nomination, but we fell \nshort by three votes. The same efforts to remove the Republican \nblockade of this President's nominees to fill vacancies on the DC \nCircuit that allowed the Senate to confirm Patricia Millett earlier \nthis week will similarly allow the Senate to move forward on Nina \nPillard's nomination so she can be confirmed and get to work for the \nAmerican people.\n  Nina Pillard is an accomplished litigator whose work includes nine \nSupreme Court oral arguments, and briefs in more than 25 Supreme Court \ncases. She drafted the Federal Government's brief in United States v. \nVirginia, which after a 7-1 decision by the Supreme Court made history \nby opening the Virginia Military Institute's doors to female students \nand expanded educational opportunity for women across the country. \nSince then, hundreds of women have had the opportunity to attend VMI \nand go on to serve our country.\n  Ms. Pillard has not only stood for equal opportunities for women but \nfor men as well. In Nevada v. Hibbs, Ms. Pillard successfully \nrepresented a male employee of the State of Nevada who was fired when \nhe tried to take unpaid leave under the Family Medical Leave Act to \ncare for his sick wife. In a 6-3 opinion authored by then-Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist, the Supreme Court ruled for her client, recognizing \nthat the law protects both men and women in their caregiving roles \nwithin the family.\n  She has also worked at the Department of Justice as the Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, an office \nthat advises on the most complex constitutional issues facing the \nexecutive branch. And prior to that, Ms. Pillard litigated numerous \ncivil rights cases as an assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense & \nEducational Fund. At Georgetown Law, Ms. Pillard teaches advanced \ncourses on constitutional law and civil procedure, and co-directs the \nlaw school's Supreme Court Institute.\n  She has earned the American Bar Association's highest possible \nranking--Unanimously Well Qualified--to serve as a Federal appellate \njudge on the DC Circuit. She also has significant bipartisan support. \nViet Dinh, the former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of \nLegal Policy under President George W. Bush, has written that ``Based \non our long and varied professional experience together, I know that \nProfessor Pillard is exceptionally bright, a patient and unbiased \nlistener, and a lawyer of great judgment and unquestioned integrity . . \n. Nina has always been fair, reasonable, and sensible in her judgments \n. . . She is a fair-minded thinker with enormous respect for the law \nand for the limited, and essential, role of the federal appellate \njudge--qualities that make her well prepared to take on the work of a \nDC Federal Judge.''\n  Former FBI Director and Chief Judge of the Western District of Texas \nWilliam Sessions has written that her ``rare combination of experience, \nboth defending and advising government officials, and representing \nindividuals seeking to vindicate their rights, would be especially \nvaluable in informing her responsibilities as a judge.''\n  Nina Pillard has also received letters of support from 30 former \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces, including 8 retired generals; 25 \nformer Federal prosecutors and other law enforcement officials; 40 \nSupreme Court practitioners, including Laurence Tribe and Carter \nPhillips, among many others.\n  Despite having filled nearly half of law school classrooms for the \nlast 20 years, women are grossly underrepresented on our Federal \ncourts. We\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\nneed women on the Federal bench. A vote to end this filibuster is a \nvote to break yet another barrier and move in the historic direction of \nhaving our Federal appellate courts more accurately reflect the gender \nbalance of the country.\n  I commend President Obama on his nominations of highly qualified \nwomen such as Nina Pillard, Patricia Millett, Elena Kagan and Sonia \nSotomayor. In each of these women, the Senate has had the opportunity \nto vote to confirm women practicing at the pinnacle of the legal \nprofession. Once the Senate confirmed Justice Kagan, the highest court \nin the land had more women than ever before serving on its bench. With \nthe confirmation and appointment of Nina Pillard, the same will be true \nfor what many consider to be the second highest court in the land, the \nDC Circuit, because she will be the fifth active female judge on the \ncourt. Never before have five women jurists actively served on that \ncourt at one time. I look forward to that moment and to further \nincreasing the diversity of our federal bench.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of ending the filibuster on \nthis outstanding nominee. This Nation would be better off for Nina \nPillard serving as a judge on the DC Circuit.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the Pillard nomination, upon reconsideration.\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Cornelia T.

Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous \nconsent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1797, \nwhich was submitted earlier today; that the bill be read three times \nand passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I want to reserve the right to object. I \nam certainly willing to let the good Senator make comments. But at this \npoint I want to reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first of all, I think it is appropriate to \nmake some comments. I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota being \nhere and making his point. But we are at a juncture that within 2 weeks \n1.3 million Americans will lose their Federal unemployment compensation \ninsurance.\n  It will be a shock to them economically and particularly since it \nwill be just a few days after the Christmas holiday. My legislation is \nvery simple. I am seeking to extend for an additional year the \nunemployment compensation program that has been in place for several \nyears. That will allow 1.3 million Americans to have some support as \nthey face a very difficult economy.\n  We have asked, as Democrats, that this UI proposal be part of the \nbudget negotiation. Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have \nmade the same request. It appears that will not be the case. So we have \nto seek a stand-alone legislative vehicle. That is why I proposed the \nlegislation as I have done today.\n  What we were trying to do, with the request that was just objected \nto, and what we have to do within 2 weeks is pass this legislation--so \nthe upcoming expiration does not allow us the time for the procedural \nprocess of committee deliberation and markup, et cetera. What we have \nto do is try to avoid a huge economic shock to 1.3 million Americans \nimmediately. There will be more after that. But as of December 28, if \nyou are on unemployment insurance, Federal unemployment insurance, you \nlose it.\n  In my State, that is 4,900 people celebrating New Year's Day by \nlosing their Federal unemployment insurance benefits; for families who \nare struggling just to keep their heads above water in a very difficult \neconomy--who have seen their jobs disappear, who after years of \ndedicated work find themselves now looking at very difficult \ncircumstances for employment, in my home State particularly, but not my \nhome State alone--this is a very difficult burden to bear.\n  So we have to act. That is why we are here this evening, to ask for \nimmediate consideration of my legislation to extend unemployment \ninsurance, not further review, but immediate consideration.\n  I think it is important to point out that the average weekly benefit \nis about $300 per week. This is not a program that people are using to \nenrich themselves by any means. This is basically keeping the heat on, \nkeeping some food on the table, maybe keeping the rent paid. Also, this \nis a program that people only qualify for after working and \nestablishing a work history.\n  So for all of these reasons, we are not talking about some lavish \nbenefit that is a windfall to Americans. This is something that can \nkeep families together. That is why I think we have to be willing, \nbeginning this evening, to get this program extended through next year \nat least.\n  There is another aspect to this too. Unemployment insurance is one of \nthe best countercyclical economic programs we have when it comes to \nFederal fiscal policy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nwith the expiration of UI, if we do not act, it will cost our economy \nnext year 200,000 jobs. It will cost us jobs if we do not act. It will \nslow economic growth by about .2 percent is their estimate.\n  So not only is this sensible, in fact the decent thing to do for \nmillions of families, it is the smart thing to do for our economy. \nBecause if we do not do it, we are literally seeing, under very \nrational estimates, 200,000 jobs disappear. What is the one thing \neverybody claims we need to do in this country right now? Put more \npeople back to work.\n  This extension has been scored at about $26 billion for the year. \nTraditionally, we have treated unemployment insurance as an emergency \nexpenditure. We have not offset it. That tradition has been abandoned \nrecently and we have had to come up with offsets. But there are \noffsets. There are tax loopholes that should be closed. There are \nprovisions that encourage companies to move jobs overseas that we can \nclose and pay for this.\n  There are other provisions that would stop subsidizing significant \nmultimillion dollar corporate benefits so American families can have a \nchance. These loopholes we have talked about--and many of my colleagues \ntalked about--they should be closed anyway. But if it helps pay for \nunemployment insurance, that is not only good, that is something that \nwould be a very positive step forward.\n  We need to extend these benefits not only for the individual families \nbut for the overall economy. We have to start immediately. We are \nrunning out of time. We have just 2 weeks. Nothing is more important \nthan getting people back to work. As I said, if we do not do this, we \nare going to see 200,000 jobs that are going to be forgone in the next \nyear. So this is about jobs, as well as it is about keeping families \ntogether and keeping them able to provide for their basic needs.\n  It is progrowth. It is smart. I hope we can come together and do it. \nI hope again--I appreciate certainly the objection of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. But I hope we can find a way to not object but to move \nforward together. The benefits cut across party lines. If you look at \nthe States that are suffering the most--as we all know, the \nunemployment compensation program is a tiered program. It depends upon \nthe level of unemployment in our States. But if you look at the States \nthat are suffering the most, and unfortunately I am going to have to \nsay Rhode Island is one of them. Nevada has the highest unemployment \nrate, 9.3. We are right behind them, 9.2 percent.\n  It has been 5 long years of unacceptable and elevated unemployment. \nIt has come down from above 10 percent, but it is still much too high. \nBut this is not a regional phenomenon. Illinois, 8.9 percent \nunemployment; Mississippi, 8.5 percent unemployment; Kentucky, 8.4 \npercent unemployment; North Carolina, 8 percent unemployment; Georgia, \n8.1 percent unemployment; Arizona, 8.2 percent unemployment. These are \ntough numbers. It is not concentrated in one place; it is across this \nentire country. This is not a red issue or a blue issue. This is an \nAmerican issue for workers who have worked and now cannot find jobs and \nneed support. There is something else that is important to mention; \nthat is, we have seen some progress on the jobs front. The last report \nshowed we actually grew last month, 203,000 jobs. That is the good \nnews. The bad news is despite this improvement, long-term unemployment \nremains high.\n  More than 4 million workers, 37 percent of those unemployed, were \njobless for 27 weeks or longer in November. So what we are seeing is \nsome short-term movement, but the longer term unemployment, the ones \nwho qualify for the Federal benefits, they are still finding it \nvirtually--very difficult, if not impossible, to find work.\n  That is exactly what this Federal program is designed to fix. Those \nlong-term unemployed who are in an environment, in a State where the \neconomy is not working as well as some other States. There are some \nStates that are doing exceptionally well. I am glad for them. But there \nare more, as I said before, who are experiencing unacceptably high \nunemployment rates.\n  This program started to take shape in its most recent incarnation in \nJune 2008, when President George W. Bush signed the program into law. \nWhen he did it, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent and the average \nduration of unemployment was 17.1 weeks. So we are looking now at a \nsituation that nationally and in many States is much higher than when \nwe initiated this program back in 2008.\n  Now is not the time to stop, and in order to get this done, we have \nto move expeditiously. There is not time for elaborate hearings. There \nis not time for conferences with the House. The House is proposing to \nleave this Friday. We have to move immediately.\n  Today, our national unemployment rate is 7 percent. The duration of \nunemployment is 37.2 weeks. That is 7 percent compared to 5.6 and 37.2 \nweeks compared to 17.1 weeks. We still need this program to help the \nfamilies of this Nation. We can't end it now. We have to move forward, \nparticularly during this holiday season.\n  The reality--and finally to make this point--is that people will be \nlooking at a new year coming with the knowledge that what little \nbenefit they are getting as they search for work--an average of $300 a \nweek--is gone. That is a tough reality, to look at your family on New \nYear's Day and understand that you don't have those resources.\n  So we have to act, and I hope we can.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my colleague and his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I objected earlier, and I want to express \nmy appreciation to the good Senator from Rhode Island. I understand his \nconcerns, but I want to take a minute just to explain the objection \nthat we have.\n  I don't think there is anyone in this Chamber who is indifferent to \nthe plight of the long-term unemployed. However, this legislation falls \nunder the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee and, as of yet, \nthe committee has not had the opportunity to consider it.\n  There are a number of concerns that Members on our side of the aisle \nhave with the legislation, most notably the price tag. According to the \nCBO, a full 1-year extension of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nProgram would cost $25 billion for a single year. That is the cost of \nthis bill, and the bill contains no offsets to cover that cost.\n  So the Senate Finance Committee needs to have an opportunity to \nconsider this legislation to find a way to pay for it. In addition, the \ncommittee needs to have an opportunity to consider alternatives. Rather \nthan simply providing additional benefits to the unemployed, hopefully \nwe can come up with something that really helps them get back to work. \nRepublicans are willing to consider such ideas and need to have an \nopportunity to do so through the committee process.\n  It is on that basis that I object to my colleague's unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I thank the Chair for the time and the courtesy of my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I certainly respect my colleague from North \nDakota for stating his principled position. I think we can both agree \non one thing: We have to start moving very quickly because this reality \nis moving very rapidly on 1.3 million Americans. I hope we can move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I too hope we can resolve the issue my \ncolleagues were just discussing. It is an important one for the \ncountry. We are very blessed in Louisiana to have a relatively low \nunemployment rate because our economy is doing so well, in large \nmeasure because of extraordinary new technologies, which I think the \nChair understands as well in Indiana, where they used to discover oil \nand gas, and particularly natural gas in places and in ways we never \nthought possible. That is creating a real resurgence of manufacturing \nin our State, and that is benefiting not only us and our neighbors \nalong the gulf coast, but it is benefiting States all over America.\n  The economic numbers, despite the great challenges we have here in \nthe Congress on our budget, on paying down our debt, on reducing our \nannual deficit, on procedural measures and how to run the Senate and \nwork more effectively on behalf of the people of all of our States, are \nreally quite good in\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nNorth Dakota, in South Dakota, in Texas, Louisiana, and other States. \nThey are experiencing really very low numbers of unemployment because \nthe jobs are plentiful. Our challenge is, just to comment briefly, on \ntraining the workforce we are going to need to fill all the jobs we \nhave. These are very good-paying jobs, some starting at $40,000 or \n$60,000 a year--construction, welders--going up to $125,000. Some are \ntemporary, but many of them will be permanent.\n  So I hope we can resolve this unemployment issue, because, \nunfortunately, in Senator Reed's State--the State of Rhode Island--and \nin 20 other States there is very high unemployment. In some States it \nmight still be over 9 percent. They are chronically unemployed because \nof the competition of globalization and other factors. So I think we \nhave to try to find a way to work together as a Nation. As I said, \nLouisiana is blessed to have relatively low unemployment, but we have a \nbig job skills training gap we are working on in our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8597-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVETERANS AFFAIRS MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY LEASE AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2013\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to actually talk a few minutes \nthis evening about a very important bill the House just passed by an \nextraordinary vote of 346 to 1. My colleague, Congressman Boustany in \nthe House, was the lead sponsor, and I want to really congratulate him \nfor his extraordinary work on this particular bill. It is something he \nand I have worked together on across party lines. He is a Republican \nand I am a Democrat, but we worked very closely together to get this \nentire bill passed not only for the benefit of Louisiana--which is \nshaded here on this chart as one of the States that would benefit--but \nwe can see here how many other States between 2013 and 2017 will be \naffected positively by the passage of this bill.\n  The bill is the Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Lease \nAuthorization Act. That is a mouthful, but it takes important action. \nIt basically uses the guidance of the Office of Management and Budget--\nwe received a letter from them at my request--and formulates a piece of \nlegislation that will allow the Veterans Administration to build \nclinics the way they have been building clinics for our veterans--who \nreally need the highest and best quality care--using a lease \narrangement.\n  The reason we had to pass this bill--and I will be working with \nSenator Vitter and many others to ask unanimous consent at the proper \ntime for this bill to pass through the Senate--is because about 6 years \nago there was an administrative ruling that basically stopped the \nability of the Veterans Affairs Department to be able to build these \nvery needed veterans clinics by using a lease.\n  Internally, the administration just decided to score it differently. \nThat threw lots of sand into the gears, and those gears have been stuck \nfor 6 years. In our State, veterans in Lafayette and in Lake Charles \nhave been waiting and waiting and waiting. We had some added \ncomplications, which the Veterans Administration has taken the blame \nfor, in that the bid process that was used initially for one of our \nclinics was defective and they had to throw it out.\n  But the end of this sad story is that a great bill passed the House \nof Representatives, literally just a few hours ago, and I wanted to \ncome to the floor to say how proud I am of Congressman Boustany and his \ndogged pursuit of justice. The district of Congressman Boustany is in \nthe part of the State where these two clinics will be built, in \nLafayette and Lake Charles, so I worked closely with him, as has \nSenator Vitter, to make sure we brought some clarity and focus to this \nissue in order to move forward. As the bill moved through to help us \nwith our problem, it turns out it is also going to help many other \nStates that are scheduled for veterans clinics.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Miller of Florida, who is the chair \nof the VA committee. He worked very closely with Congressman Boustany. \nAlso I want to thank Bernie Sanders, our Senator from Vermont who \nchairs our committee here. Senator Sanders--whose desk is right here, \nnext to mine--has been very supportive of this effort. While I am not \ngoing to ask unanimous consent at this moment, he and I have had a \ndiscussion earlier today about how strongly he supports this effort and \nhow much he wants to help us get this done.\n  There are 27 clinics in 22 States. This process--or nightmare, I \nshould say--began in Louisiana about 6 years ago. Four years ago the \nruling was made, but our legislation that was passed in the House will \noverride that and basically set us on a course that is both fiscally \nresponsible and so important to our veterans. We must honor the \npromises we made to them that we would provide clinics close enough so \nthey could access them and so they are not driving hundreds of miles \nfor regular care. We can be very smart in the way we design these \nleases so it will be a benefit to the taxpayer, a benefit to the \nveterans and it will really meet our obligation to them.\n  So again, the bill just passed the House, and tomorrow I will be \nasking unanimous consent, along with Senator Vitter, to move this bill, \nto get it to the President's desk and get it signed so that veterans \nwho have been waiting--particularly in our State--for so long will have \nsomething extra special to celebrate this Christmas holiday.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8597-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING SENATOR MURRAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a couple years ago I surprised everyone--but \nI didn't surprise myself--when I selected Patty Murray as chair of the \nsupercommittee. At the time Patty was chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, she was a member of the Budget Committee, and I thought she \nwould do a remarkably good job because I had such faith in her \nintegrity, her temperament, her wisdom, and her ability to get things \ndone.\n  The country should be so pleased with the work she was able to do on \na bipartisan basis with Paul Ryan. It is really a kind of \nunconventional pair working together to come up with a budget that we \ncan work on for 2 years. We have numbers now. I am very pleased that \nbudget negotiators Murray and Ryan have come up with an agreement today \nthat will roll back the painful arbitrary cuts of sequester and prevent \nanother costly government shutdown. I again commend Budget Committee \nchairman Patty Murray for making this possible. But it is also fair--\nand I hope this doesn't get him in trouble in the House--to say that \nChairman Ryan also worked hard. It was a compromise. We didn't get what \nwe wanted, they didn't get what they wanted, but that is what \nlegislation is all about--working together. ``Compromise'' is not a bad \nword.\n  We believed all along that Congress should set sound fiscal policy \nthrough the regular order of the budget process and not through \nhostage-taking or crisis-making. We will have a lot more to say about \nthis in the days to come, but this is a good day for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8597-3", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nInternational Human Rights Day. Sixty-five years ago, on December 10, \n1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, which serves as a foundation for human \nrights initiatives internationally, and is an enduring guide for human \nrights advocates around the globe.\n  On this annual celebration of International Human Rights Day we all\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nmourn with heavy hearts the loss of Nelson Mandela, a man who devoted \nhis life to promoting human rights, freedom, and harmony.\n  Humanity has lost one of its greatest leaders with the passing of \nMadiba, or ``father,'' as he was lovingly called. My prayers go out to \nhis family and all the people of South Africa. He was a personal hero \nof mine, and of those who work to uphold human rights around the world. \nHe led his nation not only in overcoming the divisions of racism, but \nin reconciling and healing. Throughout his life Nelson Mandela never \nstopped fighting for the oppressed, speaking out for the voiceless, and \ngiven hope to the hopeless. One of the greatest leaders may have left \nthis world but the lessons he taught us about human dignity, sacrifice, \nperseverance, and perhaps the most powerful lesson of all--\nforgiveness--will live on forever.\n  In 1964, Nelson Mandela was convicted of treason and sentenced to \nlife in prison for his part in the fight for racial equality in \napartheid South Africa. At his trial Mandela said:\n\n       I have fought against white domination, and I have fought \n     against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a \n     democratic and free society in which all persons live \n     together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an \n     ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs \n     be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\n\n  Thankfully Mandela did not die during his years of imprisonment, and \ninstead after enduring the unthinkable with grace and dignity, he \nemerged to lead a country to self determination, reconciliation, and \nforgiveness.\n  In 1990, when Nelson Mandela was finally released after 10,000 days \nof imprisonment, his spirit was stronger than ever. Ten thousand days \nin prison were not enough to break his spirit and his devotion to the \nfreedom of all people. In his autobiography, Mandela wrote ``. . . to \nbe free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way \nthat respects and enhances the freedom of others.''\n  And that he did. His democratic ideals were unwavering. He led by \nexample, living a relatively modest life, refusing to reside in the \npresidential mansion, and serving only one term as South Africa's first \nblack President.\n  Mandela's influence on the continent, and indeed around the world, \ndoes not end with his passing. His story and moral courage has changed \ncountless lives forever. As he once said, ``the true test of our \ndevotion to freedom is just beginning.'' State and Federal lawmakers \nacross the United States looked to Mandela as an inspiration when \ncrafting laws that mandated divestment from South Africa's cruel \nApartheid regime. I had the privilege of serving as speaker of the \nMaryland House of Delegates when we passed such legislation. Years \nlater, our Nation is still striving to follow in Mandela's footsteps \nand fully realize his dream of peace and equality for all of mankind.\n  As President Obama said, Mandela ``took history in his hands, and \nbent the arc of the moral universe toward justice.'' And so on this \nInternational Human Rights Day, we pay tribute to the great Madiba, the \nfather of a free and peaceful South Africa, a legendary African, and a \nshining example for future generations of change-makers who have \ninherited a better world because of his great deeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8598-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARY ELLEN McCARTHY\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, when people think of government, \nsome of the first words that may come to mind are politics and \nbureaucracy, two things that tend to stifle progress. Today, however, I \nhave the great pleasure of honoring someone who has spent her many \nyears on the Hill overcoming these barriers. She has implemented \nchanges and fixed problems to improve the lives of veterans and their \nfamilies in a very real way. Now, as she moves into retirement, she \nleaves behind an example to which we should all aspire.\n  Mary Ellen McCarthy has spent the last 7 years of her distinguished \ncareer serving as the lead investigator for the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs and the decade before that as staff director for two \nsubcommittees of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. In that \ntime, she has visited nearly every Department of Veterans Affairs \nregional office and reviewed thousands of benefits claims. She has not \nonly identified gaps in services to veterans and their families, but \nalso problems within VA. Most importantly, Mary Ellen never rested with \nthe identification of a problem. Instead, she found solutions to meet \nthe needs of veterans and their families and worked relentlessly to \nensure they were put into place as quickly as possible.\n  Among her many achievements, Mary Ellen will be forever recognized \nfor her extraordinary work in ensuring Vietnam era veterans and their \nfamilies receive the benefits to which they are entitled. She has \nworked tirelessly to identify the many veterans whose exposure to \ndangerous toxins was previously overlooked. Her efforts have helped \nveterans with service on the inland waterways of Vietnam, along the DMZ \nin Korea, and on the perimeters of Air Force Bases in Thailand. Her \nwork has led to vindication and assistance to those suffering from \nhealth problems related to Agent Orange exposure. Her efforts did not \nstop with the veterans themselves, however. She also brought attention \nto the children who are born with spina bifida, as a result of their \nparents' exposure to Agent Orange.\n  So much of Mary Ellen's work has focused on those most in need--\nelderly and low-income veterans and surviving family members. For \nexample, one of Mary Ellen's investigations revealed the surviving \nspouses of veterans who had been receiving VA disability benefits were \nnot receiving the payments to which they were entitled during the month \nof their spouse's passing. These payments not only help with funeral \ncosts, but provide some time to make other financial arrangements. Her \ndiscovery of this oversight and subsequent actions resulted in \napproximately 200,000 surviving spouses receiving more than $124 \nmillion in benefits, allowing them to focus on moving forward after the \ndeath of a loved one.\n  Mary Ellen has also been heavily involved in working toward \nelimination of the claims backlog, a challenge that has plagued the \nDepartment for decades and caused far too many veterans unnecessary \nhardship. Before she came to Capitol Hill, she spent two decades \nworking as a nurse and then a lawyer, helping low-income and elderly \nindividuals obtain government benefits. This experience gave her a \nunique insight into the challenges of claims processing and she has \nbeen able to offer a number of solutions that may otherwise have been \noverlooked.\n  These are just a few examples of the very real contributions Mary \nEllen has made to the veterans community throughout her career. To \nthose who have had the pleasure of working with her, Mary Ellen has \nbeen an inspiration--working tirelessly to provide assistance to those \nwho have served this great Nation--a true veterans' advocate.\n  As she enters into her much deserved retirement, she can rest easy \nknowing her efforts will continue benefiting veterans and their \nfamilies for generations to come, which is, as she is known to say, not \nbad for an old lady.\n  Mary Ellen, thank you for your years of advocacy on behalf of our \nNation's veterans. I wish you only the best in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8598-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8598-S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SIMEON BOOKER\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Simeon Booker as he \nreceives an honorary doctor of letters from Youngstown State University \non December 15, 2013. Mr. Booker has devoted his life's work to \nchronicling the history of the civil rights movement in America.\n  As an African-American college student in the 1940s and 1950s, Mr. \nBooker experienced discrimination firsthand at what was then Youngstown \nCollege. Refusing to accept the indignities he found there, he \ntransferred to Virginia Union University where he continued to champion \nthe rights of Black students.\n  Early in his career, he was hired by his hometown newspaper, the \nYoungstown Vindicator, where he would write local columns focused on \nthe city's African-American population and summaries for the local \nBlack baseball leagues. He went on to work for the Cleveland Call and \nPost and was offered the esteemed Nieman Fellowship at Harvard \nUniversity in the 1950s.\n  Mr. Booker became the first Black reporter for the Washington Post in\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\n1952, and also wrote for Jet and Ebony magazines. Mr. Booker was \nwitness to the rise of the great civil rights leaders of that time--\nMartin Luther King, Jr., the Kennedy brothers, Whitney Young, and many \nothers. He wrote about Martin Luther King's nonviolent movement for \ncivil rights, and covered the 1963 March on Washington.\n  Mr. Booker has received recognition from his peers, having been \nawarded both the Newspaper Guild Award and the Wilkie Award. As a \njournalist, he became the first African-American to win the National \nPress Club's Fourth Estate Award in 1982. He most recently authored \n``Shocking the Conscience: A Reporter's account of the Civil Rights \nMovement,'' an account of a half-century of American history. Earlier \nthis year, he was inducted into the National Association of Black \nJournalists Hall of Fame.\n  I would like to honor Simeon Booker for his lifetime contributions to \nour country in the fields of journalism and civil rights and \ncongratulate him on his recognition at Youngstown State University.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8599-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RECOGNIZING JOEL DEFEBAUGH\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Tom Carper, \nCongressman John Carney and myself, I rise today to recognize the Aetna \nHose Hook & Ladder Company and its many volunteers and leadership who, \non December 17, 2013, will celebrate the 125th anniversary of the \ncompany's founding in 1888.\n  For more than a century, Aetna has provided exemplary firefighting \nand lifesaving services for residents of Newark, DE. From its humble \nbeginnings at the turn of the century, when the company consisted of a \nsimple, hand-drawn hose cart, the Aetna Hose Hook & Ladder Company has \ngrown to incorporate 5 stations, 17 trucks, and hundreds of members \ndedicated to ``service for others.''\n  Prior to 1888, residents were forced to combat fires on their own, \nuntil a fire in a woolen mill resulted in the loss of 800 jobs. The \ndisaster prompted the town council to call for the creation of a town \nfire company. Founded on December 17, 1888 at a meeting of 30 town \ncitizens, Aetna Hose Hook & Ladder Company's first leadership group \nincluded John A. Mullin as chairman, Isaac J. Moore as secretary, \nWilliam H. Simpers as president, and Joseph T. Willis as foreman--the \n19th century term for fire chief. Dues for active members began at $1, \nwhile contributing members paid $2 per year. The company was \nincorporated on December 13, 1889, with 57 charter members.\n  During its humble first years, Aetna's fire alarm system consisted of \nringing Catholic Church, academy and college bells. In 1893, the \ncompany purchased its first hose carriage and in 1901, it received its \nfirst $250 appropriation from the town of Newark, prompting a \ncelebratory parade.\n  The fire company soon became an integral part of the Newark \ncommunity, hosting banquets, carnivals, and bingo nights to raise money \nfor equipment and firefighting gear. Formed in 1949, the Aetna Ladies \nAuxiliary has provided unwavering support for the company's members, \nfrom fundraising to providing hot meals for firefighters and their \nguests.\n  Today, Aetna is proud to be home to more than 20 highly decorated \nfirefighters, EMS, and EMT members. Recent citations include Heroic EMT \nof the Year to Jeff Evans, Eric Barsky, Paul Testa, Steve Walls, and \nGarland Church, and Lt. John P. Murphy; EMT of the Year to Rob \n``Dusty'' Sweetman, Joshua Rainey, Michael Shao, Kevin Eichinger, \nTheodorica Cenizal, Ann Gillespie, Arman Fardanesh, Laurel Petchel, and \nMelanie Patnaude; and Lifetime Achievement in EMS Awards to Diane \nSilverman, E. David Bailey, and Gene Niland. Aetna is also the home to \n12 EMS Top Responders, including 4-time winner Eric B. Barsky.\n  The Delaware congressional delegation is proud to recognize the Aetna \nHose Hook & Ladder Company and its team of first responders for 125 \nyears of honorable service to the community of Newark, DE.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8600-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3627.

A bill to close out expired, empty grant accounts; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Grants \nOversight and New Efficiency Act or the GONE Act. This legislation \nwould require federal agencies to close out expired grant accounts with \nan empty balance.\n  ``U.S. government spends $890,000 on nothing''--it sounds like a bad \njoke, but it is no laughing matter. The Washington Post recently \nreported, ``This year, the government will spend at least $890,000 on \nservice fees for bank accounts that are empty. At last count, Uncle Sam \nhas 13,712 such accounts with a balance of zero.''\n  According to an official government report, the Government \nAccountability Office, GA0, reported last year that the Payment \nManagement System, the largest civilian payment system for grants \nmanaged by the Department of Health and Services, was charged $173,000 \nto maintain the Department of Health and Human Services' 28,000 expired \ngrant accounts with a zero balance. Furthermore, the GAO estimates that \nif federal agencies were billed for the entire year, maintaining \nexpired grant accounts with a zero balance for the entire year would \ncost $2 million in fees.\n  To tackle this problem, I am introducing the GONE Act, a bill with a \ncommonsense goal: to increase accountability. My legislation would \nrequire the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and \nEfficiency to submit a report to Congress and the agency head including \na list of each expired, empty grant account held by the Federal \nGovernment, recommend which grant accounts should be immediately \nclosed, and for those grant accounts that have been expired for more \nthan 90 days, to explain why it has not been closed out. It would also \nrequire the agency head to close out the expired, empty grant accounts \nand to update the Council on whether the grant accounts were closed. \nAdditionally, the bill would require the Council to submit a follow-up \nreport to Congress and the committees of jurisdiction on the status of \ngrant accounts identified for closure.\n  While the fees currently spent on expired grant accounts may seem \nlike a drop in the bucket, it nonetheless proves there is plenty of fat \nto trim. At a time when our country faces serious fiscal challenges and \na soaring $17 trillion national debt, these fiscal blunders are more \nthan foolish--they are dangerously irresponsible. This example of \ngovernment waste underscores the critical importance of proper \ncongressional oversight of federal agencies and their funding.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in \nsupporting this simple, commonsense legislation to cut wasteful \nspending and help bring greater accountability to Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8603-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8603-S8604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 314--COMMEMORATING AND SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF WORLD \n                                AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 314\n\n       Whereas an estimated 35,000,000 people are living with HIV/\n     AIDS in 2013;\n       Whereas Target 6a of the United Nations Millennium \n     Development Goals is to halt and begin to reverse the spread \n     of HIV/AIDS by 2015;\n       Whereas the 2001 United Nations Declaration of Commitment \n     on HIV/AIDS Global mobilized global attention and commitment \n     to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and set out a series of national \n     targets and global actions to reverse the epidemic;\n       Whereas the 2011 United Nations Political Declaration on \n     HIV and AIDS provided an updated framework for intensified \n     efforts to eliminate HIV and AIDS, including redoubling \n     efforts to achieve by 2015 universal access to HIV \n     prevention, treatment, care, and support, and to eliminate \n     gender inequalities and gender-based abuse and violence and \n     increase the capacity of women and adolescent girls to \n     protect themselves from the risk of HIV infection;\n       Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n     Malaria was launched in 2002 and, as of November 2013, \n     supported programs in more than 140 countries that provided \n     antiretroviral therapy to 6,100,000 people living with HIV/\n     AIDS and antiretrovirals to 2,100,000 pregnant women to \n     prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS to their babies;\n       Whereas the United States is the largest donor to the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria;\n       Whereas, for every dollar contributed to the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria by the United States, an \n     additional $2 is leveraged from other donors;\n       Whereas the United States hosted the Global Fund's Fourth \n     Voluntary Replenishment Conference on December 2-3, 2013;\n       Whereas the United States President's Emergency Plan for \n     AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), introduced by President George W. Bush \n     in 2003, remains the largest commitment in history by any \n     nation to combat a single disease;\n       Whereas, as of the end of September 2012, PEPFAR supported \n     treatment for 5,100,000 people, up from 1,700,000 in 2008, \n     and in 2012, PEPFAR supported provision of antiretroviral \n     drugs to 750,000 pregnant women living with HIV to prevent \n     the transmission of HIV from mother to baby during birth;\n       Whereas PEPFAR directly supported HIV testing and \n     counseling for more than 46,500,000 people in fiscal year \n     2012;\n       Whereas considerable progress has been made in the fight \n     against HIV/AIDS, with total new HIV infections estimated at \n     2,300,000 in 2012, a 33 percent reduction since 2001; new HIV \n     infections among children reduced to 260,000 in 2012, a \n     reduction of 52 percent since 2001; and AIDS-related deaths \n     reduced to 1,600,000 in 2012, a 30 percent reduction since \n     2005;\n       Whereas increased access to anti-retroviral drugs is the \n     major contributor to the reduction in deaths from HIV/AIDS, \n     and HIV treatment reinforces prevention because it reduces, \n     by up to 96 percent, the chance the virus can be spread;\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\n       Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) has revised its \n     guidelines for determining whether HIV positive individuals \n     are eligible for treatment, thereby increasing the number of \n     individuals eligible for treatment from about 15,000,000 to \n     28,000,000;\n       Whereas 9,700,000 people in low- and middle-income \n     countries had access to antiretroviral therapy by the end of \n     2012, an increase of nearly 20 percent in a year;\n       Whereas an estimated 50 percent of those living with HIV do \n     not know their status, according to a 2012 UNAIDS report;\n       Whereas sub-Saharan Africa remains the epicenter of the \n     epidemic, accounting for 1,200,000 of the 1,600,000 deaths \n     from HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas stigma, gender inequality, and lack of respect for \n     the rights of HIV positive individuals remain significant \n     barriers to access to services for those most at risk of HIV \n     infection;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama voiced commitment to \n     realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation and his \n     belief that the goal was within reach in his February 2013 \n     State of the Union address;\n       Whereas the international community is united in pursuit of \n     achieving the goal of an AIDS-free generation by 2015;\n       Whereas international donor funding has held steady since \n     2008 and countries affected by the epidemic are increasingly \n     taking responsibility for funding and sustaining programs in \n     their countries, currently accounting for approximately 53 \n     percent of global HIV/AIDS resources;\n       Whereas December 1 of each year is internationally \n     recognized as World AIDS Day; and\n       Whereas, in 2013, World AIDS Day commemorations focused on: \n     ``[g]etting to zero: zero new HIV infections, zero \n     discrimination, zero AIDS-related deaths'': Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World AIDS Day, \n     including getting to zero through zero new HIV infections, \n     zero discrimination, and zero AIDS-related deaths;\n       (2) applauds the goals and approaches for achieving an \n     AIDS-free generation set forth in the PEPFAR Blueprint: \n     Creating an AIDS-free Generation, as well as the targets set \n     by United Nations member states in the 2011 United Nations \n     Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS;\n       (3) commends the dramatic progress in global AIDS programs \n     supported through the efforts of PEPFAR, the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNAIDS;\n       (4) urges, in order to ensure that an AIDS-free generation \n     is within reach, rapid action towards--\n       (A) full implementation of the Global Plan Towards the \n     Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and \n     Keeping Their Mothers Alive to build on progress made to \n     date; and\n       (B) further expansion and scale-up of antiretroviral \n     treatment programs, including efforts to reduce disparities \n     and improve access for children to life-saving medications;\n       (5) calls for scaling up treatment to reach all individuals \n     eligible for treatment under WHO guidelines;\n       (6) calls for greater focus on HIV/AIDS vulnerabilities of \n     women and girls, including more directed efforts to ensure \n     that they are connected to the information, care, and \n     treatment they require;\n       (7) supports efforts to ensure inclusive access to programs \n     and human rights protections for all those most at risk of \n     HIV/AIDS and hardest to reach;\n       (8) encourages additional private-public partnerships to \n     research and develop better and more affordable tools for the \n     diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and cure of HIV;\n       (9) supports continued leadership by the United States in \n     bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to fight \n     HIV;\n       (10) encourages and supports greater degrees of ownership \n     and shared responsibility by developing countries in order to \n     ensure sustainability of their domestic responses;

Mr. President, tonight the Senate passed by unanimous \nconsent a clean extension of the authority the Supreme Court Police use \nto protect Supreme Court Justices, their employees, and guests when \nthey leave the Supreme Court grounds. I have worked with my \ncounterparts in the House for months to move this extension without \namendments because that authority is set to expire at the end of this \nmonth. Last month, the House voted by an overwhelming majority of 399 \nto 3 to pass this bipartisan bill, which extends the Supreme Court \nPolice's authority to protect Supreme Court Justices, their staff, and \nofficial guests off Supreme Court grounds through 2019. Congress has \nprovided this authority since the 1980s, to ensure the continued safety \nof our Supreme Court Justices and their employees.\n  Threats to the safety of Supreme Court Justices are a threat to our \ndemocracy. In light of recent attacks of Justices off the grounds of \nthe Supreme Court, it was all the more imperative that we pass this \nextension without delay. I look forward to President Obama signing this \nbill into law and thank the chairman and ranking member of the House \nJudiciary Subcommittee on the Courts, Representatives Coble and Watt, \nas well as Representatives Conyers, Marino, and Holding for working \nwith me to ensure enactment of this extension.\n  The Senate also passed by unanimous consent a bipartisan bill to \nreorganize Mississippi's Southern District from five divisions to four \ndivisions, which was recommended by Chief Judge Louis Guirola of the \nSouthern District of Mississippi. This realignment will allow the \nSouthern District to absorb the counties formerly served by a now-\nclosed courthouse in Meridian, and the District will be able to better \nserve the needs of litigants, jurors, the bar, and the general public.\n  This commonsense piece of legislation promotes efficiency and saves \nmoney in the Southern District of Mississippi. I thank Representatives \nCoble and Watt for sponsoring this important improvement and look \nforward to its swift enaction.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/10/senate-section/article/S8605-4", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8605-S8606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORIZING DOCUMENT PRODUCTION\n\n  Mr. REID.
