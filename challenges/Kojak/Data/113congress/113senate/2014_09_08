Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 471.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to calendar No. 471, S.J. Res. 19, a \n     joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States relating to contributions and \n     expenditures intended to affect elections.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 5:30 p.m. this evening. During that period of time until 5:30 \np.m. Senators will be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled by the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  At 5:30 p.m. the Senate will proceed to a rollcall vote and \nconfirmation of a nomination to fill the vacancy in the Eleventh \nCircuit--Jill Pryor. Following the disposition of the Pryor nomination, \nthere will be a rollcall vote on the nomination of Henry J. Aaron to be \na member of the Social Security Advisory Board, followed by three voice \nvotes in relation to Aaron, Cohen, and Chen.\n  Following disposition of these nominations, the Senate will proceed \nto a rollcall vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Therefore, Senators should expect up to three rollcall votes after \n5:30 p.m.\n\n\n                            Senator Hollings\n\n  The President pro tempore and I served for a long time with the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, Fritz Hollings, who retired. \nDealing with the constitutional amendment was his issue, and I can \nremember seeing this dignified, handsome, very articulate Senator \ntalking about its importance. Before he left he spoke on this on many \noccasions. So it brings back memories--all very positive--about the \ngood work that this man did before he left. By the way, he is still \nstrong and vibrant, 90 years old or thereabouts, still playing tennis \nand as strong as we knew him when he was here.\n\n\n        Measures Placed on the Calendar--H.R. 5230 and H.R. 5272\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are two bills at the desk due for a \nsecond reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the \nsecond time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5230) making supplemental appropriations for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other \n     purposes.\n       A bill (H.R. 5272) to prohibit certain actions with respect \n     to deferred action for aliens not lawfully present in the \n     United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings as to \nboth of these bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The bills will be placed on the \ncalendar.\n\n\n                         Must Pass Legislation\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the Senate returns from the State work \nperiod, we have a number of vitally important matters that require our \nattention. I only mention a few of them. There is a lot more than this. \nThe matters coming out of the Judiciary Committee alone would fill this \nwhole page and more, but we have been stopped from doing virtually \neverything for the last two Congresses, and so we are not getting much \ndone. But I will mention a few of them.\n  We need to pass appropriations legislation to keep the government \nfrom shutting down as it has in the past because of the obstruction of \nthe Republicans. We need to pass the extension of the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act; we need\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\nto reauthorize the Export-Import Bank; we need to pass the Travel \nPromotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act, which was overwhelmingly \npassed by the House a short time ago; and we need to reconsider the \nissues of college affordability and equal pay for women.\n  But the bill before us today is Senator Udall's and Senator Bennet's \nconstitutional amendment. The good Senators from New Mexico and \nColorado have joined together on a very important issue and we are \ngoing to consider that. The first vote will be tonight.\n  We have had in this country a flood of very dark money coming into \nthis Nation's political system which is threatening to tear apart the \nfabric of American democracy. During the 2012 Presidential campaign, \noutside groups spent about $1 billion. That is about as much spending \nas took place in the previous 10 elections combined.\n  Last year was a Presidential election, so the money this year is \nfocused on the Senate and House races. They will again break all \nrecords. This spike in the amount of money being pumped into elections \nis not surprising, as alarming as it is. Recent decisions rendered by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court in the Citizens United and McCutcheon cases have \ndestroyed our campaign finance laws and have left the American people \nwith the status quo in which radical billionaires are attempting to buy \nour democracy.\n  Meanwhile, hard-working families who don't have endless funds to dump \ninto political campaigns are expected to sit on the sidelines and watch \nas two brothers try to fix every election in America to their liking. \nAnd when I say every election--they are involved in elections in the \nState of Virginia--not for the Senate, but they are involved in that, I \nam sure, too--but for secretaries of State, and State legislative races \nin Vermont. All over the country they are spending money as if there is \nno end to it, and I guess with them there is no end to it.\n  Hard-working families, though, don't have those endless funds to dump \ninto political campaigns. So they just sit on the sidelines and watch. \nWhen I say that Americans are watching the Koch brothers trying to \ninfluence November elections, I mean that literally.\n  Last week it was reported that Charles and David Koch and their \npolitical empire have funded 44,000 political ads for television so far \nduring this election cycle--44,000. But that doesn't count money they \nhide in other organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and other \norganizations' ads they helped fund. But we can identify directly \nCharles and David Koch with 44,000 separate 30-second TV spots.\n  Putting that in perspective, if for 16 days there was nothing else on \ntelevision except their 44,000 ads, the 30-second ads would run for 16 \nconsecutive days, 24 hours a day. That is 16 consecutive days, around-\nthe-clock, 30-second political ads, and that is just from them. \nImagine--16 consecutive days of nonstop political ads, no 24-hour news \ncoverage, no ESPN, no football games, no baseball games, no \nSportsCenter, no reality television, no anything--just the Koch \nbrothers' paid ads and deceitful messaging all day, everyday for more \nthan 2 weeks. This is the political environment that the Citizens \nUnited decision has hatched. It is a society inundated by the wrath of \npolitical misgivings and I guess some of the musings of the two \nbillionaire brothers. They are multibillionaires.\n  While the Kochs and other special interests are using their vast \nresources to make their voices heard, Americans are being \nsystematically disenfranchised from our democracy. To say that is wrong \nis a gross understatement. I don't know how else to say it. Our \ninvolvement with the government should not be dependent on somebody's \ncheckbook. The American people reject the notion that money gives \nbillionaires, corporations or special interests a greater voice in the \ngovernment than our own voice, the voice of the voters. The American \nvoter believes, as I do, that the Constitution doesn't give \ncorporations a vote, and it doesn't give them--because of the dollars \nthey have--extra votes.\n  The only people who don't see it that way are the Republicans here in \nCongress. They see money as speech. In fact, the Republican leader has \nsaid: ``In our society spending is speech.''\n  If spending is speech, where does that leave the rest of the American \npeople? Should their role in democracy be diminished because they are \npaying a mortgage and sending kids to college? Should a family hard hit \nby a recession--let's say they are out of work--does that mean they \nshouldn't have any say at the ballot box? Should families hard hit by \nthe recession take a back seat in our government to a couple of \nbillionaires? Right now the answer is yes.\n  How could everyday American families afford to have their voices \nheard if spending money is speech? Families cannot compete with \nbillionaires. Rich families can't, poor families can't, working \nfamilies can't. The only people that would have a vote are these \nmegabillionaires who are trying to buy our country.\n  They are trying to buy America at every level of government. Why? \nBecause they want to make more money. They control vast amounts of tar \nsands, oil, gas, coal, chemicals, and on and on. They want to make more \nmoney. What they have now is not enough.\n  So we are faced with a choice: We can keep the status quo or we can \nchange the system and restore the fundamental principle of one \nAmerican, one vote.\n  When I was in law school one of the classes I had sent us over to the \nSupreme Court to listen to an argument--Baker v. Carr. The decision was \non one man, one vote; one woman, one vote. I didn't realize that when I \nwas there listening. Frankly, I didn't really understand a lot of the \ntalk that went on before the Supreme Court, but I came to learn later. \nI have been in public office now for a few years, and I can remember \nthe first time I ran for the State legislature in Nevada. Clark County, \nwhere Las Vegas is, was really growing at the time, but they had not \ntotally reapportioned the State. They had done a little. Clark County \nis only 1 of 17 counties. They had 9 incumbent assemblymen. So I ran \nagainst those 9 incumbent assemblymen. Now the assemblymen run in \nsingle districts because reapportionment has taken place because of \nBaker v. Carr. When I was elected in the legislature one person, one \nvote did not apply. They hadn't completed that work yet. So I do \nbelieve that we should be a society where one vote equals one person.\n  Corporations should not have a vote and dollar bills should not have \na vote. But that is where we are now. We are faced with a choice: Keep \nthe status quo or change it. Senators Udall of New Mexico and Bennet of \nColorado want to change this system. Their constitutional amendment is \nabout restoring freedom of speech for everyone in America. Whether you \nare a billionaire, a millionaire, upper middle class, middle class, \nlower middle class, poor, homeless--that is for whom we are fighting. \nIt grants Congress the authority to regulate and limit the raising and \nspending of money for Federal political campaigns.\n  Senators Udall and Bennet's amendment will rein in the massive \nspending of super PACs, which has grown exponentially since the Supreme \nCourt's misguided decision in Citizens United. It also provides States \nwith the authority to institute campaign spending limits at the State \nlevel, which they should have a right to do. This is common sense. It \nis a solution to an issue that is plaguing our political system. Yet, \ninstead of joining with us to expel the undue influence of special \ninterests from our government, Senate Republicans are doing their best \nto keep the status quo. What they are going to do, Mr. President--we \nare going to have a cloture vote tonight to stop debate on this, and \nthey say: Well, great. We will go ahead and support that because we can \nstall.\n  They want us to not be able to do anything here. Remember, their \nwhole political mantra is this: We have a Democratic President; we have \na Democratic Senate. And they have done their best for the 6 years of \nthe Obama administration to stop everything. That is what they agreed \nto do--stop everything. They have two goals: not allow the President to \nbe reelected--they failed there miserably. During the first Congress of \nhis Presidency, we had a lot of Democratic Senators so we were able to \nget a lot done during that time, but in the last two\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nthey have been experts at stalling everything. That is what they are \ngoing to do again today.\n  But we are going to go ahead and vote on this tonight, and we are \ngoing to vote on it again Wednesday. There will be no amendments. It is \nnot a difficult issue. You are either for campaign spending reform or \nnot. So my Republican colleagues can stall for time. We are going to be \nvery patient. We are going to see if there is a single Republican who \nbelieves an election in America today should be determined by how much \nmoney you have. That is what this vote is all about.\n  I am going to move this legislation forward regardless of any \nRepublican obstruction because this issue is important. Simply put, \nthis constitutional amendment is what we need to bring back sanity to \nelections and restore Americans' confidence in our democracy. We must \noverturn the status quo created by the Supreme Court and instead put in \nplace a system that works for all Americans, not just the richest of \nthe rich.\n  It is such a shame what this Republican-driven tea party has done in \nCongress to try to stop everything. Virtually everything is a \nfilibuster. I do not know how much longer the American people are going \nto put up with it. These are artificial numbers anyway. Should not we \nbe a democracy? We are not because everything in this Senate requires \n60 votes. That is not the way of the Founding Fathers. And, of course, \na number of the Founding Fathers were from the Presiding Officer's \nState. None from Nevada; we were not a State. But the Founding Fathers \nmust be turning over in their graves. They must be looking down at this \nand saying: What in the world are they doing to our country?\n  We must overturn the status quo. This is what the entire issue boils \ndown to: whether our democracy, as President Lincoln said, is a \n``government of the people, by the people and for the people.'' That is \nwhat Lincoln said, and we know that is what he meant--or as we have it \ntoday: a government of the rich, by the rich, and exclusively for the \nrich.\n  Is America for sale? The American people want change. They want their \nplace in government to be protected. The constitutional amendment \nbefore the Senate protects working families. It protects Americans. It \nprotects their voice and participation in government because our \nvoice--not the wealth of a few--is the very essence of American \ndemocracy.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know we are going to hold our first vote \nrelevant to S.J. Res. 19 later today, so let me speak about that for a \nfew minutes. It is a constitutional amendment. It is something rare \nhere, but this would restore to Congress and the States the authority \nto set reasonable limits on contributions and expenditures in our \nelections. The amendment would also allow Congress and the States to \ndistinguish between natural persons and corporations when shaping \nlegislation regarding the financing of elections.\n  Both the States and the national government have exercised this power \nfor a long time in a responsible way until a narrow majority of Supreme \nCourt justices ignored history, and, worse than that, they ignored the \nCourt's own precedent. These Court opinions have now eviscerated \ncampaign finance laws, and they have invited corruption into our \npolitical system. If we do not respond, we will continue on a path back \nto the days when only the wealthy few had access to our government. If \nwe do not respond, corruption will flourish and hard-working Americans \nwill lose any remaining faith they have in their elected officials. So \nI believe it is time to restore some sanity to our campaign finance \nlaws but also to restore the true meaning and intent of the First \nAmendment.\n  I came to the Senate in January 1975, in the wake of the Watergate \nscandal. Americans were voicing concerns about the integrity and \nhonesty of their elected leaders. They were concerned about the \ncorrupting influence of anonymous money flowing into elections. The \npublic's confidence in our democratic institutions was at a low point, \nso Congress passed the 1976 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign \nAct. As a freshman Senator--in fact, the junior most Member of the \nSenate--I was proud to vote for this law.\n  Decades later Democrats and Republicans again came together in 2002 \nto pass the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. It targeted \nthe use of soft money donations and the unlimited spending that could \nbe done anonymously, used to finance attack ads before an election. \nJust as we did in the wake of Watergate, our bipartisan effort \nrecognized the need to pass important campaign finance reforms to \nprotect our democracy from corruption and to preserve access to our \npopular democracy.\n  But it appears today that many of our elected officials and a narrow \nmajority of the U.S. Supreme Court no longer even acknowledge the \ncorrosive influence of unfettered, anonymous money flowing in to fund \nour elections. Anonymous money--somebody can try to buy an election, \nand they do not even have to put their fingerprints on it. They just \nspend the money. They can say it is the Committee to Bring Honesty and \nOpenness to Government even though it might be funded by a group who \nwants just the opposite.\n  Over the last decade a slim majority of the Supreme Court has issued \none dreadful campaign finance decision after another. In fact, in 2010, \nin a 5-to-4 ruling--five Republicans on the Supreme Court--in Citizens \nUnited, the Court reversed a century of precedent by declaring that \ncorporations have a First Amendment right to spend endlessly to finance \nand influence elections. In effect, they said corporations were people. \nI have said this many times before, and sometimes people chuckle, but \nstop and think about it. This country elected General Eisenhower as \nPresident. If you really listen to what the Supreme Court said, we \ncould elect General Electric to be President or General Motors to be \nPresident.\n  In this past year the same five Justices held that aggregate limits \non campaign contributions are now somehow a violation of the First \nAmendment. In other words, if you are running in a local election \nsomewhere where people would normally spend $300 or $400, but it is \ncritical because that local board may decide what the tax policy of a \nbig corporation might be in that community, they could say: OK, people \nrunning the board are going to spend $300 or $400 each. We will just \nput $1 million in to elect a different board that will give us a $10 \nmillion tax break.\n  The Court's radical reinterpretation of the First Amendment \ncontradicts the principles of freedom, equality, and self-government \nupon which this Nation was founded. The consequence of the Court's \nopinions is that a small, tiny minority of very wealthy individuals and \nspecial interests are drowning out the voices of hard-working Americans \nand skewing our electoral process. What they are saying is: I have \nmillions of dollars. I have a voice in elections. You? You are just an \naverage hard-working man or woman, and you do not have any voice.\n  The expressed justification for time-honored campaign finance laws \nhas been a genuine concern about the corrupting influence of money in \npolitics. But despite this well-founded concern, Justice Kennedy's \nopinion in Citizens United nonsensically confined corruption to mean \nonly quid pro quo corruption or bribery. In doing so, these five \nJustices discarded what our very\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nFounders understood to be the meaning of corruption. They have also \nrejected the definition of corruption upon which this Court has \nhistorically relied. As recently as 2003 when the Court initially \nupheld the McCain-Feingold Act before striking much of it down later, \nthe Court stated:\n\n       In speaking of `improper influence' and opportunities for \n     abuse' in addition to `quid pro quo arrangements,' we [have] \n     recognized a concern not confined to bribery of public \n     officials, but extending to the broader threat from \n     politicians too compliant with the wishes of large \n     contributors.\n\n  In fact, I look at the distinguished Presiding Officer--a man who \nserved with such great distinction as Governor of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia--and I think about the jury verdict handed down last week \nagainst another former Republican Governor of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and it reminds us that when elected officials grant political \nfavors in exchange for gifts and money, it certainly threatens the \nfunctioning of our democracy. What Justice Kennedy and those who joined \nwith him fail to recognize is that more subtle forms of corruption are \nalso corrosive and undermine public confidence.\n  Way back in the last century, we changed the Constitution to allow \nthe direct election of Senators. One of the motivating factors was that \nin one State--at that time the legislatures appointed Senators--in one \nState, one major corporation in the mining industry so controlled the \nlegislature that it picked who were going to be the Senators. We \nchanged that because we said everybody should have a voice.\n  States and future Congresses should be able to recognize that \ncorruption extends to the idea that money--particularly unregulated \ncampaign contributions--buys access and influences the political \nprocess in disproportionate ways for a wealthy few.\n  This ``pay to play'' notion is corrosive to our democracy. The size \nof your bank account should not determine whether and how the \ngovernment responds to your needs. The government should be there for \nall Americans, not just the most wealthy. Vermonters understand this. \nThey have led the way by speaking out forcefully about the devastating \nimpact of these Supreme Court decisions. So we ought to start listening \nto our constituents. We ought to vote to protect our democracy against \ncorruption. We ought to restore democracy for all Americans.\n  Some have argued that money is speech so we should not allow the \nStates or Congress to limit any spending in our elections. As Justice \nStevens said in his testimony before the Rules Committee, ``while money \nis used to finance speech, money is not speech. Speech is only one of \nthe activities that are financed by campaign contributions and \nexpenditures. Those financial activities should not receive the same \nconstitutional protection as speech itself.'' This is exactly right.\n  I have also heard the argument that this proposed amendment would \nsilence nonprofit advocacy groups like the NAACP and the Sierra Club \nbecause it allows Congress and the States to distinguish between \ncorporations and actual individuals. Do not believe it. Until Citizens \nUnited, prohibitions on corporate and union political spending were the \nnorm at the Federal level and in many states. Those prohibitions never \nstopped nonprofit groups from engaging in vigorous issue advocacy. Nor \nwould this amendment.\n  Moreover, I have received a letter of support signed by both the \nNAACP and the Sierra Club, among many others, that openly advocate for \nthis proposed amendment. If this proposed amendment would have the \npotential effect of silencing their organizations, why would they \nsupport it?\n  For those who claim the threat of these Supreme Court decisions is \nnot sufficient to warrant a constitutional amendment, let's get the \nfacts straight. Even incremental measures to simply increase the \ntransparency of the flood of money pouring into our elections have been \nrepeatedly filibustered by Republicans. In fact, many of us have tried \nfor years to pass a law to require greater transparency and disclosure \nof political spending. I have tried to practice what I have preached. I \nhave disclosed every cent ever contributed to me, including one time \nfor one for about 40 or 50 cents. It cost us more to disclose it than \nwhat it was, but I wanted people to know exactly who had contributed to \nmy campaign. We tried to have that kind of disclosure.\n\n  Republicans have repeatedly filibustered that legislation, known \naptly as the DISCLOSE Act. The statutory approach would allow the \nAmerican people to at least know who is pouring money into the \nelectoral system. It is bad enough that they can pour in an unlimited \namount of money, but we ought to at least know who is doing it and why \nthey are doing it.\n  I hope we will be able to convince enough Republicans to join this \neffort to overcome the Republican filibuster of a modest transparency \nbill. But because the Supreme Court based its rulings on a flawed \ninterpretation of the First Amendment, a statutory fix alone will not \nsuffice. Only a constitutional amendment can overturn the Supreme \nCourt's devastating campaign finance decisions.\n  Our proposal to amend the Constitution simply restores the ability of \nfuture lawmakers--Republicans and Democrats--at both the Federal and \nState levels to rein in the influence that billionaires and \ncorporations now have on our elections. It is necessary to restore the \nFirst Amendment so all voices can be heard in the democratic process, \nwhether you are a millionaire or not, and it is vital to ensure that \ncorruption does not flourish.\n  I hope Senators will join with me on this vote.\n  I do not see anybody seeking recognition.

President Obama announced Friday that he would not \nfollow through on his promise to utilize Executive orders by the end of \nthe summer to provide amnesty and work authorization for 5 to 6 million \nillegal immigrants who cannot work lawfully in America because they \nunlawfully entered the country or have overstayed their visas. That \ndoes not indicate he has in any way abandoned his plan to execute such \nan Executive amnesty.\n  Indeed, the President directly said he understands that the American \npeople oppose what he is doing--this authorization to work and create a \nlegal status by Executive action. The American people oppose it by more \nthan 2 to 1. So is he going to back off and honor the wishes of the \nAmerican people? No, not at all--this is the point the American people \nneed to understand.\n  The President is now brazenly reaffirming in even clearer language \nthat he will carry out his amnesty plan--but only after the election in \nNovember. This is an attempt to protect his Democratic Senate \ncandidates. Just a few moments ago, his spokesman, Josh Earnest--Mr. \nFlack--said it would be wrong to inject this issue into the election.\n  What I say to Mr. Flack at the White House, whose salary is paid by \nthe American people, is the American people have one chance to have \ntheir voice heard. The President is talking about unilateral, illegal \naction contrary to American law to legalize as many as 5 to 6 million \npeople and we should not inject it into the election. There are \nDemocratic Senators and other Senators who failed to object to that--\nshould they now be protected from being criticized for allowing this to \noccur? Is that what we have gotten to in our democracy, that the \nPresident can make this decision and not involve the American people? \nThey think they should stay out of this. That they should not talk \nabout it in an election. Well, when should we talk about grave issues \nthat are facing America if not during the election cycle?\n  I think it is time for the Senate, and all Senators, to be heard \nexplicitly. Where do you stand? Do you support the legislation that the \nHouse of Representatives has passed that would effectively--as we often \ndo around here--bar the President from spending any\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\nmoney to execute such an illegal, unauthorized amnesty or not? Are you \nfor it or not?\n  Well, we know one thing. If it is left up to the Democratic leader in \nthe Senate, it will not be brought up. So it will take a lot of \nSenators to stand up to Majority Leader Reid and President Obama and \nbring the legislation the House has passed that would bar the \nexpenditure of any money to carry out an unlawful amnesty.\n  The President cannot give work authorization--as he and his people \nhave said he intends to do--to people unlawfully in America. The law \nsays they are not eligible to work in America, and they are not \neligible to be hired in America. The President cannot say, as he has \nalready done for the young people through the DACA program: You are \nauthorized to work. They are now talking about 5 to 6 million more \npeople. One article correctly said there were 10 times as many adults--\nmany of them presumably have entered the country illegally only \nrecently.\n  I think we have to understand what is going on, and we need to \nchallenge our colleagues to stand up and be counted--counted with \nregard to the legitimate authority of Congress, which has passed laws \nof this country that are due to be executed and carried out faithfully \nby the President of the United States. He is not authorized to just not \nenforce the law and not utilize the ICE officers and Border Patrol \nofficers and block them from doing their work.\n  The ICE officers have even sued the Administration, the head of DHS \nand the ICE director, because they have been blocked from following \ntheir oath to enforce the laws of the United States. No wonder this is \nan important issue. No wonder the American people's interest is rising \non this issue, and they have every right to do so.\n\n  Well, I am going to explain why this amnesty is unlawful, how it will \nhurt the American worker, and how it will eviscerate any hope of ever \nestablishing a lawful immigration system in the future if it goes \nforward. First, let's look at recent events. The President stated at \nthe NATO conference a few days ago that he will give legal status to \npersons who are unlawfully here by utilizing Executive orders. I say to \nthe American people and to my colleagues that he cannot do that. Those \nindividuals are unlawfully here. He has no power to reverse the laws \npassed by the Congress of the United States and declare someone lawful \nwho is unlawful. It is a thunderous, dramatic abuse of Presidential \npower.\n  He has made it clear previously that his amnesty will include work \nauthorization, and he cannot do that either. It is plainly contrary to \nlaw. He has already provided executive amnesty and work permits to \nthose who supposedly came here as young people, although the proof is \nvery uncertain. ICE officers report that they are forced to take \nsomeone's word about qualifying for the amnesty. So they are certainly \nnot very tight about verifying that. His advisers and allies openly \nboast about how broad this is going to be. They say you must go ahead, \nMr. President, and do even more than you are saying you are going to do \nnow under this plan. It is really all because of the opposition of the \nAmerican people.\n  By a substantial majority, the American people oppose this action, \nbut the President is intending to do it. According to the news reports, \nMembers of the Senate went to the President and said: Don't do this \nnow, Mr. President. I know you promised to do it before the end of the \nsummer, but don't do it now because that might hurt me in my election. \nI might have to block votes in the Senate that will stop you from doing \nthis, and I will get criticized for doing it. Please don't do this now. \nDon't do it now. You can do it after the election, when I have secured \nmy 6-year term. Do it then, Mr. President.\n  No wonder Senator McConnell referred to that as a cynical act by the \nPresident.\n  This was a dramatic event which occurred over weekend. This executive \namnesty would include work permits for millions of people who illegally \nentered the United States or have overstayed their visas and they are \nhere unlawfully. It is a violation of a sovereign, constitutional law \npassed by the people's representatives in the Congress. It wipes away \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act's clear rules on who can enter the \nUnited States, who can work in the United States, and who can live in \nthe United States. Don't we all agree that our Nation has a right to \nestablish that? Shouldn't those rules and principles be established and \nfollowed? We are not against immigration. We have 1 million people come \nto our country every year legally. They apply, wait their time, and \nthen they have the benefit of citizenship in America. We have one of \nthe most generous immigration policies in the entire world. In addition \nto permanent immigration flows, we have a huge temporary guest worker \nprogram which allows people to come here and take jobs. The President \nwants to double the number of people who come here and take jobs, but \nthe House has refused to do that.\n  These rules are the bedrock of any Nation's immigration policy and \nsovereignty, and in reality the President is actually and truly \nproposing to wipe away what amounts to the few immigration rules that \nare in effect. Through executive action, the President is proposing to \nrepeal the lawful protections to which every American worker is \nentitled. His action would allow millions of illegal immigrants to \ninstantly take precious jobs from struggling and unemployed American \nworkers by the millions in every sector of the economy. These are not \njust agricultural and seasonal workers.\n  Under the President's plan, these people who are given work \nauthorization would be entitled to take any job. They would be entitled \nto work at the county commission or the energy company or power \ncompany. They would be entitled to work at the manufacturing plants and \ndrive the forklifts and heavy equipment. They would be eligible for \ngood jobs--jobs that are good for America.\n  This is at a time of high unemployment and falling wages. We are now \ntalking about another 5 million people who will be rewarded with the \nability to take the best jobs in America when millions of Americans are \nstruggling and wages are falling and we have the highest percentage of \npeople outside of the workforce in America since the 1970s. We have a \nhigher percentage of people who are working part-time instead of \nworking full-time. There are people who are on welfare. Food stamps \nhave gone up fourfold. We need to get our people working first.\n  Again, no one that I know of would say that the people who want to \ncome to America and work are evil or bad people. We have a generous \nimmigration plan. We are not saying bad things about them. We are \nsimply saying that if you want to come to America, apply. If you don't \nqualify, we are sorry. We are not able to accept everybody who would \nlike to come to America. We have rules and regulations to make sure we \nidentify people who are likely to be successful in America and won't to \nbe on the welfare rolls and won't demand health care from the \ngovernment and will be able to pay their fair share of the cost of \nliving in America. That is what any smart Nation does.\n  I think what people need to know right now is that this \nunconstitutional action--this planned executive amnesty--has not gone \naway. It is only a matter of months now that it has been delayed--\nunless the American people stop it from happening.\n  The New York Times reported a few days ago on the timing of these \nactions. They said this:\n\n       President Obama will delay taking executive action on \n     immigration until after the midterm elections, bowing to \n     pressure from fellow Democrats who feared that taking action \n     now could doom his party's chances this fall, White House \n     officials said on Saturday.\n\n  Well, what does that mean? It was reported in a very neutral way. The \nNew York Times, of course, favors amnesty. But how cynical is that? How \ncynical is it that the President is now going to take action on a \ndifferent date than he promised repeatedly, because he is afraid that \nif he does it now, the American people will have an opportunity to \nregister their opinion come November and members of his party will face \nelection and they are going to be asked, Did they support and vote for \nthis or not? He does not want that to happen.\n  What is wrong with the American people being able to influence their \ngovernment? Is the President above that? Has he reached such a high \nlevel of popularity he doesn't have to worry\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\nabout what the American people say, think, or believe, and that he can \nadvocate and carry out policy based on political deals he has made with \nbig business and special-interest groups and politicians. Even when the \nAmerican people don't support it and Congress won't pass it, he gets to \ndo it anyway? Is this where we are in America today?\n  What is particularly disturbing is our Senate Democratic colleagues \napparently don't object to the President carrying out unilateral \nexecutive amnesty; they only prefer that the President implement it \nafter the election, after their race is over, so they don't have to \nexplain it to the people they represent.\n  Politico reported one typical Senate Democrat office as saying: \n``Obama should use his executive authority to make fixes to the \nimmigration system, but after the November elections.'' After the \nelections. Don't let it blow back on me. Go ahead, Mr. President, we \nwant you to do this fix, but don't do it now, do it after the election \nso nobody can hold me to account.\n  I think the American people are getting tired of this. I think they \nare wising up. The politicians work for the American people; the \nAmerican people don't work for the politicians.\n  We held a vote in the Senate on July 31. I sought to block this \naction by bringing up a bill similar to a bill the House passed that \nwould bar the President from spending any money to carry out this \nexecutive amnesty. Only one Senate Democrat--Senator Manchin--voted in \nsupport of allowing the bill to come up for a vote. And no one, to my \nknowledge, on the Democratic side has challenged Senator Reid and his \nblocking of the House-type legislation.\n  It is a very serious matter that we are engaged in today. It is a \nvery serious matter. The moral underpinnings, the integrity of the \nimmigration law--already seriously damaged by the DACA action President \nObama took--will be fatally wounded if he now legalizes 5 million to 6 \nmillion people unilaterally. How could we then tell anybody in the \nfuture they have to comply with the law?\n  The President himself said at the NATO conference that if we do his \nexecutive amnesty, it will, as he said, encourage legal immigration. \nWrong, wrong, wrong. Rewarding millions more who have entered the \ncountry illegally--rewarding their illegal acts--is not going to cause \nmore people to follow the law; it is going to be a further weakening of \nthe law. And in the future, how will we be able to tell people who came \nacross the border after that, that they shouldn't be given lawful \nstatus, rewarding them for their illegal act? It is that simple.\n  We are going to have to confront this issue. Congress needs to stand \nup, affirm the rule of law, do the right thing. We are not against \nimmigration. We are not against immigrants. We don't believe this \ncountry ought to be isolationist. But we have a right--and the American \npeople have a right--to believe their government will create an \neffective, honorable system of immigration and see that it is enforced \nfairly and resolutely. That is the moral thing to do. It is the right \nthing to do. It is what the American people have been demanding for 30 \nor 40 years, and the politicians have steadfastly refused.\n  I think it is time for the people's voices to be heard. The American \npeople are right on this issue. They are exactly right. We are failing \nthe future of our country, the lawful system of our country, we are \nfailing the American people, and we are failing American workers who \nare having a difficult time today finding jobs and seeing their wages \ndecline.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on three \nnominees to positions on the Social Security Advisory Board. Two of \nthese nominees--Alan Cohen and Lanhee Chen--are well suited for these \npositions, and that being the case I totally support their nominations.\n  However, I plan to vote against the remaining nominee, Dr. Henry \nAaron, whom the President ultimately intends to serve as chairman of \nthe board. I wish to take a few minutes today to explain why I have \nreached this decision.\n  Over the past decade or so, Dr. Aaron has spent most of his time and \nefforts focusing on health care issues and advocacy. Indeed, the vast \nmajority of writings he offered in support of his nomination dealt with \nhealth care, not Social Security.\n  When the Finance Committee considered his nomination, I specifically \nasked Dr. Aaron if he had performed any Social Security analysis over \nthe past decade. He could not produce anything substantive along these \nlines.\n  There is nothing wrong with focusing one's energies on health care \ninstead of analyzing Social Security policy. However, given the \nspecific focus of the Social Security Advisory Board, I am concerned \nabout the extent to which Dr. Aaron has considered Social Security \nissues and analytical advances in the field over the past decade or \nmore. It appears to me that Dr. Aaron's interests and skill set make \nhim better suited for a position in the health care arena rather than \nadvising on the current state of Social Security.\n  Dr. Aaron has written about Social Security more extensively in the \npast, but his conclusions were predominantly normative. His most recent \nSocial Security writings too often imply that anyone disagreeing with \nhis conclusions is dead wrong and likely has adverse motives.\n  In fact, this is a trend that pervades all of Dr. Aaron's writings. \nFar too often, in addition to reaching conclusions and making \nrecommendations, Dr. Aaron finds it necessary to condemn potential \ncritics, usually along partisan lines. Of course, I am not one to vote \nagainst a nominee simply because I disagree with their policy \nprescriptions or their analytical techniques. I generally believe in \ngiving reasonable deference to the President on nominations, \nparticularly those involving positions designed to provide advice to \nthe President and his administration.\n  The Social Security Advisory Board, however, is set up to provide \nbipartisan advice on Social Security issues to Congress and the Social \nSecurity Commissioner, as well as the President. Given all of the \nchallenges facing Social Security, this type of advice is crucial. The \nboard chair must be able to work toward gathering bipartisan consensus \nand avoid turning the Social Security Advisory Board into another \nplatform for political division and partisan rhetoric. Therefore, it is \nnecessary to consider Dr. Aaron's nomination from the perspective of \nbipartisanship.\n  As I said, a nominee for board chair must demonstrate an ability to \npromote and garner bipartisan consensus. Unfortunately, the evidence \ndoes not convince me that Dr. Aaron would be able to set aside his \npartisan views and manage the board in a bipartisan fashion that aims \nat consensus in both analysis and conclusions.\n  Throughout much of his writings, Dr. Aaron has, far more often than \nnot, opted for partisanship over sound policy. This not only makes me \nquestion his ability to be bipartisan, it also leads me to question his \njudgment on policy issues.\n  For example, he has recently advocated that the President disregard \nthe Constitution and ignore the statutory limit on Federal debt. He has \npraised the President for ignoring the law by unilaterally deciding not \nto enforce provisions of the Affordable Care Act, identifying the \nadministration's failure to enforce the law written by Congress and \nsigned by the President himself as an act that, to quote Dr. Aaron, \n``adroitly performs political jiu jitsu on ObamaCare opponents.''\n  He has written that the Independent Payment Advisory Board--the \nIPAB--an agency with virtually unchecked power to ration Medicare \nspending, should be given even broader authority.\n  He has scolded States that have, fully within their rights, decided \nagainst expanding Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act rollout. \nDr. Aaron used particularly vitriolic words to describe State officials \nwho opted not to expand Medicaid, saying: ``Officials in many states \nhave adopted a stance reminiscent of massive resistance, the South's \nfutile effort to block implementation of the Supreme Court's decision \nbanning school segregation.''\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n  When I asked Dr. Aaron a question at his confirmation hearing about \nthe caustic nature of some of his comments, he alluded to writings for \nnewspapers and op-eds as avenues in which inclusion of politically \ncharged rhetoric is the ``coin of the realm.''\n  That may very well be the case, but that doesn't mean there is a \nplace for it on the Social Security Advisory Board. I have serious \nconcern about Dr. Aaron's ability to keep such rhetoric in check as he \nchairs the board that is by statute intended to exhibit impartiality.\n  Once again, our Social Security system faces a number of fiscal and \nstructural changes and challenges. If we are going to address these \nchallenges, we need serious discussions that will lead to serious \nsolutions, not more partisanship.\n  Dr. Aaron has not convinced me that he is the one to help lead these \ntypes of discussions. For these reasons I intend to vote against this \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ.

Mr. President, I rise today to support an independent \nconstitutional amendment offered by Senator Udall of New Mexico which \nwould restore to Congress and the States the authority to rein in the \nenormous sums of money that are flooding into our political process.\n  As they built our democracy, the Founders feared the impact of \nconcentration of power. John Adams, a Massachusetts native and the \nauthor of our State Constitution, expressed this ideal well. He said:\n\n       Power must be opposed to power, force to force, strength to \n     strength, interest to interest, as well as reason to reason, \n     eloquence to eloquence, and passion to passion.\n\n  Balance, said Adams, was critical.\n  But in Washington power is not balanced. Instead, power is \nconcentrated all on one side. Well-financed individuals and corporate \ninterests are lined up to fight for their own privileges and to resist \nany change that would limit their special deals.\n  I saw this up close and personal following the 2008 financial crisis \nwhen I fought hard for stronger financial regulations, and the biggest \nbanks in this country spent more than $1 million a day to weaken \nreforms. But there are many more examples.\n  Big corporate interests are smart. They fight every day on Capitol \nHill, every day in the agencies, every day in the courts, always with \nthe same goals in mind--to bend the law to benefit themselves. The U.S. \nSupreme Court is doing all it can to help them.\n  Three well-respected legal scholars, including Judge Richard Posner \nof the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, a widely respected and \nconservative Reagan appointee, recently examined almost 20,000 Supreme \nCourt cases from the past 65 years. The researchers used multivariate \nregression analysis to determine how often each Justice voted in favor \nof corporate interests during that time. Judge Posner and his \ncolleagues concluded that the five conservative Justices currently \nsitting on the Supreme Court are in the top 10 most procorporate \nJustices in more than half a century--and Justice Alito and Justice \nRoberts No. 1 and No. 2.\n  Perhaps the most egregious example of this procorporate shift is the \nCitizens United decision. In this new Citizens United era, the Supreme \nCourt has unleashed a flood of secret corporate money into our \npolitical system and emboldened a powerful group of millionaires and \nbillionaires who can toss out checks for millions of dollars to \ninfluence election outcomes.\n  Earlier this year the Supreme Court gave them even more room to \noperate. Congress had long ago put limits on how much money one rich \nperson could contribute to a candidate, a party, or a political action \ncommittee in an election. These commonsense limits were intended to \npreserve the integrity of our democracy and to prevent corruption or \neven the appearance of corruption, but the Supreme Court struck down \nthose limits.\n  As Justice Breyer noted in his dissenting opinion, the Court's \ndecision ``will allow a single individual to contribute millions of \ndollars to a political party or to a candidate's campaign.''\n  The impact of this line of judicial decisions is powerful. In 2012, \nabout 3.7 million typical Americans gave modest donations, $200 or \nless, to President Obama and Mitt Romney. These donations altogether \nadded up to about $313 million. In that same election, 32 Americans \ngave monster donations to super PACs. Thirty-two people spent slightly \nmore on the 2012 elections than 3.7 million typical Americans who sent \nin modest dollar donations to their preferred Presidential candidate. \nWhen 32 people can outspend 3.7 million citizens, our democracy is in \nreal danger.\n  This is an extraordinary situation. The Supreme Court overturned a \ncentury of precedent, voiding campaign finance restrictions passed by \nCongress and making it far easier for millionaires, billionaires, and \nbig corporations to flood our elections with massive amounts of money. \nThe Supreme Court is helping them buy elections.\n  We are here to try to reverse the damage inflicted on our country by \nthese decisions. We are here to fight back against a Supreme Court that \nsays there is no difference between free speech and billions of dollars \nspent by the privileged few to swing elections and buy off legislators.\n  We are here to fight back against a Supreme Court that has overturned \na century of established law in an effort to block Congress from \nsolving this problem.\n  I support a constitutional amendment only with great reluctance. Our \nConstitution sets forth the fundamental structure of our government, \nthe scope of that government's power, and the critical limits on that \npower. Any change to its text should be measured, should be carefully \nconsidered, and should occur only rarely. But there are times when \naction is required to defend our great democracy against those who \nwould see it perverted into one more rigged game where the rich and the \npowerful always win.\n  This is the time to amend the Constitution. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this effort. We were not sent to Congress to run this country \nfor a handful of wealthy individuals and powerful corporations. We were \nsent here to do our best to make this country work for all our people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I chair the Senate judiciary subcommittee \nentitled the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human \nRights. Obviously, the most serious charge of the subcommittee is to \nconsider proposals to amend the Constitution. S.J. Res. 19, the \ndemocracy-for-all amendment, was the first amendment considered by the \nconstitution subcommittee since 2009, when I became its chair.\n  The U.S. Constitution and the wisdom of its Framers has endured for \ngenerations. I have established--and so have many of my colleagues--a \nvery high bar for suggestions to amend that Constitution. That is the \nway it should be. That is why Majority Leader Reid, Chairman Patrick \nLeahy of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I were committed to \nensuring this proposal would be thoroughly vetted and that it move \nthrough the Senate by regular order.\n  It is important to recall that until the early 20th century most \nAmericans were not allowed to vote. Even after the franchise was \nlegally expanded, a violent racist campaign prevented many African \nAmericans from voting.\n  Six constitutional amendments, landmark civil rights legislation, and\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\nSupreme Court decisions helped make the promise of one person and one \nvote a reality. We must, in our time, in our generation, be constantly \nvigilant against threats to these victories which were won through the \nblood, sweat, tears, and even the lives of many Americans. That is why \nwe are engaged in this debate today, because the right to vote is under \nsiege. It is in peril. A well-funded, coordinated effort has made it \nharder for millions of Americans to vote and at the same time unleashed \na tidal wave of special interest and corporate money into elections to \ndrown out the voices of average Americans.\n  Opponents of our amendment say, oh, they are just trying to repeal \nthe First Amendment. They have it backwards. Our efforts would protect \nand restore the First Amendment.\n  The amendment before the Senate would begin to undo the damage done \nby five activist, conservative Supreme Court Justices who have \nrewritten and distorted the First Amendment. With decisions like \nCitizens United and McCutcheon, these five Justices overturned a \ncentury of legal and constitutional precedent to give a privileged \nclique and corporate titans the power to drown out the voices of \nordinary Americans--and that is exactly what is happening.\n  Big-money donors--and their names are familiar to those who follow \nthe world of politics; the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and the \ncorporate interests they represent--certainly deserve a seat at the \npolicymaking table. But the size of their bank accounts does not \nentitle them to buy every seat at the table, control the agenda, and \nsilence their critics. Unfortunately, this is exactly what we are \nseeing across the Nation being played out, even as I speak, in this \ncurrent election campaign. Big-money campaign donors and special \ninterests, emboldened by the Supreme Court, have flooded our elections, \nunfortunately, to a great degree with secret contributions.\n  Listen to these statistics: Spending by outside groups has tripled \nsince the last midterm election. They spent $27.6 million in 2010 \ncompared to $97.7 million so far this year. In 2006, before this awful \ndecision in Citizens United, these groups spent $3.5 million. And now \nthe running total for this year: almost $100 million from outside \nspecial interest groups and well-heeled individuals.\n  In 2012, super PACs spent more than $130 million on Federal \nelections, and 60 percent of all super PAC contributions that year came \nfrom an elite class of 159 people. In North Carolina, that elite group \nhad just one member, that State had just one person. Seventy-two \npercent of all outside spending in 2010 in North Carolina came from one \nman, Art Pope, a millionaire, conservative, rightwing activist.\n  As I stand and speak, there is a super PAC on the air attacking me in \nmy home State. As best we can trace it, it is to one individual who so \nfar apparently has spent $700,000 in negative ads against me on radio \nand television. Perhaps more will follow. That is the nature of the \nworld we live in.\n  Members of Congress who run for office, for election and reelection, \nabide by strict rules on disclosure, money raised, how much is being \nspent. But when it comes to these individuals, since Citizens United, \nall bets are off.\n  Although some of the biggest and most frequent spenders are on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, the influx of secret money from super \nPACs and wealthy donors is happening on the right and on the left. Many \nhave created super PACs on the other side as a defense. Unfortunately, \nit is a tactic or strategy that has been dictated by the Supreme Court \ndecisions. Sadly, all of this money fight is eroding our democracy and \ndrowning out the voices of everyday citizens.\n\n  One year ago, in the Shelby County decision, the same five Justices \ngutted the Voting Rights Act, civil rights legislation that had \nprotected the constitutional rights of average Americans for 50 years. \nEmboldened by the Shelby County decision, more Republican-dominated \nState legislatures followed suit by pursuing legislation to restrict \nthe right to vote. It is no coincidence that these laws have a \ndisproportionate impact on minority, young, and low-income voters.\n  During his confirmation hearings, Chief Justice John Roberts of the \nSupreme Court said this of the right to vote. It was ``the right \npreservative of all other rights.'' And he pledged to be a neutral \numpire, calling balls and strikes when it came to issues such as the \nright to vote. But because of the judicial activism of Chief Justice \nRoberts and his four conservative allies, the right to vote of average \nAmericans is now at greater risk than any time since the Jim Crow era.\n  Two years ago I decided to take my subcommittee for hearings in the \nStates of Ohio and Florida. In both of those States, the Republican-\ndominated legislatures, inspired by a group known as ALEC that is not a \nlobbying group but creates so-called model legislation, had dreamed up \nways to restrict the opportunity to vote. How did they do this? Some of \nthem called for the presentation of identification cards when you vote. \nOthers said: We will limit the time that you can vote--no early voting. \nWe will restrict the opportunities for people to vote.\n  My first table of witnesses consisted of a bipartisan gathering of \nelection officials in both Florida and Ohio, States that had passed \nthese restrictive voting laws. I asked the first panel, under oath, a \nbasic question: Tell me about the incidents of voter fraud and voter \nabuse in your State which led to these changes in the legislature. \nThere were none.\n  Tell me the number of individuals who had been prosecuted for voter \nfraud in Ohio and Florida that led to these changes in State \nlegislation. There were virtually none. One said he could remember \nmaybe one case or two in the course of years.\n  I think it is pretty clear. These efforts to restrict the right to \nvote have nothing to do with the integrity of elections. There isn't a \nsingle one of us in either political party who condones voter fraud and \nvoter abuse, period. But to restrict the right to vote of millions of \nAmericans in the name of stopping voter fraud that doesn't exist--well, \nit is time to ask the more basic question: What is the real reason? The \nreal reason is to restrict the right to vote.\n  It is hard to believe that Republicans in State legislatures, and \neven some in this Chamber--the party of Abraham Lincoln, for goodness' \nsake--is party to this effort to restrict the right to vote across \nAmerica. For goodness' sake, I have been involved in election campaigns \nwhich I have won and those which I have not won. I always felt, if it \nwas a fair election, so be it; let the people speak. That is what a \ndemocracy is all about. But when you start playing with the rules, when \nyou start saying, well, we are going to try to make it tougher for \npeople to vote--even those who are legally entitled to vote--I frankly \nthink we have crossed a line which we should not ever cross in this \ncountry. Fire hoses, growling dogs, and insidious poll taxes have now \nbeen replaced with a well-funded campaign denying millions their right \nto vote and a flood of special interest money drowning out the voices \nof average Americans.\n\n  Is that your vision of America? Is that your vision of this country \nin the future, where your opportunity to vote is now restricted more \nand more, even without any indication of voter fraud or voter abuse, \nwhen your opportunity to be informed about the candidates and their \npositions is in fact overwhelmed by those who come in--such as the Koch \nbrothers and those on the left, too--to spend millions of dollars?\n  I introduced a bill a few years back for public financing and \ncampaigns. There was one valiant Republican who stood, who agreed to \ncosponsor my bill, and only one: Arlen Specter, a Senator from \nPennsylvania, a Republican Senator. What happened to him? I can tell \nyou what happened. The late Arlen Specter was challenged in his \nRepublican primary by one of those on the far right in his party. He \ncouldn't win as he looked at the polls. He switched parties and became \na Democrat. I lost my only Republican on public financing when he \njoined us on this side of the aisle. He lost the Democratic primary, \nwent on and finished his term and passed away. But he was the only \nRepublican with the courage to stand for public financing to change \nthis mess we have.\n  I can tell you we are reaching a point where mere mortals--\nindividuals who don't happen to be multimillionaires--want nothing to \ndo with this political business. It has become the hobby of\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\nhigh rollers. The two candidates for the highest offices in my home \nState now are multimillionaires playing with their own money now, \nputting millions into their campaigns.\n  I am not envious of their wealth. I have said it publicly and I will \nsay it again: I am only one Powerball ticket away from matching their \nwealth. So I am not jealous of them, but it says something about the \npolitical process, doesn't it, that someone could put in $10 or $12 \nmillion of their own money and the Supreme Court can say, well, they \nare just exercising their right to free speech. Really? I didn't see \nthe word ``cash'' in the First Amendment. I didn't even see the word \n``money'' in the First Amendment. That is what we are up against.\n  S.J. Res. 19, which is before us, is a constitutional amendment. It \nis narrowly tailored and it is a proposal to protect and restore the \nFirst Amendment. It empowers Congress and State legislatures, the \nelected representatives of the American people, to set reasonable, \ncontent-neutral--let me underline that--content-neutral limits on the \namount of money wealthy individuals and special interest donors can \ngive to candidates. It overturns Citizens United by authorizing \nCongress and State legislatures----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  It overturns Citizens United by authorizing Congress and State \nlegislatures to prohibit corporations and unions from spending money \nfrom their treasuries to influence elections. Our amendment will ensure \nthat elections are contests for the best ideas, a contest where mere \nmortals--the group I mentioned earlier--have the same chance to succeed \nas multimillionaires. That is why our amendment is supported by 60 \ndiverse advocacy organizations and the majority of the American people. \nPoliticians may not get it, but the American people do. They could see \nwhat is happening to this bidding war we now call elections. They \nunderstand the flood of television.\n  We have one Senatorial candidate on our side, who she has been \nsubjected to $15 million in independent expenditures, negative ads in \nher State. That has been going on for almost 1 year. She is going to \nweather the storm and be reelected, incidentally. But imagine that $15 \nmillion of special interest groups just showering her with hate and \nvenom for month after weary month. Is that what our political process \nhas come down to?\n  Opponents of our amendment argue that any limit whatsoever on \nelection spending violates the First Amendment. Just as there is no \nconstitutional right to buy an election, freedom of speech doesn't give \nanyone the right to violate or overwhelm the constitutional rights of \nothers. Apparently five conservative Supreme Court Justices believe the \nwealthy and elite have a greater right to free speech because they have \nmore money.\n  Our opponents also argue that corporations are people. Give me a \nbreak. Corporations are granted the advantages of perpetual \nlife, property ownership, and limited liability to enhance their \nefficiency as an economic entity, according to Justice Rehnquist in one \nof his opinions, but he went on to say in the same opinion, ``Those \nproperties so beneficial in the economic sphere pose special dangers in \nthe political sphere.''\n\n  That was Justice Rehnquist speaking about giving powers to \ncorporations which exceed the obvious. While some First Amendment \nprotections have rightfully been extended beyond everyday Americans to \ncorporations, Citizens United went way too far. Living, breathing \nAmericans face challenges these legally created entities will never \nface. Corporations never get married, they don't raise kids, they don't \ncare for sick relatives, and they cannot vote in elections or run for \noffice. Corporations have the right to be heard, for sure, but the \nright to control an election with their bank account? There is \nsomething wrong with that decision.\n  Our amendment restores the basic longstanding principle that \ncorporations shouldn't be able to wield their enormous economic power \nto sway Federal elections. Our amendment restores and protects the \nFirst Amendment for all Americans. I encourage my colleagues to vote \nfor S.J. Res. 19, and I expect a strictly partisan vote. I am sorry if \nthat happens, but I expect it.\n  When we brought up the issue of disclosure, to disclose who was \ngiving to campaigns, we couldn't get the Republicans to give us \nsupport. Just disclose who is giving the money. Nope. Keep it secret. \nThat was their position. Now they not only want to keep it secret; they \nwant to make sure those who are abusing the process by sending in huge \nsums of money on behalf of corporations and individuals are going to be \nprotected. They may protect the special interests, but they will do it \nat the expense of average Americans who are losing their faith--losing \ntheir faith in this process and in the institutions it creates.\n  Restore that faith. Support S.J. Res. 19. Let's amend the \nConstitution and make Citizens United a vestige of a wrong-headed \ndecision by the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I again thank my colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am glad I got to catch a few of the \ntail-end remarks of my colleague from Illinois. I didn't realize what \nthis debate was truly all about, but he made that clear.\n  This is all about public financing of elections, according to him, \nbecause anybody contributing any of their hard-earned money to support \na candidate whom they happen to believe in or someone espousing or \nadvocating for the principles they believe in--there is something \ninherently wrong with that according to the distinguished majority \nwhip, the Senator from Illinois, because to him the only answer is \nlet's take your money and use that to finance an election perhaps to \nbenefit a candidate who doesn't agree with anything you believe in. Is \nthat what this is all about, public financing of elections?\n  He said something else I don't think I ever heard anybody have the \naudacity to say before. He said voter fraud doesn't exist. I am sure in \nChicago they have had a few instances of voter fraud. We have \nunfortunately had some in Texas, some that resulted in the nomination \nof Lyndon Johnson to be Democratic nominee for President of the United \nStates in box 13 in Duvall County, TX, and there have been a number of \nother instances investigated and found cases of voter fraud that have \nbeen found to exist.\n  What is the problem with issuing or requiring somebody to have a \nphoto ID to vote? In Texas to get a voter ID, for which the Attorney \nGeneral has sued the State of Texas, saying somehow it is \ndiscriminatory to require somebody to have a voter ID to prove they are \nwho they say they are so they can then cast their vote, even though it \ntakes a photo ID to get into the Department of Justice--you cannot go \nsee Eric Holder or anybody at the Department of Justice unless you have \na photo ID. Oh, by the way, you cannot buy tobacco products, you cannot \nbuy alcohol, you cannot fly on an airplane without a photo ID, and if \nfor some reason you don't have one in the State of Texas, well, you get \none for free. How does that possibly burden the right to vote?\n  It is no surprise that 70 percent of the respondents in most of the \npolling I have seen--Independents, Democrats, and Republicans alike--\nsay they think voter ID is a good idea, because what does it do? It \nprotects the integrity of the ballots for people who are qualified to \nvote and doesn't permit illegal votes to dilute those votes.\n  We spent the last several weeks back home meeting with our \nconstituents. I know some people like to call it recess. I know it \ndoesn't feel like recess, at least not in the elementary school sense \nof the word, because most of the time this is a period during which we \nget to travel our States and interact with our constituents and do \nsomething we need to do more of, which is to listen to what they have \nto say and what their concerns are, and I did that in Texas.\n  My constituents did not say the most important thing we can do is \npass a constitutional amendment gutting the First Amendment, the right \nto free speech. That didn't come up one time.\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\nWhat did come up were their concerns about the economy, about the \naccess to health care, about immigration, about the challenges imposed \nby radical Islamic terrorists and the Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. \nAll of those came up. Not a single time did my constituents say: We \nwant you to go back to Washington, DC, and vote to gut the First \nAmendment right to free speech. At this time of high unemployment and \nstagnant wages, with the labor participation rate at historic lows--\nthat is, the percentage of people actually in the workforce looking for \njobs is at a historic low--and millions of Americans concerned about \nlosing their health insurance or facing higher deductibles or premiums, \nwith a crisis on the southwest border which has not gone away with this \nwave of unaccompanied minor children coming across from Central \nAmerica, with terrorists on the march in the Middle East, with Russian \nmilitary forces continuing a full-blown invasion of Ukraine, despite \nall that, the majority leader in his wisdom has decided to bring up \nthis amendment because he thinks the most urgent order of business is \nto replace the current First Amendment which has stood the test of time \nfor lo all these many years since our country's founding and replace it \nwith one that empowers incumbent politicians to control who has access \nto the resources in order to get their message out.\n\n  Now everyone is entitled to their priorities, but it is painfully \nclear the majority leader's priorities have everything to do with \nNovember 4, the coming midterm elections, so it is all politics all the \ntime, no matter what. I am embarrassed, frankly, to confront my \nconstituents when they say: What are you going to be doing when you \nreturn to Washington, DC? Are you going to be dealing with jobs or the \nenergy sector--which is a very bright spot in our economy--or what are \nwe going to do to make sure the millennials--the young adults--can \nactually find jobs so they can pay down their college loans and so they \ncan get to work? What are you going to do to keep the promises the \nPresident made on health care; that if you like what you have you can \nkeep it, the premiums for a family of four are going to go down by \n$2,500, and you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor--what are \nyou going to do to make sure those promises are kept?\n  Instead of dealing with all of those very important issues, it is \nembarrassing for me to tell my constituents that, look, the majority \nleader is the one who controls the agenda in this Senate. He is the \ntraffic cop, and an individual Senator--and certainly not one in the \nminority--doesn't have any ability to control the agenda of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So this is all Senator Reid's choice as the majority leader, and he \nclaims this proposed constitutional amendment is all about getting so-\ncalled dark money out of the political system. In reality, if that was \nall this was about, we might have a good debate and a vote. But in \nreality what he is concerned about is opposition--political support \nthat is going to make it more likely that Republicans regain the \nmajority of the Senate and Democrats become a member of the minority. \nThat is what is motivating this vote. In reality what this amendment \nwould do would be to undermine some of our most cherished, most \nfundamental, and most important liberties.\n  If this proposed amendment ever becomes law, State and Federal \nlawmakers would suddenly have vast new powers to regulate or even \ncriminalize political speech. So to state the blindingly obvious, the \nFounding Fathers proposed and readopted the First Amendment precisely \nbecause they saw how dangerous it was to let politicians restrict the \nexercise of free speech. The Founders understood that without the First \nAmendment we could end up with a never-ending cycle of elected \nofficials shrinking the boundaries of permissible speech. A political \nsystem such as that would be totally incompatible with the principles \nand values of a free society. Yet that is exactly the type of political \nsystem we would have if this constitutional amendment being proposed \never were to take effect.\n  I heard the majority whip saying this isn't about political speech, \nthis is just about the money, but that argument quickly falls apart.\n  For starters, my colleagues amendment would allow Congress to \nrestrict freedom of assembly and freedom of petition as well, both of \nwhich are essential to safeguarding political speech. While the \namendment might not give Congress the power to curtail freedom of the \npress per se, it would give Congress the power to curtail political \nspeech by individuals and activists, which begs the question: Why \nshould the political speech of newspapers and magazines be any \ndifferent from the political speech of you and me? Why should theirs be \ncarved out and unrestricted in terms of the financial resources that \ncould advance those points of view in newspapers and magazines? Yet our \nability to communicate about the things we care about the most would be \nrestricted by limiting the amount of money we could spend to advocate \nthose points of view.\n  After all, when newspapers publish editorials about public policy, \nthey are trying to persuade politicians and other elected officials to \nadopt a given position, and that is an important part of our system.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Newspapers are trying to persuade voters all the time to \nelect a given candidate because they endorse those candidates.\n  I remember when I ran for my first public office as a district judge \nin Bexar County, San Antonio, TX, one of the most important things I \nsought was the endorsement of the editorial board of the local \nnewspaper. I knew that even if nobody knew anything else about me, if \nthe newspaper editorial board thought I was a credible candidate, that \nmight help in my election.\n  Neither Federal nor State lawmakers should have the power to decide \nwhat type of political speech is permissible. Free speech is free \nspeech. The solution to speech is more speech, not less speech.\n  For 225 years the First Amendment has served as the guarantor of \nAmerican democracy. It was designed to protect all speech, not just \nspeech we happen to agree with or that supports our particular point of \nview. A recent Supreme Court decision put it this way: ``There is no \nmore basic right to our democracy than the right to participate in \nelecting political leaders.''\n  Unfortunately, this amendment would undermine that right, and it \nwould roll back perhaps the most elemental freedom of our founding \ndocument by creating a system in which vital, indispensable liberty \nwould be contingent on the ever-shifting tides of partisan politics. \nThese efforts should not only be not supported, they should be \nrepudiated firmly, loudly, and unapologetically, nothing less than the \nvery bedrock of American democracy is at stake.\n  As I close, I wish to add that the Founders wisely put the process by \nwhich the Constitution can be amended in our Constitution. Two-thirds \nof the House and two-thirds of the Senate must vote for a \nconstitutional resolution and then it goes to the States where three-\nquarters of the States must ratify this constitutional amendment. I can \ntell you that there is no doubt in my mind that this would ever happen \nwith this amendment.\n  Why is the majority leader bringing this up now, less than 60 days \nbefore the midterm elections? Perhaps it is to motivate his own \npolitical base in the hope that will mitigate some of the losses in the \nNovember 4 election. But it certainly cannot be without any hope or \npipedream that it would ever become the law of the land, and for the \nreasons I have stated it should not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I say to my good friend the \nSenator from Texas that there are very important reasons for bringing \nup this issue now, and it is because of the elections that are going \non. He makes it sound as though this is some kind of a political \nprocess. What is going on in our elections right now--and here are the \nnine top Senate races in the country. The blue on this chart indicates \npartial or nondisclosed money. This is the dark money. Nobody knows \nwhere this money is coming from. It could be billionaires or large \ncorporations. It could be almost anyone with a secret agenda.\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n  As an example, more than half the money in this race in Arkansas is \ndark money. In Georgia we can see that almost all of the money is in \nthis category of partial or nondisclosure. In Kentucky and North \nCarolina almost half the money is in the category of partial or \nnondisclosed money, and there is a significant amount of partial or \nnondisclosed in the other nine States. This issue has to do with what \nis happening right now in our elections.\n  Just 6 months ago I went over to the Supreme Court and listened to \nthe McCutcheon argument and the ruling--well, I went over there longer \nthan 6 months ago. They made the ruling about 6 months ago. That ruling \nsaid one individual can give $3.6 million, and that is what this is \nabout. We are trying to get to the bottom of what is happening in our \nelections and how our elections are being taken away from us and how \nthey are being influenced in terms of dark money. This is a very good \ntime to have this debate.\n  I will also say to my friend from Texas, this is a bipartisan \namendment. This amendment started back in 1983 with Ted Stevens, a \nRepublican. Ernest Hollings could not be more of a bipartisan figure in \nthe Senate, and he picked it up. From 1983 to today, we have had 11 \nRepublicans either vote for the amendment or a similar amendment or \nbeyond the amendment. This is not anything that should be partisan. \nThis dark money and the impact it is having is something the American \npeople are very worried about. I will come back to this chart in a \nminute.\n  This is a crucial period in our history. Americans will go to the \npolls and vote. It is our heritage, it is something to celebrate, and \nit is something to protect. The integrity of our elections is crucial, \nbut our campaign finance system is under siege, drowning in cash and \nrecord amounts of money. Much of the money is from outside groups and \nmuch of it is hidden. Our elections should not be for sale to the \nhighest bidder. Money has poisoned our political system. The American \npeople have lost faith in us as they have watched this merry-go-round \nand constant money chasing from special interests and very little has \nbeen getting done.\n  Folks want Congress to get to work and work together so we can find \nreal solutions to real problems and spend our time raising hopes \ninstead of raising cash. That is why Senator Bennet and I have \nintroduced our constitutional amendment and that is what I wish to talk \nabout today.\n  Total spending on Federal elections was over $6 billion in 2012. That \nis double what was spent in 2000, just 12 years before. That is a lot \nof money. Where does it come from? Most of it comes from a tiny \nfraction of the population, and there are billionaires and special \ninterests writing checks--often in dark corners with a lot of the dark \nmoney, as I talked about at the beginning of my speech. Nobody knows \nwho is behind that dark money, and that dark money is in our elections \nin a big way.\n  There are basically two questions: How did we get into this mess and \nhow do we fix it? First, we need to look at the history, which is \nimportant to understand because folks can change the subject, but they \ncannot change the facts and the facts are very clear. Our campaign \nfinance system is being destroyed by misguided Supreme Court decisions, \none after another with narrow 5-to-4 decisions, giving a hammer to big \nmoney and chipping away at our democracy.\n  Normally the tradition in the Supreme Court has been that of Justices \ndeciding on issues with a vote of 9 to 0 or 8 to 1 after trying to work \nthings out, but these are narrow 5-to-4 decisions which are dividing \nthe country and dividing the Court.\n  We can go all the way back to a Supreme Court decision back in 1976 \nin a case called Buckley v. Valeo, when the Court said money and free \nspeech are the same thing. Four years ago in a case that involved \nCitizens United, the Court said corporations are persons and they can \nspend all they want.\n  Basically the Supreme Court put a for sale sign on elections. These \nelections and decisions opened the door and allowed a flood of money. \nThey ignored political reality and drowned out the voices of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  Most recently the McCutcheon decision knocked down aggregate \ncontribution limits. What we are talking about in that case is that one \nperson can dole out $3.6 million directly to candidates and parties in \nall 50 States. Let's put that in perspective for the average American \nworking full time and making minimum wage. He or she would have to work \n239 years to make that much money. Because of the McCutcheon decision, \none person can dole out $3.6 million directly to candidates and parties \nin all 50 States. It would take the average American, working full time \nand making minimum wage, 239 years to make that much money. Look at the \nimbalance and inequality there.\n\n  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a recent interview \nin the National Law Journal:\n\n       I think the biggest mistake this Court made is in campaign \n     finance. . . . It should be increasingly clear how [money] is \n     corrupting our system.\n\n  Justice Ginsburg is right. It is clear to most Americans, which is \nwhy opponents of reform either change the subject or muddy the water, \nwhich I will get into in a minute. But the point must be made that the \nfive conservative Justices on the Supreme Court are not done. If left \nunchecked, the hammering will continue and the destruction will go on.\n  Chief Justice Roberts made a troubling statement in the McCutcheon \ndecision. He said preventing bribery is the only basis, the only \njustification for Congress to pass campaign finance laws.\n  What does this mean? It means more bad decisions from the Court, the \nfloodgates stay open, and the money keeps pouring in. Short of \nprohibiting out and out bribery, Congress is powerless to act and the \nAmerican people must step aside. Billionaires will stay at the front of \nthe line. All of this, folks, defies common sense.\n  Senator McCain said after the ruling on McCutcheon: ``There will be \nscandals involving corrupt political officials and unlimited, anonymous \ncampaign contributions that will force the system to be reformed once \nagain.''\n  I am afraid my friend is right. There will be scandals. We are \nsetting the stage for scandals. Just look at the millions of dollars of \nundisclosed money pouring into our elections.\n  How can there be reform? The Court has tied the hands of Congress. \nUntil the Constitution is amended, we cannot enact real reforms--\nreforms such as McCain-Feingold. The Court will just strike them down. \nWe are headed back to the pre-Watergate era.\n  In 2012 outside groups spent $450 million to influence Senate and \nHouse races. In 2008, before Citizens United, they spent $43 million. \nThat is a tenfold increase. There is an obvious trend and it is deeply \ntroubling. Much of that money is hidden.\n  According to a recent report by the Brennan Center, over half the \nmoney spent in this year's top nine Senate races is not fully \ndisclosed. So in 2 months we will know the outcome of these elections, \nbut we won't know who paid for them.\n\n  This chart is a great indication. We have the top-most contested \nSenate races, and here in the red we have full disclosure of the money. \nSo the red shows us what people know and that they know who the \ncontributors are, but the blue, which is more than half if we average \nit through all of the elections, represents partial or absolute \nnondisclosure.\n  This clearly shows we have a broken system. There are only two ways \nto fix it. The Court can reverse itself--that is unlikely--or we can \namend the Constitution, making clear in the Constitution that people \nhave the right to regulate campaign finance. Until then, we will fall \nshort of real reform. That is why a constitutional amendment is \nessential--because the time has come to give power back to the elected \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  Opponents say this is just an election year stunt, but, again, this \nignores history. Our amendment is similar to other bipartisan \namendments introduced in nearly every Congress since 1983 when Ted \nStevens--a Republican--was the lead sponsor. Many prominent Republicans \ncosponsored and voted for these amendments over the course of three \ndecades, people such as John Danforth, Strom Thurmond, Nancy Kassebaum, \nArlen Specter, John McCain, and Thad Cochran. This was always a \nbipartisan effort. And this was before Citizens United, before\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\nMcCutcheon, when things went from bad to worse.\n  It is not a radical idea. In fact, it is pretty simple. It would give \nback power to Congress to regulate campaign finance at the Federal \nlevel and to States at the State level. That is it, period. We do not \ndictate specific reforms. We can debate the specifics, and we should, \nbut Congress has a duty and a right to enact sensible campaign finance \nreform.\n  The American people support reform because they know a basic truth: \nNo matter how hard some may try to obscure it, when the Court says \nmoney is free speech, there is a great risk that special interests can \ndrown out the voices of everyone else because we know we don't get \nsomething for nothing. Folks writing those checks want something in \nreturn. Whether they are Democratic billionaires or Republican \nbillionaires, they want value for their money, which usually means less \ncompromise and which usually means less compromise and more gridlock.\n  Opponents of reform are in full throttle by ignoring history and \ntorturing logic. But let's be clear. Here is the bottom line: They \noppose any limits, they oppose any restrictions on how big the checks \nare or even saying which billionaires are writing them. It is hard to \ndefend that. Instead, they change the subject and talk about threats to \nfree speech, which goes something like this: If Congress can regulate \ncampaign finance spending, then it can also regulate free speech. I \nthink this is a straw man argument not supported by history, logic, or \nthe law. It isn't persuasive, and it is basically a scare tactic.\n  Congress has a long history of regulating campaign finance, often in \nthe wake of scandal. Since 1867 Congress has been in the business of \nregulating campaign finance by banning solicitation of campaign funds \nfrom naval yard government employees. We have had the Pendleton Act, \nthe Tillman Act, the Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, the Hatch \nAct, the Federal Campaign Election Act of 1974, and the Bipartisan \nCampaign Act of 2002.\n  First scandal and then reform--that is the unfortunate pattern. Every \ngeneration has faced that challenge for ethical government, for \nstanding up to the power of big money, and the Congress has acted. It \nhas not banned books, suppressed preachers, or stopped printing \npresses. Reform has been modest, reasonable, and responsive, sensible \nenough to pass both Houses of Congress and get the signature of the \nPresident. We have to answer to our constituents, unlike Supreme Court \nJustices.\n  Further, our amendment does not give Congress free rein. There is \nstill a reasonableness requirement in the Court's interpretation of any \nconstitutional amendment. If Congress did pass extreme laws, the Court \ncould still overturn them as unreasonable. The First Amendment is in \nfull effect. So in the classic example, we protect free speech, but we \ncannot yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater. ``Reasonable'' is not a \ncomplicated idea--except maybe here in Washington or to billionaires \nwho demand their way or the highway.\n  Opponents also argue that our amendment protects incumbents. This, \nagain, misses the point. If anything, the current system favors \nincumbents. Raising $10 million, $15 million, or $20 million for a \nSenate seat is a tall order--one many qualified candidates will \ndecline. If a person is elected, it is just the beginning of this \nendless campaign cycle to compete, to keep up, to raise more money. \nEvery Member in this body can speak to the hours on the phone dialing \nfor dollars when our time could be better spent meeting the real needs \nof our constituents and serving the folks who sent us here in the first \nplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute to \nsum up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, this is not about free \nspeech, and the American people know it. It is about the wealthiest \ninterests trying to buy elections in secret, with no limits, period. \nThat is it.\n  Let me finally say that I have had a great group of Senators working \nwith me on this amendment over the years. One of them we are going to \nhear from right now--Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont. All of us--\nSenator Leahy, Senator Durbin on the Judiciary Committee--have worked \nand refined this amendment to do everything we can to make sure that it \nis responsive to the American people and that it will make us \nresponsive to the American people in terms of having a good, solid \nelectoral system other than the one the Supreme Court is leading us \ndown the path with.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator Tom \nUdall for his extraordinary work over the years in calling attention to \nthis disastrous Supreme Court decision called Citizens United which is \ndoing so much to undermine the foundations of American democracy. It \nhas been a pleasure working with him, and we will continue to fight.\n  My colleagues may not know it by reading the newspapers or watching \nTV, but this week we are going to be having a debate on what I consider \nto be the most important domestic issue facing the United States of \nAmerica; that is, whether this great country retains its democratic \nfoundations--one person, one vote--or whether we move into an \noligarchic form of society where a small handful of billionaires is \nable to control not only the economic life of our Nation but the \npolitical life as well.\n  Whether one is a Democrat, whether one is a Republican, or whether \none is--as the Presiding Officer and I are--an Independent, the \noverwhelming majority of the American people do not believe free speech \nhas anything to do with billionaires being able to buy elections.\n  The Washington Post reported earlier this week that one family, the \nKoch brothers--a family worth $80 billion--has already put on the air \nsome 44,000 ads, and this campaign has 2 months left to it--44,000 ads. \nAmerica is supposed to be about debates on issues. It is not supposed \nto be a process where a billionaire can come into a small State such as \nMaine or Vermont and plop $50 million down or $20 million down to elect \ncandidates whose sole job in life is to represent the wealthy and the \npowerful.\n  Men and women have put their lives on the line and died to defend \nAmerican democracy--the right for all of us to be involved in the \npolitical process, not to create a situation where a handful of \nsuperwealthy families can elect the candidates they want.\n  I think some people, when they hear about Citizens United, say: Well, \nit is kind of an esoteric issue; it is not really relevant to my life.\n  Those who believe that are dead wrong. If people are concerned about \nthe collapse of the middle class; if people are concerned about the \nfact that more people today are living in poverty than at any time in \nAmerican history; if people are concerned about the fact that we have \nmore wealth and income inequality in America today than any other major \ncountry on Earth; if people are concerned that we are the only major \ncountry on Earth without national health care, guaranteeing health care \nto all people; if people are concerned about the crisis of global \nwarming and many other issues, people have to be interested in the \nissue of Citizens United and how we elect Members of the House and \nSenate and Governors, and so forth and so on, because ultimately what \nthis is about is whether the wealthy can determine the agenda of the \nHouse and the Senate, whether they can say to candidates: Here it is--\nwe are going to put $50 million into your campaign, and all you have to \ndo is support us on A, B, C, D, and E. You have to make sure the rich \nget more tax breaks--despite the fact that the wealthy are doing \nphenomenally well. You have to make sure we cut food stamps or \neducation or we eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency. That is \nwhy we are giving you the money we are giving you.\n  People do not spend hundreds of millions of dollars on campaigns for \nfun, for the hell of it; they are spending money because they have an \nagenda. And the billionaire agenda is not the agenda of the American \npeople.\n  I wish to read for a moment exact language from the 1980 Libertarian \nParty, whose Vice Presidential campaign and major funder was one David\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\nKoch--one of the two Koch brothers. What I am going to read to my \ncolleagues today is what I believe remains their agenda today because I \nsee no evidence that it has changed.\n  When we turn on the TV and we see an ad coming from one of the Koch \nbrothers' organizations, know what they stand for.\n  ``We favor the abolishment of Medicare and Medicaid programs.''\n  That doesn't mean cutting them; that means ending them.\n  ``We favor the repeal of a fraudulent, virtually bankrupt and \nincreasingly oppressive Social Security system.''\n  That does not mean they are opposed to raising the minimum wage, \nwhich many of us want to do; they want to do away with Social Security \nentirely--not cut Social Security but do away with it.\n  ``We support repeal of all laws which impede the ability of any \nperson to find employment, such as minimum wage laws.''\n  What that means in English is that while we are trying to raise the \nminimum wage, they want to abolish the concept of the minimum wage. So \nin high-unemployment areas, an employer can pay a worker $3 an hour or \n$4 an hour.\n  This is also from the Koch brothers' platform: ``We oppose all \ngovernment welfare, relief projects, and aid to the poor programs. All \nof these government programs are privacy-invading, paternalistic, \ndemeaning, and inefficient. The proper source of help for such persons \nis the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals.''\n  That means goodbye to good jobs, nutrition programs, Federal aid to \neducation, and goodbye to unemployment insurance.\n  This is not a conservative agenda. This is not a small-government \nagenda. This is an extremist agenda designed to eliminate virtually \nevery piece of legislation passed by Congress in the last 80 years \nwhich protects the middle class, working families, low-income people, \nseniors, and the system. That is their agenda.\n  I am not saying every Republican adheres to every aspect of this \nagenda, but these guys are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into \nthe political process for a reason, and that reason is to make the \nwealthiest people in this country even wealthier while they do away \nwith all legislation that protects working families.\n  Citizens United is one of the worst decisions in the history of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I hope every Member of the Senate votes this week \nto start the process for a constitutional amendment to overturn \nCitizens United.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the State of Georgia lost a great \ncitizen and America lost a great patriot. Truett Cathy, 93 years old, \nthe founder of Chick-fil-A restaurants, passed away this morning. One \nof the great entrepreneurs of all time, Truett Cathy started a \nrestaurant called the Dwarf House in College Park, GA, years and years \nago. He turned it into the Chick-fil-A restaurant, which now has over \n1,800 restaurants in 40 States and the District of Columbia. It is a \nfamily-owned business. It is not a public corporation. It is a business \nthat is built on the principles that Truett Cathy believed in and \nbelieved in to this day. Truett Cathy's stores are never open on \nSunday. He is a devout Christian and believes Sunday is a day of rest. \nSo he operates 6 out of the 7 days. Everybody who competes with Truett \nCathy operates for 7 days. But everybody who competes with Truett Cathy \nfinishes second in gross sales, second in quality, and second in the \nline.\n  Truett Cathy was an extra-special man whose life has been a great \ntribute to all the right things in life that all of us believe in.\n  Truett Cathy also gave back to his community probably more than any \nother person I know of. He founded WinShape Homes, WinShape to build \nboys, WinShape to take children who could not find a foster parent, put \nthem in a home and turned their life around. He was a prolific writer \nof book after book after book about his belief in life. His greatest \nbook is one I gave to each Member of the Senate about 5 years ago: \n``It's Better to Build Boys than Mend Men.'' Because he knew the \ncitizens of our country would be better if we had good foundations from \nthe beginning. So he tried to make sure all those who were less \nfortunate, who did not have the advantages he or others had, had a \nchance to grow up in a home with a warm and nurturing environment, a \nChristian environment, an environment that was dedicated to the \nprinciples of this country, and freedom and democracy.\n  Atlanta and Georgia will miss Truett Cathy. He is irreplaceable. It \nis said that nobody is irreplaceable. Truett Cathy is. But the legacy \nand the legend he built and his restaurants will go on as a flagship \nfor everything that is right about free enterprise and about the United \nStates of America.\n  On this day on the floor of the Senate, to his family and to his \nlegion of friends and to all he stood for and stands for, I mourn the \nloss of Truett Cathy, a great American and a great citizen.\n  I urge everybody, when they get the chance, to read the story of his \nlife, because it is the story of the American way of life. It is the \nstory of principles you are committed to, vision you hope for, taking a \nrisk to try and create a reward, and giving back to the community when \nyou earn the money from that reward, to see to it you leave this world \na better place than you found it.\n  For America and Georgia today, Truett Cathy has left us. He has gone \nto a much better place. But he has left our city, our State, and our \ncountry a better place than what he found. May God bless the life of \nTruett Cathy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This evening the Senate will vote on whether it should \nproceed to the consideration of a constitutional amendment that would, \nof all things, alter the Bill of Rights. Specifically, it seeks to \namend the First Amendment to permit this Congress to regulate the \nspeech and political activity of American citizens.\n  As written, the First Amendment does not permit regulation of the \nsort the majority wishes to impose, so they have decided to rewrite it. \nThis is incredible and a sad demonstration of the lengths to which this \nmajority is willing to go in its quest to retain power.\n  It is particularly sad when you realize that in just over 2 weeks we \nwill be celebrating the anniversary of the Senate action that made \nratification of the First Amendment possible. It was on September 25, \n1789, that this body passed the first 10 amendments to the Constitution \nof the United States. That was 225 years ago. The ratification process \nwas completed when Virginia became the 11th State to approve the \namendments on December 15, 1791.\n  Since then, for over two centuries, the First Amendment has \nguaranteed all Americans will have the right to express themselves and \nparticipate in the political process without fear of government \nreprisal. While other nations have struggled to build and sustain \ndemocracy, the liberties guaranteed by our Constitution have given us a \nstability that allowed the United States of America to grow, to \nprosper, and to become a beacon of freedom around the globe.\n  Our Founders knew that the free expression of ideas was essential to \nthe life and health of our democracy. Many other nations have yet to \nlearn this lesson and still punish and imprison their citizens for \ndaring to speak out and challenge those in power.\n  That does not happen here because of the system our Founders gave us. \nIt does not happen because of the First Amendment. These things should \nbe obvious. We might even call them self-evident. One would think that \neven in these polarized times we would have a consensus or could have a \nconsensus on the wisdom of the Founders on this point.\n  You would think that Senators on both sides of the aisle would \nrecognize and agree that the First Amendment, which has preserved our \nliberty, must itself be preserved.\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\n  I am very sorry to say that if you thought that, you would be wrong. \nI am very sorry to say that as we stand here today in September 2014 \nthose on the other side of the aisle now want to reverse the decision \nthis body made that September 225 years ago. Forty-nine Members of the \nmajority have chosen to cosponsor S.J. Res. 19, an amendment to the \nBill of Rights.\n  I am pleased to say that not a single one of my Republican colleagues \nhas joined them, but I am saddened that so many of those across the \naisle have taken the extraordinary step of supporting it.\n  I think the reason is clear. They want to silence their opponents. \nThe First Amendment does not allow them to do so, so they are going to \ntry and change it.\n  The First Amendment begins with ``Congress shall make no law''--for a \nreason. Our Founders knew a great deal about human nature. They knew \nthat those in power would be inclined to retain it and unless \nconstrained would use their power to punish those who would seek to \nchallenge them or remove them from office.\n  The First Amendment denies us that power. It explicitly prohibits \nthis Congress from passing laws that restrict the speech of the \nAmerican people.\n  Now the majority wants to remove that prohibition. They want to grant \nthemselves the power to control speech, to silence their opposition.\n  We will hear from the other side that there is nothing to worry \nabout, that all they wish to do is impose reasonable regulations.\n  Of course, the point of the First Amendment is to prevent this \nCongress from making determinations about what speech is reasonable--\nand, therefore, permitted--and what is unreasonable and, therefore, \nprohibited. We don't need to speculate about what the majority will \ndeem reasonable and what it will deem unreasonable.\n  As I described at a recent Rules Committee hearing on the DISCLOSE \nAct, prior consideration of that legislation has shown us what the \nmajority regards as reasonable. The DISCLOSE Act is the majority's most \nrecent version of their now biannual attempt to create a new regulatory \nstructure to deter speech. It is precisely the kind of legislation we \ncan expect to see more of if the majority grants itself the power to \nregulate speech through the amendment we are debating today.\n  So with past as prologue, let us recall what happened when the \nDISCLOSE Act was considered by the House in 2010. Not surprisingly, the \nrestrictions and obligations it imposed were applied to groups \ndisfavored by the majority at that time. A number of corporations were \nsimply prohibited from speaking. Government contractors and TARP \nrecipients were prohibited from making independent expenditures.\n  During floor consideration an amendment was added also to prohibit \nspeech by companies that explore and produce oil and gas on the Outer \nContinental Shelf. The bill was on the floor soon after the Deepwater \nHorizon spill, so this was an easy target.\n  Not surprisingly, the majority thought it was perfectly reasonable to \nprevent any of these companies from speaking but did not think it was \nnecessary to extend those restrictions to the unions that might \nrepresent the workforce in these companies. Republican amendments to \nextend the restrictions to those unions were rejected. The majority did \nnot find them reasonable, apparently.\n  In some cases groups were excluded from the disclosure obligation \nsolely because the votes were not there to include them. That is what \nhappens once the Congress starts imposing speech restrictions--\nrestrictions get applied to whoever doesn't have enough votes in the \nCongress to prevent them. Imposing speech regulations based on the \nwhims of whatever party happens to be in the majority in the Congress \nat a given time is not reasonable, but it is exactly what happens once \nwe start down this path and the majority has not deviated from it.\n  The Rules Committee hearing revealed the DISCLOSE Act continues to \nexempt groups sympathetic to the majority from the obligations it would \nimpose on others.\n  It may be a natural impulse to wish those who are criticizing us \nwould stop--everybody understands that--but the First Amendment does \nnot allow us to make it stop. We should not have the power to silence \nour critics and we should never have it.\n  I know many Members on the other side of the aisle are upset about \nthe ads that are attacking them and their agenda. I know they want \nthose ads to stop. Well, we don't get to choose who gets to speak.\n  The proponents of this amendment and the critics of the Citizens \nUnited decision are clearly exercised by the prospects of corporate \nspeech. It is obvious they fear how such speech might influence public \npolicy debate in this country and their own electoral prospects. They \nhave decided these voices should not be heard and must be suppressed.\n  They claim to be motivated only by a desire to promote the health of \nthis democracy. They claim they just want all voices to be heard and \nwant to make sure powerful corporations do not drown out the voices of \nothers.\n  This claim is belied by one simple fact that there are and always \nhave been powerful and wealthy corporations that have exerted enormous \ninfluence over our politics in this country and in our culture even. \nBut the majority has not had a problem with them. I am speaking, of \ncourse, of media corporations. They were never limited by the \nelectioneering restrictions imposed on other corporations. The Citizens \nUnited decision simply leveled the playing field and ended that \nnonsensical distinction.\n  That logical and constitutional result alarms the majority, though, \nbecause they fear that other corporations may not be as sympathetic to \nthem as media corporations have been. They therefore regard it as \nperfectly reasonable to allow media corporations to say whatever they \nwant, while at the same time regarding it as intolerable that other \ncorporations be permitted to do the same.\n  While the amendment they propose would allow them to prohibit speech \nby any corporation--including the media--we can expect their allies \nwill continue to enjoy the right to free expression. Their opponents, \nhowever, will be targeted. Those whose views align with the majority \nshould draw no comfort from this fact though. Majorities do change. The \nwhole point of the First Amendment is to ensure that the people's right \nto speak is not dependent on the whims of whatever majority happens to \nbe in power at a given time in the Senate.\n  People have a right to express themselves and that right is not \nlimited to whatever this body might deem to be reasonable.\n  We have a free marketplace of ideas. We do not entrust this Congress \nwith the power to decide what ideas will get expressed or how much they \nwill be expressed. Again, we don't entrust this Congress with the power \nto decide what ideas will get expressed or how much they will be \nexpressed.\n\n  The majority proposes this amendment because they want that power, \nbut they should never have it, and neither should any future majority. \nWe have already seen from the rule change they imposed unilaterally \nonly a few months ago that this majority is willing to jettison \nlongstanding traditions and practices for short-term political gain. \nThis mentality has already done serious and possibly irreparable damage \nto this body, but apparently destruction of the Senate rules will not \nsuffice. Now the Constitution itself must yield. The interests of the \nmajority are paramount and everything--even our most basic principles--\nmust be sacrificed on the altar of the majority.\n  Well, thankfully, the rules for ratification cannot be discarded as \neasily as the rules of this body. To ensure against precisely what the \nmajority wishes to do--to alter the Constitution for their own \nbenefit--the Founders made it very hard to amend. Two-thirds of each \nHouse of Congress must agree to an amendment. Then three-quarters of \nthe States must ratify it. That is just not going to happen.\n  But the fact that they will not succeed does not mean that we should \nnot take their threat seriously. To even begin down this path shows a \nremarkable contempt for our political traditions and founding \ndocuments. It reveals the desperation of the majority and at the same \ntime it reveals the wisdom of our Founders. In seeking to amend the \nFirst Amendment to protect\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\nthemselves, the majority reminds us again how lucky we are to live in a \ncountry with a Constitution that prevents such abuses.\n  I am profoundly grateful for the wisdom of the Founders and proud to \nstand here today to defend the First Amendment that they gave us.\n  I will oppose this amendment today, tomorrow, and forever, and I ask \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be charged equally to both parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, these last few weeks have been very \ntrying for America. In August, as the result of the cowardly and \nbarbaric acts of the terrorist group ISIS, America lost two courageous \nand inspiring journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.\n  Along with my colleagues Senators Ayotte, Nelson, and Rubio, and \nChairman Menendez, I am submitting a resolution to honor the lives of \nJames Foley, who was born and raised in New Hampshire, and Steven \nSotloff, a Florida native but a graduate of Kimball Union Academy in \nMeriden, NH.\n  Our resolution mourns James and Steven, two outstanding journalists \nwho pursued their profession under the most difficult and dangerous \nconditions in order to tell the stories that needed to be told of the \nstruggles that people on the ground were facing in the middle of \ndifficult conflicts. We will never forget the bravery of James and \nSteven and their dedication to the ideals of freedom they so embodied.\n  Our resolution strongly condemns the terrorist group ISIS, a group \nthat has committed unspeakable atrocities against humanity and \nattempted to justify them through a perverted interpretation of Islam. \nISIS fighters have targeted Iraqi Christians, killing many and forcing \nothers to flee their ancient homeland, they have massacred Muslims who \ndo not subscribe to their depraved ideology, they have threatened \ngenocide against the ancient Yazidi population of Iraq, and they have \ntargeted other religious and ethnic minority groups. They have \nthreatened to conduct terrorist attacks internationally, including here \nin the United States. And of course ISIS brutally murdered these two \nAmerican journalists, Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff.\n  Let us be clear. We must hold ISIS accountable for their despicable \nacts. We must vigorously pursue those responsible and bring them to \njustice, and we must not let the deaths of these two Americans go \nunanswered. The terrorists who murdered Jim Foley are deeply mistaken \nif they think their barbaric acts will lessen Americans' resolve and \npave the way for ISIS to continue terrorizing. We will bring an end to \nthose who stand against everything these men stood for.\n  I hope the entire Senate--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--\nwill stand together to adopt this resolution. Let us show the world our \nNation is united in its commemoration of the lives of James Foley and \nSteven Sotloff, and in our condemnation of the barbaric group that took \nthese Americans from us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with all the problems facing the country \nand the world, the majority has decided the time has come to cut back \non the Bill of Rights to be amended for the first time in our history.\n  We hear from the other side repeatedly that they revere the \nConstitution. But they want to restrict the core of free speech. That \nis speech that allows a self-governing people to choose in elections \nthe people who will represent them. This proposed amendment would \nenshrine in our Constitution the ability of elected officials to \ncriminally punish those who would dare to criticize them more than the \nelected officials think is reasonable.\n  Today Americans are free to spend unlimited money on behalf of \ncandidates and political issues and messages of their choice. The \namendment being proposed would put those who would engage in political \nspeech on notice that they may be prosecuted for being active citizens \nin our democracy. That threat of criminal prosecution would not just \nchill speech, it would freeze political speech. This proposed amendment \nwould be the biggest threat to free speech that Congress would have \nenacted since the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798.\n  The First Amendment creates a marketplace of ideas. When people \ndisagree on political speech, competing voices respond to each other \nand the public then decides. When speech is free, people are not shut \nup with the threat of jail if the government thinks they speak too \nmuch.\n  Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that because \neffective speech can only occur through the expenditure of money, \ngovernment cannot restrict campaign expenditures by candidates or \nanybody else. The Court has recognized that effective campaign speech \nrequires that individuals have the right to form groups that\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\nmight actually spend money on campaign speech.\n  The proposed amendment is very radical. It would not overturn just 1 \nor 2 but it would overturn 12 Supreme Court decisions. That was the \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee of the country's foremost \nFirst Amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams.\n  The other side may think the Senate can simply filibuster the motion \nto proceed and then move on to some other political vote they may want \nto have us take. Proposals to amend our fundamental charter of liberty, \nthe Bill of Rights, should be treated more seriously. We should have \ndebate on this important amendment. The majority should be made to \nanswer for why they want to silence their critics under threat of \ncriminal prosecution.\n  I look forward to supporting the vote to move to that debate, and I \nnow yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5364-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PRYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Jill Pryor to serve as circuit judge for the Eleventh \nJudicial Circuit.\n  Ms. Pryor's educational pedigree is beyond reproach. She worked to \nput herself through college at William & Mary, graduating phi beta \nkappa. She then went on to Yale Law School where she was the senior \neditor in chief of the Yale Law Journal. After finishing law school she \nclerked for Judge Edmundson on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in \nAtlanta, the very court for which she is today being considered.\n  Once she finished her clerkship, she decided to stay in Atlanta in \nprivate practice, where she has been practicing for the last 25 years. \nDuring that time she has played a pivotal role in some of the largest, \nmost complex cases in the history of our legal system and in our great \nState of Georgia. But like any other well-rounded attorney, Ms. Pryor \nhas taken time to give back outside the courtroom. She is currently on \nthe State Bar of Georgia Board of Governors, and she is also on the \nBoard of Governors of the Georgia Legal Services Program. She is the \nformer chair of the appellate practice section of the State bar, and \nshe is a past president of the Georgia Association for Women Lawyers.\n  The Eleventh Circuit will be well served by the addition of Ms. \nPryor, and as I said in July before the Senate unanimously confirmed \nJudge Julie Carnes to this very same court, this is a vacancy that \nneeds to be filled and needs to be filled quickly. Ms. Pryor certainly \nhas the judicial as well as educational background to serve on the \nEleventh Circuit. She has done extensive work inside the courtroom as \nwell as at the appellate level, and she is well qualified to now go to \nthe Eleventh Circuit.\n  I am pleased to speak on behalf of this highly qualified nominee, and \nI urge my colleagues to vote in support of Jill Pryor to the Eleventh \nCircuit judicial court.\n  Thank you very much. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PRYOR TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                            ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jill A. Pryor, \nof Georgia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will finally vote on the \nconfirmation of Jill Pryor of Georgia to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Her \nnomination has been pending in the Senate since February 2012--more \nthan two and one-half years, which is longer than any other currently \npending judicial nominee. She received the American Bar Association's \nhighest rating of unanimously well qualified and has the support of \nboth of her Republican home State Senators--Senator Chambliss and \nSenator Isakson. Rather than vote to confirm her before the August \nrecess, some Senate Republicans continued their senseless obstruction \nto keep the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty of advice \nand consent by filibustering her nomination for the sake of delay.\n  Despite this unyielding partisan strategy, the Senate has made great \nstrides to fill vacancies on courts around the Nation. This year the \nSenate has confirmed 61 nominees to the circuit and district courts and \nin doing so, it has hit an historic milestone for diversity on the \nFederal appeals courts. More women and people of color are serving on \nthe Federal appellate bench than ever before. Today I am happy that we \nwill add to this laudable record with yet another well-qualified \nnominee.\n  From the outset, President Obama has understood that our Federal \ncourts should reflect the diverse communities that it serves. He has \nnominated more women and more lawyers of color than any previous \nPresident in American history. Since the first day of the Obama \nadministration, former Senate staffer Christopher Kang has worked with \nhome State Senators to implement President Obama's goal of finding \njudicial nominees who not only embody the necessary integrity, \nintellect, and commitment to the rule of law, but who are also drawn \nfrom diverse backgrounds. I urge my fellow Senators to vote to confirm \nJill Pryor of Georgia and to agree to votes on the remaining district \ncourt judges on the calendar without delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Jill A. Pryor, of Georgia, to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Dr. Aaron is one of America's foremost \nexperts on Social Security. His many publications and contributions to \nthe program make him an invaluable asset. I strongly urge Senators to \nsupport his confirmation on this bipartisan board.\n  The second is one of the Senate's own, Dr. Alan Cohen, a veteran \neconomist of the Finance Committee staff. He will be an excellent board \nmember.\n  The third is Dr. Lanhee Chen.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I support all three of these nominations, \nbut I want to talk a moment about Dr. Henry Aaron.

He has been \ninvolved with Social Security his entire professional life dating back \nto 1979 when he chaired the Advisory Council on Social Security, which \nis a bipartisan group that works on Social Security.\n  He is an individual who will work across party lines in order to deal \nwith the short-term and long-term needs of Social Security.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak as in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 43 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                                  NDAA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. There is another issue I wish to talk about, and I have \ntalked to our leader, Chairman Levin, on the Armed Services Committee. \nThere are several members of the Armed Services Committee, including \nthe chair, on the floor.\n  I think we wanted a vote on what happened last year. Last year we did \nnot pass an NDAA--keep in mind we passed an NDAA every year for 52 \nyears. Perhaps, in my narrow view, I think it is the most significant \nbill we address every year.\n  Now we have this year's NDAA that we passed on May 22. It passed our \ncommittee 25 to 1. It had the overwhelming support of Democrats and \nRepublicans to go ahead and have an NDAA bill. Chairman Levin and I \nhave come to the floor and begged our colleagues to send down \namendments if they want. We have several amendments now, a couple \nhundred amendments. We are looking those over. We are going to try to \nsee what can go into a managers' amendment, and maybe we can come up \nwith something. I am hoping we can do it before the election, to come \nup with a bill that will consider the amendments. If we were able to \nsay to the Democrats and Republicans in this vote that we would \nrestrict it to ``X'' number of amendments, 3, 5, 6 amendments on each \nside, then I believe our leader would allow this to come to the floor \nso we could have an NDAA vote.\n  I have a number; 140 amendments have already been filed. The staff \nhas been working over the August recess to put together a managers' \npackage that is going to consider varieties of all these 140 \namendments, but we need more. What I don't want to happen is in the \nlast minute everyone comes up and says: Wait a minute. I have \namendments and I want to have them included. Now is the time to do it.\n  We have thousands of men and women serving today in harm's way, \nrisking their lives for us, for our Nation, and they are dealing with \nthe most complex and volatile global security environments I have ever \nseen in my life. We rely on them to do their job to keep our Nation \nsafe and they should rely on us to do the same.\n  Let's remember what happened last year. Last year we didn't do it and \nwe came up to the year-end, and it wasn't until then we decided we were \nnot going to be able to do it in the legitimate way that we have been \ndoing for 52 years. And so I happened to be the ranking member of the \nminority, and of course we have Chairman Levin and we had the two on \nthe House side. The big four got together in a room, took all the \namendments that had been considered, weeded through them, satisfied \nmost of the people, and in 3 hours we designed a bill, brought it out \nto the floor and passed it on the 26th of December. Now we have gone \nbeyond that. We have gone to December 31.\n  We have kids out there risking their lives without hazard pay, \nwithout reenlistment bonuses. It costs some $15 million to train a \nfighter in the air to the standards of an F-22, and the reenlistment \nbonus would be about $200,000. So the economics are there. Assuming we \nhad gone beyond that point, it would have been an absolute disaster.\n  So I am pleading with all of our Members on the Republican side and \non the Democratic side to do what is necessary to bring their \namendments down to the floor.\n  The President recently submitted an OCO request for $59 billion to \nfund operations in Afghanistan and around the world. The request \nincludes a new $4 billion counterterrorism partnership fund and $1 \nbillion for the European reassurance funds. Many questions remain about \nthese funds. I have questions about it. I haven't talked to one member \nof our Senate Armed Services Committee who knows the details of this \nrequest.\n  We are the ones who should be doing this. These are measures we can \ninclude in the NDAA, and I am going to ask and plead with our fellow \nMembers on the Democratic and Republican side to get your amendments in \nand let's go ahead and let us take a number of amendments on each side \nso we can have the ability to do it the way it should be done.\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\n  The only alternative is to do what we did last year, and that doesn't \ninclude anyone except four people in the House and Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, true to their Vermont roots, the citizens \nof Marshfield, VT, are bringing to fruition a new vision for the \nMarshfield Historical Society, an organization dedicated to \npreserving--and sharing--the long history of this 44-square mile town \nin the foothills of Vermont, just outside our State capital of \nMontpelier.\n  In the late 17th century, the land that came to be known as \nMarshfield was home to the Abenaki. Then, just as now, its inhabitants \nenjoyed the Winooski River to fish and the surrounding hills to hunt. \nMarshfield is a community that upholds tradition and passes stories \nfrom generation to generation. The land is clearly different than it \nwas centuries ago, but these customs can make it difficult to notice \nthe sometimes subtle changes Marshfield has borne. Creating a public \nspace to commemorate the town's past is the mission of the Marshfield \nHistorical Society.\n  On September 12, with the support of the Vermont Historical Society, \nthe Marshfield Historical Society will host its grand opening, a \nreopening of sorts. In concert with the support of the local \nSelectboard, the Jaquith Public Library, a generous anonymous donor, \nthe perseverance of a dedicated core of volunteers, and, of course, the \nresidents of Marshfield, the history of this small but vibrant town \nwill now be accessible to the public. Local artifacts and memorabilia, \ncloistered for years, will be publicly accessible in the Old \nSchoolhouse Common. The Marshfield Historical Society is returning to \nthe residents of Marshfield their own history.\n  The Marshfield Historical Society owes much to the memory of Hap \nHayward, a longtime resident, who was an original inspiration for the \nestablishment of a local historical society. The society's new site, \norganized content, and new exhibits will surely attract visitors and \nlocals. Some of their most noteworthy collections include a rare copy \nof Militia Law of the State of Vermont from 1843, as well as an \nextensive collection of postcards of Marshfield buildings and \nlandscapes. These artifacts belong to the residents of Marshfield, and \nto all Vermonters. As a longtime supporter of the historic preservation \nof our communities, our downtowns and our local histories, I am eager \nto visit the new historical society.\n  I congratulate the people of Marshfield on successfully undertaking \nthis impressive effort to protect their history for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5367-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5367-S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JAMES FOLEY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I would like to honor James Foley, a \nproud son of New Hampshire, whose life was guided by love--love for the \nhumanity he devoted his life to documenting, love for his family \nmembers who worked tirelessly to secure his release, and love for God \nwho brought him strength and comfort, even in the darkest moments.\n  The entire Nation was saddened to hear the news about Jim. It was \nwith a heavy heart that I joined the Foley family and a crowd of nearly \n1,000 on August 24 at Our Lady of the Holy Rosary parish in Rochester, \nNH, to memorialize Jim and reflect upon how he chose to live his life.\n  As we here pause to remember Jim, we cannot allow those responsible \nfor his death to fill us with sorrow and despair. Though the sense of \nloss remains, through Jim's life we may hope to rediscover a sense of \noptimism and goodness--the same feelings that motivated him as a \njournalist to search for humanity in the world's darkest and most \ndangerous places.\n  When I think of Jim, I will remember his fierce passion for his work \nand for the people whose stories he lived to tell. I will remember the \ninterminable spirit of his parents, Diane and John. And I will remember \nhow New Hampshire, and Americans across the country, came together to \nsupport the Foleys.\n  Jim Foley's life began in Wolfeboro, a small New Hampshire town on \nthe shores of Lake Winnipesauke. He graduated in 1992 from Kingswood \nRegional High School, where classmates remember him as light-hearted, \nbut also caring and eager to see the world. As the oldest of Diane and \nJohn Foley's five children, James developed a strong sense of \nresponsibility for others.\n  Jim was known in his family for running late because wherever he went \nhe ran into friends and colleagues who wanted to stop and catch up with \nhim. Jim's uncommon kindness earned him the trust and friendship of \npeople across the United States and the world.\n  Jim's compassion for others and his desire to learn their stories is \nwhat motivated his life's work. According to his parents, Jim's \nexposure to the poverty of inner-city Milwaukee while attending \nMarquette University led him to realize that people are often shaped by \nevents and circumstances out of their control, and that it was within \nhis power to tell their stories.\n  He carried this mission with him throughout his life and used it as a \nbasis for his work in conflict zones.\n  After graduating from Marquette, Jim started down the path that would \nturn him into the successful journalist he became. He first taught \nhistory for 3 years at middle school in Phoenix, AZ, a world away from \nhis upbringing in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire.\n  Eager to learn how best to turn his experiences into compelling \nstories, he went on to complete master's degrees in writing and \njournalism at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Northwestern \nUniversity. Classmates of Jim's at Northwestern recall that when one of \nhis professors assigned him to cover a neighborhood in the Lower West \nSide of Chicago, Jim decided to move there, a telling decision for a \nfuture frontline journalist.\n  Jim later gained experience in conflict reporting while covering U.S. \nmilitary operations as an embedded reporter in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nbut he worried that being removed from the local population detracted \nfrom his reporting to people back home.\n  When a wave of popular revolutions swept the Middle East and North \nAfrica in the spring of 2011, Jim knew that he needed to bear witness \nto this incredible phenomenon from the perspective of those living \nthrough it.\n  Jim left for Libya, where he provided critical stories on the Libyan \ncivil war until he was captured and imprisoned for 44 days by pro-\nGadhafi forces.\n  Others who were detained with Jim tell stories of his unending \nselflessness toward his fellow prisoners--how he shared food, blankets \nand an endless stream of jokes to help everyone cope with a difficult \nand scary situation.\n  Furthermore, when Jim returned to the U.S. after his release, he was \nfrequently asked to tell the story of his capture and detention. \nInstead of focusing on his own experience, Jim used the publicity to \nraise money for the family of a colleague who had been killed in the \nattack that led to Jim's capture. It was Jim's nature to care more \nabout others than he did about his own personal successes or accolades.\n  In his reporting from Libya, Jim discovered that his passion was in \nhelping the world relate to those in the middle of unimaginable \nconflict, and he would soon return to the region, this time to Syria, \nwhere Bashar al-Assad was escalating his brutal tactics of repression \nto maintain control of the country.\n  It was in the Syrian chaos that observers began to talk about rise of \na group of militant Islamists calling themselves the Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria, the same group that would later hold Jim hostage for \n637 days\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\nalongside a handful of other innocent journalists and aid workers.\n  Thanks to a message Jim passed to his family through a fellow \nprisoner who was released, we know that his close relationship with God \nand his family provided him with strength in captivity.\n  In the letter, he thanked his family and friends for their thoughts \nand prayers, and recounted treasured memories from time spent together. \nMost strikingly, he spent most of his words offering encouragement and \nsupport to those he loved. Even in the most trying circumstances, Jim \nFoley refused to abandon his core concern for others over himself.\n  We will always remember Jim for his compassion and devotion to the \nlives and stories of others, even in the most difficult conditions.\n  We are all proud to call James Foley our fellow American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5368-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN ARNOLD\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and congratulate John \nArnold and recognize the 47th anniversary of Portable Practical \nEducational Preparation. This is a noteworthy milestone, an opportunity \nto recognize them for their remarkable history and the important \nresults they continue to achieve.\n  The story of Portable Practical Educational Preparation begins with \nJohn Arnold and his vision of what could be done to address the \nproblems being faced by the poor and those who came to America in \nsearch of a better life. His response was to roll up his sleeves and \nget to work. He knew an education would be the key these individuals \nwould need to create a better life for themselves and their families. \nOver the past 47 years the success he began in that and so many other \nefforts has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n  The work that began in Arizona proved to be just the beginning. John \nhas since reached out to those in need across the country and around \nthe world. When Hurricane Katrina devastated so many of our Southern \nStates, he was there to help provide those whose lives were forever \nchanged with a reason to hope for a better future because he cared \nenough to help. His other projects have reached out to people in Africa \nto provide them with the resources they needed to improve their lives, \ntheir communities, and their countries.\n  As has been said before, John Arnold leads the best way--by example. \nBy so doing, he has provided us with a chance to see what can be done \nif we are sufficiently motivated and determined to take on the greatest \nchallenge of them all--changing the world--and creative and \nenthusiastic enough to make it happen.\n  I want to offer my congratulations to John and all those who have \nworked with him over the years. He has made so many things happen, and \nwe are all looking forward to seeing what he will take up in the years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5368-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NEW HARMONY, INDIANA BICENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the outstanding \ncitizens of New Harmony, IN as they celebrate their town's 200th \nanniversary and to recognize the many contributions of New Harmony's \ncitizens to the great State of Indiana and our Nation as a whole.\n  New Harmony was founded in 1814 by the Harmonie Society, led by Georg \nJohann Rapp. Just 5 short years after purchasing land along the Wabash \nRiver, the settlers had developed the area into a productive and \nprosperous community. In 1825, the community was sold to Robert Owen \nand his financial associate William Maclure. With the continued \ndevelopments of Owen, a Welsh industrialist, and Maclure, who some \nconsider ``the father of American geology,'' New Harmony became a \nmagnet for intellectual and academic innovators of the 19th century. \nThe town had been called ``the Athens of the West'' because of the many \nscholars and scientists that called New Harmony home, such as the \nrenowned American entomologist Thomas Say, French educator Marie Duclos \nFrategeot, and Dutch naturalist Gerard Troost.\n  Throughout its history, New Harmony has demonstrated a constant \nspirit of innovation, especially in the educational and scientific \nfields. New Harmony was the home of the early kindergarten movement in \nAmerica, as well an early example of what is now called a technical \nschool. Robert Owen's son, David Dale Owen, led the early geological \nsurveys of the Midwest, and another son, Robert Dale Owen, was a U.S. \nRepresentative from New Harmony, who wrote the bill to establish the \nSmithsonian Institution and chaired the Building Committee. Robert Dale \nOwen was also an abolitionist who was influential in shaping President \nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n  New Harmony has long sustained its spirit of cultural innovation. In \n1979, world-renowned architect Richard Meier designed the Atheneum of \nNew Harmony. Since its construction, the Atheneum has been recognized \nwith the prestigious Progressive Architecture Award and the American \nInstitute of Architects' Twenty-Five Year Award.\n  I wish to congratulate the council members of New Harmony, Joe Straw, \nDon Gibbs, Linda Warrum, Karen Walker, and Andrew Wilson; the entire \nBicentennial Commission and its co-chairs, Connie Weinzapfel and \nRaymond McConnell; as well as the citizens of New Harmony for their \nongoing support and contributions to their community and the State of \nIndiana.\n  Today, New Harmony remains a bastion of the hard work, dedication, \nand innovation that are such an integral part of the Hoosier spirit \nthat makes Indiana the great State it is today. On behalf of the \ncitizens of Indiana, I congratulate each and every member of the New \nHarmony community on the town's 200th Anniversary. I wish them \ncontinued success and growth for many more years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5368-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5368-S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       2014 GREEN RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today, I wish to applaud the Saint \nThomas Aquinas School of Indianapolis and Carmel High School of Carmel, \nIN for being recognized as 2014 Green Ribbon Schools by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  Established in 2011, the Green Ribbon School program is the Federal \nGovernment's first comprehensive green school initiative. Since its \ninception, the program has offered the opportunity for schools in every \nState to gain recognition for educational and environmental \naccomplishments. Recognition as a Green Ribbon institution is based on \na school's ability to reduce environmental impact, improve the health \nof students and staff, and provide environmental education. Both of \nthese exceptional Hoosier schools have made great strides in these \nareas.\n  In 2003, Saint Thomas Aquinas School constructed a National Wildlife \nFederation-certified schoolyard where students can learn about the \nenvironmental sciences as they grow vegetables for a local food pantry. \nIn addition, Saint Thomas Aquinas School has also greatly reduced its \ncarbon footprint through the installation of new energy efficient \nwindows and low-flush toilets, the implementation of an extensive \nrecycling program, and the encouragement of walking and biking to \nschool. As a result, Saint Thomas Aquinas has reduced its solid waste \nby nearly 30 percent and carbon-emissions by nearly 19 percent.\n  Similarly, Carmel High School has made its campus and the surrounding \ncommunity environmentally friendly. Carmel has embraced energy saving \ntechnology such as energy efficient bulbs and LED lighting and has \nmoved to a fuel efficient bus fleet. After two decades of implementing \nthese impressive measures, Carmel High School has reduced its energy \nconsumption by 72 percent, its greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50 \npercent and its water consumption by 55 percent. The school also \nestablished Carmel Green Teen, a board that dispenses microloans for \nstudent projects that work towards pollution reduction, conservation, \nand energy savings.\n  I would like to thank Principal Cara Swinefurth of Saint Thomas \nAquinas School and Principal John Williams of Carmel High School, their \nentire staffs, and their students for the hard work and dedication it \nundoubtedly took to receive this prestigious award.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate both the Carmel \nHigh\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\nSchool and Saint Thomas Aquinas communities, and I wish them continued \nsuccess in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5369-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         RAYMOND, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the town \nof Raymond, NH, which is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding this month. I am proud to recognize this historic milestone.\n  Located in Rockingham County along the Lamprey River in southeast New \nHampshire, the geographic area that Raymond now occupies was originally \na parish of Chester called Freetown by its early settlers who came from \nnearby Exeter. Later, in 1764, the town was incorporated by colonial \nGovernor Benning Wentworth and was officially named Raymond.\n  Since its incorporation in 1764, the population in Raymond has grown \nto approximately 10,000 residents, whose dedication to preserving the \ntown's unique character and historical charm is a testament to their \npatriotism and pride. Raymond is also a hub for commerce with a vibrant \ndowntown.\n  Raymond's town common serves as a central gathering place for the \ncommunity and helps makes this town a quintessential New England \ntreasure. Each year Raymond's residents come together for the annual \nChristmas parade and tree lighting, the Fourth of July parade, Veterans \nDay, and other special events. The town is also home to several \nhistoric sites, including the Raymond Congregational Church, which was \nestablished in 1874, the Dudley-Tucker Library, and the old Raymond \nRailroad Depot, which now houses the Raymond Historical Society.\n  The theme for Raymond's 250th anniversary celebration is ``My Town, \nYour Town, Our Town.'' These words reflect the deep pride and spirit of \ncitizenship that have defined Raymond over the course of the past 250 \nyears--and which will continue to guide the town's future. Among the \nmany activities planned as part of Raymond's 250th celebration is a \nparade that will bring together local residents, community \norganizations, businesses, veterans, and students. I am truly honored \nto be joining residents of Raymond for this special and historic event.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I am delighted to \ncongratulate the citizens of Raymond on this important occasion in the \ntown's history and commend them for their many contributions to our \nState and their spirit of community--which will endure for the next 250 \nyears and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5369-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL SIELICKI\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the exceptional \npublic service of my good friend Police Chief Michael Sielicki. Mike \nSielicki has worked as a New Hampshire law enforcement officer for more \nthan 26 years, retiring as the chief of police of the Kensington Police \nDepartment.\n  After serving in the U.S. Army with the 82nd Airborne Division from \n1979 to 1983, then as a combat engineer in Germany from 1983 to 1986, \nChief Sielicki returned to New Hampshire to serve in the New Hampshire \ncriminal justice system. He first joined the Hillsborough County \nDepartment of Corrections in 1986 and then the Coos County Department \nof Corrections in 1987. Mike Sielicki began his law enforcement career \nwith the Colebrook Police Department in 1987 and attended the New \nHampshire Police Academy in 1989. Through his hard work and dedication, \nhe rose through the ranks and became the chief of the Colebrook Police \nDepartment in 1993, serving in that capacity until 1999, when he \naccepted the chief's position in Hancock, where he worked from 1999 to \n2003. In 2003, he was appointed the chief of police of the Rindge \nPolice Department, where he served until accepting the chief's position \nin Kensington in 2012.\n  In a career that has spanned three decades, Mike has established a \nreputation as a knowledgeable, respected and compassionate public \nsafety professional and engaged community member. He established the \nColebrook Police Athletic League in 1994. Chief Sielicki became a \nfoster parent and subsequently served as the president of the New \nHampshire Foster Parent Association from 1999 to 2004. He led the Law \nEnforcement Torch Run for NH Special Olympics from 2008 to 2011.\n  During my tenure as New Hampshire's attorney general, it was my \nprivilege to work directly with Chief Sielicki on many important law \nenforcement initiatives. Mike earned the respect and admiration of his \npeers and has been a thoughtful, effective leader in efforts to improve \nthe criminal justice system and public safety in New Hampshire. Active \nin the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, Chief Sielicki \nrose through the executive board chairs and served as its president \nfrom 2013 to 2014, a term he just completed. A courageous and respected \nleader, Mike often spoke out on important public policy issues, such as \nopposing the legalization of marijuana, and the expansion of gambling.\n  As Chief Sielicki celebrates his retirement, I want to commend him on \na job well done and ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him, his \nwife Kim, and their family well in all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5369-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5369-S5370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING COMMAND SERGEANT MAJOR HOWARD A. McRAE\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to memorialize a \ndecorated veteran from the Alaska community of Haines, CSM Howard A. \nMcRae. Born in 1929, he wanted to see more of the world, so, with his \nbuddy Dave Berry, he made his way to Seattle. In that short distance, \nthe two young men found themselves broke, so they joined the U.S. Army, \nwhere they received training in electronics. That was 1948.\n  For Howard it was a turning point. Described by a family member as \n``a little disheveled,'' the Army changed his life. He was now on his \nway to a 23-year military career, including 11 in the Green Berets.\n  Howard got his wish to see more of the world, although perhaps not as \noriginally intended. Assignments took him to Korea, Japan, Laos, \nCambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. He did four tours of duty in Korea and \nthree in Vietnam.\n  Described as courageous and disciplined, Howard McRae received many \ncitations and medals for his bravery, his dedication to duty, and his \nleadership. Among them: an Army Commendation Medal with three Bronze \nOak Leaf Clusters to include a ``V'' for valor; a Korean Service Medal \nwith four Bronze Service Stars; a Vietnam Service Medal with three \nBronze Service Stars, a United Nations Service Medal given by the U.N. \nfor participation in the Korean war; and an Army Commendation Medal and \nOak Leaf Cluster for meritorious service as chief instructor of the \nAdvance Training Committee and as sergeant major and director of \ninstruction at Fort Bragg, NC.\n  Exemplifying the military's own respect for Command Sergeant Major \nMcRae, he was among the 44 Special Services soldiers chosen to stand \nguard over President John F. Kennedy's body as he lay in State in the \nWhite House. McRae had said that this was his proudest moment.\n  In his later military career, McRae was command sergeant major of the \nSpecial Forces School and the High Altitude Low Opening Military \nSchool, parachute at Fort Bragg, NC. As the highest ranking \nnoncommissioned officer at the post, he was in charge of oversight for \nthose who taught tactical training skills. Truly, he was a leader among \nleaders.\n  Unfortunately, and likely due to the effects of agent orange \nconnected to his service in Vietnam, Command Sergeant Major McRae was \nmedically retired in 1971. With wife Sarah Elizabeth, whom he met at \nFort Bragg, he returned to Haines. There, he continued in service but \nthis time through the city and borough of Haines, where he served in \nthe borough assessor's office. In 1976 he and Sarah moved to Juneau, \nwhere he served as a budget analyst for the Alaska Department of \nEducation.\n  Every inch a soldier, McRae raised his blended family of 8 children \nand 34 grandchildren to serve. His son Guy served in the Army, as did \ngrandsons Steven and Joshua. Grandson Thomas joined the Marines and, \ngiven his grandfather's indomitable spirit, survived serious injuries \nin Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\n  Sadly, we lost Command Sergeant Major McRae in 1987, but given his \nservice through the military, his community, and State, it is only \nfitting that his home community of Haines has placed his name in \npartnership with another great Alaskan leader, Walter Soboleff, on a \nveteran's home. The Soboleff-McRae Veterans Village and Wellness Center \nwill forever serve as a reminder of the exemplary service of this man \ngave to his country. We are eternally grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5370-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING KRAFT FOODS\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, Kraft Foods has a long history in \nSpringfield, MO, and is observing two anniversaries this year. Kraft \nstarted production of processed cheese in 1939 on the second floor of a \nbuilding on West Mill Street. After 15 years, Kraft made the decision \nto expand and build a ``modern new plant'' on property on the outskirts \nof town off Bennett Street east of Glenstone. This plant is now home to \nmore than 800 employees who enjoy good-paying jobs. The 780,000-square-\nfoot plant turns out hundreds of millions of pounds of product \nannually, including Kraft American Singles, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese in \nboxes and microwaveable cups, and Kraft natural cheeses. The dozens of \ndifferent products made at Kraft Foods-Springfield are distributed \nthroughout the South, the Midwest, and the mountain States.\n  The current Springfield plant was expanded again in 1976, adding \n219,000 square feet of modernized production space for new lines of \npasta products; shredded cheese joined the product mix, and a 100,000-\nsquare-foot warehouse was completed in 2000. Kraft-Springfield receives \nraw products by the train car load every day, and a fleet of trucks \nsends the finished products to the marketplace. In 2010, working with \nthe city of Springfield, bonds were issued to allow Kraft to expand, \nwhich included an $18 million pasta press, drying equipment, and a \nnatural cheese project. Another $20 million funded new technology for \nKraft Singles, and a third project funded improvements to the EZ Mac \ncup line.\n  Critical to the success of the Kraft-Springfield operation is the \noffsite warehouse in the Springfield Underground. Opened more than 50 \nyears ago when below-surface storage was untested, offsite space today \nboasts reduced energy costs and performance sustainability. At 36 \ndegrees Fahrenheit, the Kraft Foods space in the underground stores \ncheeses, Oscar Mayer meats, and Jell-O puddings. Kraft officials \nbelieve that the facility uses about 65 percent less electricity than a \ncomparable surface warehouse. It is another part of the emphasis Kraft \nplaces on its environmental stewardship. The Kraft facility achieved \nthe Ozarks GreenScore Green Level in 2013--the highest level of \nenvironmental achievement--and the Ozarks GreenScore Gold Level in \n2011.\n  Kraft employees and the company also give back to the community \nthrough product donations, employee time and fundraising to support the \nOzarks Food Harvest, Boys & Girls Clubs of Springfield, United Way Day \nof Caring, and Park Board Dairy Days, among numerous other \norganizations.\n  I remember touring the plant during our Congressional Agriculture \nTour in 2000 and later at the Underground. It was a remarkable facility \nthen and is even more advanced now. The commitment Kraft Foods has made \nto Springfield is reflected in the commitment Springfield has made to \nKraft. On this 60th anniversary of the plant and Kraft's 75th year in \nSpringfield, I hope this unique public-private partnership survives for \nmany generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5370-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JACKIE ROBINSON WEST LITTLE LEAGUE CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Chicago's very \nown Jackie Robinson West Little League team, who are the reigning 2014 \nLittle League World Series U.S. Champions. Jackie Robinson West is the \nfirst team from Chicago to reach the Little League World Series in more \nthan 40 years. They have brought immense pride to our city, and I \ncommend them on their incredible achievement.\n  From Chicago's South Side, the Jackie Robinson West team consists of \n13 players aged 11-13 years old. The last Little League team from \nChicago to make it nearly this far was in 1967, and we were long \noverdue for another run at the championship. These 13 players worked \ntogether for countless hours to bring their A-game to the field. During \ntheir season, they outscored their opponents by a score of 212 to 28! \nTheir teamwork, dedication to their teammates and coaches, and \nperseverance to become champions is nothing short of an inspiration to \nmyself and our entire country.\n  Jackie Robinson West showed us all what true dedication, tireless \neffort and teamwork can achieve. They represented our Nation with great \npride and sportsmanship on and off the field, and I am proud of each \nand every one of these young men for what they have achieved and for \nthe sense of pride and accomplishment that they have brought to our \ncity. They are an inspiration to young men and women across Chicago and \nthroughout the Nation.\n  I want to personally congratulate DJ Butler, Lawrence Noble, Jaheim \nBenton, Ed Howard, Cameron Bufford, Brandon Green, Darion Radcliff, \nMarquis Jackson, Joshua Houston, Eddie King, Prentiss Luster, Pierce \nJones, Trey Hondras, their coach Darold Butler, director Bill Haley, \nand assistant coaches Jerry Houston and Jason Little on their historic \nwin. I am exceedingly proud of their accomplishments and wish them best \nof luck in this upcoming school year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5370-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5370-S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOSEPH CALNAN\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I honor Mayor Joseph Calnan, \nof Anaconda, MT. It is with pride that I recognize his dedication and \nservice to those Montanans who most needed a helping hand.\n  Joseph Calnan believed in the value of hard work. He spent 30 years \nworking for the Butte Anaconda Pacific Railroad. Each night he returned \nhome for dinner with his wife and seven children before heading out to \nhis second job at a local store. The only interruption in his long \ncareer was the 4 years he spent working as the mayor of Anaconda.\n  Mayor ``Joe'' Calnan took office in 1963 and immediately began \nfighting for a better Anaconda. He worked to beautify Anaconda's \nCommon, taking it from a weedy field to the lush, tree-filled park it \nis today. Joe fought to open land for business development at a time \nwhen one in five Americans was living below the poverty line. He knew \nthe importance of creating jobs so hardworking folks would have a \nchance to provide for their families. His own children still remember \nhim saying time and again, ``We have plenty of picnic tables in \nAnaconda. But without jobs, there won't be food to put on those \ntables.''\n  As he worked on the local level, Joe also kept an eye on national \npolitics. On August 20 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the \nEconomic Opportunity Act into law, creating the Job Corps. Job Corps \nallows young people from low income families to get the training they \nneeded to enter the workforce, free of charge. Joe began his campaign \nto bring a Job Corps center to Anaconda immediately.\n  First, Joe wrote to Sergeant Shriver, Special Assistant to the \nPresident, to request the establishment of a Job Corps center at the \nForest Creek Picnic Area just west of Anaconda. He received an \nencouraging reply, and traveled to Washington to meet with Senators \nMike Mansfield and Lee Metcalf and Representative Arnold Olsen to \nfinalize his proposal. When the first three Job Corps students arrived \nin Anaconda in 1966, they got off the bus to find Joe waiting there for \nthem in his personal car. Through a partnership with the Forest \nService, the Job Corps program thrived at the Anaconda Job Corps \nCivilian Conservation Center.\n  The Anaconda Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center has graduated \nover 14,000 students since it opened its door, over 160 students are \ncurrently enrolled, and most importantly, 86 percent of enrolled \nstudents get jobs.\n  On August 20, Job Corps celebrated its 50th anniversary. At the \nAnaconda Center, the Forest Service dedicated its newly completed \ndining hall to Mayor Calnan in honor of his hard work to bring the Job \nCorps to his town. While Joe has passed away, his children, \ngrandchildren, and great grandchildren were there to celebrate\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\nthe event. Job Corps students had created the metal sign dedicating the \ndining hall, the same sort of hard-working young people that Joe spent \nso much time helping during his time as mayor. They put it best. The \nsign reads simply, ``Joseph F. Calnan Thank You for Your \nVision.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5371-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING TERESA LAWRENCE\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish today to honor Teresa \nLawrence, CEO of Delta Personnel and the 2014 recipient of the \nExcelencia Award for Small Business Leadership by the Hispanic Chamber \nof Commerce of Louisiana.\n  Teresa was born in Cuba and came to the United States in 1973 to \nescape tyranny. She came here with her mother, brother, and \ngrandmother. Tragically, her father was unable to join the family in \nleaving Cuba and was killed 4 years later.\n  Teresa's mother, along with her grandmother, instilled in her a \nstrong work ethic. She began working at the age of 14 by bagging \ngroceries, and eventually worked her way up to the position of \nadvertising account executive. She attended college for 2 years until \nher mother was injured and needed her help. Teresa then took a full \ntime job at a large architectural firm to help support the family. She \nsaid this position helped sharpen her skills and expand her vocabulary.\n  In 1988, Teresa married David Lawrence, whose family owned and \noperated a staffing agency, Delta Temporaries. That same year, the \nbusiness was struggling and her father-in-law was diagnosed with \nParkinson's disease, so David and Teresa quit their jobs and began \nrunning the company. With no formal training in the staffing \nprofession, they spent years trying to run the business, get out of \ndebt, and just survive.\n  In 2000, Teresa became the sole owner of Delta Personnel. Just when \nshe felt she had really turned things around, the community was \ndevastated by Hurricane Katrina, which brought immeasurable changes not \nonly to her business, but also to southeast Louisiana. Through a lot of \nhard work, Teresa and her staff were able to re-open the business in \nBaton Rouge before eventually being able to locate the business back \nhome in Metairie.\n  Teresa is known as a great leader who places an emphasis on \nempowering her staff to make decisions needed to help their business \ngrow and thrive. She participated in and graduated from the Goldman \nSachs 10,000 Small Businesses program in New Orleans in March of 2012. \nSince joining 10,000 Small Businesses, her company has more than \ndoubled their sales from $2.3 million with expectations to exceed $5 \nmillion this year. Teresa says the great reward is that she and her \nstaff have placed more than 950 people in jobs across the Gulf Coast.\n  I am pleased to join with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of \nLouisiana in honoring Teresa Lawrence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5371-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NORTHWEST YOUTH CORPS ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this weekend, the Northwest Youth \nCorps celebrated its 30th year of providing young people with \nopportunities to learn and lead. For three decades, Northwest Youth \nCorps has educated youth and young adults and instilled in them a \nstrong sense of leadership, community, and environmental stewardship.\n  Northwest Youth Corps, NYC, founder Art Pope created NYC in 1984. Mr. \nPope's inspiration for the NYC stemmed from the 1930s-era Civilian \nConservation Corps, CCC, which provided work to the unemployed during \nthe Great Depression. Mr. Pope was inspired by the hands-on, education-\nbased model of the CCC and wanted to extend the vision of hard work and \nservice to modern youth. The NYC philosophy encourages youth to pursue \nindividual achievement, develop a solid work ethic and leadership \nskills, all while benefitting their communities and the environment.\n  Thirty years ago, NYC extended this vision to its first class of 52 \nstudents. Today, NYC serves more than 1,000 teens per year across 5 \nStates. NYC offers a wide variety of programs for youth and teens from \n12 to 19 years old. Youth enrolled in NYC summer programs learn \nconservation values in a hands-on learning environment. Summer programs \nrange from teaching youth how to build trails and enhance natural \nhabitats to 6-week camping programs where teens learn reforestation \ntechniques. At the summer program graduation last year, I saw firsthand \nthe sense of accomplishment and pride NYC students feel upon completing \n6 weeks of conservation efforts in our State's beautiful forests.\n  In 1997, NYC drew from the success of its summer programs and \nestablished a full-year high school. Over the past 17 years, the \nOutDoor High School has grown into a fully-accredited, tuition-free, \nprivate high school with a strong focus on applied learning and \nenvironmental stewardship.\n  NYC's hands-on conservation education programs have enriched the \nlives of more than 16,000 students over the past 30 years, and have \ntouched countless communities and ecosystems across the west. It is my \npleasure to recognize Northwest Youth Corps 30th anniversary. I look \nforward to NYC's continued contribution to the community for many, many \nmore years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5371-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5371-4", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5371-5", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 5230.

A bill to amend section 349 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act to deem specified activities in support of terrorism as \nrenunciation of United States nationality; read the first time.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue of grave \nimportance to the national security of the United States; that is, the \nthreat from the radical Sunni terrorist organization known as the \nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria or simply as the Islamic State.\n  Now it claims to control territory in a grotesque parody of a nation \nstate. ISIS is a study in oppression and brutality that is conducting \nethnic cleansing against religious minorities in the region; that is, \ntargeting and persecuting Christians and that is attempting to subject \nthe local population to the strictest forms of Sharia law. ISIS has \ngrotesquely murdered U.S. civilians and indeed journalists on the \npublic stage. It should come as no surprise that the people of the \nUnited States are deeply concerned about this development. We are \nconcerned about the inability of our government to anticipate this \ngathering threat. We are concerned about the brutal acts of oppression \nagainst the weak and the helpless.\n  We are concerned about ISIS's seizure of financial and military \nassets that have fueled their murderous rampage. Above all, we are \nconcerned about the threat ISIS poses, not only to our close allies in \nthe region but also to our citizens and even here in our homeland.\n  There has been a lot of talk in recent days about developing a \nstrategy to combat ISIS. I would like to propose a couple of \ncommonsense steps that we should take immediately to combat this \nscourge.\n  First, the time has come--it is beyond time--for us to secure our \nborders. Representing the State of Texas, which has a border nearly \n2,000 miles long, I know firsthand how unsecure the border is right \nnow. This week of all weeks, with the anniversary of the September 11 \nattacks upon us, we can have no illusions that terrorists will not try \nto make good on their specific threats to attack America. As long as \nour border is not secure, we are making it far too easy for the \nterrorists to carry through on those promises.\n  Rumored ISIS activities on the southern border should unite us all in \nthe resolve to make border security a top priority rather than an \nafterthought or rather than something to be held hostage for political \nnegotiations in the Congress. Second, we should take commonsense steps \nto make fighting for or supporting ISIS an affirmative renunciation of \nAmerican citizenship. We know there are over 100 Americans who have \njoined ISIS who have taken up arms alongside the jihadists, along with \nthousands of others from the European Union.\n  We also know they are trying to return to their countries of origin \nto carry out terrorist attacks there. We know this because on May 24 an \nISIS member returned to Belgium where he attacked innocent visitors at \na Jewish museum, slaughtering four people. It was reported today he had \nbeen plotting an even larger attack on Paris on Bastille Day.\n  In addition, on August 11 of this year, an accused ISIS sympathizer, \nDonald Ray Morgan, was arrested at JFK Airport trying to reenter the \nUnited States. So we know this threat is real. That is why I have today \nfiled legislation, the Expatriate Terrorist Act of 2014, which would \namend the existing statutes governing renunciation of U.S. citizenship \nto designate fighting for a hostile foreign government or foreign \nterrorist organization as an affirmative renunciation of citizenship.\n  By fighting for ISIS, U.S. citizens have expressed their desire to \nbecome citizens of the Islamic state. That cannot and will not \npeacefully coexist with remaining American citizens, the desire to \nbecome a citizen of a terrorist organization that has expressed a \ndesire to wage war on the American people, has demonstrated a brutal \ncapacity to do so, murdering American civilians on the global stage and \npromising to bring that jihad home to America.\n  We should not be facilitating their efforts by allowing fighters \nfighting alongside ISIS to come back to America with American passports \nand walk freely in our cities to carry out unspeakable acts of terror. \nIt is my hope the legislation I am introducing today will earn support \non both sides of the aisle, that we will see this body come together \nand say: While there are many partisan issues that divide us, when it \ncomes to protecting U.S. citizens from acts of terror, we are all as \none. That is my fervent hope.\n  The third thing we should do is we should do everything possible to \nmake ISIS understand there are serious ramifications for threatening to \nattack the United States, for murdering American citizens. While \ndamaging ISIS's financial assets is certainly a part of this action, \nbecause of the very nature of ISIS, the response must be principally \nmilitary.\n\n  All Americans are weary of the long and costly wars in the last \ndecade. We\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\nare tired of sending our sons and daughters potentially to die in \ndistant lands. No one wants to see an extended engagement in Iraq, but \nat the same time I do not believe the American people are one bit \nreluctant to defend our national security, to defend the lives of \nfellow Americans. The American people can see the grim threat \nrepresented by ISIS and the need for decisive action.\n  We should concentrate on a coordinated and overwhelming air campaign \nthat has the clear military objective of destroying the capability of \nISIS to carry out terror attacks on the United States. We must remain \nfocused on this clear military objective if we hope to be successful. \nWe cannot engage in photo op foreign policy or press release foreign \npolicy of dropping a bomb here, shooting a missile there, and not have \na strategy that is dictated by clear and direct military objectives in \nfurtherance of U.S. national security interests.\n  We should be perfectly clear as well that any action we take against \nISIS is in no way contingent on resolving the civil war in Syria. That \nconflict is a humanitarian tragedy, pitting a brutal dictator against \nradical Islamic terrorists. The sad reality is there are no good \noptions for the United States in this fight. We may have had less \nradical options 3 years ago, but those are not currently available.\n  The Obama administration had proposed arming rebel forces that \ncontained terrorist factions associated with ISIS. Previously, we were \ntold the rebels fighting alongside ISIS were our friends and Assad and \nIran were our enemies. Now, in the face of ISIS, we are hearing Assad \nmay be our friend, Iran may be our friend, and ISIS is now our enemy. \nThis makes no sense. Indeed, it is a dangerous cycle reminiscent of \nGeorge Orwell's ``1984.'' Orwell wrote:\n\n       At this moment, for example, in 1984. . . . Oceania was at \n     war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. . . . \n     Actually . . . it was only four years since Oceania had been \n     at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But . . . \n     [o]fficially the change of partners had never happened. \n     Oceania was at war with Eurasia; therefore Oceania had always \n     been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always \n     represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or \n     future agreement with him was impossible. . . .\n\n  This administration seems to have no sense of past or future. All of \nthose familiar with the terribly human carnage inflicted by the civil \nwar in Syria pray for its end. But the goal of our action against ISIS \nshould not be to end it by supporting Assad. The enemy of my enemy is \nnot always my friend. Sometimes the goal is the destruction of the \nenemy who poses an imminent threat to our national security, not the \nenabler of yet another enemy of America.\n  It should also be clear that any action we take against ISIS should \nin no way be contingent on political reconciliation between Sunnis and \nShiites in Baghdad. This administration has often become distracted by \nthe hope to achieve this reconciliation, but the sad truth is the \nSunnis and Shiites have been engaged in a sectarian civil war since 632 \nA.D. It is the height of hubris, it is the height of ignorance to \nsuggest the American President can come and resolve a 1,500-year-old \nreligious civil war and have both sides throw down their arms and \nembrace each other as brothers. That should not be our objective, \nalthough we of course always hope for reconciliation and peace. We \nshould not be so naive as to make defending our national security \ncontingent on resolving millennia-old sectarian religious civil wars. \nDoing so, seeking to promote a utopia, seeking to transform Iraq into \nSwitzerland is nothing less than a fool's errand.\n  Likewise, it should be perfectly clear that any action we take to \nstop ISIS from attacking and murdering Americans is in no way \ncontingent on consensus from the so-called international community. \nAmerica is blessed to have many good friends and allies in the region \nand beyond who understand the threat of ISIS and are eager to do what \nthey can to combat it. We welcome their support. But in order that this \naction be done right, it must be led by the United States, unfettered \nby other nations' rules of engagement that might impede our effective \naction.\n  Achieving some preordained number of countries in a coalition is not \na strategy. For as has often been remarked: In the most effective \nefforts, the mission determines the coalition, not the other way \naround. It is heartening to hear the voices from my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, raising the alarm of the threat posed by ISIS. \nPresident Obama has signaled his intention of addressing the issue \nlater this week.\n  It is well past time for him to do so. His recent statements from his \nadmission on August 28 that ``we don't have a strategy yet'' to his \nsuggestion on September 3 that ``our best bet is to try to `shrink' \nISIS's sphere of influence until they are a manageable problem,'' those \ncomments are not encouraging. The objective is not to make ISIS \nmanageable. The objective is to protect the national security interests \nof the United States and to destroy terrorists who have declared jihad \non our Nation.\n\n  Neither are the two things we already know that the President will \npropose in his new ``game plan''--namely, that he will not be \nrequesting authorization from Congress for military action against ISIS \nand that his model is the counterterrorism policies pursued by his \nadministration the past 5 years. Neither of these is encouraging. I ask \nthe President to reconsider both of these points.\n  While ISIS is obviously part of the scourge of radical Islamic \nterrorism that has bedeviled the West for decades, it equally obviously \nrepresents a new and particularly virulent strain. The President is \nreportedly considering an action that could last as long as 3 years and \nmay require a range of actions. If this is indeed the case, then it is \nincumbent on him to come to Congress and lay out his strategy so that \nwe and the American people are clear on it.\n  I would note that the Presiding Officer has been particularly vocal \nand clear defending the constitutional authority of Congress to declare \nwar. I would note as well that it is beneficial for the effort for the \nPresident to come to Congress, because in doing so it will force the \nPresident to do what has been lacking for so long, which is lay out a \nspecific and clear military objective: What is it we are trying to \naccomplish that is tethered directly to the U.S. national security \ninterests of America?\n  The Constitution is clear. It is Congress and Congress only that has \nthe constitutional authority to declare war. Any President, as \nCommander in Chief, has constitutional authority to respond to an \nimminent crisis, to respond to a clear and present danger. But in this \ninstance, the President is not suggesting it. He is suggesting engaged \nmilitary action, and it is, therefore, inconsistent with the \nConstitution for him to attempt to pursue that action without \nrecognizing the constitutional authority of this body.\n  It is my hope that he will do so, and it is my hope we will have a \nsubstantive and meaningful debate about the military objective we \nshould be united in achieving, which is, namely, destroying ISIS and \npreventing them from committing acts of terror and murdering innocent \nAmericans.\n  Given the need to consider such action against a new actor such as \nISIS, it also must be admitted that the Obama administration's \ncounterterrorism policy has not been a success. They have labeled the \n2009 attack on Fort Hood in my home State of Texas as an act of \n``workplace violence'' even though the terrorist attacker Nidal Hasan \nrecently asked to become a citizen of the Islamic State.\n  They also missed connecting the dots that would have uncovered the \nradicalization of the Tsarnaev brothers that resulted in the attack on \nthe Boston Marathon. It should be noted that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the \nelder brother, worshipped at the same Cambridge, MA, mosque where the \nISIS head of propaganda worshipped. This jihad can reach back and \ndirectly take the lives of Americans citizens at home.\n  The administration has failed to respond effectively to the attack on \nour facilities in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, in which four \nAmericans were murdered, including the first ambassador killed in the \nline of duty since 1979, an event that inaugurated Libya's spiral into \nterrorist anarchy that continues unchecked to this day. They completely \nmissed the gathering threat of ISIS to the point that the President \nhimself was under the misapprehension that the group was the terrorist \nequivalent of the junior varsity only a few months ago.\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\n  We cannot afford to return to these destructive policies, given the \nacute threat posed by ISIS. It is my hope that this body will stand \ntogether as one in bipartisan unity to secure the borders and to change \nour laws to pass the legislation I am introducing today to make clear \nthat any American who takes up arms with ISIS has, in doing so, \nconstructively renounced his or her American citizenship so that the \nCongress, with one voice, can protect Americans at home. This requires \nclear, decisive, unified action, and it is my hope that all of us will \ncome together supporting such action and that the President will submit \nto the authority of Congress seeking authorization to protect America \nagainst ISIS and to engage in a concentrated, directed military \ncampaign to take them out.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON:\n  S.J. Res. 42. A joint resolution to authorize the use of United \nStates Armed Forces against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I have introduced today a Senate joint \nresolution. This is a resolution that will express the authorization \nfor the use of the U.S. Armed Forces against the Islamic State in Iraq \nand the Levant. It is a resolution that has been necessitated by legal \nscholars.\n  Since the President has used his existing authorization for the use \nof military force in Iraq, most recently against ISIS--ISIL/ISIS; it is \nthe same thing. The Levant is that area broadly from about Baghdad all \nthe way to the Mediterranean. That is ISIL. ISIS, I-S-I-S, is the \nIslamic State in Iraq and Syria. Of course, we know that this \norganization that is calling itself an Islamic caliphate knows no \njurisdictional boundaries. It has taken large swaths of territory in \nSyria as well as Iraq. When the President successfully employed the use \nof air power, both manned and unmanned, against ISIS targets as they \nwere marching toward Erbil, the capital of Kurdistan, and then likewise \nas they were marching toward the Mosul dam, the President used his \nauthority in Iraq and also his authority as Commander in Chief to \nprotect Americans.\n  There are Americans in Erbil. There are Americans in Baghdad. There \nare Americans in other places in Iraq. The protection of the dam in \nMosul was to protect those Americans downriver, because if the dam were \nblown, that would have flooded all downriver and it would have flooded \nBaghdad.\n  Legal scholars disagree with me that the President has the authority \nunder the Constitution as Commander in Chief to go after ISIS in Syria. \nI describe ISIS as a snake. If the head of the snake is in Syria, which \nit is--a lot of their organization, a lot of their leadership is \nthere--then we ought to go after the snake where the head is and \ndecapitate the snake. In doing that, we are going to have to go into \nSyria.\n  I believe the President has the authority to do this under the \nConstitution anyway, but there are some who disagree. So rather than \nquibble about legalities, I have introduced this legislation. There is \nno pride of authorship. The Senate is obviously going to debate this. I \nbelieve if you are seeing the polls from today, where 90 percent of the \npeople of this country are concerned about ISIS, and some huge number \nwant us to go on and attack ISIS in other places than where we are \nattacking now, then I think it is obvious the United States is going to \nhave to continue this attack on ISIS.\n  I want to compliment the President. Often, as I have talked about \nthis issue, people have come--or members of the press--and said: Well, \nthe President has dillydallied and so forth. I do not think he has at \nall. I think the President indeed has employed a very successful \nstrategy of going after ISIS in Iraq--in fact, stopped their march on \nErbil, in fact, stopped their march on the Mosul dam, and is going \nafter them in other locations in coordination with the Peshmerga of the \nKurds, as well as the Iraqi Army.\n  Indeed, the President started on August 25 the surveillance flights \nover Syria so that we can collect the intelligence that is necessary to \nprepare to go after them in Syria. But the President has done something \nmore. He has started to put together a coalition, realizing that the \nAmerican people have no appetite for American boots on the ground in \nSyria--to put together a coalition so that maybe the Free Syrian Army, \nmaybe other members of the Arab League, maybe some other members of \nNATO would participate.\n  But the way we drew this resolution, it talks about there would not \nbe a recurring military presence and the employing of an American army \non the ground. It leaves the flexibility that clearly there will be \nAmerican boots on the ground, just as there already have been when we \nsent our special operations forces in there to try to rescue the two \nAmerican journalists who subsequently met such a brutal and uncivil end \nin their beheading. So American boots have been there. We might need \nspecial operations kinds of missions in the future. We might need \nforward air observers actually on the ground to direct air strikes. So \nthere is flexibility in this resolution.\n  I want to say if there is anybody with any doubt about the intent of \nISIS, they have made it so clear, not only taking the lives of these \njournalists, the second one of which was from my State of Florida, but \nin their statements of what they intend to do, setting up an Islamic \ncaliphate. The leader, al-Baghdadi, even calls himself the caliph or \nreligious leader.\n  But they have also said they will not stop until the black flag of \nISIS is hanging and flying over the White House. Their intent is pretty \nclear. We are going to have to deal with them, not only in Iraq as we \nare now, but elsewhere. It is going to be sooner or later. It is not \ngoing to be a 1-day or 2-day operation. As the President has already \nindicated, this is going to be a long-term kind of operation. The fact \nis, the United States is the one that has to lead the coalition.\n  To get this right out front and center of what we need to do, I have \nintroduced, and it is printed as a part of the Record, this resolution \nto give the legal authorization from the Congress for the President to \nstrike ISIS in Syria and to do as the President has said, to bring to a \nsuccessful conclusion, to stop this horrendous uncivil, extraordinary \nkind of inhumane behavior that is being illustrated by these folks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S.J. Res. 43. A joint resolution to authorize the use of force \nagainst the organization called the Islamic State in order to defend \nthe American people and assist the Iraqi Government in expelling the \nIslamic State from their territory; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when you look at what is happening with \nISIS, we have gone through all kinds of terrorist activities. We all \nknow we are in a crisis right now. I am inclined to agree--and I don't \nalways agree--with Secretary Hagel, but on the day when he said that \n``ISIS is an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it is \nin Iraq or anywhere else,'' this is a big deal.\n  As America sat back and looked and observed and saw the beheading of \ntwo Americans, a lot of people said that was an act of war. I found out \nrecently that as of yesterday--and it will be announced in the next few \ndays that there is a poll that has been conducted, that if we take all \nthe problems that are out there that people have been talking about for \na long period of time, including the borders and all the other issues, \nnothing is even close to ISIS.\n  I think it was very interesting that on August 28, just a few days \nago, the President made the statement, ``We don't have a strategy yet'' \nto deal with ISIS in Syria. If there is not a strategy now, there has \nto be a strategy.\n  I am introducing an AUMF resolution for action against ISIS. An AUMF \nis Authorization for Use of Military Force. This is something that \nperhaps the President has anyway--we don't know that--but we have to \ntake away the doubt that is out there. Something has to be done. I know \nthe President is going to make a speech--I guess it is on Wednesday--\nand he may come out with a specific strategy. If he doesn't, he has had \nall the time in the world he needs to do it, and he hasn't done it. My \nAUMF is specific to ISIS. There are other AUMF's dealing with Al Qaeda \nand other things, but to me that just confuses the issue. This has now \nbecome the No. 1 issue in America, and\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\nthere is no tolerance to continue doing nothing, as we have been doing. \nWe need to make sure the President has the authority, and this requires \nthe President, within 15 days and then with 90-day updates, to submit \nin writing to Congress a comprehensive strategy to defeat the global \nthreat posed by ISIS.\n  Keep in mind, it seems as if this President is inclined, anytime \nthere is a problem out there, let's drop a bomb here and let's do \nsomething over there. That is not a strategy. I stated 1 year ago, on \nthis same day, that the President cannot continue to operate without a \nclear-cut strategy.\n  So the congressional authorization for the President is to use all \nnecessary and appropriate force to protect Americans in defending \nnational security in the United States against a threat posed by ISIS \nand any successor terrorist organization. It allows the President to \nuse all tools available and necessary to defeat ISIS, with flexibility \nto adjust efforts as the terrorist organization evolves. So this is not \njust limited to any boundaries. As you know, there are no boundaries \nwith ISIS. It is not just Syria, it is not just Iraq. This is something \nthat is spread all over. It is huge, and it is a threat unlike anything \nwe have seen in our country before.\n  So I am asking my good friends--I have already talked to several \nfriends on the Democratic side and the Republican side--to join me, and \nI think hopefully we will be able to do it.\n  It is estimated that 12,000 foreign fighters have joined ISIS, about \n2,500 of which hold Western passports to give them easy access. What is \ngoing to happen is they will come back and be trained terrorists. I \nthink that is a major issue that I want to at least have announced.\n  I have introduced this resolution. It is out there right now and we \nare going to be asking for support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/08/senate-section/article/S5379-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3783.
