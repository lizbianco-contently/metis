Mr. President, all over America today there are newspaper \narticles of hope--for example, in the Washington Post today, ``Veterans \nAffairs bills progressing quickly in Congress.'' It quotes me as saying \nit is something that needs to be done. ``It's urgent that we get this \ndone to resolve some of the outstanding issues within the VA.''\n  My friend the Republican leader, the senior Senator from Kentucky, \n``predicted that GOP senators will overwhelmingly support the bill.''\n  This is what the article says about Mr. Miller from Florida, the \nHouse chairman:\n\n       Miller signaled support for the Sanders-McCain bill, noting \n     that it largely mirrors a series of similar stand-alone \n     proposals the House approved in recent months.\n\n  Each side has run what are called hotlines--meaning permission from \nSenators to move forward on this legislation--and we have been able to \ndo that. It was my understanding late last evening that the junior \nSenator from Oklahoma has an amendment he feels should be offered. \nFine. Let's bring that up, vote on it, and move on.\n  This is a bill that needs to get done. Not only are the veterans \nelated to hear language like what I have just read but also people all \nover America because we support the veterans community.\n  We have issues that are so deep and complex that we need to get to. \nWill this solve all the issues? Of course not. But because of the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, we have 2 million new veterans who have a \nmultitude of problems we have never had in other wars. So I certainly \nhope we can quickly arrange an opportunity to move forward on this \nlegislation. I stand ready to work with my Democratic allies here and \nthose in the minority to do everything we can to move forward on this \nlegislation as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3553-8", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, will control 15 minutes, and the \nremaining time until 10 a.m. will be equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Who yields time? If no one yields time, then the time will be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, could the Chair please let me know when \nI have 3 minutes remaining on my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I heard the majority leader's comments \nabout the importance of moving on to the veterans bill, so I have a \nsuggestion: Why don't we send this political stunt on student loans to \nthe Senate education committee, where the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, and I are busy working in a bipartisan way to reauthorize \nhigher education, and let's move on to the veterans bill immediately. \nWhy should the Senate take a week on a political stunt that everybody \nhere knows won't pass when veterans are standing in line at clinics, \nwaiting for us to act on a bipartisan solution to their problems?\n  It actually goes further in giving veterans more choices in health \ncare than anything Congress has ever done. It actually begins to give \nveterans more choice in health care in the same way Congress gave them \nchoices in higher education with the passage of the GI bill for \nveterans in 1944. Back then, Congress said to the veterans: Here is the \nmoney. Go choose your college.\n  Moving to and passing the veterans bill, Congress would be saying: If \nyou have to stand in line too long or if you live too far away from a \nveterans facility, here is the money--go choose your medical care.\n  That is a very important step for millions of veterans. It deals \ndirectly with the problems all Senators on both sides of the aisle are \nchagrined about--veterans standing in line waiting for health care.\n  So I have one question: Why should the Senate spend a week on a \npolitical stunt? Why should we go all the way to next Monday before \ndisposing of it? Let's dispose of it today. Let's send it to the \ncommittee that is already considering these issues, and let's move on \nto the veterans bill before noon. We could do that, and the veterans \nand the people of this country would respect us for it.\n  I thought we had stopped the political stunts on student loans last \nyear when the President, to his credit, worked with the Republican \nHouse and a bipartisan group in the Senate, and came to a result--a big \nresult. It affects $100 billion of loans every year.\n  Half the students in America have a grant or loan to help pay for \ncollege. Congress stopped this type of political stunt last year. \nInstead of every election year where someone comes forward offering \nsome preposterous proposal about what we can do in the hope that \nstudents might vote for them--Congress stopped that by saying: Let's \nput a market-based pricing system on new student loans. The effect of \nthat was to stop semi-annual political stunts, while lowering the \ninterest rate on loans for undergraduates nearly in half. Undergraduate \nstudents are 85 percent of the students receiving federal loans. So a \n19-year-old student can get a loan to go to college at 3.86 percent \nwithout any credit rating and in some cases can get a grant of up to \n$5,645 to go to college. Congress did that last year.\n  This year the Senate education committee has held 10 bipartisan \nhearings on higher education. This is a committee that knows how to \nwork. Senator Harkin, the Senator from Iowa, and I have big ideological \ndifferences in our committee, but that doesn't stop us from working, \nfrom doing our job. We passed 19 bills out of our committee, and 10 of \nthem have gone through the Senate and became law. No other committee in \nthe Senate can say that. Right now we are working on this very subject \nof the political stunt.\n  So why not stop the political stunt and put this where it belongs--\nback in the committee that is already working on it in a bipartisan \nway. Let's focus on the veterans who are standing in line and do what \nthe majority leader said, which is let's deal with that issue.\n  Why do I say this student loan idea is not a serious proposal? It is \nnot out of lack of respect to the sponsor. Of course I have great \nrespect for her and for other Senators who are offering this proposal. \nBut let me outline why I say this is not a serious proposal. And \neverybody in the Senate knows that. They know it is not going to pass. \nSo why would the Senate waste time on it?\n  No. 1, it does nothing--not one thing--for current or future \nstudents. For students who are in college today or will be tomorrow, \nthis does nothing for them. So don't let the rhetoric fool you.\n  No. 2, what does it do for people who used to be in college paying \noff a student loan? According to data supplied by the Congressional \nResearch Service: It will give them $1 a day. For the typical former \nstudent who has old loans, this bill will give them a taxpayer subsidy \nof $1 a day to help pay their student loans.\n  How big is that loan? For undergraduates--which are 85 percent of all \nstudents with loans--it is $21,600. For graduates with a 4-year degree, \nit is $27,000. So $27,000--probably the best investment a person will \never make. The College Board says that if you have a 4-year degree, \nyour lifetime earnings will be $1 million more. So $27,000 for a \nstudent with no credit rating and has a right to borrow that earns you \n$1 million? I think that is a pretty good deal. In fact, this $27,000, \nis about the exact amount of the average car loan.\n  So what are we going to do next week? Instead of dealing with lines \nof veterans at clinics, is somebody going to come on the floor and say: \nWell, people have a $27,000 car loan, so let's raise taxes and raise \nthe debt and give them $1 a day to pay off their car loan or the \nmortgage loan or the credit card.\n  This is not a serious proposal. It is not going to help \npeople. College graduates don't need a dollar-a-day tax subsidy to pay \noff their loan. They need a job. They need a job, and right now they \nare experiencing the worst situation for finding a job that they have \nseen in a long time.\n\n  Now Republicans have plans that would help create more jobs. We would \nlike to do what the President said, which was give the President more \ntrade authority so companies in the nation can sell more things in \nEurope and Asia, but, no, we cannot bring that up. We would like to \napprove the Keystone Pipeline, but, no, we cannot bring that up. We \nwould like to repeal ObamaCare and particularly the parts that make it \nharder to create jobs, but, no, we don't want to talk about that. We \nwould like to at least change the provision about part-time jobs from \n30 to 40 hours which affects millions of American workers, but, no, we \ncannot bring that up either.\n  If the Senate wants to talk about students paying back loans, they \ndon't need a dollar a day, they need a job. But my point is why should \nthe Senate waste a week on this bill when veterans are standing in line \nwaiting for us to take up and deal with a bipartisan proposal that the \nmajority leader just described? What else is wrong with this student \nloan proposal? It could add up to $420 billion to the Federal debt. It \ndoes bring the money with it to eventually pay it off, we hope, but it \nadds to the debt. The Congressional Budget Office says national debt is \nrising at such a rate that interest payments will go from around $200 \nbillion up to around $800 billion in 10 years. Taxpayers will be \nspending more on interest in 10 years than on national defense. It \nincreases individual income taxes $72 billion with what I call a class \nwarfare tax. That tax has been rejected eight times by the United \nStates Senate, seven times on a motion to proceed.\n  There already is a way to lower your payments if you are a student \nwith a loan and your monthly payments are too high. It is in the law. \nThe President talked about it this week. It is called the income based \nrepayment plan. It could lower monthly payments $60 more a month than \nthe Democrat proposal if you are a typical undergraduate and $300 more \na month if you are a typical graduate student. Former students can do \nthat today. That is a bigger savings on monthly payments than in the \nproposal we are debating.\n  In addition to that, if this proposal were to pass the Senate. It \ncould not be\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\nsent to the House. It is unconstitutional. We cannot originate a tax in \nthe Senate, according to the Constitution. So why would the Senate pass \nthis if it cannot be sent to the House? Next, it violates the Budget \nControl Act. We passed a law that said we couldn't spend any more than \nX. This measure violates that act.\n  So if it gives a dollar a day to pay off a $27,000 loan at a time \nwhen a college degree will earn people more than $1 million, if the \nloans for undergraduates are about the same as a car loan, if it raises \nthe debt by $420 billion, if it raises taxes by $72 billion, if there \nalready is a way in the law to lower monthly payments more than this \nproposal without raising taxes, without raising the debt, without \npassing the law that is unconstitutional--so even if it did pass, it \ncannot be sent to the House--if it violates the Budget Control Act, why \nwould the Senate waste time on it when veterans are standing in line \nwaiting for a bipartisan proposal to give them more choices for medical \ncare? Why would we do that?\n  Right behind the veterans bill are Senator Mikulski from Maryland and \nSenator Shelby from Alabama with a series of appropriations bills that \nhave bipartisan support. They have been through committee too. We \nhaven't passed appropriations bills in the last 4 years--two of those \nyears we passed zero, one of those years we passed one. They are ready \nto do the job on both sides of the aisle.\n  Why would we spend time on this if it doesn't deal with the real \nissue? Students with loans don't need a dollar a day to pay off the \nloan. They need a job. We have proposals for jobs. The real problems \nwith student loans are complexities and overborrowing. Ninety percent \nof the loans we read about in the paper that are over $100,000 are \nloans held by graduate students. But these are only 2 percent of the \nloans for all students.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. May I inform the Senator from \nTennessee he has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I will reserve 1 minute and I will \ndo it in this way:\n  Vote no. A ``no'' vote means no to a week-long political stunt, no to \ndebt and taxes, and yes to moving today to a bipartisan solution to the \nproblem of veterans standing in line at clinics; yes to appropriations \nbills that deal with cancer research and national defense and the other \nurgent needs of our country, also in a bipartisan way; yes to the way \nthe Senate ought to run. It would mean no to the practice of pulling a \nbill out of your pocket, putting it on the floor, and wasting 1 week \nwith a political stunt while veterans are standing in line at a clinic \nwaiting for us to act.\n  So I would suggest the right thing to do is to vote no, send the bill \nand the discussion about student loans to the education committee. We \ncan work with the President on a solution just like last year, and \nlet's move on to dealing with a bipartisan solution to veterans who are \nstanding in line waiting for the Senate to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The senior Senator from Tennessee has summed it up \nquite accurately. I have been calling on the majority leader to press \npause on his party's nonstop campaign so we can take up bipartisan \nlegislation for a change, because there is a real crisis in the \ncountry. It is a scandal that demands the Senate's full attention.\n  According to the Obama administration's own internal audit, its \nveterans scandal has now spread to more than three-quarters--three-\nquarters--of the VA facilities that were surveyed. Nearly 100,000 \nveterans continue to wait for care at VA centers and many of our \nveterans have been forced to wait 3 months or longer. Eighteen veterans \nhave already died in Phoenix alone waiting for care that never came. \nThis is a national disgrace.\n  The President needs to nominate a capable leader and manager who \npossesses the skills, leadership ability, and determination to correct \nthe failings of the VA, support thousands of VA workers who are \ncommitted to serving our veterans, and provide all of those who have \nserved bravely with the timely care they have earned. He also needs to \nuse the tools he already has to address the systemic failures of \nmanagement in his administration, and he needs to use the new tools we \ncan provide him with the legislation as well. We in this body have a \nresponsibility to act and to do so with a sense of urgency.\n\n  Yesterday the House passed bipartisan legislation unanimously--\nunanimously--to help deal with this crisis. It is similar to the \nbipartisan Sanders-McCain bill right here in the Senate. It would \nincrease patient choice, it would introduce some much needed \naccountability into the VA system, and it is past time to take up that \nkind of legislation in the Senate. Veterans have been made to wait long \nenough. Senate Democrats shouldn't be keeping them in the waiting room \neven longer.\n  I know the majority leader and his Democratic colleagues would rather \nstick to their campaign playbook. We know they would rather talk about \na bill they claim is about student loans, but the Senate Democrats' \nbill isn't about students at all. It is all about Senate Democrats \nbecause Senate Democrats don't actually want a solution for their \nstudents, they want an issue to campaign on to save their own hides \nthis November.\n  Recall that around this same time last year Republicans had to swoop \nin with a bipartisan piece of legislation to save students from a rate \nincrease after Senate Democrats blew past the deadline, and Senator \nAlexander was right in the middle of that incredible and effective \nsolution. Now Senate Democrats are pushing yet another--yet another--\nstudent loan bill, one they actually hope will fail.\n  I think Senate Democrats are in for a surprise. Americans are not \ngoing to fall for this spin because students can understand this bill \nwill not make college more affordable, they understand it will not \nreduce the amount of money they have to borrow, and students know it \nwill not do a thing--not a thing--to fix the economy that is depriving \nso many young Americans of the jobs they seek.\n  Of course Senate Democrats understand all of these things too. Here \nis what the majority leader's lieutenant, the senior Senator from New \nYork, said when he was asked a couple of years ago about student loans. \nHe said that if Democrats had wanted to be ``political about this'' \nissue, they ``would have paid for it with'' the very same gimmick being \nused to pay for the bill before us today.\n  I give the Senator from New York points for honesty. His words show \nwithout equivocation that Senate Democrats are now playing politics \nwith the futures of young Americans instead of doing something about \nthe VA crisis.\n  So let's just accept the Senator's admission that his party's bill is \ntruly about helping Democrats, not students, and let's move on to \nfixing the VA scandal instead. The time is now to turn away from \ndesigned-to-fail politicking and toward actual bipartisan solutions. \nOur constituents demand it and our veterans deserve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you very much. We can do both the Sanders-McCain \nbill, the veterans bill, and we can do this, and there is a need for \nthis.\n  I was proud to join Senator Warren of Massachusetts in presenting the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. I come from a State \nwhere we have the distinction of being fourth in the Nation in terms of \nlevel of debt that our students have when they graduate from college, \nover $30,000. Then we see people who come to graduate school with a lot \nmore.\n  I do college roundtables all the time. Kids are working 20, 30, 40 \nhours a week while going to school. I have kids telling me they are \ngiving blood while they are in school. We need to address this. This is \nonly a part of what we need to do when talking about the costs of \ncollege, but why is it possible to refinance a home loan in this \ncountry, people are able to refinance their car loans, they are able to \nrefinance a business loan, but they cannot refinance their student \ndebt? That makes no sense.\n  This has become a macroeconomic issue. Economists agree that because \nof the level of student debt--and if someone is paying 10 percent \ninterest on it, it makes a huge difference--they are\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\nnot able to save enough to put a downpayment on a house or they are not \nable to buy a car, they are not able to move out of their parents' \nhouse. This would help 550,000 Minnesotans--550,000 Minnesotans. That \nis 1 out of every 10 Minnesotans.\n  What pays for it is saying that people who make over $1 million a \nyear would pay in income taxes what people making $60,000 a year pay. \nThis is about fairness. We all know that in the last number of decades, \nand especially in the last number of years, virtually all new income \nhas flowed to those at the top. The top 40 hedge fund managers make as \nmuch as 300,000 teachers. Why shouldn't they pay 30 percent on their \nincome? Why not benefit the millions of Americans who have student debt \nand let them refinance their debt as we can with home loans, car loans, \nbusiness loans?\n  It just seems that this is a matter of fairness, and it is smart \neconomics because economists agree that the $1.2 trillion in student \ndebt has hurt this economy. It seems to make common sense.\n  This is not political. It is not political if the other side votes \nfor it. If the other side votes for it, then we can help millions and \nmillions of Americans refinance debt just like other Americans can \nrefinance their credit card debt or home debt. This makes too much \nsense, and it should not be political. It should be bipartisan.\n  We should get to this, and then move on to the Sanders-McCain bill, \nwhich I cosponsored. I want to get on that. I want to be able to get on \na lot of legislation. In this Congress we have sometimes seen--and in \nthe last several Congresses--the minority do what it can to slow down \nthe process and gum up the works here. I would love to get to the \nveterans bill immediately after passing this.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which is \ncurrently pending before the Senate. This legislation would reduce \nstudent loan debt for millions of Americans and provide relief for \nthose who are struggling to keep up with their payments.\n  Student loan debt is exploding, and it threatens the stability of our \nyoung people and the future of our economy. The debt now totals $1.2 \ntrillion and it is growing bigger every single day. In 8 years the \naverage student loan balance increased by 70 percent, and now 7 out of \nevery 10 college seniors are dealing with student loan debt.\n  This debt is crushing our young people and dragging down our economy \nby keeping borrowers from being able to buy homes, cars, and open small \nbusinesses. It is keeping them from making the purchases that get their \neconomic lives started and help our economy grow.\n  We must act now to provide relief for existing borrowers, and the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act will do exactly that. \nThe legislation is straightforward. It allows existing borrowers to \nreduce their debt by refinancing their high-interest loans to much \nlower--and much more manageable--levels.\n  Depending on when they took out their student loans, millions of \nAmericans are stuck in loans at 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, and \neven higher. While interest rates are low, we propose to refinance \nthose loans so that the old debt is at the same rates currently being \noffered to new student loan borrowers. These new rates are exactly the \nsame rates that nearly every Republican in the House and Senate voted \nfor just last summer as the fair rate for new student loans issued in \n2013 through 2014--3.6 percent for undergraduate loans and a little \nhigher for graduate and parent loans. These new rates are still higher \nthan what it costs the government to run its student loan program. But \nif these lower rates are good enough for new borrowers, they should be \ngood enough for older borrowers too.\n  Later today Senators will have a choice. They can move forward and \ndebate this bill or they can filibuster it and prevent any \nconsideration of this refinancing plan. Some Republicans have pointed \nout that the legislation doesn't solve every problem that we have in \nhigher education. Well, that is true; refinancing will not fix \neverything that is broken in our higher education system.\n  We need to bring down the cost of college, and we need more \naccountability for how schools spend their Federal dollars. Senator \nReid, Senator Durbin, and I have a bill to do just that, and we welcome \nour Republican friends to join us on that bill. But we have another \nproblem right now--student loan debt. Refinancing that debt is a \nstraightforward way to ease that problem right now. We should do it \nright now. If Senators want to do more, they should offer amendments to \nthat bill, but they should not block it from being considered.\n  Some Republicans have expressed concern about the effect of student \nloan refinancing on the deficit. In fact, the bill is fully paid for \nand--according to official estimates from the Congressional Budget \nOffice--it actually reduces the deficit, and that is because it is \nfunded by stitching up the loophole in our Tax Code that allows some \nmillionaires to pay lower tax rates than middle-class families. \nInvesting in students and asking billionaires to pay their taxes seems \npretty fair to me. If Senators want to pay for this in a different way, \nthey should offer amendments to this bill, but they should not block it \nfrom being considered.\n  Finally, some have argued that the financial benefit for our young \npeople here is small. If Republicans would like to lower the interest \nrates even more, then count me in. That is what I would like to do. But \nlet's be clear: 40 million borrowers in this country have student loan \ndebt--40 million--and many of those individuals could save hundreds or \neven thousands of dollars a year under this proposal. That is real \nmoney back in the pockets of people who invested in their education. If \nSenators want to change those rates, they should offer amendments to \nthe bill, but they should not block it from being considered.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. Locking old borrowers into high \ninterest rates just doesn't make any sense. The Federal Government \nshould offer refinancing just like any other lender.\n  This is not only about economics, it is also about our values. These \nyoung people saddled with student loan debt didn't go to the mall and \nrun up charges on a credit card. They worked hard and learned new \nskills that will benefit this country and help us build a stronger \nAmerica. They deserve a fair shot at an affordable education.\n  Unfortunately, people struggling with student loans don't have the \nmoney to hire armies of lobbyists to argue their case on Capitol Hill, \nthey don't have a super PAC, and they can't fund super secret political \nmachines. But they have their voices, and they are making themselves \nheard. Over 700,000 people have signed petitions urging Congress to \nrefinance student loans. Dozens of organizations have endorsed the \nbill--including student groups, colleges, and mortgage bankers.\n  Senators have a choice to make today. They can move forward and \ndebate this bill, they can acknowledge that the debt is crushing our \nfamilies and do what we were sent here to do--address an economic \nemergency that threatens the financial futures of Americans and the \nstability of our economy--or they can block this bill from being \nconsidered. They can refuse even to debate this idea in order to \nprotect tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires. That is it--\nbillionaires or students, people who have already made it big or people \nwho are working to build their futures.\n  With this vote, we show the American people whom we work for in the \nSenate--billionaires or students. A vote on this legislation is a vote \nto give millions of young people a fair shot at building their future. \nForty million students and their families are counting on us.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The question before the Senate is, Shall we spend the \nnext week on a political stunt that gives some students $1 a day to pay \noff a student loan or shall we move to a bipartisan solution for \nveterans who are lined up at clinics and hospitals across the country \nin a way that shocks Senators on both sides of the aisle? That is the \nissue.\n  The proposal before the Senate is not a serious proposal. There is \nnothing in it for current or future students. It is a $1 a day subsidy \nto pay off a $27,000 loan. What are we going to do next week--raise \ntaxes and raise the debt to pay off a $27,000 car loan, which is \nsimilar to the average loan debt of a graduate with a 4-year degree?\n  In addition, this could not even be sent to the House if it passed \nbecause it is unconstitutional. You can't start a tax in the Senate, \nand this has a big tax in it.\n  The way we deal with these issues is the way we did it last year. We \nworked with the President in a bipartisan way and reduced rates for \nstudents.\n  What we need to do today is vote no--no to the political stunt, and \nmove immediately to the deal to help veterans standing in line at \nclinics and hospitals across the country.\n  I urge the Senate to send this to the committee that is already \nworking on it in a bipartisan way, and let's move to help the veterans \nin a bipartisan way.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This is a man \nwho always stood for peace, a man who has been so futuristic about what \nshould be done in that part of the world. I look forward to this \nceremony that will take place. He is now 90 years old.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk \nabout some of the side effects we have been seeing from the health care \nlaw.\n  When President Obama and Democrats in Congress were selling their \nhealth care law, they made a lot of promises. One of the big ones was \nthat the health care law would save money. They said it was going to \nsave money because people would be going to see physicians in offices \nfor routine care instead of going to the emergency room.\n  President Obama said:\n\n       If everybody's got coverage, then they're not going to the \n     emergency room for treatment.\n\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\n\n  Well, just like promises about keeping your doctor if you like your \ndoctor or keeping your insurance if you like your insurance--promises \nthe President made--it turns out the President's claims about emergency \nroom care weren't true either. That is what the Louisville Courier \nJournal says they have seen in the State of Kentucky. This was the \nheadline on Monday, just a couple days ago: ``More patients flocking to \nERs under ObamaCare.'' That is not what the President said, but that \nwas the headline.\n  The article says:\n\n       It wasn't supposed to work this way, but since the \n     Affordable Care Act took effect in January, Norton Hospital \n     has seen its packed emergency room become even more crowded, \n     with about 100 more patients a month.\n\n  That is a 12-percent spike in the number of patients at the emergency \nroom of that hospital in Louisville. As the article said, it wasn't \nsupposed to happen that way, and that is why I come to the floor to \ntalk about the side effects of the President's health care law.\n  There are many side effects. They are harmful. They are expensive. \nSome are irreversible. But they are all related to promises made to the \nAmerican people by a President who I don't believe fully understands \nhis law. And I know there are many people in this body who voted for it \nwho, I understand, never read it in the first place. Those are the \nconcerns I have. Those are the concerns I hear at home in Wyoming every \nweek, and I heard them this past weekend all around the Cowboy State.\n  For the President, this emergency room situation may be just another \nsurprising side effect of the health care law. And they are not seeing \nthis just in Kentucky. According to a survey by the American College of \nEmergency Physicians, it is happening all across the country. Their \nsurvey found that 58 percent of emergency room doctors say they are \nseeing more patients since the beginning of the year. A doctor in \nVirginia told the Wall Street Journal that the health care law ``is \ngoing to stretch emergency doctors further, and that has implications \non how quickly we can get people through.'' When the emergency rooms \nhave more patients, it involves longer wait times for those patients.\n  It seems the Democrats who voted for this health care law--many \nwithout reading it--were so focused on getting people insurance \ncoverage that they came up with a system that actually makes it harder \nfor people to get care. It was interesting listening to the President \ncontinuing to give speeches about coverage and ignoring the fact that \npeople were worried about actually getting health care.\n  That is a very dangerous side effect, but it is not the only side \neffect of the law. There are also incredibly expensive side effects of \nthe health care law.\n  There is an expensive side effect that a lot of people are starting \nto hear more about as States release information on insurance premiums \nfor next year.\n  Late last Friday the State of Maryland released their rates. We could \ntell it was going to be bad news for people in Maryland because they \nsnuck the numbers out late Friday afternoon. It seems that is what \nhappens when bad news comes out--they get it out late Friday afternoon. \nAccording to the Washington Post, the biggest insurance company in \nMaryland is CareFirst. This was in the Washington Post Metro section on \nSaturday, June 7: ``CareFirst seeks hefty premium increases.''\n  The article says:\n\n       Maryland's dominant insurance company, CareFirst, is \n     proposing hefty premium increases of 23 to 30 percent for \n     consumers buying individual plans next year under the federal \n     health care law.\n\n  The President of the United States said the health care law was going \nto save families $2,500 a year by the end of his first term. But what \nwe are seeing here--Metro section, Washington Post, Saturday: \n``CareFirst seeks hefty premium increases.''\n\n       Maryland's dominant insurance company, CareFirst, is \n     proposing hefty premium increases of 23 to 30 percent for \n     consumers buying individual plans next year under the federal \n     health care law.\n\n  That is a very costly side effect of the health care law.\n  Remember, the health exchange--where people are supposed to buy this \ninsurance in Maryland--was so broken that they had to start over again. \nState officials spent $118 million to set up their own exchange. Now \nthey are going to use software from Connecticut's exchange. Nobody got \ncare for that money. That is wasted taxpayer dollars. Nobody got care.\n  Connecticut may have gotten the software right, but people there are \ngoing to have to pay more for insurance too. The Washington Post says \nthat two insurance carriers in Connecticut have proposed rate increases \naveraging about 12 percent. That is the average. Some people will have \nsmaller increases, but many people will pay much more.\n  President Obama said Democrats in Congress should forcefully defend \nthe law and be proud of it. That is what he said they should do--\nforcefully defend and be proud. Are there any Democrats who are ready \nto come down to the floor and forcefully defend these dangerous side \neffects of more people going to the emergency room, stretching \noverworked emergency room doctors even thinner, making for longer wait \ntimes in emergency rooms? Are Democrats going to come to the floor and \nforcefully defend and be proud of the law when they see expensive side \neffects such as the hefty premium increases in Maryland of 23 to 30 \npercent, 12 percent in Connecticut?\n\n  It didn't have to be this way. Republicans offered ways to reform \nAmerica's health care system back when we were debating the law, but \nPresident Obama and Democrats in Congress didn't want to hear it. We \nwarned about some of these brutal side effects of the health care law \nthat were going to hurt people, and we talked about bipartisan ideas \nthat could have helped to maintain the access people had for the doctor \nthey liked. That is what people want. They want the doctor they liked, \nand at the same time they want care to be more affordable. They want \naccess to care, quality care, affordable care, not empty coverage, \nexpensive coverage, which is what the President has provided.\n  We are going to keep talking about measures that would expand access \nto health savings accounts to save money for families as well as for \nemployers. I talked about that when some of us met with the President \nin 2010. The President didn't want to listen. It is too bad, but it is \nnot too late.\n  The Republicans are going to keep talking about letting consumers buy \nhealth insurance across State lines to increase competition, to let \nthem shop for options they actually need, want, and will work for their \nfamily. That could actually help bring down prices, not drive them up \nas the Democrats' health care laws do. These are ideas Republicans have \noffered from the beginning, ways to give the American people care they \nneed, from a doctor they choose, at lower costs. That is all people \nwanted in the beginning. Instead they got these harmful, hurtful, \nexpensive side effects.\n  We know what the American people have asked for. We know what they \nwanted, and that is what Republicans are going to continue to try to \ngive them, not the empty promises from President Obama and Democrats \nwho told the American people that the President and Democrats knew \nbetter what they needed or wanted than what the American people knew \nworked best for them and their families.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I wish to say a few words as to where we are right \nnow and my strong hope that we can move forward as rapidly as we can--\nhopefully today--in addressing some of the very serious problems that \nexist within the Veterans' Administration.\n  What I have learned since I have been chair of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee for the last year and a half is that the cost of war does not \nend when the last shots are fired and the last missiles are launched. \nThe cost of war continues until the last veteran receives the care and \nthe benefits he or she is entitled to and has earned on the \nbattlefield. The cost of war is in fact extremely expensive in terms of \nhuman life and financially. That is something every American should \nknow.\n  It is very easy to vote to send people to war, but we have to \nunderstand what the costs of those wars are in terms of\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nwhat happens to people who come home from them and in some cases do not \ncome home. The cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is almost 7,000 \ndead. The cost of war from Iraq and Afghanistan alone is some 200,000 \nmen and women coming home with post-traumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injury. The cost of war is too many young men and women \ncoming home without their legs or their arms or their hearing or their \neyesight. The cost of war is manifested by tragic suicides that are \ntaking place all across this country. The cost of war is veterans \ncoming home and finding it difficult to get reintegrated into their \ncommunities and get jobs and get their feet on the ground financially. \nThe cost of war is high divorce rates and the impact that has on \nchildren. The cost of war is widows suddenly having to begin their \nlives anew. Those are some of the real costs of war.\n  Last week Senator McCain and I hammered together a proposal to deal \nwith the immediate crisis facing the VA. I thank him very much for \ncoming forward, for working with me, and for understanding the need for \nus to move forward expeditiously. There are serious problems at the VA \nnow and they must be addressed now--not next week, not next month but \nnow.\n  I thank the 27 bipartisan cosponsors who have agreed to sign on to \nthis bill. There are 21 Democrats and 6 Republicans, and I think in \nfact the support is broader than that. I thank Senators Begich, \nBlumenthal, Booker, Burr, Casey, Collins, Coons, Hagan, Hirono, \nIsakson, Johanns, Kaine, Manchin, McCain, Merkley, Murphy, Pryor, \nRubio, Schatz, Udall, Walsh, and Whitehouse for cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Clearly, the bill Senator McCain and I introduced, which now has 27 \ncosponsors from both parties, is not the bill he would have written \nalone, and it certainly is not the bill I would have written alone. It \nis a compromise. What this bill does is address the immediate crisis \nfacing the VA of veterans having to wait too long a period of time--\nlong waiting lists--in order to get the quality care they need in a \ntimely manner.\n  What our veterans deserve is to be able to get into the system in a \ntimely manner and get quality care. What this legislation does is move \nus forward strongly in that direction. Let me very briefly describe \nsome of the major features in this legislation.\n  There has been on the drawing boards for many years in some cases the \nneed to build or expand VA medical and research facilities. This bill \nprovides for 26 major medical facility leases in 26 States and Puerto \nRico. That is something that is supported in a bipartisan way and has \nalready passed the House in virtually a unanimous vote.\n  This bill provides for the expedited hiring of VA doctors, nurses, \nand other health care providers and $500 million targeted to hire those \nproviders with unobligated funds. The simple truth is that no medical \nprogram--not in the private sector, not in the VA, not anywhere--can \nprovide quality care in a timely manner if that program does not have \nan adequate number of doctors, nurses, and other medical providers. It \nis unclear exactly how many more providers are needed, but there is no \nquestion there are many needed. I have heard--I will not swear to this, \nbut I have heard estimates that in Phoenix alone there is a need for up \nto 500 new providers. While the Phoenix situation may be worse than \nother parts of the country, there is no doubt in my mind that many \nhundreds, if not thousands, of doctors and nurses are needed, and we \nneed to expedite the hiring process.\n\n  Importantly, what our legislation also does is say to veterans around \nthe country that if they cannot get into a VA facility in a timely \nmanner, they will be able to get the care they need outside of the VA \nfrom a private provider in their community. They will be able to go to \na federally qualified health center in their community, an Indian \nHealth Service or if there is a Department of Defense military base and \nthey can get care there, they will be able to do that. This gives the \nveteran himself or herself the opportunity if that person cannot get \ntimely care within the VA to go outside of the VA.\n  What this bill also does is say to veterans who live 40 miles or more \naway from a VA facility if they choose--and it is clear there are some \nveterans that live hundreds of miles away in our rural areas from a VA \nfacility--they will also be able to get care outside of the VA. For \nthose veterans in rural areas this is an important provision.\n  This legislation also addresses a major crisis that we have seen \ntragically in recent years within the DOD, within the military, and \nthat is the issue of sexual assault. Far too many women and men have \nbeen sexually assaulted, and this legislation provides funding for the \nVA to provide improved care for those suffering from sexual assault.\n  This bill also deals with an issue where I believe there is \nwidespread support among Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, and \nthat is the need to address instate tuition for all veterans at public \ncolleges and universities. This legislation also provides that \nsurviving spouses of those who die in the line of duty will be eligible \nfor the post-9/11 GI bill. This bill also establishes commissions to \nprovide help to the VA in terms of improving scheduling capabilities \nand also their capital planning, two areas clearly where the VA needs \nto improve.\n  Lastly, and it is very important, this bill gives the Secretary of \nthe VA the authority to immediately fire incompetent employees and, \neven worse, those who have falsified or manipulated data in terms of \nwaiting periods or in other instances. So what we say is if somebody \nhas lied, has manipulated data, they are out tomorrow, after the bill \nis signed, but we also provide a very expedited appeals process in \norder to allow some due process.\n  I worry very much about the politicalization of the VA if a Secretary \ncomes in with a new President and says, I am going to get rid of 400 \ntop people and 4 years later another Secretary comes in and says, I am \ngoing to get rid of another 400 people. What we want in the VA, which \nis the largest integrated health care system in America, taking care of \n6.5 million veterans--one shouldn't care if those folks are \nRepublicans, Democrats, progressives or conservatives--what we want are \ncompetent, able supervisors. I also want to make sure if people get \nfired that it has nothing to do with the color of their skin or sexual \norientation.\n  So we have an abbreviated appeals process, but within that appeals \nprocess somebody can be removed from their position immediately.\n  The House of Representatives, as you know, passed legislation \nyesterday which covers a lot of the same ground the Sanders-McCain bill \ncovers, and I applaud the House for moving forward in a very rapid \nfashion. I am absolutely confident that working with House Chairman \nMiller and Ranking Member Michaud, we can in fact bridge the \ndifferences that exist in the two bills and send to the President \nlegislation he can sign as soon as possible.\n  Finally, I wish to say a word to the some 300,000 employees who work \nat the VA. The overwhelming majority of these people are hardworking, \nhonest, serious employees. In fact, many of them are veterans. My \nexperience is that for many of these employees what they do is less of \na job than a mission. They understand the sacrifices veterans have \nmade, and they in the vast majority of cases are doing excellent work \nto support our veterans. Let us never forget that some 230,000 veterans \ntoday and tomorrow and the next day are going into the VA for health \ncare and that the vast majority of those people--and that is 6.5 \nmillion people a year--are receiving high-quality care.\n  I have talked to veterans all over the State of Vermont, and what \nthey tell me is that they get very good care. I obviously cannot speak \nfor every veteran, but in Vermont--and I expect in most areas around \nthis country--veterans feel good about the health care they get.\n  A few weeks ago I held a hearing and asked all of the major veterans \norganizations point blank about their view on VA health care. What they \nsaid--this is not what Bernie Sanders said; it is what they said--was \nthat once people get into the system, the care is good. That is not \njust their view. There are independent studies out there that rate VA \nhealth care with private sector care, and oftentimes VA health care \ncomes out better. Right now our job is to address the crisis of long \nwaiting periods and making sure that veterans all\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\nover this country can get the care they need in a timely manner.\n  In my State of Vermont--according to information that just came out \nthe other day--some 98 percent of veterans get appointments in the \nsystem within 30 days. I suspect the numbers are similar in certain \nother parts of the country, although clearly not in all parts of the \ncountry. That is the issue we are addressing right now.\n  It seems to me that our job now is to defend the veterans of this \ncountry who have defended us. It is time to move the Sanders-McCain \nlegislation as quickly as we can--hopefully today. I know the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, feels strongly about this issue. He wants this \nlegislation moved as quickly as possible, as do I, and I believe \nSenator McCain does as well.\n  Once we get that legislation passed, I am confident we can set up a \nquick conference committee and resolve the differences between the \nHouse and Senate bills and get a bill to the President as early as next \nweek.\n  It is one thing to give great speeches on Memorial Day and Veterans \nDay about how much we love and respect veterans, but it is another for \nus to act expeditiously and effectively on behalf of veterans. Now is \nthe time for action, and I hope very much we will have virtually \nunanimous support to move this important legislation forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a topic of \ngreat importance to our country's security, economy, and social fabric, \nand that is our broken immigration system.\n  No one can dispute that our system is broken. We do not yet have \nsufficient resources on our border or in our interior to prevent \nillegal immigration. And our legal immigration system takes far too \nlong, has far too much bureaucratic redtape, and does not sufficiently \nserve our economic needs. In the meantime, our broken system has \ncreated millions of broken families. Many of these families are \nseparated simply because of immigration status.\n  All of these problems can be solved by passing immigration reform \nlegislation. Immigration reform will jump-start our economy, reduce our \nnational debt, secure our country, and heal these broken families. The \ntruth is, we have heard excuse after excuse after excuse from House \nRepublicans about why they have not put immigration reform legislation \non the floor.\n  First, it was that the Senate had to act first with broad bipartisan \nsupport. Well, that was taken away when the Senate passed bipartisan \ncomprehensive reform legislation with 68 votes--a vote total which is \nvirtually unprecedented for such important legislation.\n  Then it was that the House could only pass measures under the Hastert \nrule, which meant that a majority of the Republicans in the House had \nto support a bill in order to get a vote. This excuse was also taken \naway when the House showed it could pass other legislation, such as the \ndebt ceiling, Sandy relief, and the Violence Against Women Act, without \nneeding to fulfill the Hastert rule.\n  Then it was that the House could not pass one bill; it needed to \nbreak up the bill into component pieces. They thought this would be a \ndeal killer. We said: Fine, we will work with you on the smaller pieces \nof immigration reform as long as all of the important pieces are \naddressed at or around the same time.\n  Then it was lack of trust of the President. That too was a phony \nexcuse given that the President has deported more individuals than any \nother President. But even here we said: If that is really your problem, \nlet's pass a bill now and delay implementation until 2017. We will get \nthe President out of this equation so he is not used as an excuse. The \nHouse had no answers for that suggestion.\n  Now we have a new excuse. The excuse is that we supposedly cannot \npass immigration reform because Eric Cantor lost his primary election. \nWell, just like all of the other excuses that have proven to be \nillusory, the idea that they cannot do immigration reform because Eric \nCantor lost his election is another phony excuse for not passing \nimmigration reform put together by those who willingly and unashamedly \nhand the leadership gavel on immigration to far-right extremists like \nSteve King.\n  I want to be very clear about two things today. First, Eric Cantor \nwas never the solution on immigration. He was always the problem. Every \ntime I talked to Republican Members, business leaders, growers, and \nfaith leaders about immigration reform in the last several months, I \nconsistently heard that the House leadership wanted to move forward but \nthey did not have Cantor's support. Cantor was the chokepoint for \nimmigration reform for these past few months. Contrary to the \nconventional wisdom, Cantor's loss makes it easier--not harder--for \nHouse leadership to pass immigration reform.\n  Secondly, the polling is clear. Eric Cantor did not lose his primary \nbecause of support for immigration reform. It has been widely reported \nthat 72 percent of registered voters in Cantor's district polled on \nTuesday said they either strongly or somewhat support immigration \nreform that would secure the borders, block employers from hiring those \nillegally, and allow undocumented residents without criminal \nbackgrounds to gain legal status. And this is the case in one of the \nmost conservative districts in Virginia and the country. The polling is \nconsistent with other recent polling which shows support for \nimmigration reform among a majority of Republicans and a plurality of \ntea party supporters across the country. Even 70 percent of Republicans \nin Cantor's district support reform. Again, to be clear, not even the \nmajority of the farthest right segment of the Republican Party supports \ndeportations and the current broken system. But that is what we still \nhave in place today.\n  So to repeat, Eric Cantor did not lose his primary yesterday because \nof immigration. He lost it because he had lost touch with the people in \nhis district.\n  The election shows the Republican Party has two paths it can take on \nimmigration: the Graham path of showing leadership and solving a \nproblem in a mainstream way, which leads to victory, or the Cantor path \nof trying to play both sides, which is a path to defeat.\n  The lesson Republicans should take from last night is that embracing \nand showing leadership on immigration reform is a far better path to \nvictory than running from it, particularly for Republicans who are not \ntea party members but mainstream conservatives. The example shown by \nSenator Graham is dispositive. Rather than trying to be all things to \nall people, he defended immigration reform strongly in his State and \nwas rewarded by the people of South Carolina, the Republicans of South \nCarolina, which is an extremely Republican and conservative State.\n  Senator Graham sat with us from day one and crafted an immigration \nreform bill that he could sell to the mainstream conservatives in South \nCarolina, and he was rewarded last night by his State for being a man \nof principle.\n  One final thing about last night's election. David Brat won by \nreceiving 36,000 votes in a Republican primary in rural Virginia in an \nelection where 65,000 people showed up. The total population of the \nCantor district is over 750,000 people, and there are 11 percent more \nRepublicans in the district than Democrats. For some context, in the \n2012 election, Eric Cantor received 220,000 votes and his Democratic \nchallenger 160,000 votes. The point here is that it would be a \nmonumentally lame excuse for Republicans to say that our Nation's \nimmigration policy should be dictated by the whims of less than 20 \npercent of the Republican voters in a rural Virginia Republican \ndistrict.\n\n  So the time for excuses is over. The time for action is now. It has \nbeen nearly 1 year since the Senate passed bipartisan comprehensive \nimmigration reform legislation that would secure the border, turbo \ncharge America's economic growth, and provide a chance to heal \nAmerica's broken families who are being separated by our dysfunctional \nimmigration system.\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\n  For far too long, Republican House leaders have yielded the \nleadership gavel on immigration to the xenophobic leaders of the \nextreme far right of the party such as Steve King, who has previously \ndescribed immigration as a ``slow-motion holocaust.''\n  The question is whether House leadership will side with the Steve \nKings and David Brats of the world or if they will side with the \nopinions of the vast majority of Republican voters and even the vast \nmajority of voters in the Seventh Congressional District in Virginia.\n  Time is running out. The window is now open for passing immigration \nreform legislation, and the clock is furiously ticking. We have less \nthan 7 weeks to go to get something passed, and the time is now for \nRepublicans to give us their proposals on fixing the broken system. I \nsay 7 weeks because it is highly unlikely that immigration reform could \npass during a Republican Presidential primary season, where the party \nleaders will have to move to the extreme right to try and capture the \nPresidential nomination.\n  Therefore, it is time for the House leadership to declare \nunequivocally that immigration reform will be placed on the floor for a \nvote before the August recess. Without this declaration and the \npressure to act, we will not be able to get immigration reform drafted \nand passed during this window.\n  Make no mistake about it. If the House fails to act during this \nwindow--a clear indication that they have no inclination in solving the \nproblem--the President would be more than justified in acting anytime \nafter the summer is over to take whatever changes he feels are \nnecessary to make our immigration system work better for those unfairly \nburdened by our broken immigration laws.\n  But administrative relief is not what anyone wants to resort to. \nThose measures will be far too limited to fix all of the problems that \ncurrently plague our broken system. What we need right now is true \nleadership. Let's work together to get this done. A true leader will \nsay: I will do what is good for my country--and for my party--even if \nit means that an extreme wing of my party will be unhappy. That is \nleadership. That is necessary.\n  We stand ready to work with any of our Republican colleagues who want \nto achieve solutions in good faith. But for now, I will conclude by \nsaying that immigration reform is both necessary and inevitable. It is \nnecessary because it will secure our country, grow our economy, reduce \nour deficit, create new jobs, and provide us with the best and the \nbrightest. It is inevitable because the population of voters who \nbelieve this is an important issue continues to grow and become more \npolitically active day by day.\n  So to my Republican friends, the choice is yours: Work with us on \nimmigration reform this year and help the country now or do nothing and \nwatch as immigration reform eventually passes without your support or \nyour input. I hope we can act this year, but we will ultimately act. \nLet's hope we can finally do what is right before every other option \nhas been tried.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to S. 2432, the student loan refinancing bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I come to the floor disappointed that the Senate did not \nmove to full consideration of the legislation that I know the Presiding \nOfficer and others have worked on to take on the challenge that I \nbelieve will be the next great financial crisis our country will face--\nstudent debt.\n  Student debt, which is $1.2 trillion, now exceeds credit card debt, \nand that has been a PolitiFact out there and now validated. \nIncreasingly, this crushing amount of student debt is slowing economic \ngrowth. It is not allowing young workers to go into the marketplace and \nbuy a house or start a business.\n  While I am disappointed that we were not able to move to full \nconsideration of the legislation that would provide a more \ncomprehensive ability for students to refinance at a lower rate, I \nwould point out that there are a number of other tools we can use.\n  I know I am going to be joined in a few moments--our paths may not \ncompletely cross here--by Senator Rubio. There are two pieces of \nlegislation around this issue that Senator Rubio and I are working on \ntogether, and I want to speak briefly about both of those.\n  The first is legislation we have actually been joined by Senator \nWyden on as well called the Know Before You Go Act--a relatively simple \nconcept using data that the U.S. Department of Education already \ncollects. It says we ought to put together in a user-friendly Web site \ninformation for every parent and young student before they go off to \ncollege--whether it is a 4-year college, a 2-year college, or a \ncommunity college--so they know, if they attend that university, what \ntheir chance of graduation is, how long it will take; if they choose to \nmajor in art history, the way my daughter did, what the chances are of \ngetting a job and what that job would actually pay, so that we can make \nthese people--young and not so young--better informed consumers. The \ncost of higher education--perhaps next to the purchase of a home--is \nthe single largest investment most families will make.\n  This legislation I have with Senator Rubio, the Know Before You Go \nAct--and Senator Wyden--would say that making these families and \nparents more informed will add value and make a more-informed consumer. \nIt is simple, very little cost. We already collect this data, but we \ndon't present this data in a format that is easily obtainable by \nfamilies all across America.\n  I know Senator Rubio is going to speak about the second piece of \nlegislation, and I think Senator Rubio and I share a common background \non this issue. I believe we are both first in our generation to have \ngraduated from college. I was able to get through college and law \nschool--being quite a bit older than Senator Rubio--through direct aid, \nthrough work during college and law school, but also through student \nloans, but I came out of that with only $15,000 in student debt.\n  My personal story is that after working a bit in politics, I decided \nI would become an entrepreneur and proceeded to go off and start my own \nbusiness, which within 6 weeks failed miserably. I then started a \nsecond enterprise that lasted a little longer; it lasted 6 months. My \nthird enterprise was in the very early days of cell phones, and it \nmanaged to do pretty well, going on to cofound the company that became \nNextel.\n  But as I reflect upon that period, particularly when I was literally \nliving out of my car and sleeping on friends' couches, I am not sure I \nwould have had the courage to try once, twice, or three times if I was \nlooking at the kind of student debt that many--perhaps even some of \nthese young pages here as they go on to college--might face if we don't \ntake on this problem. It is not uncommon now for students--particularly \nif they complete graduate school--to see $70, $80, $100,000 in debt. \nThe average student in Virginia comes out with about $30,000 in debt. \nWe have to recognize that there should be a variety of tools available \nto them.\n  Again, I wish we had proceeded with the full debate on the bill on \nhaving the comprehensive ability to refinance.\n  One other piece of legislation, one other solution set--and I will be \ncoming to the floor on a regular basis because I think there are a \nvariety of ideas we need to lay out--a piece of legislation that \nSenator Rubio and I are working on together that we will be introducing \nis on simplifying into a single form a tool that already exists on \nstudent debt in terms of income-based repayment.\n  Income-based repayment is a pretty simple idea. It says that if you \nget out of college or get out of graduate school--too many young people \nnow are perhaps forced into careers that\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\nmay not have been their initial choice, but because of the crushing \namount of debt payments they have to make, they don't have the kind of \nfreedom I had to go out, candidly, and fail a couple of times before I \nmanaged to be successful. Income-based repayment says we will graduate \nthe amount of money you will pay back on your student debt based upon \nthe income you make. So if at first you need to take that job that \nmight pay a little lower because there is a chance you can pursue your \ndream or actually become an entrepreneur, we will allow you to tailor \nyour repayment schedule based upon the income, and as your income goes \nup, your payments will go up.\n  Rather than making income-based repayment kind of at the end of the \nline and very complicated to sort through, we simplify this approach, \ndo it in a way that I believe is financially responsible, and do it in \na way that gives that potential entrepreneur--the way I was--the chance \nto go out and take those risks, and if you are not successful at \nfirst--and can't leave out that 90 percent of entrepreneurs are not \nsuccessful the first time they try a business--to make sure that you \ncan maybe get that second shot, get that fair shot every American ought \nto have and not allow that student debt to be able to crush your \ndreams.\n  Clearly in America in 2014, in a world that is a global economy that \nis based upon our knowledge skills to stay competitive, you shouldn't \ngo broke in America if you choose to go to college or get a higher \neducation.\n  I believe these two pieces of legislation I am working on with \nSenator Rubio--the Know Before You Go Act, so you are more informed \nabout your options going forward, and this income-based repayment--are \ntwo of the possible solutions that could be added to make sure everyone \ngets the same kind of fair shot that I know the Presiding Officer and \nmy good friend the Senator from Maryland had and that we want to make \nsure all the future Americans have as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank Senator Warner for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  The bills Senator Warner is bringing forward will help deal with the \nincredible burden American families are confronting today in order to \nget quality education. His story is a story told about the \nopportunities of America. Education is the great equalizer in this \ncountry.\n  My grandparents came to America for a better life for their children. \nMy parents benefited from education. They are products of the Baltimore \nCity public school system and the public colleges and universities in \nthe State of Maryland. As a result of the educational tools given to \nthem, the grandson of those immigrants now serves in the Senate. That \nis the story of America. Education is the great equalizer.\n  That is why we were so disappointed that we couldn't proceed with an \nimportant tool to make education more available to families; that is, \nthe bill we just recently voted on to try to at least break the \nfilibuster so that we could help those who currently have student \nloans.\n  Education has been the great equalizer in a growing middle class, \nwhich has led to the strength of America. It has been key to global \ncompetition. We all talk about the fact that other countries are doing \na better job in STEM education or catching up to America--in some cases \nsurpassing America. Well, education is a great equalizer.\n  We should make it easier for families to be able to afford a college \neducation.\n  The truth is that it is more expensive here than it is in other \ncountries. Yet we expect our country to be able to compete globally.\n  We are hurting ourselves. It is important for a growing economy, a \ngrowing middle class. Trained workers will strengthen America's \neconomy, creating more jobs and more opportunity. So it is in our \ncollective interests, not just that one family who is debating whether \nthey are going to send their child to college or which college because \nof costs. It is in all of our interests to make it easier for Americans \nto afford a higher education.\n  The cost of higher education today is just plain too expensive. It is \njust too costly. It is the single most important investment a family \ncan make. Yet today college debt is around $1.2 trillion--greater than \nall of the credit card debt held by American families. Is that putting \na priority on education? I don't think so. We can do a much better job.\n  In Maryland, 776,000 students have Federal student loan debt totaling \nover $21 million. Over 50 percent of those graduating students are \nborrowing money in order to attend college, but here is the problem. \nFor too many families it is a decision of whether they are going to \ncollege or not going to college--the cost. For too many families it is \ngoing to a school of their second, third, or fourth choice rather than \nthe school they want to go to, and they are making that choice not \nbecause they couldn't get into the school they wanted but because they \ncan't afford the school they want, their first choice.\n  The debt they have when they leave college, it is clearly affecting \ntheir career choice. We may have a brilliant future researcher or a \nbrilliant future teacher. What is more important than being a teacher? \nBut they choose to go into a different profession because they have \nstudent loans, and they choose for immediate pay considerations for \ntheir jobs rather than the career they really want because they know it \nis not fair to their families to continue these large student debts \nwith which they are graduating.\n  That is the situation we confront. We know the numbers. I will tell \nyou some real stories about real Marylanders.\n  Last year I visited one of our 4-year colleges and had a roundtable \ndiscussion with students. There was a second-year student there. She \ntold me she was going to drop out of school after her second year. This \nis, by the way, in a very challenged community.\n  I said to her: I guess you are not doing well. She said: I am a \nstraight-A student. I love the opportunities I am being given here. I \nlove the knowledge I am getting, but I can't do it to my family to \nincur more debt. I look at my classmates from high school who have \ngraduated and they are making money for their family and here I am a \nburden to my family by incurring more debt. I can't do it. I don't know \nwhere I am going to be 2 years from now, but I know I can't do this to \nmy family. So I have to go out and work. I can't incur more debt.\n  That is a loss for that student and for our community.\n  I met another student named Becky last week at one of our Southern \nMaryland colleges. She told me the story about wanting to become a \npediatric dentist. She is brilliant. She is doing great. But Becky is \nworking full time and going to college. She is not going to be able to \ngo to her first choice. She has her first choice, but she is not going \nto be able to do that because she is working full time and incurring \ndebt in order to go to college. So it is going to take her a lot \nlonger. She is not going to get through undergraduate in 4 years. It is \ngoing to take her 5 years or 6 years to get through, and whether she \nwill ever become the pediatric dentist she wants to be, I don't know.\n  That is what is happening in America today, and millions of others \ncan tell you similar stories of career decisions they have made, giving \nup the most important investment in their life because of the financial \nconsiderations. The bill we have on the floor right now can do \nsomething about it.\n  I would be the first to acknowledge there is a lot we could do to \nhelp in this regard, but I thank Senator Warren for her leadership in \nbringing forward a bill that will make a difference for millions of \nstudents who hold debt. It will make it less costly for them to take \nout the loans they have taken out. It would affect millions of \nstudents.\n  I think Americans would be upset, disappointed, and outraged to learn \nthe Federal Government is making money off of student loans. The \ninterest rates are higher than what the cost of the student loan is. \nTaking into consideration defaults, taking into consideration \nadministrative costs, taking into consideration the cost of borrowing, \nbetween 2007 and 2012 $66 billion was made off the backs of students \nwho can't afford the loans they currently have.\n  What Senator Warren's bill does is allow those who hold student debt \nto refinance and take advantage of lower interest rates. It is not \ngoing to be subsidized loans. There will be no cost to\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\nthe taxpayers to do this. This seems like a no-brainer, quite frankly. \nIt would make it easier for them. We let homeowners refinance their \nmortgages and we passed special legislation to allow that. We allow \nbusinesses to refinance their loans to the lowest competitive rate. Why \ncan't students do this? That is what the bill before us does. It lets \nus move forward at no cost because we are not subsidizing the loans.\n  Just because of our unusual scoring reasons here, she provides an \noffset, which I don't think is necessary, but I certainly support the \nbill, and the offset is certainly one that has millionaires paying \ntheir fair share and it makes sense. So this will save thousands of \ndollars for those who currently holds loans. That is important.\n  Some say: Don't we need more accountability from higher education? \nYes, we do. Don't we need more transparency from higher education? Yes, \nwe do. Don't we need to have better consumer information? Yes. I agree \nwith all of the above, but today we can do something about the interest \ncosts and correct an injustice of government, making money off of \nstudent loans, and do this in a way that makes it more affordable for \nfamilies. We can do something that truly helps. It will provide help to \nfamilies.\n  President Obama has acted. I thank him for doing that. Five million \nfamilies will benefit from his Executive order or clarification which \nsays no more than 10 percent of your income will be used to pay student \nloans and caps the number of years. That is going to help. He is also \ndoing more to promote awareness of repayment options. That is good, but \nwe in Congress have an opportunity to act and act today.\n  I hope we get bipartisan support to help middle-income families and \nto help our country. I urge my colleagues to allow us to get on the \nbill and to pay to help the middle class of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, in a few moments I will yield the floor \nto my colleagues who will have an announcement about the progress which \nhas been made on the veterans bill, an important issue.\n  I wish to take this moment to talk about a tale of two bills--a tale \nof two very critical issues that confront our country, both deserving \nof the time and attention of the Senate but how they have been treated \nvery differently from one another.\n  The first issue is one which has been talked about here; that is, the \nissue of student loans in America. This is an issue I care about deeply \nfor two reasons.\n  The first is, when I arrived on the floor of the Senate in January of \n2011, I owed over $100,000 in student loans. For years we struggled \nwith the cost of those loans. My parents never made enough money to \nsave for our education, but I was able to pay for it through a \ncombination of Pell grants and loans for my undergraduate and graduate \nstudies. The undergraduate-level loans were manageable. The graduate-\nlevel loans for law school were quite a strain. At one point in our \nlives it was the single highest expenditure in our monthly budget. So I \nknow the cost of this.\n  The other reason is because I have the honor of serving as an adjunct \nprofessor at Florida International University, where once or twice a \nweek I interact with young men and women in South Florida who are \nfacing not just the cost of undergraduate education but starting to \nthink about how they are going to pay to go to law school or get a \nmaster's degree or any other profession they choose. This is a very \nsignificant issue, and there are two aspects of it that we are going to \ntalk about in a moment.\n  The second issue that is critically important for our country is the \nwell-documented problems of the Veterans' Administration. I don't need \nto go into a long dissertation about how our men and women who have \nserved us so honorably and so bravely in uniform deserve the very best \ncare possible.\n  Well documented are the long waiting lists and, even more tragically, \nefforts among some at the VA to cover up all of this, to cover their \ntracks and to cover up their incompetence. The vast majority of the men \nand women who work at the VA work hard and do a good job, but there are \ntoo many who do not, and there is not enough accountability with regard \nto that. As I said a couple of weeks ago when I came to the floor and \ntried to pass a measure, a companion of the issue that passed in the \nHouse: You are more likely to get a promotion or bonus than you are to \nget demoted or fired for not doing your job at the VA.\n  Two very important issues: a tale of two bills because they have been \nhandled so differently.\n  I anticipate in a moment a number of Senators will come to the \nfloor--Senators whom I thank for allowing me to work with them to make \nthis possible--and will have an announcement to make with regard to \nvotes on the veterans bill. That is great news. The men and women who \nhave served us deserve this progress.\n  There is no claim that this is going to solve every problem in the \nworld, but it is an important first step. I thank Senators McCain, \nSanders, Burr, Coburn, and others for all the work they have done on \nthis issue. We are excited to hear about their announcement in a few \nmoments. If they arrive, I will gladly yield the floor for them to do \nthat at the appropriate moment. I thank them, our men and women who \nhave served us thank them, and the people of Florida thank them. We are \na State with an enormous number of veterans.\n  This is an important issue, and I wish people could have seen the \neffort and how people worked across party lines to get this done. \nEveryone has great ideas about things they want to see added to it, \nabout things they would like to see in addition to what has been \nincluded, but we all understand a sense of urgency about addressing \nthis issue. We all had ideas we wanted to pursue, but we were all \nwilling to put those aside for another debate and another day in order \nto get this done.\n  We need more of that in the Senate, we need more of that in the U.S. \nGovernment, and I thank the Senators who have worked so hard to make \nthis happen and my colleague in the House, Jeff Miller, for the work he \nhas done in terms of bringing this forward as well. He has done a \nfantastic job.\n  Compare that to the way this issue on student loans has been handled, \nhowever. This is a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed, but the \nbill that was brought before the Senate included something the \nproponents knew was deeply political and controversial--the so-called \nBuffett rule. We have had debate on that issue before. We can have \ndebate in the future.\n  They knew the simple utilization of that rule as part of this \nmeasure--as admitted, by the way, by Members of the majority who have \ntalked about this measure in the past--they knew that by putting that \nin there, it politicized it and, quite frankly, doomed it to failure.\n  Let me lift the veil for those who are watching at home or in the \ngallery or anywhere, watching or listening now or in the future. They \nknew what the outcome would be when they included that, but it was put \nin there for the purposes of saying Republicans blocked this because \nthey knew that issue in and of itself served as a sort of poison pill \nthat held this up. It is unfortunate because the issue of student loans \nis a very valid issue in America.\n  Look, there was a time not long ago when higher education was an \nimportant option for millions of Americans, but, for example, even if \nsomeone didn't have a college education, they could still find a \nmiddle-income job that allowed them to make it to the middle class.\n  That is how my parents did it. Neither one of my parents had advanced \nformal education. Neither one finished the equivalent of high school. \nYet we lived in the middle class. We achieved the American dream, \nbecause working as a bartender and as a maid, my parents were able to \nmake enough money to achieve that.\n  The world has changed. Today, if someone doesn't have some form of \nadvanced education, they are going to struggle to find a job that pays \nenough to keep up with the cost of living, much less to get ahead. This \nhas made\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nhigher education no longer an option. It is now a necessity. This is an \nissue that needs to be looked at in multiple ways, not simply the loan \nissue, by the way.\n  Take, for example, the story of a 41-year-old head of household who \nhas worked their entire life to provide for their family and now has \nlost their job or their business, the only way they are going to be \nable to get a job that makes it to the middle class in the 21st \ncentury--because the job they used to have has been automated or \noutsourced or the industry is no longer around. The only way they are \ngoing to be able to make it back into the middle class and stay there \nis to acquire skills and education necessary for 21st century middle-\nclass and above jobs.\n  But if someone is 41 years old and they have to work full time to \nprovide for their family, and they have to raise that family, they \ncan't just drop everything and go back to college for 4 years, and they \nprobably can't afford it either. So we need to revolutionize what \nhigher education means in America so people living those circumstances \ncan access it in a cost-effective way.\n  When I worked in the State legislature, I had an employee who was the \nequivalent of my executive assistant. She made less than $30,000 a year \nbecause that is what the State pay grade called for. But she went to \nschool at night and became a paralegal and doubled her pay on the day \nafter her graduation because she was able to acquire advanced skills \nand a degree that allowed her to improve not just her lifestyle and her \nquality of life but that of her daughter's as well--a young, single \nmother struggling to provide and move ahead in life.\n  The problem is that our existing higher education system is one we \nhad in the 20th century. It is largely designed for a student who \ngraduates from high school and goes to college for 4 years, but it is \ninaccessible and unaffordable for Americans who are later in their \nlives, who have to work full time and raise a family, for people who in \nthe middle of a career have found their job outsourced or automated and \nneed to be retrained. That in and of itself calls for higher education \nto be revolutionized. The second point I would make is there is some \ninnovation in higher education. For example, there are degrees and \ndegree-type programs you can now get online. But you will often find \nthat the cost of those programs is as much and more than a brick and \nmortar institution would charge. It costs as much and in many instances \nmore to get your degree on line than it would by sitting in a classroom \nand taking lectures every day. For many people that is not realistic.\n\n  So we need to revolutionize what higher education means. The \ntraditional 4-year college will always be an important part of it, but \nwe also have to provide programs that allow people to graduate from \nhigh school with skills that allow them to immediately be employed such \nas more welders and more electricians. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. These are important jobs that we have shortages in, by the way.\n  We need to create more innovation so that people can acquire learning \nin the most effective way possible. For example, why can't we allow \npeople to package learning in any way they acquire it, online, work \nexperience, life experience, to be able to package all of your learning \nand acquire the equivalent of a degree that allows you to go to work?\n  There are real answers to these problems. I am involved in at least \nthree of them. One is a program called ``Right to Know Before You Go'' \nthat I sponsored with Senator Wyden. It is a bipartisan proposal. It is \nvery simple. It says that when you go to school before you take out a \nloan you have to be told: ``This is how much people that graduate from \nour school with a degree that you are seeking make.'' So you can decide \nwhether it is worth taking out thousands of dollars in loans for a \ndegree that doesn't lead to jobs.\n  The other proposal is changing the way we accredit higher education \nin America. Accrediting basically means you have permission to get a \ncollege degree. But the institutions who control that process are the \nexisting status quo schools. They will always have an important job in \nour educational portfolio but they cannot be the only ones anymore. We \nneed to change that so there are alternative programs available that \nallow you to package learning no matter how you acquire it so that you \ncan get credit for that as well. So the changing of accrediting is a \nbig part of this.\n  I believe that income-based repayments should be a part of this. \nThere is a more responsible way to do it. Thankfully, Senator Warner \nand I are working on such a proposal. I wish issues such as that were \ndebated as a part of this solution, as opposed to simply a political \nstunt brought to the floor designed to get enough ``no'' votes by \nRepublicans so it can be used in November on the campaign trail.\n  Student loans--a trillion dollars' worth--are owed by both \nRepublicans and Democrats. We need to get this issue solved if we are \ngoing to move forward. On the Veterans' Administration issue--I see a \nnumber of Senators have arrived and potentially have an announcement \nfor us--we have made great progress. The bill is important, but the one \npart I have been working on personally is accountability, giving the \nSecretary the power to hire and to fire those mid-level bureaucrats \nthat are not doing their job. That is an important measure. I am glad \nthat is included in this. I am glad the Senate will be moving forward \non this in a few moments.\n  It is the tale of two bills. One is an example of how we can get \nthings done to address the real needs in our country, and the other is \na missed opportunity to address one of the single greatest impediments \nto upward mobility and the American dream in the 21st Century--and that \nis the accessibility and affordability of higher education, because \ntoday higher education is no longer just an option. In some way, shape \nor form acquiring higher education has become a necessity for all \nAmericans, and we need to make that more accessible and more \naffordable.\n  It is my hope that in the weeks and months to come we will be able to \nput aside the desire to turn this issue into a political tool and come \ntogether to solve this problem because there is a trillion dollars of \nstudent loan debt sitting out there, and there are hundreds of \nthousands of Americans who desperately need to acquire some sort of \nhigher education and they cannot afford it or they cannot access it or \nboth. They need us to address this issue because this cannot be an \nissue we do not resolve. The American dream will continue to slip out \nof reach for millions of people in this new century unless we make the \nacquisition of higher education more accessible and more affordable to \npeople from all walks of life: the 18-year-old who graduates from high \nschool, the 25-year-old single mother, the 41-year-old father who heads \na household, and everyone in between.\n  This is an enormous challenge for our country but one for which there \nare solutions. All we need now is a willingness to proceed to do it, \nand I hope that in the weeks to come, once we pass this moment, we can \nget back on this issue and solve it in a real and responsible way.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on these issues. I look forward \nto working to pass the veterans bill hopefully today and to move \nforward and work together in a serious and meaningful way to make \nhigher education more affordable for every American who needs it in \norder to achieve their American dream.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before I say anything, I really and deeply \nappreciate the ability of the Democrats and Republicans to work \ntogether on an extremely important issue, and I need not editorialize \nmore than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3564-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3564-S3593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS DURING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. REID.

EMERGENCY DESIGNATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 4(g) of the Statutory Pay-As-\n     You-Go Act of 2010 (2 U.S.C. 933(g)).\n       (b) Designation in Senate.--In the Senate, this Act is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     403(a) of S. Con. Res. 13 (111th Congress), the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we will have one or two rollcall votes \nstarting at 4 p.m. this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we have not completed this legislation, \nand we may be subject to a budget point of order. It is not clear yet \nwhether there will be one, but according to this unanimous consent \nagreement, there will be no amendments filed prior to a vote on final \npassage either with or without a budget point of order being considered \nby the body. We will have time between now and then to have an indepth \ndiscussion of the provisions of this legislation.\n  In the meantime, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his willingness \nto make very difficult compromises. I also thank many of my colleagues \nwho have forgone the amending process in order that we may expedite \nthis legislation, which if there is a definition for emergency, I would \nsay this legislation fits that appellation. It is an emergency. What is \nhappening to our veterans and the men and women who have served this \ncountry needs to be addressed, and we need to pass this legislation and \nget it to conference with the House as soon as possible.\n  I especially mention two people who are really responsible for this \nlegislation, and I say--with not typical modesty--that they were the \nones who were really responsible for the provisions of this bill; that \nis, Senator Burr, ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nand Senator Coburn, whom I view, in many respects, as the conscience of \nthe Senate. Those two individuals were largely responsible for this \nlegislation, and I am obviously very proud to be a part of it.\n  Again, we will have time to discuss this legislation, but I extend my \nappreciation to the Senator from Vermont whose chairmanship of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee has been conducted with patriotism and with \nthe needs of our veterans uppermost in his priorities.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I look forward to our passing \nthis legislation and getting it to conference in as short a period of \ntime as is possible so we can bring it back to this body and then to \nthe President's desk for signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona has been too \nmodest. He deserves a great deal of credit for stepping to the plate \nwhen we needed him to step to the plate. He understands that we have an \nemergency, and it is imperative that the veterans of this country get \nquality care in a timely manner. He and I were both determined to make \nsure that something happened.\n  I thank Senator McCain and his staff for their hard work on this \nbill. We will discuss this issue more on the floor. He was absolutely \nright when he said that we have an emergency. We have to pass this \nlegislation today. We have to get it to conference as soon as possible, \nand we have to get a good bill on the President's desk next week.\n  Again, I thank Senator McCain.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate to \nspeak about an issue that is of urgent concern to me and should be of \nurgent concern to all of us. That issue is global warming or climate \nchange.\n  This is a personal issue for me. As the father of three, along with \nany other parent, my kids are never far from my mind and my heart. This \nis true for me as a father as well as a Senator, where every day I have \nto ask the question: What kind of example am I setting? What kind of a \nworld are my actions going to lead to? What sort of a world will I \nleave my children, and will it be better than the one my parents left \nto me?\n  Last summer I experienced one of the great joys of parenthood--a \nfamily trip. My wife Annie and I took our three children Maggie, \nMichael, and Jack on a visit to one of our Nation's most spectacular \nplaces: the mountains and glaciers of Glacier National Park in Montana. \nThere was one hike in particular on our summer trip that I will never \nforget. It was our hike up to visit historic Grinnell Glacier. If we \nhad taken this hike more than 60 years ago, here is what we would have \nseen, as this picture shows: mountains deep in glaciers, thick with ice \nand snow, covered in the glaciers that gave this national park its \nname. Yet last year as we took a long and winding hike up the trails, \nwe came up and over the last rise, and what we saw was noticeably \ndifferent--strikingly so--because most of what is left of the iconic \nGrinnell Glacier in the summer is a chilly pool of water in a largely \nempty valley pool. We can see the difference in these two pictures, and \nthis is just in one lifetime.\n  Since 1966, Grinnell Glacier has lost half its total acreage, and as \nwe continue to warm our planet, these changes will only accelerate. My \nchildren--our children--will not just lose the chance to see beautiful \nglaciers and an iconic national park but the chance to live in a world \nas robust and safe and healthy and vibrant as the one their parents \nwere born into. As our global population keeps growing toward 9 billion \nand developing nations keep seeking higher living standards and climate \nchange accelerates, this is the foundational challenge of the 21st \ncentury.\n  Climate change impacts everything: human health, agriculture, \nnational security, migration patterns for animals and fish and birds. \nAs parents and as a nation, I think it is our responsibility, our \nchallenge, and our opportunity to lead the way, to show that prosperity \ndoes not need to mean doom for our future.\n  I also think in my view that, simply put, there is no alternative to \naction. The world where we don't act isn't a world of vibrant economic \ngrowth, it is a world with more frequent and extreme natural disasters, \nwith increased droughts and famine, with displaced populations and \ncities--even regions and in a few cases even nations--plunged under \nwater.\n  I represent the lowest mean elevation State in America, the State of \nDelaware. It has been documented in a broad study led by our Governor's \nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environmental Control that rising \nsea levels could put up to 11 percent of my home State of Delaware \nunder water by the end of the century. We know these changes are \ncoming. They are slow. They are gradual. They are cumulative. At times \nthey are hard to perceive, but they have already started and will only \nget more extreme and more expensive the longer we wait to act. The cost \nof our inaction will be borne by our children and generations to come.\n  We are not the only ones seeing these impacts, and although the \ndebate over science raged for many years, and I think is settled, I \nhave also had an opportunity to hear from folks who live well outside \nthe Western scientific world but have a profound insight into what \nthese impacts are and how they are seen in the world.\n  Several years ago, along with the senior Senator, a friend of mine, \nour President pro tempore, Senator Leahy, I visited the Kogi tribe in \nthe remote Santa Marta Mountains of Colombia. These equatorial \nmountains have massive glaciers up at the very top of very high \nmountains but are also right at the edge of the Caribbean Sea. The \nfolks who make up this pre-Colombian tribe, the Kogi tribe, don't have \nsophisticated technology that monitors and tracks climate change, but \nas they sat with us they shared with us what they see as starkly as our \nbest weather-monitoring satellites. By observing changes in migratory \npatterns and weather and the snowpack on the glacial mountains they \nworship, they see,\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\nmore every year, that there is a fundamental change happening in our \nenvironment, in our climate. Their purpose in calling us to meet with \nthem was to warn us that climate change is impacting the way of life \nthat has passed down from generation to generation for centuries in \ntheir people, and it has moved them to speak out to the world, to tell \ntheir story, and to urge the rest of us not to hurt Mother Earth and to \nunderstand the consequences of the changes we are making.\n  Whether the voices we listen to come from our own children, from our \nscience community or from remote corners of the world, all of them call \nus to act, to act in a way that prevents the worst from happening and \nto ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.\n  This isn't just wild-eyed or rosy thinking. It is possible for us to \nmake meaningful change in a bipartisan way. We have done it before. \nBack in 1990, when acid rain was a real and pressing challenge that was \nthreatening the vitality and the vibrancy of many of the lakes and the \nmountain places in the American West, I remember well that under then-\nRepublican President George H.W. Bush, Congress came together in a \nbipartisan way and passed the Clean Air Act amendments. These were \ndesigned to reduce the contributing elements to acid rain: powerplant \nemissions that produce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide that in \ncombination caused acid rain, damaging historic property, monuments, \ninjuring forests and lakes and ecosystems all over our country.\n  So Congress came together to create a novel, market-based, flexible \ncap-and-trade program that allowed powerplants to find cost-effective \nalternatives, solutions to limit pollution. Rather than tanking our \neconomy, that cap-and-trade plan to fight acid rain ended up finding \nnew ways to power our country and to improve energy efficiency without \nso much pollution. We adapted, we changed, and in some ways we thrived.\n  As a study done 13 years later shows, those standards adopted in 1990 \nhave saved lives at a cost well worth it: $70 billion in health \nbenefits every year, cumulatively, compared to $1.7 billion in costs--a \n40-to-1 tradeoff that I think most Americans would take any day of the \nweek as a return on their investment.\n  More recently, in my own State of Delaware and eight of our \nnortheastern neighbors, we showed how we can act together to begin to \ncurb climate change and grow our economies at the same time. In 2003, a \nbipartisan group of regional leaders, this time led by New York State's \nRepublican Gov. George Pataki, built a regional cap-and-trade system, \nsimilar to the Acid Rain Prevention Program I just referenced. But the \none in our region was called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or \nRGGI for short. It is flexible, market-based, and it has been \neffective. States choose to cut pollution in a number of ways, from \nclosing older coal-fired powerplants or opening renewable energy \nprojects to investing in important and valuable energy efficiency.\n  As the New York Times reported just last week, since that program \nstarted in 2009, our economies in these regional States have actually \ngrown more than the 41 other States that are not part of RGGI--by \nseveral percentage points--while we have cut our emissions over four \ntimes more than the rest of the Nation.\n  We have created jobs, we have invested in innovation, we have cut \npollution, and we saved millions of families money on their energy \nbills. That is why I think we should feel optimistic about the \nimportant steps the administration has just taken. The President's \nstrong standards for vehicle fuel efficiency were a great start. At \nfirst many argued that pushing car companies to make cleaner, more \nefficient cars would end up costing a huge amount of money with little \nto show for it. But the opposite has happened.\n  We set more aggressive national standards. Engineers have gotten to \nwork. They have innovated. They have invented. America's leading car \ncompanies have met the challenge, and the improvement in fuel \nefficiency has been dramatic. Although there is a cost in upfront \nresearch and development, it is well worth it, as drivers save money at \nthe pump, America becomes less dependent on foreign oil, and we all get \nto breathe cleaner air.\n  Just last week the Obama administration took another step and \nproposed our Nation's first rules to limit carbon pollution from \nexisting powerplants. Although they will not be finalized for another \nyear, these limits represent the most significant action that any \ncountry has taken to halt the devastating warming of our planet.\n  They will have real and lasting health benefits. By cutting \npowerplant pollution over the next 15 years, we will be able to prevent \n100,000 asthma attacks in children, 2,100 heart attacks, and thousands \nof premature deaths. That will mean nearly 500,000 fewer missed days of \nschool and work and will save $7 in health costs for every $1 required \nof new investment.\n  Over the long term, curbing climate change will make large, lasting, \nand meaningful differences--from reduced hunger and heat waves, to \nreducing the spread of infectious diseases or conflicts over scarce \nresources.\n  Cynics will argue that even with these limits we will not stop \nclimate change, and that is true. They will point out that renewable \nenergy technology is not yet ready to fully replace fossil fuels. They \nwill say that America acting alone cannot solve the problem, and that \nis true. We need global action, especially from large developing \nnations such as China and India that are on pace to pollute the most \ngoing forward.\n  As an exercise in cynicism, they get a lot of things wrong. These \nrules alone, yes, will not halt our rising seas. But, then again, no \none is claiming they will alone. But they are a crucial step, and we \nowe it to posterity, to our country, to our future to take what action \nwe can to send a powerful signal to America's entrepreneurs and \nengineers, our innovators and inventors, that this is a challenge we \nintend to take on. By acting now, we can begin to birth the innovations \nthat will be at the heart of our planet's clean energy future.\n  Innovation in America has never stood still. We have done incredible \nthings that even a few years before we might not have predicted. \nRemember, just a few years ago, natural gas prices were volatile, \nunreliable, and solar power was too expensive for most households. Yet \nin just the last few years new technologies have flipped those on their \nhead and we are seeing remarkable changes. Solar prices have fallen 60 \npercent in just the last 3 years, and natural gas is today cheaper than \ncoal. There are dramatic changes in our energy future going on because \nof a huge resurgence in natural gas production in this country. We have \nevery reason to believe that by focusing our greatest minds on this \nchallenge, American ingenuity can change and even save the world.\n  If the United States is going to lead the 21st century, we have to be \nat the forefront of combating climate change. Although we know meeting \nthis challenge will take global action, the United States needs to lead \nthe way. This is our responsibility. We cannot expect other poor \nnations to act if a leading, wealthy nation such as the United States \nis not willing to take even the most minimal responsible actions. We \nare the second largest polluter of greenhouse gases on the planet, only \njust eclipsed by the Chinese in the last decade.\n  For more than a century our economic growth and our strong middle \nclass--built on American industry and innovation--made us the envy of \nthe world, but they have also contributed to putting our planet in a \ndangerous position.\n  As developing nations work to lift hundreds of millions of people out \nof desperate poverty, they are looking at us to show that it is \npossible. Also, a great but urgent opportunity here lies before us. We \nhave a moral obligation to lead because others are looking at competing \nexamples and are not waiting around.\n  China, our greatest economic competitor, now and into the future, is \nitself choking on the byproducts of coal and investing heavily in \ncleaner air and cleaner energy. The country that figures out how to \nprosper without deadly pollution is the country that will dominate the \ntechnologies that our world uses and depends on in the decades to come. \nAre we really going to miss out on this chance to be the country that \nmakes the clean cars, the\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\nclean powerplants, the clean technologies of the future? I hope not.\n  We in Congress have the opportunity and the obligation to pull \ntogether and to act responsibly as well. We can pass the bipartisan \nShaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill today, create great jobs, and \nmake it easy for families to spend less on energy and save money while \ndoing it. We can put clean energy on a level playing field by passing \nthe bipartisan Master Limited Partnership Parity Act, of which I am a \ncosponsor, to stop giving coal, oil, and natural gas a leg up without \nan even playing field for renewables and energy efficiency. We can \ninvest in the research that will unlock the energy innovations of the \nfuture.\n  These are actions we could take today. There will be costs. But if we \nact now, they will be far outweighed by the benefits today and into the \nfuture. If we wait, these costs will only grow.\n  I understand this is a difficult issue politically for us to take on. \nMany of the most dire consequences of global warming are still into the \nfuture. As I know, as a person who struggles to make long-term, delayed \ndecisions--whether it is investing for retirement or losing the weight \nmy doctor keeps suggesting would help improve my long-term health--\nhumans are not really good at taking the small but powerful steps today \nthat over time will lead to a healthier, more secure future. Even if \nthe costs are low, when the benefits are farther out, it is so hard for \nus to take action.\n  What will we say--what will we say--when our children ask, what did \nwe do, when the science was clear, when the options were before us, and \nwhen we had the chance? Just as we rightly worry in this Chamber about \nthe financial debts we are going to leave to future generations, \nleaving this debt, leaving the burdens of unaddressed, unresolved \nglobal warming and climate change to our children and future \ngenerations is a debt too deep for us not to address.\n  We are in danger--if we do not act--of leaving behind not only a \nworse off world but of leaving ourselves a future where we cannot look \nour children in the eye and say that we stepped up to the greatest \nglobal challenge of this century.\n  What will it mean when my own daughter, at some point in the future, \ngoes to Glacier National Park with her future family? Will it even have \nglaciers? How will she explain to them how that amazing national park \nhas changed? And what will she say about what this Senate and her own \nfather did to take action? It is my hope, my prayer, that on that \nfuture trip they will reflect on how we found the will, how we found \nthe determination, to act together to change the trajectory of our \nfuture and to save it for everyone's future.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         College Affordability\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that earlier today this Chamber could not even proceed \nto the consideration of the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing \nAct. This would have allowed those with outstanding student loan debt \nto refinance at the lower interest rates currently offered to new \nborrowers. This is deeply disappointing to me, and it should be to the \nAmerican public--that we could not even get on to the bill to debate \nit.\n  This is why it is particularly disappointing: Our Nation's young \npeople and their families are burdened with extraordinary debt--$1.2 \ntrillion of student loan debt. This exceeds the aggregate--the total--\nauto loan, credit card, and home equity debt balances in America, \nmaking student loans the second largest debt of U.S. households, \nfollowing mortgages.\n  Today, the average student graduates from college with around $29,000 \nin loans. In New Jersey, that is up from an average of $27,600 in 2011 \nand $23,792 in 2010. More than 16 percent of my constituents now have \nstudent debt. That is over 1 million New Jerseyans who are weighed down \nby a significant financial obligation that limits the amount of money \nthey are able to put back into the economy--in buying homes and in \ninvesting in their futures, in pursuing their American dream.\n  Reduced purchasing power due to high student loan debts not only \nholds back a family's day-to-day spending but it keeps them from making \nthose large investments.\n  I believe it is irresponsible and shortsighted for us to think that \nwe can saddle young people--the true engines of our economy--with this \nburden and maintain our position as the world's most powerful economy.\n  Historically, the United States has done things differently. We were \nthe leader in expanding college opportunity. From the GI bill following \nWorld War II to Pell grants in 1980, we have taken bold steps to ensure \nthat Americans have access to college regardless of their ability to \npay their way entirely on their own. We created these programs because \nwe understood that an educated workforce is essential to our Nations's \neconomic competitiveness. The most valuable natural resource any nation \non the planet has is the genius and mental acuity of its people. \nWithout highly skilled workers, without trained minds, without that \nopportunity that comes with higher education, America simply will not \nbe able to compete as well in the global economy.\n  The cost of college in America puts our young people at a \ndisadvantage compared to their peers. We are not leading; we are \nlagging. These obstacles to a college education deny a level playing \nfield. We are disadvantaging our young people in their fight to compete \nand lead against other nations that are doing so much more.\n  Take this important data point: More than 51 percent of the median \nincome is the cost of college in the United States, while the cost of \ncollege in Germany is just 4.3 percent of that country's income. In \nCanada it is about 5 percent. In England it is about 6 percent. Compare \nthat to us--51 percent of median income in the United States. It is \nless than 7 percent in Canada, in England, in Germany--our competitors.\n  We should be doing everything in our power to encourage forthcoming \ngenerations to pursue higher education so that we do not slide further \nin global rankings and compromise our ability to compete. Where we used \nto lead the globe in percentage of population with a college education, \nnow we lag. We cannot be the leading economy if we are the lagging \nnation in education.\n  I commend my colleagues, including Senators Harkin, Reed, Warren, and \nGillibrand, who have been so active even before I came to this body in \ncalling attention to this issue. I urge my colleagues to step up and be \na part of preserving this grand American tradition of college access, \nwhich is so essential to the other grand tradition in our Nation of \nsocial mobility, that no matter where you are born, no matter what your \neconomic status, no matter what your color or your creed, this is the \nNation where, if you have grit and toughness, discipline and hard work, \nyou can make it. We are a country that will remove those obstacles and \nallow genius to be made manifest.\n  I hope we can begin to get bills like this that are so common sense--\nthis idea that we can refinance student debt--to the point where we can \ndiscuss the bills on the floor and they can escape the trap of the \nfilibuster.\n\n\n                              Truck Safety\n\n  Before yielding the floor, I wish to take this moment to express my \ndeepest condolences to the family of victims involved in a tragic \ntractor trailer accident Saturday night on the New Jersey Turnpike. My \nthoughts and prayers go out to the several individuals who were injured \nin the crash. I obviously wish them a full recovery.\n  We owe many thanks to the emergency personnel who responded to this \nweekend's accident and countless others who worked tirelessly along our \nhighways to keep them safe. During times like these, though, we must \nask ourselves whether this tragedy and so many others in New Jersey and \nacross our Nation along our highways could have been prevented with \ncommon sense. It is too early to tell, but I am grateful to the \nNational Transportation Safety Board for investigating\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\nthis particular accident thoroughly. I eagerly await their findings, \nbut in the meantime, it is worth reviewing what we do know.\n  Larger and heavier trucks cause greater damage when collisions occur. \nIt is just physics. That is why there are rules governing truck size \nand weight limitations on our highways. I have concerns about any \nattempts to increase truck size and weight limits. I hope that sound \ndata and science will inform our decisions, the decisions this body \nmust make on that issue.\n  Another major highway problem--one that I know is affecting the lives \nof families from coast to coast--is the problem with driver fatigue. \nStudies show that fatigue contributes to 30 to 40 percent of all major \naccidents--all major truck accidents. Thirty to forty percent of truck \naccidents are contributed to by fatigue. When drivers do not get enough \nrest, when they are more tired, they are much more likely to get into \nan accident. That is why there are limitations in place on the number \nof hours truckdrivers may work in any given week. I am concerned about \nany efforts to weaken those rules, which would allow people to push the \nlimit of human exhaustion even further and would therefore create an \nenvironment where more accidents are possible.\n  The bottom line is that truck accidents and the deaths and injuries \ncaused by them are actually increasing in America. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate to take a serious look at what \nwe can do to improve the safety of our highways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I come to the floor today as we get ready \nto vote on the veterans bill to make several points and would like to \nbegin by commending Senators Sanders and McCain. They have obviously \nacted quickly. They have acted responsibly. They are taking up some of \nthe most extraordinary concerns that really have come to light in the \nlast few weeks regarding the access our veterans have to medical care.\n  I think it would be fair to say that every single Senator--every \nSenator--is grateful for the immeasurable sacrifices veterans make for \nthe Nation. These are men and women who give up years of their lives to \nserve our country and willingly head into harm's way. They suffer \nphysical and mental wounds all too often. Many of the veterans of the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan--and I have seen this in my home State--\nhave volunteered for three, four, and five tours of duty.\n  What is undisputable is this: The Senate understands that when our \nveterans come home, the health care services they receive must be \nsecond to none. I believe that strongly. I believe it is a concern \nwidely shared here in the Senate. That is why the reports of long wait \ntimes and falsified records are so appalling.\n  The VA audit that came out this week showed, for example, how hard \nveterans in my home State of Oregon have been hit. More than 3,000 \nOregon veterans could not be seen by a doctor within 90 days at the \nPortland VA facility, and nearly 3,500 faced the same wait times at the \nRoseberg VA facility. Many Oregon veterans who rely on the Boise and \nWalla Walla facilities got similar treatment. Moreover, an \ninvestigation is underway to determine how things deteriorated so \nrapidly. It is pretty obvious that these kinds of findings are \ninexcusable and they are unconscionable.\n  Veterans deserve the best. Senators Sanders and McCain deserve credit \nfor working in a bipartisan way--a way that is too rare here in \nWashington, DC--to address this challenge. It is never easy to work in \na bipartisan way. I commend them.\n\n  I wish to also raise today one part of the bill that I believe has to \nbe resolved and can be resolved before the legislation gets to the \nPresident's desk. The legislation currently directs many of our \nveterans to Medicare's doctors and specialists. At first glance that \nmight not raise questions, but I wanted to bring up the possibility of \nsome unintended consequences.\n  Right now there is a mandated 2-percent cut on payments for Medicare \nservices because of across-the-board sequestration. That is still in \neffect. However, that particular spending cut, that spending reduction, \ndoes not apply to treatment for veterans. So, in effect--and I know \nthis was completely unintended--this could create an incentive for \nphysicians--we already do not have enough of them caring for seniors \nwho rely on Medicare--it could create an incentive for doctors to take \nthe veteran patients over our Nation's seniors. I think no Senator \nwants that to happen. I have talked about this with Chairman Sanders \nand with Senator McCain, and they certainly do not want that false \nchoice. I think it would be fair to say that no one wants to see \nseniors pitted against veterans. All Senators want the best possible \ncare for both our older people and our veterans.\n  The problem, however--and all Senators are familiar with this--\nMedicare patients often are already waiting in line to see their \ndoctors. In fact, many of the underperforming VA facilities are located \nin communities that have difficulty meeting the current demand for \ncare. This is especially true in some medical fields that are \nabsolutely crucial for our veterans, particularly primary care and \nmental health.\n  It is important to note that the other body--the House--has picked up \non an idea that I and others have advanced in order to resolve this \nmatter. So this is an opportunity for the Senate and the House, in a \nbipartisan way, to work together. I have talked to leaders of the \nveterans committee in the House. My sense is that we now have the House \nfully supportive of a way to resolve this issue and ensure that despite \nthe fact that the veterans funds are not sequestered and the seniors \nfunds--the Medicare funds--are, there would be a way to resolve this, \nand that would simply be to stipulate that any credentialed provider \ncould contract with the VA to treat veterans. That way, in effect, we \nwould ensure that both seniors and veterans would get the care they \nneed. In effect, it would put the Senate and the other body on the same \nwavelength.\n  It is a simple fix. We just allow our veterans to meet with any \nlicensed clinical provider, not just the Medicare provider.\n  In closing, I commend again Chairman Sanders and Senator McCain for \nfirst-rate work, accomplished at truly land-speed record timing.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction and a \nlong history with respect to Medicare, I want them and our colleagues \nin the other body to know the Finance Committee is very anxious to work \nwith all concerned to make sure the final version of this legislation--\nthe bill we hope goes to the President's desk as soon as possible--\naddresses what is best for both veterans and seniors.\n  I am confident that by working together--Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate and the House--we can achieve that resolution before the \nbill gets to the President's desk.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to express my disappointment in \ntoday's earlier vote, that we weren't able to pass the student \nrefinancing legislation.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Warren for sponsoring that bill and for \nmy colleagues who did support it. I hope we will have a chance to bring \nup this legislation again, get bipartisan support, and get it passed.\n  We can agree education is the gateway to opportunity. I was first in \nmy family to go to college and went to school with the help of \nfinancial aid, and I know how important it is to many in the State of \nWashington that we help them make education more affordable.\n  Student debt in this Nation quadrupled over the past 10 years, so the \ntotal amount of debt is $1.2 trillion. Many students in my State are \nanxious about this situation and they want to do something about it.\n  Over the past 4 years student debt has even surpassed credit card \ndebt. So when we think about that, the fact that student debt is enough \nto pay every American's credit card balance and still have $450 billion \nleft over tells us how much debt is being accumulated on behalf of \nstudents just to get an education, just to basically make their way in \na changing economy.\n  We do live in an information age, and it means that everybody having \na good\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nbase education and being able to adapt--as new information comes along \nthat changes industry--is going to be critically important.\n  The fact that student debt is now the second source of personal debt \nin America, only behind mortgages, puts a drag on our economy. Those \nwho are suffering under this are real individuals.\n  We just had a roundtable in the State of Washington last weekend with \nsome of the best and brightest at the University of Washington. These \nstudents talked about how they were trying to invest in their own \nskills so they could advance in their education, and many of the \nstories they told were not out of the ordinary, but I think it is \nsomething we don't think about.\n  In a lot of these cases, these individuals were talking about how \nthey were trying to get an education. Other people in their family, \ntheir brothers and sisters, were trying to get an education, and their \nparents were also trying to upgrade their skills, because in an \ninformation age economy, that is what happens, everybody has to upgrade \ntheir skills.\n  So these students are trying to do everything. But I was truly moved \nby one student who said: I have a debt that seems to be the size of a \nmortgage for me, but I don't have a house that goes along with it.\n  He was trying to say: I am coming out of college with incredible debt \nand how am I going to even afford the basic things people look forward \nto--maybe not right after graduation but as they start their careers \nand start to move forward. These are individuals who contribute to our \neconomy. They buy cars, they buy homes, everything. But this \nindividual, a graduate of Central Washington University, told me he \npays the same amount for rent as he does for student loans every month.\n  In Washington State the average student borrower owes more than \n$23,000 before they graduate. That is an increase of 22 percent over \nthe last 5 years, $4,000 for the average student borrower at the \nUniversity of Washington.\n  So over the next weeks thousands of students in Washington State will \nwalk across and get their diploma, but when they accept this diploma \nand go into the world of opportunity, they will also be going with a \nlot of debt. We also heard from another student at the University of \nWashington, how at this point in her career, as she graduates, the debt \nwill be almost $100,000. She wants to pursue a career, but when she \nthinks about how much she has to pay on that student loan, that is \ngoing to affect that. In fact, during her time at the University of \nWashington there were points at which she worked 60 hours a week. I \ndon't know how anybody can continue their education and work 60 hours a \nweek.\n  So these are students who want to be able to refinance and pay down. \nIn this case, with somebody who has a 6-percent or 7-percent loan, this \nbill and legislation would allow them to refinance.\n  With the legislation, an undergraduate with $30,000 in student loans, \nfor example, would save almost $5,000 over the life of their loan by a \nrefinancing of that interest rate, if it was 6.8 percent, to the \ncurrent direct undergraduate interest rate of 3.86. Those are real \ndollars to these individuals.\n  That means much needed help for 25 million borrowers across the \ncountry. It could save, on average, for all those borrowers, about \n$2,000 per loan. In my State it would mean relief for 451,000 students, \njust like the ones we spoke to last week.\n  The University of Washington in the Pacific Northwest took matters \ninto its own hands and produced a report. The report showed that the \ntypical University of Washington student would have to work 54 hours a \nweek for a full year to pay for 1 year of student education.\n  I am so proud of these students. They did their own report and got it \non the front page of the Seattle Times because it spells out what we \nhave already known, that the days when students could raise the amount \nof money they needed to pay for education by doing summer jobs is gone.\n  The burden of debt and the amount of money owed is impacting \nstudents. There is no way they can work their way through college at 54 \nhours or 60 hours a week and be able to do their academic work.\n  Entrepreneurial activity among 20- to 34-year-olds is challenged. The \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York has found that for the first time \npeople with student loan debt are less likely to buy a house than those \nwithout, so it is showing up in our economy.\n  If you think about it, if this is what a generation of Americans are \ngoing to be faced with for the next decade or two, then that is going \nto have a ripple effect through our economy for several years.\n  A recent study by the Brookings Institution found that student loan \nborrowers are 60 to 70 percent less likely to apply for graduate school \nthan those without student debt. So again now we have another \ncomplexity.\n  I look at this issue and I look at the fact that we have a worldwide \ndemand for 35,000 new airplanes. We need 20,000 new workers in the \naerospace industry. We have demands for computer scientists, something \nlike 300,000 a year. We only graduate 70,000.\n\n  I look at it and say: Why aren't we helping to finance everybody who \nwants to get an engineering degree and a computer science degree? Why \naren't we figuring out a way to make that more affordable? Because in \nan information age economy, that is exactly what we need to do, make an \ninvestment in education, but we can't make an investment in education \non the backs of these students when they are coming out of college with \nthis much debt or trying to struggle even to learn these careers that \nare so vital to our economy and they have to choose between working and \nactually studying. We would rather they commit themselves to these \ncareers and these educations so we can have the workforce of the \nfuture.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle didn't \nsupport this legislation, but the Congressional Budget Office projects \nthat the bill would actually reduce the deficit by about $14 billion \nover the next decade.\n  That is important because we want to see policies that are going to \nhelp our economy in the short run and in the long run, but they have to \nbe fiscally responsible.\n  So I say to those critics who say: Oh, well, if we make the interest \nrate lower, then students are going to borrow more money, I don't think \nstudents are looking to borrow more to add to their debt.\n  I don't think students whom I talked to who had loans as high as \n$180,000 want to borrow more money just because we are going to reduce \nthe interest rate. They want to refinance, reduce their obligation, and \nget back to studying.\n  There is much more we need to do to mitigate the cost of higher \neducation. I know my colleagues and I are going to be working on that, \nbut the Bank on Student Loans Emergency Refinancing Act was a very good \nstep to help students and to focus them on their careers and education.\n  Again, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will look \nagain at this issue and get back to it. We need to make sure college \neducation is more affordable. It is time for us to extend the same \nbenefits we do for businesses and mortgages to students so they can \nrefinance and that 25 million students in America could refinance their \nstudent loans.\n  I thank Senator Warren for bringing up this issue. I hope we will get \nback to it again.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak on a matter of great \nimportance that seems to have slipped through the cracks of the \npublic's consciousness. However, with the growing furor over the recent \nscandal at the Veterans' Administration, I expect more and more people \nwill be made aware of it.\n  I don't think it is unreasonable to argue that most Americans would \nbe outraged to learn the Federal Government pays tens of millions of \ndollars every year to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of government \nemployees not to work. This practice used to be called featherbedding. \n``The term `featherbedding' originally referred to any person who is \npampered, coddled, or excessively rewarded.''\n  It was later used to describe certain labor relations practices. \nAccording to Wikipedia:\n  The modern use of the term in the labor relations setting began in \nthe United States railroad industry, which used feathered mattresses in \nsleeping cars. Railway labor unions, confronted with changing \ntechnology which led to widespread unemployment, sought to preserve \njobs by negotiating contracts which required employers to compensate \nworkers to do little or no work or which required complex and time-\nconsuming work rules so as to generate a full day's work for an \nemployee who otherwise would not remain employed.\n  Congress tried to put an end to the practice in the 1947 Taft-Hartley \nAct amendments, which defined and outlawed featherbedding. However, the \nU.S. Supreme Court has narrowly defined the terminology, leaving most \npractices undisturbed.\n  The featherbedding-like practice I am referring to today is most \noften called official time, wherein government employees--who are \nhighly compensated, often including overtime pay--are paid to perform \nno work for the government, only work for the benefit of their unions. \nThese ``employees'' are not union employees, nor are they paid by the \nunion. Instead, they are union members paid by the taxpayers to work \nfull time for the union while working for the Federal Government.\n  Of course, this practice also goes on in the private sector. However, \nin the private sector, the featherbedding comes off of the bottom line \nand is negotiated as a measure of ensuring labor peace and in exchange \nfor other union concessions. In the Federal Government, where the \nbottom line is the taxpayer and where unions are not permitted to \nstrike, this practice is a way for weak managers to use government \nfunds to reward public sector union political supporters and financial \ncontributors, passing the costs along to the unknowing taxpayer for \nservices not rendered. In the private sector, official time is \ncarefully monitored and controlled. In the Federal sector, managers \ngenerally look the other way.\n  According to the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, during \nfiscal year 2011 unions represented 1,202,733 nonpostal Federal civil \nservice bargaining unit employees--an increase of more than 17,000 \nemployees compared to fiscal year 2010. In that same year agencies \nreported that bargaining unit employees spent nearly 3.4 million hours \non official time--an increase of nearly 10 percent compared to the \nprevious year. How much money are we talking about, and why should \nAmerican taxpayers shoulder the entire burden if the official time is \nonly for union work?\n  Some may wonder what this has to do with the VA scandal. I don't \nthink it is a coincidence that the VA--which is plagued by \nincompetence, dishonesty, and bureaucratic ineptitude--utilizes the \npractice of official time more than any other Federal agency, according \nto OPM. In 2011 the VA reported paying out nearly 1 million hours in \nofficial time--an increase of more than 23 percent over the previous \nyear. The cost of official time in 2011 amounted to nearly $43 million. \nThat is $43 million paid out to VA ``employees'' to do union work full \ntime. Wall Street Journal Editorial Board writer Kimberley Strassel \nnoted a few weeks back:\n\n       The VA boasts one of the largest federal workforces, and VA \n     Secretary Eric Shinseki bragged in 2010 that two-thirds of it \n     is unionized. That's a whopping 200,000 union members, \n     represented by the likes of the American Federation of \n     Government Employees and the Service Employees International \n     Union.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  Union supporters often lament that under Federal law Federal employee \nunions are relatively toothless, especially when compared to the very \npowerful State employee unions. However, as Ms. Strassel noted, given \nits size and influence, the VA union may be an exception to that rule.\n  Once again, two-thirds of the VA workforce is unionized, and the \nagency has paid more than $40 million in salaries to full-time union \nworkers in a single year. That has to have an impact on the VA's \nefficiency. And that is for workers who don't even work--except for the \nunion.\n  Obviously, the inefficiency of the VA has recently been the subject \nof a very high-profile public debate. However, the impact unions have \nhad on the VA's operation was being talked about well before news of \nthe recent scandal broke. For example, Senators Portman and Coburn sent \na letter to former VA Secretary Shinseki in 2013 noting that the vast \nmajority of VA employees on official time were trained nurses, \ninstrument technicians, pharmacists, dental assistants, or therapists. \nIn other words, these were employees hired specifically to fulfill \nroles in direct support of veterans. Yet, instead of caring for \nveterans, processing claims, and helping to eliminate the horrendous \nbacklog, these employees were being paid to do union work full time--\nall at the expense of taxpayers. On top of that, union-negotiated work \nrules over things such as seniority and job classification have \ncontributed to the bureaucratic nightmare at the VA. In addition, the \nunions have been the most vocal opponents of any reform proposals that \nwould give veterans access to outside health care.\n  While it may be overstating the unions' influence to assign to them \nthe blame for the entire VA scandal, it is clear that these unions have \nat least contributed to the problems we are now seeing at the agency. \nThey are at least partially to blame for the backlog in veterans' \nclaims. They are at least partially to blame for the failed VA \nbureaucracy. They are at least partially to blame for the failure of \nreasonable attempts to reform the agency in the past, and it is almost \nimpossible to reform it the way it is currently run.\n  I wish I could say this problem is isolated at the VA. Unfortunately, \nthere is at least one other scandal-plagued agency with a similar union \nproblem. I am talking, of course, about the IRS.\n  We are all pretty familiar with the IRS targeting scandal. By its own \nadmission, the agency was targeting Tea Party groups in the runup to \nthe elections in both 2010 and 2012.\n  Like the VA, the IRS consists of a heavily unionized workforce. About \n66 percent of IRS employees belong to the National Treasury Employees \nUnion, or NTEU.\n  It shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that the NTEU is extremely \nactive in politics, having twice endorsed President Obama. During the \n2010 election cycle, when the IRS first began targeting conservative \ngroups, the NTEU raised over $600,000 through its PAC, almost all of \nwhich went to Democrats. In the next election, in 2012, the NTEU PAC \nraised more than $700,000, 94 percent of which went to Democrats. In \nother words, during the same campaign cycles in which the IRS was \ntargeting conservative organizations--organizations that were critical \nof the President, his administration, and in many cases the IRS \nitself--for harassment and extra scrutiny, the union that represents \nnearly two-thirds of IRS employees was busy raising and donating well \nover $1 million to Democratic candidates. And we wonder why the IRS--\nwhich should not be partisan in any way, shape, or form--is filled with \npartisanship. We should not have unions at the IRS or at the VA. Is it \nany surprise that the agency found itself predisposed toward harming \nconservative organizations or their causes?\n  Of course, the IRS has its own issues with the practice of paying out \nofficial time. Indeed, as of 2011 there were at least 200 IRS employees \nworking full time for their union--all at taxpayers' expense. In that \nsame year, the agency paid out more than 625,000 hours of official \ntime. The total cost of these union activities was roughly around $27 \nmillion. But that is only the beginning. That is $27 million in a \nsingle year paid\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\nto ``employees'' of the Federal Government who did nothing but union \nwork. That is simply preposterous.\n  As I said, if the American people understood that this type of \nfleecing of the taxpayers goes on every day, they would be outraged.\n  Current law allows most Federal employees to be represented by a \nunion. There are, however, some exceptions--and good reasons for these \nexceptions. Most of these exceptions are for agencies that perform a \nnational security function or other highly sensitive work. One would \nthink the IRS would fit in that category. One would think the VA would \nfit in that category. For example, we don't allow employees at the FBI, \nthe CIA, or the Secret Service to be unionized. There is good reason \nfor that: We don't need partisan political activities in those \nagencies. But we don't need them in the IRS or the Veterans' \nAdministration either. We also don't allow employees at the GAO or the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority to unionize.\n  In days to come, Congress is going to have to take a hard look at \nreforming both the Veterans' Administration and the IRS. One of the \nquestions we are going to have to ask ourselves is whether these \nagencies, with their important and sensitive missions and their poor \nperformance in the recent past, should be added to the list of agencies \nnot permitted to unionize, not permitted to be partisan. And anybody \nwho doesn't understand that doesn't understand anything about politics.\n  In addition, as we continually look for ways to improve the \nefficiency of our government, we will need to examine the overall \npractice of official time and determine whether it should be eliminated \nentirely. I, for one, don't believe taxpayers ought to be footing the \nbill for union work. I think the majority of the American people, if \ngiven an opportunity to fully understand this practice and the abuse it \nentails, would agree with me.\n  One thing is for sure: If what we have seen at the VA and the IRS is \nin any way representative of the influence unions have on government \nagencies, drastic changes are going to be necessary. How can any \nAmerican citizen feel the IRS is above politics when it is run by a \nunion? And we all know that unions support almost 100 percent one party \nover the other. How can we feel the VA is going to be handled right \nwhen it has a union representing it and determining all the workloads?\n  I have talked to the IRS Commissioners since I have been on the \nFinance Committee, and they admit that to try to correct or punish an \nIRS employee who is out of control and not doing what is right takes \nupward of a year if you are lucky. That is why there are all kinds of \npolitics in these agencies and they act with impunity in advancing what \nreally are liberal causes.\n  If there are any two agencies that should not have unions in them, \none ought to be the IRS and the other ought to be the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  I was raised in the union movement. I learned a trade. I went through \na formal apprenticeship program, and I became a journeyman. I am proud \nof that. I believe unions have a place in our society, but they have \nbecome more and more partisan. It is reported that 40 percent of union \nmembers are Republicans. Yet almost 100 percent of every dime that is \ngiven in politics is given to Democrats. So by any measure we have to \nsay that these folks are partisan, which I think is their right. But \nshould we have partisan control of agencies such as the IRS, which \neverybody has to deal with at one time or another in their life, and \nthe Veterans' Administration, which is in dire jeopardy right now \nbecause of the way it is being run?\n  I have been very much trying to do a straightforward investigation of \nthe IRS and these accusations that have been thrown at it, many of \nwhich are true. The more I get into it, the more I realize it is being \nrun in a partisan way for one party when it should be run in a \nnonpartisan way--for neither party. I am going to do something about \nit, and I hope the American people pay attention to it because I think \nmost people, including younger Members, would be outraged to know that \nthere is partisanship at these agencies that is not just average \npartisanship. It is blatant partisanship. The more I get into it, the \nmore I realize that is true.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Wall Street Journal article that I previously referred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 29, 2014]\n\n                       Big Labor's VA Choke Hold\n\n                       (By Kimberley A. Strassel)\n\n       We know with certainty that there is at least one person \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs is serving well. That \n     would be the president of local lodge 1798 of the National \n     Federation of Federal Employees.\n       The Federal Labor Relations Authority, the agency that \n     mediates federal labor disputes, earlier this month ruled in \n     favor of this union president, in a dispute over whether she \n     need bother to show up at her workplace--the Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center in Martinsburg, W.Va. According to FLRA \n     documents, this particular VA employee is 100% ``official \n     time''--D.C. parlance for federal employees who work every \n     hour of every work day for their union, at the taxpayer's \n     expense.\n       In April 2012, this, ahem, VA ``employee'' broke her ankle \n     and declared that she now wanted to do her nonwork for the VA \n     entirely from the comfort of her home. Veterans Affairs \n     attempted a compromise: Perhaps she could, pretty please, \n     come in two days a week? She refused, and complained to the \n     FLRA that the VA was interfering with her right to act as a \n     union official. The VA failed to respond to the complaint in \n     the required time (perhaps too busy caring for actual \n     veterans) and so the union boss summarily won her case.\n       The VA battle is only just starting, but any real reform \n     inevitably ends with a fight over organized labor. Think of \n     it as the federal version of Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and \n     other states where elected officials have attempted to rein \n     in the public-sector unions that have hijacked government \n     agencies for their own purpose. Fixing the VA requires first \n     breaking labor's grip, and the unions are already girding for \n     that fight.\n       Federal labor unions are generally weak by comparison to \n     state public-sector unions, though the VA might be an \n     exception. The VA boasts one of the largest federal \n     workforces and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki bragged in 2010 \n     that two-thirds of it is unionized. That's a whopping 200,000 \n     union members, represented by the likes of the American \n     Federation of Government Employees and the Service Employees \n     International Union. And this is government-run health care--\n     something unions know a lot about from organizing health \n     workers in the private sector. Compared with most D.C. unions \n     (which organize for better parking spots) the VA houses a \n     serious union shop.\n       The Bush administration worked to keep federal union \n     excesses in check; Obama administration officials have viewed \n     contract ``negotiations'' as a way to reward union allies. \n     Federal unions can't bargain for wages or benefits, but the \n     White House has made it up to them.\n       Manhattan Institute scholar Diana Furchtgott-Roth recently \n     detailed Office of Personnel Management numbers obtained \n     through a Freedom of Information Act request by Rep. Phil \n     Gingrey (R., Ga.). On May 25, Ms. Furchtgott-Roth reported on \n     MarketWatch that the VA in 2012 paid 258 employees to be 100 \n     percent ``full-time,'' receiving full pay and benefits to do \n     only union work. Seventeen had six-figure salaries, up to \n     $132,000. According to the Office of Personnel Management, \n     the VA paid for 988,000 hours of ``official'' time in fiscal \n     2011, a 23 percent increase from 2010.\n       Moreover, as Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Tom Coburn \n     (R., Okla.) noted in a 2013 letter to Mr. Shinseki, the vast \n     majority of these ``official'' timers were nurses, instrument \n     technicians pharmacists, dental assistants and therapists, \n     who were being paid to do union work even as the VA tried to \n     fill hundreds of jobs and paid overtime to other staff.\n       As for patient-case backlogs, the unions have helped in \n     their creation. Contract-negotiated work rules over job \n     classifications and duties and seniorities are central to the \n     ``bureaucracy'' that fails veterans. More damaging has been \n     the union hostility to any VA attempt to give veterans access \n     to alternative sources of care--which the unions consider a \n     direct job threat. The American Federation of Government \n     Employees puts out regular press releases blasting any \n     ``outsourcing'' of VA work to non-VA-union members.\n       The VA scandal is now putting an excruciating spotlight on \n     the most politically sensitive agency in D.C., and the unions \n     are worried about where this is headed. They watched in alarm \n     as an overwhelming 390 House members--including 160 \n     Democrats--voted on May 21 to give the VA more power to fire \n     senior executives, a shot over the rank-and-file's bow. They \n     watched in greater alarm as Mr. Shinseki said the VA would be \n     letting more veterans seek care at private facilities in \n     areas where the department's capacity is limited.\n       This is a first step toward a reform being drafted by Sens. \n     Coburn, John McCain (R., Ariz.) and Richard Burr (R., N.C.), \n     which would give veterans a card allowing them health \n     services at facilities of their choosing. The union fear is \n     that Democrats, in a tough election year, will be pressured \n     toward reforms that break labor's VA stronghold.\n       Not surprisingly, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), chairman \n     of the Veterans Affairs Committee, has promised his own \n     ``reform.'' Odds\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\n     are it will echo the unions' call to simply throw more money \n     at the problem. Any such bill should be viewed as Democrats \n     once again putting the interests of their union allies ahead \n     of veterans.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, last week our Nation commemorated the \n70th anniversary of D-day. Leo Scheer of Huntington County, IN, is one \nof those courageous veterans who survived the outlying assault on the \nbeaches of Normandy, and last month he made the trip to Washington, DC, \nthrough the Honor Flight Network to receive a hero's welcome from a \ngrateful Nation.\n  My office had the honor of greeting Leo and this group of heroes upon \ntheir arrival to the World War II Memorial, and Leo made an \nunforgettable impression with his humility, demeanor, and strength of \ncharacter. Leo is a member of what we have come to know as the \n``greatest generation.'' They easily deserve that title, where duty \ncomes as second nature, where braggadocio is not present, where simply \nstanding up and serving your country in a time of crisis is responded \nto overwhelmingly without complaint and with true honor and dignity.\n  Sadly, there are a dwindling number of those not only who arrived on \nthe shores of D-day in Normandy but those who served throughout the \nworld's largest military conflict in history. While those great service \nmen and women are still here to share their stories--at least a few--we \nmust remember the sacred promise that we as a Nation made to them to \ngive them the care they deserve when they come back home.\n  As a veteran myself, my hope is that our Nation will carry out this \npromise not only to our World War II vets but to all who have served in \nconflicts from that point forward--from Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other places. We must live up to the promise for all \nwho were called to serve and answered that call.\n  Regrettably, in recent months we have seen this promise broken and \nshattered. Just this week an internal audit by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs revealed that the department's problems have affected \n76 percent of VA facilities. Nearly 100,000 veterans continue to wait \nfor medical appointments. These are staggering figures.\n  In my home State of Indiana confirmed audit findings show that \nveterans endured unacceptably long wait times. Some Hoosier veterans \nnever even received an appointment. This is unacceptable. That is why \ntoday I stand here to support the bipartisan Sanders-McCain veterans \nbill that would implement key changes to the existing VA health care \nsystem.\n  This is not a perfect bill, and there are parts of it that I wish \nwere different. I hope that we can manage some needed changes as it \nmoves over to the House of Representatives and then to conference. I \nhope the final bill will make our veterans proud and begin the process \nof reform that the VA so desperately needs.\n  Let me address three key reforms in this legislation that I think are \nessential to moving forward and the primary reason why I have agreed to \nsupport this. First, giving veterans more choices in care--perhaps the \nmost important provision in this legislation--is allowing veterans who \ncannot be scheduled within a reasonable time the option to receive care \nfrom non-VA facilities or private sector facilities outside of the VA. \nThis also applies to veterans that reside more than 40 miles away from \na VA facility, many of them not in a condition to be able to secure the \ntransportation they need for that care, so they don't have to endure \nlong drives to get care. We must ensure that veterans receive timely \ncare, and if the VA cannot provide it, then our veterans should be free \nto go elsewhere for care, including Medicare providers.\n  Second, the removal of bad actors--there are a lot of good people \nworking at VA. Their hearts are in the right place. They are talented \nand provide good care and good service. I don't mean to demean their \ncontributions to veterans' health care, but we do know that there have \nbeen mistakes, mismanagement, and there has been some outright fraud, \nit appears. We will have to prosecute that. This reform would authorize \nthe Secretary of the VA to demote or fire senior executive service \nemployees based on their performance. That is not present now, and if \nwe are going to change the management it takes more than just asking \nthe first top person to resign as has happened. We need to look at the \nmanagement team and those that oversee those that are providing the \ncare and what their responsibility is in that role. Passage here would \nshake up the leadership of the VA so those people can be held \naccountable for their actions.\n  The third provision I want to mention is providing more VA locations. \nIt is clear that some of our veterans have to travel very long \ndistances. Also it is clear that the facilities currently in place are \nshort of help and there are not enough to address the needs of the many \nveterans that are entering the system. So this bill would establish 26 \nnew VA medical facilities around the country. As I said, while this \nlegislation is not perfect, it is an important start but it should not \nand will not be the end of our work to live up to our promises to \nveterans.\n  Ultimately, as I stated before to our body of Senators, the VA needs \na change of culture. Too many bureaucrats view our veterans as a list \nof numbers rather than the heroes worthy of our very best care. We have \nto look at our veterans through a different lens, one that sees them \nclearly as defenders of our freedom and as the heroes they are.\n  We must continue to investigate and reform the culture within the VA \nand ensure that this crisis doesn't happen again. That is why I called \nfor an independent investigation. This bill authorizes the process of \nbeginning these independent evaluations. Also the committee has \nprovided additional funding to specifically allow the inspector general \nto conduct an independent investigation into the VA, and I join my many \ncolleagues to ask the Department of Justice to join in this \ninvestigation. Now, unfortunately, this culture of indifference at the \nVA is not new. For years veterans have faced excessively long waits for \ndisability claims. When I returned to the Senate in 2011, these waits \nwere over 600 days in Indianapolis. Veterans were waiting over 2 years \nto have their claims adjudicated. Once we shined a light on the \nproblem, the situation improved somewhat, but our veterans still face \nwaits that are far too long both for medical visits and to receive \ntheir disability benefits.\n  My staff in Indianapolis currently have over 550 active cases that we \nare working on for Hoosier veterans who are seeking help and have not \ngotten satisfactory responses from the VA. So they call us and say: Can \nyou help? We do everything that we can to help expedite the process. In \nmany cases these veterans are just trying to assess the benefits that \nthey have rightfully earned and they just want an answer.\n  Reflecting on Leo Scheer's service to our Nation on D-day reminded me \nof the opportunity that I had to visit the beaches of Normandy while I \nwas Ambassador to Germany. It was, to say the least, a powerful and \nextremely emotional experience standing on the bluffs overlooking the \nspread of beaches from Utah to Omaha, and it made me reflect on the \ncountless lives lost in service to our Nation.\n  I was standing there on a perfectly calm day. The water was gently \nlapping on the shore. The beaches were empty. A soft warm breeze was \nblowing. The sun was shining--just a beautiful day--and I was \noverwhelmed by the violence that must have taken place that I could \nonly have imagined. We have all seen the movie ``Saving Private Ryan,'' \nand I give Mr. Spielberg great credit for making that a very realistic \npicture of what happens. But I don't think Hollywood, or those of us \nwho weren't there, could imagine the violence that was taking place on \nthat beach when our troops went ashore. The silence was not there. \nThere must have been a cacophony of noise with hundreds of ships \noffshore unloading our soldiers into landing vehicles. Many of them \nwere shot down by the German bunkers up in the bluffs, built-in \nconcrete fortifications--an almost impossible task. Many of them never \neven got out of their landing craft. When the doors opened, many were \nshot before they reached the water. The water was red with the blood \nfrom our soldiers who never\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nmade it to the beach. The beach was littered with bodies of those who \nnever made it to the edge of the cliff. And the sacrifice that was made \nin climbing those cliffs and getting to those German bunkers took many, \nmany hundreds if not thousands of more lives.\n  So visiting the graves of soldiers afterwards, pausing to say a \nprayer of gratitude for their sacrifice leads us to this point where we \nhave to understand what it is we are trying to provide and why we need \nto provide it. That is in a response to those who put their lives on \nthe line and sacrificed those lives--and many ended up with lifelong \ndisabilities--a commitment to those that we would take care of them \nwhen they came back.\n  They have come back and run into a government-run bureaucracy that \nhas run amuck. If it proves anything, it proves that government just \nsimply doesn't do big stuff very well, without confusion, without \nbureaucracy, without duplication, without excessive costs. It is not \nefficient and not effective, nowhere near what the private sector can \noffer. That is why there is the provision for veterans who cannot get \ncare at the VA on a timely basis to have the opportunity to use our \nprivate system.\n  They deserve our utmost care. They served on the frontline, but when \nthey go for benefit decisions and when they go for health care, they \nare not in the front of the line, they are at the back of the line, and \nthat is not right.\n  We cannot let the sun set today, and I am glad we are not, because we \nare voting to move this legislation forward. In doing so we are going \nto make a statement that we are going to try to live up to that promise \nand do the best that we possibly can. As I said, as a veteran I expect \nmy country to fulfill the promises to my fellow service men and women, \nand as a Senator I will seek to hold the Veterans' Administration \naccountable and to do everything I can to help in the reform of the \nsystem. That reform is so desperately needed.\n  The leader of the D-day effort, GEN Dwight D. Eisenhower called the \ninvasion of Normandy ``a fight in which we would accept nothing less \nthan full victory.'' It is in that spirit that I call upon my Senate \ncolleagues to immediately take up and pass this legislation on behalf \nof our veterans and then to continue the work of changing the culture \nof the VA so that we don't have to come back years from now and repeat \nthis process all over again.\n  Let's get it right this time. The fight to restore trust to our \nveterans is one we are waging, and to paraphrase General Eisenhower, we \nshould accept nothing less than victory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Indiana for his \nremarks about our military service men and women and our obligation to \nprovide them the care they have earned for their service. I look \nforward to voting, along with everyone in this Chamber, on this \nbipartisan legislation this afternoon, which represents the first \nstep--not the last step but the first step--toward the systemic \nfailures that have been disclosed as a result of the comprehensive VA \naudit.\n  I come to the floor to speak again about a growing humanitarian \ncrisis in South Texas, the State I represent, where authorities are \nstruggling with waves of unaccompanied minors--children--coming through \nMexico into the United States. The numbers are pretty staggering. So \nfar 47,000 minors have been detained at the southwestern border since \nOctober. The Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol estimate \nthat there could be as many as 60,000 unaccompanied minors, mostly from \nCentral America. If we look at the map from Guatemala City to McAllen, \nTX, it is roughly 1,200 miles.\n  Unfortunately, this influx is a direct consequence of the perception \nthat this administration will not enforce our immigration laws. \nInterviews with more than 200 of the migrants who comprise some of \nthese individuals confirm their impression, which is reinforced by \nCentral American news media outlets--primarily newspapers--that if \nchildren can get to the United States, they will have a free ticket and \nbe able to stay.\n  We had a chance to question and discuss this humanitarian crisis with \nSecretary Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, this morning \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, and to his credit, he has taken an all-\nhands-on-deck attitude, but the truth is the Federal Government's \nresources are overwhelmed by this humanitarian crisis.\n  By creating a powerful incentive for people to come to the United \nStates illegally, we have effectively encouraged children and their \nparents to make a treacherous and threatening journey from Central \nAmerica, one of the most dangerous parts of the world today, through \nMexico--large swaths of Mexico are controlled by drug cartels--and then \nall the way into Texas.\n  Secretary Johnson conceded this morning that somehow we are \nschizophrenic about this issue. When we look at the victims of human \ntrafficking and other people, we all agree we need to do more on a \nbipartisan basis to deal with this scourge of human trafficking, but \nthe fact is that the transnational criminal organizations--trafficking \npeople for economic reasons, such as for sex, drugs, and weapons--will \ndo anything for money. They are criminals, and that is what they do.\n  Unfortunately, we have a lot of innocent children who are now being \nswept up in this humanitarian crisis, as I said, committed by their \nparents to take this trek across Mexico into the United States. We have \nno idea how many children start that journey and how many simply drop \noff along the way because they have been kidnapped, injured, murdered \nor perhaps they just become ill as a result of exposure and die during \nthis long trek.\n  It is a journey that often begins in cities, towns, and villages \nscattered throughout Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The first \nmajor checkpoint is the Mexican border with Guatemala. It is about 500 \nmiles long. Before arriving there, many families and children pass \nthrough regions of northern Guatemala that are controlled by the Zetas \ncartel, one of the most violent criminal organizations in the world.\n  When they reach Mexico, many illegal immigrants jump onto a network \nof freight trains known by the ominous nickname ``The Beast.''\n  I encourage anyone who is listening to me to go online and Google or \nBing or use some other search engine and type in ``The Beast'' and read \nsome of the horrific stories about transportation from southern Mexico \nup to northern Mexico on The Beast. NPR, National Public Radio, \nrepeatedly reported The Beast train is ``just as likely to spit them \nout as it is to shepherd them safely to the border.''\n  Indeed, people riding on The Beast are frequently robbed, raped or \nkilled by the drug traffickers and gang members who control the \nsmuggling corridors. This is organized criminal activity by \ntransnational criminal organizations. As one former Beast passenger \ntold CNN, ``almost everyone gets assaulted.''\n  If there is anybody who thinks illegal immigration and trafficking \ninvolves some sort of benign experience of traveling from a country \nwhere people don't have an opportunity to a country where people do \nhave an opportunity, that part is true, but what they don't tell you is \nthe horrific, life-threatening, and sometimes life-destroying \nexperience of getting to the United States because people are \ncommitting themselves to the tender mercies of some of the most violent \ncriminal organizations on the planet.\n  In recent years, Mexican authorities have discovered mass graves \ncontaining the bodies of Central American migrants--those who did not \nmake it to our southern border. Among those who are not murdered by the \ncartels, many passengers on The Beast simply fall off the train. For \nexample, they try to jump on it while it is moving. If they are lucky, \nthey might just end up with a few broken bones, but if they are not \nlucky, they might end up losing a limb or being crushed to death \nunderneath its wheels.\n  In short, no one should be traveling to the United States this way \nand least of all young children, some of whom, according to published \nnewspaper reports, are as young as 3 and 5 years old. Can any parent \ncomprehend the idea of a 3- or 5-year-old coming unaccompanied or \nperhaps en masse with drug cartels and criminal organizations \ntransporting them from their home country to the United States?\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\n  The Border Patrol reported that 180 convicted sex offenders have been \narrested since October while coming across the southwestern border. Can \nyou imagine this trip with convicted sex offenders mixed into the mass \nof humanity coming across the border?\n  Some children who ride The Beast are kidnapped or forced to become \ndrug mules or forced into sexual slavery. In fact, some who make it all \nthe way to Texas and north remain prisoners of organized crime after \ncrossing the U.S. border.\n  I remember talking to one young woman. About 1 year ago I had the \nchance to visit with her. She came from Central America. She was \nbrought by a coyote, they called him--a human smuggler--into Houston, \nTX. She had family in New Jersey, but that didn't work out, so she came \nback to Houston where she was essentially held as an indentured servant \nand prostituted and forced to turn over the proceeds of that money to \nthe coyote--the smuggler.\n  When people operate in the shadows of the law, they have no \nprotection of the law, and the people who are the most likely to get \nhurt are the immigrants themselves or certainly the immigrant \ncommunity. We need to keep that in mind. We have to remember that \nMexico's biggest and most violent drug cartels are heavily involved in \nthis trafficking, as I mentioned earlier.\n  Time magazine reported last year: ``Cartels control most of Mexico's \nsmuggling networks through which victims are moved, while they also \ntake money from pimps and brothels operating in their territories.''\n  The cartels, gangs, and sex traffickers are only too happy to prey on \nthe poor, vulnerable migrants, including children, transiting through \ntheir terrain. Experts believe the Mexican drug cartels may earn as \nmuch as $10 billion a year from sex trafficking and sex slavery alone. \nThese are not nice people.\n  According to Amnesty International: ``Some human rights organizations \nand academics estimate that as many as six in 10 women and girl''--and \none-quarter of these unaccompanied minors are girls--``migrants \nexperience sexual violence during the journey'' through Mexico--6 out \nof 10.\n  A new CRS--Congressional Research Service--memo reports that based on \napprehension data provided by Customs and Border Protection, ``there \nhas been an increase in the number of [accompanied alien children] who \nare girls and the number of [unaccompanied alien children] who under \nthe age of 13.''\n  They are not exactly able to defend themselves against the \nmonstrosities they encounter along the way.\n  I hope it is clear to everyone listening and to the President and \nevery other person of good will, that we should be doing everything \npossible to discourage people from risking their lives in the first \nplace, and especially their children's lives, on such a dangerous \njourney.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I happened to be the Attorney General of \nTexas, and before that I had a career in law and the judiciary. It is \nstandard criminal jurisprudence that not only should law enforcement \nenforce the laws in order to maintain the law, but the law serves \nanother important function; that is, deterrence.\n  In other words, it stops people from doing things they know they \nshould not do in the first place rather than just catching them after \nthey do it. This is one of the elements that is missing and \nunfortunately was encouraged by the impression that you got a free \nticket if all you had to do was get on the train and show up in South \nTexas. As I have said, this is very dangerous stuff, and it has \nbackfired in unexpected ways.\n  Yesterday, I listed five simple suggestions to the President that he \ncould take to start fixing the problem. I was glad to hear Secretary \nJohnson talk about some of the ad hoc measures he has begun to \nimplement, but the truth is they are struggling to catch up.\n  I urged the President, No. 1, to publicly declare that his 2012 \ndeferred action program will not apply to children currently arriving \nat the border. Let me stop there to say that this morning some of my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee could not resist the temptation \nto take a partisan shot. They said if the House had just passed \nimmigration reform, this never would have happened.\n  My point is the President's deferred action program doesn't even \napply to these children, so it is still against the law for them to \nenter. But they realize, as a practical matter, although the resources \nand capacity of the Federal Government are overwhelmed, there is no way \nwe can turn them back, and they will have to be handled compassionately \nand in a humane sort of way.\n  It would help if, No. 1, the President would make clear he has not \nissued a free ticket to anyone who wants to enter the country \nillegally.\n  No. 2, I encouraged him to publicly discourage people from attempting \nthe journey through Mexico, and it would help if our Mexican \ncounterparts would do a better job--maybe with our help and \nassistance--securing their southern border, since that would stop a lot \nof people from coming from Central America through Mexico on this \ndangerous journey which I have tried to describe.\n  I also encouraged the President to enforce all of our immigration \nlaws regardless of political needs or any frustration he might feel or \nanyone else might feel on the current stalemate in which we find \nourselves. Sometimes these things take a little time.\n  My hope is, if not before, then by next year, Congress--the Senate \nand the House--can begin to move a series of smaller pieces of \nlegislation that are more transparent, consensus based, and begin to \nrepair the broken immigration system. I don't think anybody believes on \nthe right or the left that the status quo is acceptable, and indeed it \nis dangerous to the people I have described.\n\n  So I mentioned the fourth item, which is to work with the Mexican \nGovernment to improve security at the border with Guatemala. I was \nrecently in Juarez, Mexico, right across the river from El Paso, which \nused to be one of the most dangerous places on the planet because of \nall of the conflict between the drug cartels. Things are getting \nbetter. It is still pretty rough, but things are getting better thanks \nto strong leaders, such as the mayor, whom I met with there, and thanks \nto the assistance the U.S. Government is providing through the Merida \nInitiative to help train law enforcement and to provide equipment and \nthe like. So we could step up our work with the Mexican Government to \nhelp them secure their own southern border, which would eliminate more \nthan half of this migration from Central America.\n  Finally, I urge the President to take the step of making sure that \nTexas and other U.S. border States and communities have the resources \nthey need to address the ongoing crisis.\n  Today I reiterate those calls, and I also call on the President to \nplease act as soon as possible. Make no mistake. The actions we take \nand sometimes the actions we don't take have unintended consequences. \nBut in the days and weeks ahead, there will be life-or-death \nconsequences to an untold number of vulnerable children, perhaps in the \nmisperception that they can come to the United States if they can just \nget here, without understanding the treacherous journey that will \nbefall them. We are doing no one a service by allowing that.\n  Because the impression created by the President has resulted in this \nproblem, at least in substantial part, I believe he has the unique \nauthority and power to begin to fix it. But first he will have to send \nthe message that I mentioned a moment ago, which is that there is no \nfree ticket into the United States. We have to deal with the \nhumanitarian crisis of these children and make sure they are safe, but \nthen we need to get about the business of enforcing our laws and not \njust giving the impression that anybody and everybody who wants to come \nto the United States can come here.\n  Perhaps in a perfect world everybody could live in America. But the \nfact is that we need to have our immigration laws for our protection \nand for the protection of legal immigrants. We need to do everything we \ncan to send a message that we are a caring country, but we are also a \ncountry that believes in the rule of law. We need to restore order out \nof this chaos, while dealing with the immediate humanitarian crisis of \nthis wave of children that is overwhelming the capability of the \nFederal Government to deal with it. We need to do everything we can \ntogether to address all of these issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas just spoke on the \nfloor about the number of children coming across the border into the \nUnited States, and the numbers are frightening, they are so large.\n  We had a hearing today with Jeh Johnson, who is the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. A lot of questions were asked, such as \nif actions by our government or statements by our President are luring \nthese children into the United States. Let me make the record clear. \nThere is nothing--nothing--about the President's Executive order \ninvolving those we call DREAMers--children brought to the United \nStates--which would lead any of these families of the children to \nbelieve they could qualify to be treated as qualified for docket--that \nis, deferred deportation--because they would be eligible DREAMers. \nNone--none--of these children would be eligible, period. So the \nsuggestion that this Executive order has anything to do with luring \nthese children to the United States is wrong.\n  Second, there is turmoil in Mexico and Central America. That is a \nfact. I am sure that is a factor in decisions being made by some to \nleave. But there is an issue that has been overlooked here time and \nagain which needs to be addressed. There is a Pulitzer Prize-winning \nbook entitled ``Enrique's Journey.'' The author is an L.A. Times writer \nnamed Sonia Nazario. She started following the paths of children--\nchildren--coming into the United States from Mexico and Central America \nand even South America. Here is what she found after her investigation: \n48,000 children a year coming across the border into the United States, \nsome as young as 7 years old, half of them without any escort. How do \nthey get in? Well, many of them jump on freight trains. Can my \ncolleagues imagine, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-year-olds jumping on a freight train \nto come into the United States, trying to get here by themselves--half \nof them by themselves? Why? Seventy-five percent gave the same reason: \nTo find my mother. To find my father.\n  That is what is bringing so many of them into the United States. What \nhappened? Mother left that village in Mexico or somewhere in Central \nAmerica and came to the United States. She works hard now and sends \nmoney home and occasionally will send toys at birthdays and Christmas \nand exchange photographs. And heartbroken children get on these trains \nand try to find them.\n  They found a 9-year-old boy walking around Los Angeles. They asked \nhim why and where he was going. He said: Where is San Francisco? He was \ntrying to find his mother.\n  That is the reality and the heartbreak of what is happening at our \nborder when it comes to children, so many times over. The lucky ones \nmake it. Many don't. A survey done by the University of Houston found \nover and over these kids on their way are starving, they are beaten, \nthey are robbed, they are raped over and over. Some are pushed off of \nthe train. Some die. Some are maimed. That is the reality.\n  What does it tell us? As we step back and look at this, what does it \ntell us? It tells us what we already know: Our immigration system in \nAmerica is broken. It is flat-out broken. I know this, and everyone \nelse does too. Twelve million people living amongst us, some of whom \nhave been here for decades, worried about being deported tomorrow, with \na household where the wife and mother may be a citizen, the children \nmay all be citizens, but one person in the household is not--that is \nour broken immigration system.\n  Well, Congress, stop talking about it. Do something about it. So we \ndid. We did. And the Presiding Officer was here. It was a little over a \nyear ago. We put together a bipartisan coalition of Senators--four \nDemocrats, four Republicans, and I was one of them--and we sat down and \nfor months worked out comprehensive immigration reform to finally fix \nthis broken immigration system and start to end some of the tragedies \nwe know are happening to children and to their parents all across \nAmerica. We worked on it for months.\n\n  It was a pretty interesting coalition. It included John McCain, a \nwell-known Republican Senator from Arizona; Lindsey Graham, Republican \nSenator from South Carolina; Marco Rubio, a Republican Senator from \nFlorida; Jeff Flake, a Republican Senator from Arizona; and on our \nside, Chuck Schumer of New York, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Michael \nBennet of Colorado, and myself.\n  We worked on it for months, and we produced a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill that was endorsed by virtually every major \nlabor organization and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. We go through the \nlist of virtually every religion in America, and major religions \nendorsed it. It was an amazing bipartisan product, and I was proud to \nbe a part of it and even more proud when the day came that we passed it \non the floor of the Senate with 68 votes--Republicans and Democrats. We \ndid it.\n  What happened to it? We sent it to the U.S. House of Representatives, \nwhere it has languished for over a year. For over a year they have \nrefused to call this bill.\n  Now Senators who come to the floor, who voted against the reform, who \ndon't acknowledge the obvious--that the Republican House will not even \ncall this bill for debate and a vote--and who criticize the current \nimmigration system in America, aren't telling us the whole story. The \nwhole story is that we need to fix this system top to bottom--yes, a \npath to citizenship but a path to citizenship that eliminates those \nwith serious criminal records--we don't want them--makes those who want \nto enter this path pay a fine and learn English and make sure as well \nthat they are paying their taxes to our country. Then we will put them \non a path to citizenship, where they can be at the back of the line. \nUnder our bill, it would take a person 13 years before they become a \ncitizen. All that time they are paying their fines, they are learning \nEnglish, they are doing what they are supposed to do, and they are \nsubject to regular questioning as to any problems that might be in \ntheir lives that we should know about. That is what the bill does.\n  So when I hear people come to the floor and say this immigration \nsystem is broken, I agree completely. It is a tragedy to think \nthousands of children are crossing the border in search of their \nparents, as young as 7, 8, 9, 10 years old, and teenagers, being preyed \nupon.\n  I just had in my office the Ambassador of Ecuador to the United \nStates of America. We talked about this issue. She told me the story of \na 12-year-old girl whose mother and father were in New York, and this \nheartbroken girl decided she had to at any cost be reunited with them. \nShe jumped on one of those trains, and she was apprehended by Mexican \nauthorities. The parents found out about it and tried to find her. They \nput her in an orphanage. She was going through the Mexican legal \nsystem. The next thing: It was announced that this 12-year-old girl had \ncommitted suicide--questionable but still a tragedy. And this \nAmbassador from Ecuador said: I can't tell you what that did to our \ncountry. It broke our hearts to think that little girl was just trying \nto find her mom and dad.\n  We can do better. We can be better. All of the excuses in the world \ndon't count when it comes to this issue because we are a nation of \nimmigrants, my friends, all of us. We may have to go back several \ngenerations--in my case, not very far. My mother was an immigrant to \nthis country. I am lucky to be standing on the floor of the Senate \nrepresenting a great State such as Illinois. That is my story. That is \nmy family's story. That is America's story. That is who we all are.\n  Why can't we, in our generation, embrace the reality of immigration \nand fix this broken system, make sure we have security on the border to \nstop, as much as we physically can, the flow of illegal immigration, \nand make sure those who are here are reporting to our government so we \nknow who they are, where they are, and where they work? All of these \nthings will make us a better and stronger nation.\n  Let me tell my colleagues something else about these immigrant folks, \nand I speak with some authority. The first wave of immigrants to this \ncountry, by and large, take the toughest, hardest jobs available--\nanything--and they will work hard on those jobs. But they are also \nlooking over their shoulder at their kids and they are saying to their \nkids: We expect more from you. We\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\nwant you to stay in school. We want you to succeed.\n  That dynamic of the hard-working immigrant and the first-generation \nAmerican, striving to prove they can succeed, gives our country the \nenergy it needs. It gives our economy the energy it needs.\n  I see my friend has come to the floor, Senator McCain, and I \nmentioned his name earlier in a positive way because we worked together \nso closely on immigration reform. He has a special challenge I don't \nhave. Yes, we have many undocumented in Illinois, but being a border \nState, Arizona has tougher challenges than most. We tried in our bill \nto be sensitive to both States and all States in what we were putting \ntogether.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor and say a word about children coming \nacross the border. I see two of my colleagues here, and I will yield \nthe floor in just a second.\n  We need to acknowledge the obvious. These children are vulnerable. \nThey are being exploited. Many of them are being hurt. Some are being \nraped. Others are being killed. And that has to come to an end. To \nbring it to an end in a sensible, thoughtful, American way, we ought to \npass comprehensive immigration reform. No more excuses in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. Call the bill. For goodness' sake, call the \nbill. Debate it. Vote on it. I will accept whatever comes, but what I \nwon't accept is ignoring these problems, blaming them on someone else, \nand putting off to some time in the future the reality of the \nresponsibility we should face today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, as the son of an Air Force master \nsergeant and a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \ntake very seriously my responsibility to represent the interests of \nthose who have served our country in uniform. When it comes to our \nNation's veterans, their commitment to country is without question, and \nour country's commitment to them should be the same.\n  Put simply, our veterans deserve better. That is why I am pleased to \nsee that we have come together to address this crisis in the Senate. \nThese men and women have served and sacrificed on behalf of a grateful \nnation. We need to ensure that they are getting the high-quality \nservices they have earned. Our veterans deserve a system that proves \ntheir care is our top priority.\n  Unfortunately, the VA is struggling to meet the health demands for \nour veterans. The VA inspector general is currently investigating \nmisconduct throughout the VA health system. In order to ensure \naccountability, we have to give the VA the ability to fire and demote \nsenior executive service employees who are responsible for these types \nof abuses.\n  Under current law, senior VA employees are nearly untouchable. That \nmeans the very people responsible for hiding the true extent of wait \ntimes, for instance, and other abuses cannot be fired. That is \nincredible when you think about it.\n  We cannot tolerate bad actors who abuse their power and put our \nveterans in danger. That is why a key component of this bill gives the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to fire or demote senior VA \nemployees for poor performance.\n  Accountability is the goal here. However, that goes beyond individual \nemployees. The Department itself needs to be held accountable for its \nshortcomings. So it is time we shine a light on the VA.\n  This bill would also establish an electronic waiting list that would \nbe made available to veterans on the Department's Web site so everyone \ncan see the average waiting time for an appointment at each VA medical \ncenter for specific types of care and services. New wait time goals \nwould also be published on the Department's Web site and in the Federal \nRegister within 90 days of the bill's enactment.\n  Earlier this week we saw an audit which revealed that veterans \nseeking care for the first time waited an average of 60 days in the \nLittle Rock VA hospital and 52 days in the Fayetteville hospital. \nClearly, these results need to be improved and indicate the failure of \nthe VA to meet its goal of seeing new patients within 14 days.\n  I am committed to ensuring that the VA uses every available option it \nhas to deliver on its mission for all veterans who have earned this \ncare. And if it cannot, this bill gives our veterans the ability to \nseek that care elsewhere.\n  The bill we are considering today would establish a 2-year program \nthat allows veterans who have been unable to obtain care from the VA \nfor providing service to seek care from private providers. This option \nwould also be provided to those who live more than 40 miles from a VA \nfacility, including a community-based outpatient clinic. The government \nwould be obligated to reimburse the non-VA health care provider for the \nservices provided to the veteran.\n  Wait times and secret lists are not the only problem within the VA \nhealth system. We are learning now that quality-of-care issues on a \nrange of critical care outcomes, including mortality and infection \nrates, are willingly being ignored by senior VA management.\n  We need to restore faith in the VA health care system, and that \nbegins with accountability and following through with our promises.\n  The crisis surrounding the VA health care system shows an immediate \nneed to improve timely access to medical care for our veterans. The VA \nneeds to correct the systemic problems that are preventing our veterans \nfrom accessing the high-quality health care services offered.\n  I am pleased we are taking action on this important issue, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support this legislation before us because \nwe need to improve the health services our veterans earned and deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair welcomes the Senator from Arkansas \nback to the floor.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say that \nthis compromise is really an excellent example of what Congress can do \nwhen we work together to put our veterans first and work toward \nsubstantive solutions to the challenges they face.\n  Passing this legislation this afternoon is a critical step toward \naddressing some of the immediate accountability and transparency \nconcerns that are plaguing the VA and fixing its deep-seated structural \nand cultural challenges. Each new report seems to paint a more serious \nand more disturbing picture of the VA's systemwide failure to provide \ntimely access to care for our Nation's heroes. I am especially \nconcerned by the number of facilities that serve Washington State \nveterans that have been flagged for further review and investigation. \nThe VA has promised to get to the bottom of this, and I expect them to \ndo so immediately.\n  However, these new reports are not only consistent with what I hear \nso often from veterans and VA employees but also with what the \ninspector general and GAO have been reporting on for more than a \ndecade. These are not new problems, and Congress must continue to take \naction on them while addressing the inevitable issues that will be \nuncovered as ongoing investigations and reviews are completed.\n  I expect this Chamber to come together, as the House did yesterday--\ntwice, in fact--to move this bill forward so we can work on our \ndifferences with the House and send this legislation to the President's \ndesk as soon as possible.\n  As we all know, there are serious problems at the VA that will not be \nsolved through legislation alone or by simply replacing the Secretary. \nHowever, I am very hopeful these steps that are in this legislation \nwill spark long-overdue change--from the top down--in order to ensure \nthat our veterans are given the care and support they expect and \ndeserve.\n  So I wanted to come today to commend the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Vermont for their commitment to bipartisanship and putting \nthe needs of our veterans first. This is an important compromise, and I \nurge our colleagues to continue the bipartisan collaboration that made \nthis bill possible. Let's get it passed and in place so these reforms \ncan begin to get started. And then we must keep working to address the \nmanagement, resource, and personnel shortcomings that we all know exist \nat the VA.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of the veterans \nbill we are about to vote on as well. I commend everyone who worked on \nit on both sides of the aisle, certainly including Senator McCain, who \nwas here a minute ago, Senator Sanders, who is on the floor, and \nSenator Burr, who is the ranking Republican member of the committee.\n  I am strongly supporting it, mostly with three key provisions in \nmind--one I have been working on since well before this scandal and \nthis crisis that has engulfed the VA broke; that is, to dislodge, to \nget moving on crucial expanded VA outpatient clinics in 18 States \naround the country, including Louisiana. Mr. President, 26 clinics; 2 \nof those are in Louisiana, in Lafayette and Lake Charles. Those should \nhave been built by now. They have been on the books, they have been in \nthe VA plan for years. Through what the VA readily admits was a \nbureaucratic glitch--a complete screw-up at the VA--they were delayed \nfor a significant period of time.\n  There was another glitch in terms of the so-called scoring of these \nclinics. That required legislation, which the House passed. But that \nlegislation, which I was spearheading in the Senate, has been balled up \nin the Senate.\n  Finally, the corrective legislation, to get moving, to get these \nclinics done--including in Lafayette and Lake Charles, LA--is in this \nbill. So I have been committed to that for months--since well before \nthis scandal erupted.\n  The other two provisions I want to highlight in this bill do go \ndirectly to this scandal. One is the need to give veterans choice when \nthey are locked into a dysfunctional system. So for the first time ever \nwe are mandating the unparalleled choice that if a veteran is either \nover 40 miles from a VA facility or he or she cannot get care--an \nappointment--in a reasonable timeframe, then that veteran can go to a \nMedicare provider or another provider who is delineated in the bill to \nget the care he or she needs in a timely way. That is a really \nimportant reform to expand choice and really competition that I think \nwill make the VA system better and offer veterans, when need be, \nimportant care outside the strict VA system.\n  The third provision I wish to highlight is to give the leadership of \nthe VA the tools it needs to clean house, to get rid of incompetence \nor, worse, to fire people who clearly merit that in the cases we have \nbeen reading about in the last several months.\n  We have had so many protections heaped on the civil service system \nover 100-plus years that it has become virtually impossible to fire or \ndemote or punish someone who is deserving of that because of \nincompetence or worse. We need to change that because unless and until \nwe do, bureaucracies such as the VA will remain broken. This bill has \nimportant provisions in that regard.\n  Those are the three top reasons I will be strongly supporting the \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Massachusetts is the Bay State, but we are \nalso the ``Brave State.'' But being first in freedom is not enough if \nwe don't put our veterans, their families, and the families of the \nfallen first as well.\n  There are more than 388,000 veterans in Massachusetts. But too many \nof our bravest return home unable to find a job. They suffer from \nhomelessness, mental health, and substance abuse. Too often, they end \ntheir lives in suicide. Twenty-two veterans kill themselves every day.\n  This March, not one servicemember died in action in Afghanistan or \nIraq, but almost 700 veterans took their own lives. Of the 8,500 \nMassachusetts National Guard, six of them have committed suicide in the \nlast year and a half.\n  We need to treat these unseen wounds, and give our veterans a better \nlife, where they are employed, appreciated, and supported.\n  We have a sacred obligation to honor and care for our service men and \nwomen for their bravery and sacrifice.\n  On the battlefield, the military pledges to leave no soldier behind. \nAs a nation, we must ensure that when warriors return home, we leave no \nveteran behind.\n  In recent years, we have provided historic budget increases for \nveterans, expanded access to VA health care, improved health services \nfor all veterans, and modernized benefits earned by America's \nservicemembers.\n  But what is clear today is that hasn't been enough. The problems at \nthe VA are unacceptable and they dishonor our veterans and their \nfamilies who have sacrificed so much.\n  Anyone who contributed to the careless treatment of our veterans \nshould be held fully accountable, and I mean anyone.\n  And so our work must continue. We must address the emerging needs of \nveterans, as well as those needs that have lingered for years.\n  Our returning veterans, and those who served in previous wars, always \nshould get the best services, including medical care.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, is facing \na crisis. The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general reports \nshowed that thousands of veterans have been trying to see a doctor but \nwere never on the VA list to see a doctor. These veterans were \nforgotten and lost in the scheduling process. VA leadership \nsignificantly understated the time new patients waited for their \nprimary care appointment in their performance appraisals in part \nbecause that affected their bonuses and salary increases. Mr. \nPresident, 57,000 veterans have been waiting 90 days or more for their \nfirst VA appointment. Mr. President, 64,000 veterans have fallen \nthrough the cracks and have never received an appointment after \nenrollment.\n  These deficiencies at the VA are unacceptable.\n  What is clear is that we need a full-scale reform of how the VA does \nbusiness. Too many men and women are falling through the cracks. We \nneed to fully fund the VA and modernize the agency and its facilities \nto appropriately address the new needs of returning soldiers and their \nfamilies.\n  All veterans are heroes, but sometimes heroes need help.\n  The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and \nTransparency Act of 2014 allows the immediate firing of incompetent \nhigh-level officials who broke the trust of our veterans by leaving \nthem behind. It also includes appropriate provisions to prevent the \nabuse of these new powers.\n  The bill allows VA to lease 26 new medical facilities that would \nexpand access to care, including $4.8 million for the VA Worcester \ncommunity-based Outpatient Clinic.\n  It authorizes the hiring of new medical personnel for hospitals and \nclinics that are facing a shortage of doctors and other health \nprofessionals.\n  It would allow veterans living more than 40 miles from a VA hospital \nor clinic to go to a private doctor.\n  It develops an independent commission to update the VA's scheduling \nappointments process and another to help spur the construction of new \nVA facilities.\n  It would allow all recently separated veterans taking advantage of \nthe post-9/11 GI bill to get instate tuition at public colleges and \nuniversities. Finally, it would extend post-9/11 GI bill education \nbenefits to surviving spouses of veterans who have died in the line of \nduty.\n  This bill is an important first step to dealing with the crisis at \nthe VA. However, more needs to be done. We need to make sure the \nMassachusetts VA hospitals in Brockton, West Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, \nBedford, and Northampton can continue to provide the care that our \nveterans deserve, including the latest in health care for traumatic \nbrain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other injuries.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the 470,000 \nMaryland veterans in order to thank my colleagues for making veterans \nhealth care a priority by passing S. 2450, the Veterans' Access to Care \nthrough Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014. I \nspecifically applaud the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nSenator Sanders, and Senator John McCain for developing this bipartisan \nagreement and demonstrating to the Nation that the Congress can work \ntogether to meet our greatest challenges.\n  I want to thank President Obama and Acting Secretary Gibson for \ntaking preliminary action and holding senior Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA,\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\nleadership accountable. Now the hard work begins of renewing and \nmeeting our commitments to our veterans, who have sacrificed so much \nfor our Nation. I support this bill's efforts to provide immediate \nauthority to refer veterans to non-VA care and its provisions \naddressing commonsense long-term reform. Much of the treatment our \nveterans need is already provided in world-class facilities that are \ncloser to their homes than the nearest VA Hospital, and they stand \nready to support them today.\n  I am concerned that the expedited firing provision for Senior \nExecutive Service employees creates a separate process for VA staff \nemployee. Let me be clear: Anyone guilty of fraud, malfeasance or \ncriminal negligence must be held accountable. But current law and \nOffice of Personnel Management policy provide measures to address such \nacts. Federal employees deserve the appropriate due process.\n  This bill is an exceptional step in the right direction and will \nbegin to address some of the concerns we all have with respect to the \nVA, beginning with access to care. But there is still much work to do \nto help our veterans return to civilian life after they have served. A \nmere thank you is of little comfort to a veteran who cannot find \nmeaningful employment, who is struggling to provide for his or her \nfamily or who is dealing with post-traumatic stress. Their sacrifices \nare often made in stressful, frustrating, and dangerous conditions. Yet \nthese brave men and women do not shy away from committing themselves to \nserving our country.\n  Disability claims at the VA are continuing to take far too long to be \nprocessed, and the backlog is denying support to veterans who are in \ncritical need due to service-related injuries. I will continue to push \nfor an amendment that will make the Fully Developed Claims Program \npermanent. The Fully Developed Claims Program is an optional new \ninitiative that offers veterans and survivors faster decisions from the \nVA on compensation, pension, and survivor benefit claims. Veterans and \nsurvivors must simply submit all relevant records in their possession \nand those records which are easily obtainable, such as private medical \nrecords, at the time they make their claim and certify that they have \nno further evidence to submit. Then the VA can review and process the \nclaims more quickly. This program is realizing much improved processing \ntime due to the extraordinary partnership with numerous Veterans \nService Organizations, but I propose we make a guarantee to our \nveterans that if they utilize this program, the VA will provide their \nfinal rating in an expedited manner or they will receive a provisional \nrating at 180 days. This is the level of commitment from Congress that \nthe American people expect and our veterans deserve.\n  A true marker of our Nation's worth is our willingness to serve those \nwho have served us. As we continue to wind down our commitments in \nAfghanistan after 13 years of war, we need to gear up our commitment to \nour veterans. Our veterans deserve every possible tool we can provide \nto help ease their transition to civilian life. I am committed to \nmaking sure that our veterans receive the services and benefits they \nhave earned and the support they were promised and deserve. The United \nStates is the strongest Nation in the world because of our veterans, \nand we owe them and their families our gratitude and our respect and, \nmost important, our support.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of S. \n2450, a bill I have proudly cosponsored that would make critically \nneeded reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs. As we all know, \nrevelations from whistleblowers, reports from the Government \nAccountability Office, an internal review by the VA, and an interim \nreport from the VA's inspector general, an independent watchdog, have \nall revealed problems within the VA that have caused the system to fail \nmany of our veterans. This is simply unacceptable.\n  As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I understand the \nextraordinary debt we owe to the men and women who have served this \nNation in defense of our freedoms. I thank my colleagues, Senator \nSanders and Senator McCain, for working to forge a bipartisan bill to \naddress some of the most serious shortcomings in the VA health care \nsystem that have been identified in recent weeks. The bill would \nprovide for greater transparency at the VA by requiring an independent \nassessment of the scheduling system used at every VA medical center, \nalong with the staffing levels and workloads at each facility. It would \nalso task the VA inspector general to identify on an annual basis the \nhealth provider occupations with the largest staffing shortages, which \nwill give both the VA and Congress a better understanding of the \nDepartment's needs. In order to address what has been identified as a \nshortage in health care providers within the VA, the bill would expand \nopportunities for veterans to seek care outside of the VA system, \nincluding allowing veterans who qualify to seek care at Department of \nDefense health facilities. The bill would also empower the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to immediately hold senior VA officials accountable if \nthey have failed to do their jobs.\n  The credibility of the VA has taken a serious blow, and it will take \nyears for the Department to regain the trust it has lost among veterans \nand among the American people. My strong support for this legislation \nis based on my belief that it will make critical and fundamental \nchanges to the VA that will result in significant improvements to the \nquality of care our veterans receive and their ability to access that \ncare. The VA is facing significant challenges, but with the passage of \nthis legislation the Senate is taking an important step in helping to \nrestore trust in a system that has provided tremendous care for \ngenerations of veterans. Our Nation's veterans deserve no less.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to state my strong \nsupport for the legislation on the floor that addresses the current \nhealthcare crisis facing our nation's veterans. This bill, the \nVeterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and \nTransparency Act of 2014, is the product of excellent bipartisan work \ndone by Senator Sanders and Senator McCain. I want to thank both of my \ncolleagues for their efforts on drafting this legislation and finding a \npath to bring it to the Senate floor today. I believe their legislation \nwill give our veterans access to the healthcare they deserve and that \nit will invest in the Department of Veterans Affairs' health care \nsystem.\n  While Senator Sanders' and McCain's legislation contains many good \nmeasures that will improve the healthcare our veterans receive at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, I would like to highlight three \nprovisions in the bill that I believe are especially important for \nCongress to pass.\n  First, I am strongly supportive that the legislation contains a \nprovision to allow the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nto immediately terminate senior executives for poor performance. It is \nmy opinion that the current scandal was largely a result of ineffective \nand disgraceful mismanagement. As a first step, the Department must be \nable to terminate any managers who directed or pressured staff to \nfalsify or cover up wait times for veterans seeking health care. It is \ntime for a new culture of management in the VA, and I look forward to \nproviding this authority to the Department.\n  Second, I am grateful the legislation provides the authority for the \nVA to quickly hire new clinical staff, such as physicians and nurses, \nwhen there is a shortage of medical providers within the VA. The \nlegislation allows the VA to use any unobligated funds at the end of \neach fiscal year to do such hiring. The audit released by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs this week clearly indicated that many \nmedical facilities had a shortage of clinical providers. The \nlegislation on the floor also authorizes the VA to enter into medical \nleases the Department has requested in previous years, but that \nCongress has not funded. These include four community outpatient \nclinics in California, which are in San Diego, Chico, Chula Vista, and \nRedding. Thus, I am confident the authority to hire new clinical staff \nand the authority to enter into much needed medical leases are critical \nmeasures that Congress must pass if we expect the VA to meet the \ngrowing demand of medical care our Nation's veterans need and deserve.\n  I am also glad the legislation the Senate is considering contains \nmeasures to beef up how VA hospitals are\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\nevaluated for the quality of health care they provide, and that this \ninformation will be made public for veterans. The legislation contains \na provision that would require the Department of Health and Human \nServices to complete evaluations of VA hospitals and to post this \ninformation publically. It also requires the Government Accountability \nOffice to look at the metrics the VA is using to evaluate patient care \nand hospital quality. Finally, the bill will require the VA to publish \nits appointment wait times, which will increase the transparency of how \nquickly our veterans can access health care. Thus, I want to thank both \nSenator Sanders and Senator McCain for including such important \nprovisions that will improve accountability, transparency, and health \ncare quality at the VA.\n  Recently, the Department of Veterans Affairs released the results of \nits nation-wide Access Audit detailing the breadth of its struggle to \nresponsibly manage waiting lists for care at its medical facilities \nacross the country. The allegations of false record-keeping and other \ninappropriate scheduling practices were further substantiated. The \naudit made it clear that many staff members--13 percent interviewed \nnationally--were instructed to use inappropriate scheduling actions by \ntheir supervisors. The audit also revealed that at least one scheduler \nat 76 percent of all VA facilities indicated they received direction to \nenter inaccurate or misleading appointment data. The result is that \nsome veterans were forced to wait an egregious amount of time for \nmedical appointments, and surely many of these veterans suffered \nnegative health effects as a result of these delays.\n  After the press reports of secret wait lists at the Phoenix VA \nMedical Center, I wrote a letter to the VA's acting inspector general \nurging him to expand the scope of his investigation in order to \ndetermine if similar problems were occurring elsewhere. On May 28, \n2014, the VA's Office of the Inspector General released an interim \nreport of the ongoing review at the Phoenix VA Health Care System. This \nindependent review verified that deliberate action was taking to \nfalsify wait times and to keep some veterans--1,700 in Phoenix--off \nofficial wait lists. In response to this report, on June 2, I wrote to \nActing Secretary Sloan Gibson requesting an immediate review of medical \nappointment wait times at all California VA medical facilities, and \nthat the VA take action to expedite appointments for veterans in my \nState waiting an excessive amount of time to receive health care.\n  California is home to 8 major Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \nhealth care systems which include 66 medical centers and outpatient \nclinics. According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, of \nthe nearly 22 million veterans in the United States, nine percent, or \nroughly 2 million, live in California; a figure greater than that of \nany other State. California's large population of veterans, many of \nwhich are concentrated in southern California, creates a substantial \ndemand for medical care at California's VA Medical Centers.\n  The VA's Access Audit, released this week, validated the national \nextent of lengthy wait times and potential falsification of appointment \nrecords. It also makes it clear that California is not exempt from the \nrecent VA scandal. The data collected shows that over 20,000 veterans \nin California are having to wait more than 30 days for a medical \nappointment. Nearly 3,000 are waiting more than 90 days for their \nappointment. Furthermore, nearly 7,000 California veterans are on \nelectronic wait lists who have not been able to schedule any \nappointment. This lack of urgency to provide care to our Nation's \nveterans is not only appalling, it is also irresponsible.\n  In addition, I am deeply troubled that the recent audit identified \nthat five VA health care facilities in my State had some evidence of \nfalsifying or hiding wait times. They are the Livermore Medical Center, \nthe Yuba City Outpatient Clinic, the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center, \nthe Escondido Outpatient Clinic, and the Imperial Valley Outpatient \nClinic. The VA recommended the Office of the Inspector General conduct \ninvestigations at these facilities in order to determine if any \nfraudulent or criminal activity occurred, and I eagerly await the \nresults of these investigations.\n  It is clear to me that excessive wait times for medical appointments \nnegatively impacts the health of our veterans. So, fixing the VA is not \nonly about fixing the systemic management problems that led to a cover-\nup of appointment wait times at certain VA facilities across the \nNation. The fix also must be about improving the VA's ability to \nprovide high caliber health care to all of our Nation's veterans.\n  The VA must radically alter how it manages health care. It is my \nopinion that the VA's performance should be tied to the health outcomes \nof our veterans. The VA has played number games with appointment wait \ntimes in order to evaluate their performance for too long, and that \nmust end today. I hope the new leadership at the Department will work \nto develop better measures of performance that are based on how well \nour veterans do in terms of health and wellbeing as a result of the \ncare they receive at the VA.\n  For example, the VA should strive to reduce preventable drug \nresistant infections acquired in medical facilities. Deadly drug \nresistant infections are linked to poor infection control and the \noveruse of antibiotics in hospitals. These infections, like Methicillin \nResistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, and Clostridium difficile are \ndeadly, difficult to treat, and largely preventable. VA hospitals that \nprovide high quality medical care, that use antibiotics prudently, and \nthat practice good hygiene will have lower rates of these infections, \nfaster recovery times for hospitalized patients, and reduced health \ncare costs. VA hospitals that have clear data that they use antibiotics \nappropriately, have fewer deadly hospital acquired infections, and have \nveterans who can be discharged faster should be noticed for their \nperformance. I truly believe that a greater focus on health care \nquality and outcomes is critical for improving the VA's health care \nsystem.\n  The delays in access to health care and the culture of cover-ups that \nemerged within the Department of Veterans Affairs are absolutely \nunacceptable. Our Nation's veterans served and sacrificed for our \ncountry, and they deserve better. I truly believe the legislation \nintroduced by Senators Sanders and McCain is the solution our veterans \nneed and deserve. This is not a partisan issue, this is an issue of \ndoing what is right by those who defended our freedom.\n  Thus, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of \nS. 2450, the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, \nand Transparency Act of 2014.\n  The preliminary VA inspector general's report of delayed care at the \nPhoenix Hospital uncovered serious and systemic failures in our VA \nsystem. The internal audit by the Veterans Health Administration \nconfirmed these delays. These problems have dragged on long enough and \nmust be addressed and corrected. I believe we must keep the promises we \nhave made to our veterans. We can do this by giving them the same \nquality of service they gave us, and by providing them with the care \nthey deserve. That is why I support this bill.\n  This bill contains a number of provisions that will improve veterans \naccess to care when they need it the most by:\n  Sending care into the community and ensuring veterans do not have to \nwait more than 14 days to see a doctor or physician;\n  expeditiously hiring new doctors, nurses and other health care \nproviders in locations that have shortages;\n  requiring the VA to upgrade their electronic scheduling software;\n  authorizing the VA to enter into 27 major medical leases that will \nincrease access to care for thousands of veterans who currently have to \ntravel long distances to get the care they need;\n  requiring the President to create a commission to evaluate access \nissues in the VA Health Care system;\n  and, creating a commission on capital planning for VA medical \nfacilities to look at the processes to ensure our veterans are being \ntreated in safe facilities.\n  There is also a provision that would allow the Secretary of the VA to \nterminate VA senior executives for poor performance. This provision \nwould also require the Secretary to provide Congress a justification \nfor any removal\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\nwithin 30 days. I also support giving SES employees the ability to \nappeal to the Merit System Protection Board within 7 days of \ntermination, providing them the protections from retaliation and \ndiscrimination they deserve.\n  In addition to supporting this bill, as the chairwoman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I have put money in the Federal checkbook to \nimprove the veterans health care system so that wounded and disabled \nwarriors get the care and benefits they need. I have worked to ensure \nveterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, or a \ntraumatic brain injury, TBI receive better diagnosis and treatment \nthrough the Defense Department and the VA.\n  I have also led the charge to reduce the backlog in processing \nveterans disability claims. I brought Secretary Shinseki to Baltimore \nto create a sense of urgency to end the backlog by 2015. I used my \npower as chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee to convene a \nhearing with the top brass in the military and members of the committee \nto identify challenges and get moving on solutions. I cut across \nagencies to break down smokestacks and developed a 10-point checklist \nfor change enacted as part of the FY-2014 omnibus appropriations bill. \nThis plan includes better funding, better technology, better training \nand better oversight of the VA.\n  The Veteran's Administration needs a new attitude from the bottom up \nin every facility across the Nation. It is time to turn the VA around. \nVeterans who have fought on the front lines should not have to stand in \nline for the care they have earned and deserve.\n  This legislation is a significant step in the right direction, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 6 minutes, the \nDemocrats just under 13 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the Senator \nfrom Alabama to have 6 minutes, and I ask unanimous consent for 4 \nadditional minutes for this side, following the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of my colleagues \non this legislation. They have accomplished some very good things. We \nneed legislation to pass to help our veterans. The needs are real, and \nrecent revelations of substantially substandard care--and too often no \ncare at all--at our VA medical centers are shocking. There is and has \nbeen a long-term problem with the management of that agency. It is \nheartbreaking. It is an embarrassment. We owe our veterans better care \nthan they have been given.\n  One of the keys to improve that care is improving accountability, \nensuring money is being properly spent, not simply wasted by government \nbureaucrats. The money needs to get to our veterans.\n  Our national debt now is $17 trillion. It is growing rapidly. We \ncannot be lighthearted or cavalier about our responsibility to follow \nour agreement to honor the budget limitations we have. There are a lot \nof budgetary freedoms we have and a lot of ability we have and duties \nwe have to set priorities in our spending. Veterans clearly are a \npriority. I fought hard against the recent push to cut veterans \npensions and led an effort to restore those pensions payments.\n  In this case we are dealing with an issue of bureaucratic \naccountability. What happens so often is that in the crush and press of \nbusiness, we are unable to reach agreements on finding money somewhere \nelse in this monstrous bureaucracy and government of ours, and we \nsimply break the budget and add to the debt. Our veterans deserve \nbetter than that.\n  I am the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. We wrestle with \nthese issues--the chairman of the committee, Senator Murray--and the \nnumbers from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that this \nlegislation, as drafted, violates the Budget Act.\n  Indeed, the entire bill, the way the language is written, has been \ndeclared an ``emergency'' which allows its authors to avoid finding the \nefficiencies and the accountabilities needed to stay within the Federal \nbudget limits both parties agreed to. There is plenty of wasteful \nspending to be cut elsewhere in government, and much we can do to \nincrease accountability at the VA.\n  Even more concerning is the new open-ended entitlement legislation in \nthe bill. The bill would authorize emergency spending but sets no \nlimits on that spending. Section 801 says ``such sums as necessary.'' \nWell, how much is necessary? This is an important conversation to have, \nto wrestle with, and to develop solutions. But by simply not developing \nthese solutions, we invite more of the same kind of accountability \nproblems we have seen that brought us here.\n  I feel strongly that we have to do the right thing for our veterans, \nbut history suggests a blank check for the bureaucracy, an unlimited \nentitlement program, will not have the desired results--indeed, may \neven yield the opposite results from what we hope to achieve.\n  We need to resist the temptation to create more entitlements and more \nentitlements, which is one of the reasons we are heading recklessly \ntoward fiscal crisis, as our own Congressional Budget Office has \nindicated, and instead focus on creating reforms and solutions that \nimprove that quality of service and the effectiveness that is \ndelivered. Isn't that our job? Isn't that what our veterans deserve \nfrom us--the very best we can give them? As many hours as it takes for \nus to get this right, instead of simply avoiding the difficult issues \nwe must tackle to solve this calamity long-term?\n  There are also 3 years of emergency spending under the legislation, \nwhich I think is an unwise precedent for us to set. Again: it leads to \nthe kind of unaccountability, the lack of oversight that helped create \nthis crisis in the first place. We should designate--maybe if we have \nto do this--2014 money this year where the crisis is. We have already \nappropriated money. If we need some more, that could be perhaps \njustified as emergency spending, but a 3-year bill goes beyond what I \nthink is proper. It fails to establish the oversight that Congress has \na solemn duty to deliver. We can't just write a blank check and think \nit will solve these problems. We have to ask the tougher, deeper \nquestions about the changes needed in Washington to do right by our \nveterans. Details matter. Every line of legislation matters. We need to \nget this right.\n  The Appropriations Committee has already reported out the 2015 VA-HUD \nbill. It is already on the floor and could be here as early as next \nweek. The Senate could easily attach a bipartisan amendment to that \nthat provides the spending called for in this bill with offsets, cuts, \nefficiencies, and reductions in other spending to pay for it. There are \nplaces we could do this.\n  So I have to tell you, there are some good things in the bill. I \nthink there are. It improves the situation. I like the idea of giving \nveterans more choice to go to the doctor who is close to them. It is \nsomething Senator McCain and Senator Sanders have agreed on. I think \nthat is progress, very much so, but I have to say I cannot suggest to \nmy colleagues that the budget violation now before us should be waived. \nIt should not. Ignoring this requirement will not help our veterans in \nthe long run, but will lead to the same kind of problems we are \nconfronting today. We should adhere to the agreement we reached on \nspending by finding offsets. If we don't adhere to our spending limits, \nother programs will crowd out the budget for veterans and mean we have \nless money in the future not more, to fund these programs. If we ignore \nour debt, we do a disservice to our veterans. Unfortunately, the bill \ndoes not do what the law we agreed to requires. It is not paid for. We \nall agree veterans are our priority. So then is it not our duty to them \nto fulfill this priority by reducing wasteful spending elsewhere so \nthat money can be spent on veterans instead? Can we not deliver for \nthese veterans that most basic level of responsibility on our part as \nlawmakers?\n  Finally, colleagues, a vote to sustain the budget point of order is a \nvote that tells the committee to find appropriate money for the bill \nand does not kill the bill. It does not knock down the bill. It allows \nit to continue to be alive and a piece of legislation before us. It \nwould just require us to fix the funding. It would require us to fix \nthe bill. So that\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nis what we should be doing. That is why I feel I must raise the budget \npoint of order.\n  In summary, the bill has mandatory spending that violates the limits \nwe have agreed to in the Budget Act, and the bill also abuses the \nemergency designation to circumvent the requirement for offsets and the \nneed for accountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order against the \nemergency designation provision contained in Section 802(b) of H.R. \n3230, the vehicle for S. 2450, the Veterans' Access to Care Through \nChoice Act, pursuant to section 403(E)(1) of the fiscal year 2010 \nbudget resolution, S. Con. Res. 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am going to yield to Senator McCain in \na moment, but before I do that, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable \nbudget resolutions and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \nAct of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending bill, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 4 minutes, the \nSenator from Vermont has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Vermont want to go ahead?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am happy, if the Senator from Arizona needs more time \nat the end of his 4, for him go right ahead.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank a lot of people, including \nthe staffs of the committees, Senator Sanders' staff, Dahlia Melendez \nand Travis Murphy; Senator Burr's staff, Natasha Hickman, Maureen \nO'Neill, Anna Abram, and Victoria Lee; Senator Coburn's staff, Jabari \nWhite; my own staff, Elizabeth Lopez, Jeremy Hayes, and Joe Donoghue, \nand all the hard work that has gone into this legislation.\n  I think it is well known to my colleagues that this is an \nunprecedented piece of legislation in that for the first time it is \ngoing to provide our veterans with a choice. There are many other \nprovisions I would like to discuss also but have been, and I am sure my \ncolleague from Vermont will be addressing those.\n  There are, according to a recent VA audit, over 57,000 veterans who \nhave been waiting for an appointment for over 3 months to see a \nphysician at the VA. Over 63,000 veterans over the past 10 years have \nnever been able to get an appointment at all. There are allegations in \nthe Phoenix VA hospital that 40 veterans have died.\n  Today, June 11, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a \ncriminal investigation into allegedly misleading scheduling practices \nat the Department of Veterans Affairs that may have concealed how long \nveterans had to wait for appointments to see a doctor. ``Our Phoenix \noffice has opened a criminal investigation,'' FBI Director James Comey \nsaid in response to a lawmaker's question at a hearing Wednesday.\n  If that is not an emergency, I do not know what is. If it is not an \nemergency that the very lives of the men and women who have served our \ncountry with honor and distinction are being either jeopardized or \nallegations of absolutely being lost through malpractice and \nmalfeasance, if that is not an emergency, I have never seen one before \nthis body.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote this for what it is, this budget point \nof order. This is an emergency. If it is not an emergency that we have \nneglected the brave men and women who have served this country and keep \nus free, than I do not know what an emergency is.\n  Hard work has been done on this legislation, hard work and a lot of \ncompromises. I am happy to see that the majority of the veterans \nservice organizations are now in support of it. Is it a perfect piece \nof legislation? No. Is it exactly what I wanted? No. Is it exactly what \nthe Senator from Vermont wanted? Absolutely not. But this is an \nemergency. I tell my colleagues, if it is not an emergency of how we \ncare for those who have served on the field of battle, then nothing \nelse is before this body.\n  It breaks our hearts. It breaks American's hearts when they hear and \nsee these stories of those brave men and women and the neglect they \nhave suffered, the lack of a fulfillment of an obligation we made to \nthem. I hope we will vote against this budget point of order. I hope we \nwill vote unanimously, 100 to 0, to pass this legislation, send it to \nthe House, go to conference, get it to the President's desk, and start \nhealing the wounds that have been inflicted on these men and women.\n  There is no way we can ever compensate for those who have gone \nwithout the treatment they have earned, but at least we can \nexpeditiously fix this problem to the best of our ability. Is this the \nultimate and final solution to those problems that have been uncovered? \nNo, but it is a beginning. It is not the end of the beginning, it is a \nbeginning. There will be more proposals before us. There will be more \nefforts to fix this gaping wound in America's conscience.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to waive the budget point of order. This \nis an emergency. I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. Again, I \nthank everyone for their involvement, especially Senator Burr and \nSenator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me just thank Senator McCain for his very hard and \nbold work on this issue. He stood and came forward when we needed \nsomeone to do so. I think we have made real progress in a bipartisan \nway.\n  As Senator McCain just said, and I agree with him, if this is not an \nemergency, I am not quite clear what an emergency is.\n  During the last 4 years some 2 million new veterans have come into \nthe VA system. Many of them have come in with very difficult medical \nproblems, PTSD, TBI. We have an aging veteran population. Taking care \nof older people is complex and expensive. The simple truth is that in \nmany parts of this country--not all parts I suspect, but in a number of \nplaces in this country--we simply do not have the number of doctors, \nnurses, and other medical staff to accommodate the needs of our \nveterans. I have been told, unofficially at least, that at the very \nminimum there is a need for 700 new physicians in the VA. I am told \nthat is the floor, that the reality may be higher than that.\n  I have been told that in Phoenix alone there is a need for hundreds \nof new providers in order to address the problems in that one large \nfacility. Further, this legislation says to veterans that if there are \nlong wait times, if they cannot get into a facility in a reasonable \ntime, they can go outside of the VA. That is what this bill says.\n  You know what. That is going to cost money. That will cost money. \nThis legislation also says that if they live 40 miles or more from a VA \nfacility, they have the option of going to a private provider. That \nbenefit is going to cost money. The bottom line is that if we are going \nto do what in my view we should do; that is, to make sure every \nfacility in the VA has adequate staffing--doctors, nurses, other \nmedical personnel--and to make sure there is available funding to pay \nfor those veterans who will now get care outside of the VA--right now \nthe VA is spending about $4.8 billion a year in contract fees. There is \nno question in my mind that number is going to go up, but that is what \nwe are voting on now.\n  If you want to provide timely care to veterans, if you agree they \nshould go outside of the VA, it is going to cost money. If we are going \nto do that and the other things in this bill, that legislation needs to \nbe passed as written, and we must waive the point of order brought up \nby Senator Sessions.\n  Lastly, I remind my colleagues that when Congress voted to go to war \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, it did so with emergency funding. Those wars \nwill, it is estimated, cost between $3 and $6 trillion by the time we \ntake care of the last veteran. If we can spend that kind of money to go \nto war on an emergency basis, surely we can spend one-tenth of 1 \npercent of that amount to take care of the men and women who fought \nthose wars.\n  What we have done, as Senator McCain has indicated, is developed a \ncompromise. I am sure he is not happy\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\nwith everything in the bill. I am not happy with everything in the bill \nas well. I did want to also remind Senators about a few of the other \nprovisions that are in this bill that are important and I think do have \nbipartisan support.\n  This bill allows for 26 major medical facility leases, which means \nimproved and expanded care for veterans in 27 States and Puerto Rico. \nThis bill provides for the expedited hiring of VA doctors and nurses \nand $500 million targeted to hire those providers with unobligated \nfunds. As I mentioned earlier, this bill allows for veterans to go \noutside of the VA when there are waiting lines and when they live 40 \nmiles from a facility. This bill also deals with an issue where there \nis widespread support both in the House and the Senate; that is, the \nneed to address instate tuition for all veterans at public colleges and \nuniversities.\n  It also provides that surviving spouses of those who die in the line \nof duty will be eligible for the post-9/11 GI bill. This bill also \nimportantly establishes commissions to provide help to the VA in terms \nof improving scheduling capabilities--God knows they certainly need \nthat help--and also for capital planning.\n  Lastly--and we need to reiterate this point--this bill gives the \nSecretary of the VA the authority to immediately fire incompetent \nemployees and those who have falsified or manipulated data in terms of \nwaiting periods.\n  Our legislation differs from the House in that in order to prevent, \nin my view, the politicization of the VA or eliminate all due process, \nit provides for a very expedited appeals process.\n  The House of Representatives passed legislation yesterday which \ncovers a lot of the same ground the Sanders-McCain bill covers, and I \nam absolutely confident that working with Chairman Miller and Ranking \nMember Michaud we can bridge the differences and send the President a \nbill that he can sign in the very near future.\n  Finally and lastly, I want to say to the 300,000 employees who work \nat the VA that the overwhelming majority of those people are hard-\nworking, honest, serious people. For many of them, taking care of \nveterans is not a job; it is a mission. Many of them are, in fact, \nveterans themselves. These people understand the sacrifices the \nveterans have made to protect our country, and they are doing the best \nthat they can to support our veterans.\n  I hope we pass this bill. I hope we pass a waiver for the budget \npoint of order. I hope we get a conference committee moving \nimmediately, and I hope we get a bill to the President as soon as \npossible.\n  Furthermore, as Senator McCain has just mentioned, I don't think this \nis the end of the discussion regarding the needs of veterans. I hope \nvery much that in our committee and on the floor we can begin to \naddress some of the other very serious issues facing the veterans' \ncommunity.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes for Dr. Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nfor working with Senator McCain to get a bill.\n  I support Senator Sessions and the budget points of order on this \nbill. I take exception to some of the statements by my colleague from \nVermont.\n  As reported yesterday, if you look at the patient list for many of \nthe primary care doctors in the VA, they are half of what the average \npracticing physician outside the VA is. When you drill down on those, \nmany of them have patients that have been deceased for years. About 10 \nto 15 percent of their patient list has never been to the VA, or they \ncame once from a different State or were transferred from somewhere \nelse. What you actually see is the patient load in the private sector \nis about 2\\1/2\\ times what the patient load is in the VA.\n  I have no doubt we need to increase the number of physicians in the \nVA, but we also need to increase markedly the amount of output that \nthose physicians perform.\n  The other thing that is important in this bill is the transparency--\nwhich I don't believe has been mentioned--that will actually allow \nveterans to know the quality outcomes of where they are being treated \nand the credentials of those who are treating them. Those are important \nfactors for care.\n  Our veterans deserve the best care. I agree with the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee that the vast majority of our VA employees \nare hard-working employees, but there are some who aren't.\n  Our lack of oversight and the lack of management expertise at the VA \nhas now exploded into issues that are going to continue to be exploded. \nWe hear every day new whistleblowers coming forward on the problems in \nthe VA.\n  It is not only scheduling; it is a lack of truthfulness in a lot of \nother areas. It is a lot of inaccuracy in terms of outcome.\n  I agree with the chairman. This is just the beginning. But if, in \nfact, somebody puts their life on the line for us, we certainly, at a \nminimum, ought to make sure that we don't just have words that say we \nare going to give you the health care if you are an injured returning \nwar veteran, but that we actually give that care, and that it meets the \nstandard of care we want for anybody in our family. This is just the \nstart.\n  The other thing that I would say, in agreement with Senator Sessions, \nthere are ways to pay for this bill.\n  On the clinics, we drill down on one clinic--and I am going to go \nspend just a minute talking about it. It is a clinic that will triple \nin size, but with an average expected increase in veteran population of \n5 percent and visits of less than 7 percent over the next 20 years. So \nit is going to go from 50,000 to 190,000 square feet.\n  We are going to spend $188 million for that facility and pay $40 a \nsquare foot per year for it on a rate of increase of 4 percent in part \nof the lease. We can rent the same space in Tulsa at $15 a foot and \nspend less money than we pay for the engineering cost for this to have \na clinic just as good or better.\n  So the planning and the management of the VA on these clinics is \nsuspect, and I plan on drilling down on every one of those before this \nbill comes to conference and give our conferees the information based \non that. Because we are going to spend emergency money, as the chairman \nwould like to do on this, we ought to make sure there isn't a penny \nthat is wasted.\n  So we can do it. We can do it better, we can do it for less money, \nand we can do it in the confines of what we are actually going to see.\n  The final thing is I would say again to my colleague from Vermont, I \nappreciate his willingness to compromise on the issues. His heart is \ndedicated to veterans, and I understand that. Our philosophies are \ndifferent on how we get there, but his commitment is nonetheless real \nand felt, and I thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I rise to speak about the care this Nation provides to \nveterans--care that they have earned, the care that we owe them, the \ncare that we promised them, and the care that we should never stop \nworking to improve.\n  I joined the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee when I came to the \nSenate in January of 2007. Soon thereafter I launched a listening tour \naround the great State of Montana to hear what veterans thought about \nthe health care they receive.\n  Montana has the second-most veterans per capita. We serve our country \nat some of the highest rates in the Nation. We are home to a large \nNative-American population that serves more often than any other \nminority in this country.\n  In 2007, the surge in Iraq was in full swing. Veterans had many \nconcerns on their minds. But in rural Montana I heard over and over \nfrom the veterans about how the mileage reimbursement that disabled \nveterans receive to see their doctor at the VA was far too low. In \nfact, it was at 11 cents a mile, hardly enough to even pay for the gas, \nmuch less the tires, the oil, and the automobile itself.\n  That number matters in a State where folks have to drive a couple \nhundred miles across the State to see their doctor.\n  So when I came back to Washington I worked with then-Senator Byrd to \nraise that reimbursement rate for the first time in decades. Now more \nveterans can afford to see their doctor, and that is how a \nrepresentative of government should work--identify a problem, write a \nbill to fix it, work with colleagues, hear their concerns, and pass a \nsolution into law. That is what we have done here today.\n  Today's bill is a good bill that gets at some of the VA's most \npressing problems. Today's bill addresses many of the transparency, \naccountability, and access-to-care issues that are plaguing\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\nthe VA. By getting rid of incentives to falsify wait times and make it \neasier to remove bad managers, we will hold more folks accountable for \nthe care veterans receive. By making it easier to hire medical \nprofessionals and allowing more veterans to seek care from outside \nproviders, we will reduce the bottleneck that forces veterans to wait \ntoo long for care.\n  I want to be clear about one issue. Once veterans get in the door at \nthe VA, they receive incredibly good health care. As a member of the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I continue to travel around Montana \nto talk to veterans. I speak to veterans' groups around the country as \nwell.\n  They tell me that VA care is some of the best in the Nation. I have \nhad wives, husbands, daughters, and sons seek me out to tell me what VA \nis doing right. Additionally, 9 out of 10 veterans report they are \nhappy with the care they receive at the VA. That is important to \nremember.\n  It isn't all bad news, but the fact is that while the war in \nAfghanistan is winding down, and the war in Iraq has come to a close, \nthe struggle for many service men and women continues here at home.\n  We went to war after 9/11 to fight against terror, to fight for the \nfreedoms that we value in this country, but we didn't think far enough \ndown the road. We didn't think about how we could care for our fighting \nmen and women when they returned from battle.\n  When I joined the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the VA was starting to \nrecover from years of neglect. In 2007, as Americans fought in the \nstreets of Baghdad, Congress had to pass an emergency budget bill to \nkeep the lights on in the VA. Imagine that--fighting two wars, but we \ndidn't properly fund the department that cares for our troops when they \ncome home.\n  With better planning and advance appropriations, we have come a long \nway, but attention spans and new cycles are short.\n  The bill we passed today is a good start, but it can't be the end of \nthe story. Moving forward, we must make sure that we have all the facts \nbecause you can't fix a problem if you don't understand it.\n  That is why I have already worked with my colleagues to help pass \nlegislation out of committee that will free up more resources for the \ninspector general's office of the VA to do its job and to make reports \nfrom the VA inspector general public and transparent.\n  The bill also prohibits the payment of bonuses to VA medical \ndirectors and senior VA employees until investigations are complete and \nreforms are made. Our message is clear; that is, that veterans come \nfirst.\n  In the 7 years since I held that first veterans listening session \nacross Montana, since then we have worked with veterans groups to open \nnew veterans centers and community-based out-patient clinics across the \nState of Montana.\n  I have helped more veterans get transportation to get to their doctor \nappointments, and I have helped lead the way to expand the use of \ntelehealth for rural veterans. We did this while working with the VA \nsecretaries from both parties by working across the aisle to write \ncommonsense legislation that meets the needs of veterans and their \nfamilies. Not only should improving veterans care be an unrelenting \nfocus for this body but it must be a nonpartisan one.\n  Improving mental health care for veterans is not a partisan issue. \nImproving veterans' ability to get a good job is not a partisan issue. \nMaking sure that veterans get the care they have earned, the care that \nwe promised them when they signed up to fight should never be a \npartisan issue.\n  Let's keep working together to honor the sacrifices made by our \nfighting men and women, as well as the families who anxiously wait for \nthem back home.\n  On Saturday morning I will be in Anaconda, MT, kicking off my latest \nveterans listening tour to get more ideas about how we can improve the \nservices and care for veterans.\n  I know that many of my colleagues are holding similar sessions in \ntheir States, and I look forward to hearing what ideas they bring back \nso that we can work together to improve veterans health care.\n  If this bill is the end of this Congress's work on veterans issues, \nit will be disappointing to me and it will be disappointing to the \nveterans out there who put their lives on the line to defend our \nfreedom.\n  We have more work to do, and I hope it doesn't require another crisis \nto get it done.\n  I wish to thank Bernie Sanders for his great work on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Before the Memorial Day recess, the Armed Services \nCommittee voted 25 to 1 to favorably report out S. 2410, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015.\n  The bill is on the calendar, and both it and the committee report \nhave been filed and are available online and in print.\n  As the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Inhofe and I hope to bring the bill to the Senate floor as soon \nas the Senate schedule allows. I have talked with the majority leader \nabout it, and he says he is going to do his best, but there are a \nnumber of things that we can do to be helpful on this effort.\n  Neither of us wants to be in the position that we were in last year \nwhen Senators were unable to take up the bill and vote on any \namendments to this important legislation because of how close it was to \nthe end of the session when it was brought up.\n  Both of us are on the floor today urging Senators who are considering \namendments to the bill to file them before the July recess.\n  We would then be in a position--both of us, with our staffs--to work \nwith Senators to clear as many amendments as possible for inclusion in \na manager's package and to begin identifying relevant amendments that \nwould be likely to be contested.\n  Now, we believe if we can develop a list of a few relevant amendments \nthat would require votes to start with when we first take up the bill, \nit would help us in getting to the floor. I believe that is the case, \ngiven the circumstances the Senate is in.\n\n  We have an awful lot of work ahead of us. We don't have a long time \nto do it. If we were able to put together a proposal to the leaders, \nthat we have not only the bill, which is obviously on the calendar we \nhave worked on a bipartisan basis to pass with the 25-vote majority--\nwhich is minus 1 vote in the Senate--it would be our belief this would \nhave greater practical appeal to our leaders.\n  We think this approach would enable us to reach unanimous consent as \nto an initial set of relevant amendments to be considered so we could \nthen move forward expeditiously when the Senate returns to the bill. I \nhope our colleagues will help us in this matter.\n  I think it is in everybody's interest and it is in the national \nsecurity interest that we have a bill before us. We have to pass a bill \nin order to go to conference with the House or else we are put in the \nsame kind of position we were in last year, where we simply present \nwhat amounted to a conference report before a bill had ever been truly \ndebated and sent. We and our staff, working with colleagues, put \ntogether what amounted to a conference report, which was not a \nconference report in technical terms but was in effect the work product \nof both the Senate and the House and our committees by process of \nnegotiation.\n  So our colleagues can be very helpful in getting this bill to the \nfloor, meeting the concerns of our Nation and doing what we should be \ndoing for our troops and our families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I first say and express my appreciation to \nChairman Levin. We hear a lot of talk about bipartisanship and people \ngetting along. That is usually just talk. In this case, it is real.\n  We have a committee of Democrats and Republicans concerned about \ndefending our Nation with totally inadequate resources. Chairman Levin \nhas responded every time we have had some kind of a controversial \nmatter come up. Then our staff--Peter Levine\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\nis the staff director for the majority and John Bonsell is the staff \ndirector for the minority--I have yet to call them when issues come up \nthat we haven't been able to get this done, and this is kind of \nunusual. This doesn't happen in the Senate in very many committees.\n  I believe, and have always said, the NDAA is the most important bill \nof the year, keeping in mind we have actually passed one for 52 \nconsecutive years. This is something that has to be done.\n  We adopted the National Defense Authorization Act on May 22, as the \nchairman said, 25 to 1, which doesn't happen very often around here. It \ncontains a lot of vital work we have to do and it is within the budget \ncaps.\n  I think it supports the training of the troops, the maintenance and \nmodernization, research and development, and the pay and benefits. \nThese are tough issues to negotiate, but we have done that, and we have \nit ready for more action.\n  What we don't want is what happened last year. Last year we had a lot \nof amendments. We on the Republican side were wanting to have all these \namendments. I think we are entitled to amendments. We did a count last \nyear of how many amendments were on the average bill. It was something \nlike 140 amendments. We didn't have nearly that many requests, but we \nwere able to get them in.\n  If we start now, we can do that. So I wish to tell my Republican \ncolleagues that I don't want them to come back and start complaining \nlater on, if we don't start getting amendments now so we can hash them \nout, find out what is acceptable, and find out where the opposition \nwould be. But we don't want to wait until the end of the year.\n  It got so close last year, as we were approaching December 31, and we \nall know that if we don't have a Defense authorization bill by that \ntime, hazard pay is at risk, reenlistment bonuses won't be paid. Stop \nand think about the cost. Right now, if we were to hire a person in \ntraining to be an F-22 pilot, the cost is $9 million. However, the \nretention bonus for over a 9-year period could be $225,000. Look at the \neconomics of it. We don't want that to happen.\n  Last year we were able to get a bill. It is the first time I have \never participated in a ``big four'' meeting. Actually, three of us sat \ndown because we had one no-show. So three of us put together a bill in \na period of time, tried to consider all the amendments, and most people \nwere pretty satisfied with it, but that is not the way it is supposed \nto happen.\n  We are going to have a lot of amendments. We always do. The only way \nwe are going to be able to do this is to get this out on the floor. I \nthink it needs to be passed before the end of the fiscal year. So I \ninvite my friends on both sides of the aisle to bring down their \namendments.\n  Let me again say how appreciative I am personally of having worked \nwith Carl Levin in this process and with the staff, who have been so \neasy to work with, and so competent and professional.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senator Grassley for his patience.\n  Senator Inhofe and his staff worked extraordinarily well with us on \nthis side of the aisle. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bipartisan \ncommittee. Senator Inhofe has helped in a very important way to \nmaintain this bipartisan tradition of our committee. I thank him for \nthe remarks, and I thank him and his staff.\n  I hope our colleagues will listen to what we both are urging them to \ndo. Let us take a look at the amendments now, instead of waiting and \nwaiting and waiting. Because if we look at amendments now, we increase \nour chances of getting this bill to the floor earlier rather than \nlater.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to address two \nissues, a shorter issue on immigration and a longer issue on the \nstudent loan program, particularly in reference to legislation offered \nearlier this morning.\n  On immigration, this morning, Secretary Johnson appeared before the \nJudiciary Committee. We had a chance to ask a number of questions \nrelated to the administration's release of 36,000 criminal aliens, for \nwhat reasons the Department voluntarily did release them--especially \nconvicted murderers--and what they are doing to track down and keep \ntrack of where these people are. I didn't get answers, but the \nSecretary committed to respond in writing about the matter, and I thank \nhim ahead of time for doing that.\n  I also asked about data on countries that refuse to cooperate in \ntaking back their nationals. Today I am introducing a bill with Senator \nInhofe to fix this situation and allow the government to detain foreign \nnationals who pose a threat to our homeland. I have a longer statement \non that issue.\n  Finally, I mention that the Secretary of Homeland Security answered a \nlot of questions related to unaccompanied children coming to the United \nStates, mostly from Central America, and entering our southern border.\n  I agree we do have a humanitarian problem. These are vulnerable \nchildren whose lives are on the line. They are escorted by strangers \nfor the most part, away from their families in some cases, and each of \nthese young people probably not understanding what lies ahead.\n  When in custody, our government makes an attempt to reunite them with \ntheir families. However, sometimes the government is handing them over \nto nonrelatives, which concerns me because of the potential of placing \nthem in the hands of pimps and traffickers.\n  As I said this morning in the committee, these children are being \nlured into these dire circumstances by false promises. That is evident \nfrom the interviews being done with the children.\n  Already, border agents and intelligence analysts have been \ninterviewing the youth to understand why they are migrating at this \nparticular time. Today I received a document that summarizes the \nfindings of these interviewers. The document, while it does not have \nany author or official seal, was apparently done to summarize the \ninterviews of individuals crossing the border along the McAllen, Rio \nGrande City, and Weslaco stations.\n  Two hundred thirty subjects were interviewed from several countries. \nAn overwhelming majority said they were coming to the United States to \ntake advantage of the new U.S. law that grants a free pass to \nunaccompanied children and female adults traveling with minors. That \nso-called free pass refers to a Notice to Appear document issued and \nthen saying they are released on their own recognizance pending a \nhearing.\n  There is no new law. There is a new bill that passed the Senate 1 \nyear ago but not through the House of Representatives, and it may never \nbe. So there is no new law granting a free pass to unaccompanied \nchildren and female adults traveling with minors.\n  Specifically, this report states:\n\n       A high percentage of the subjects interviewed stated their \n     family members in the U.S. urged them to travel immediately, \n     because the United States Government was only issuing \n     immigration [free passes] until the end of June 2014.\n\n  The report states that:\n\n       The issue of free passes was the main reason provided by 95 \n     percent, plus or minus, of the interviewed subjects.\n\n  So while I understand there are a lot of factors involved, we cannot \nignore the fact that these children are coming or are being forced here \nbecause of a belief on their part that they will never be deported.\n  We can say that is thanks to the Obama administration because this \nadministration has refused to be serious about immigration enforcement. \nThe President needs to send a signal right away, if he wants to stop \nthis catastrophe from happening, that the laws will be enforced.\n  Instead of reviewing deportation policies and suggesting ways to \nremove fewer people, the President should task Secretary Johnson with \nfinding ways to actually enforce the laws we have on the books.\n  We must send a very strong signal that there is no benefit and no \navenue\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\nfor them to remain in the United States. We must do this so the \nchildren are not lured into dire situations in the future. Even before \nthey cross the border into the United States, they are probably already \nin circumstances we would consider a dire situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3596-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3596-S3597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Department of Education \nwill make about $112 billion in Federal direct loans to students. The \nFederal Government already holds more than $1 trillion in student loan \ndebt. So that makes the U.S. Department of Education one of the \ncountry's largest lenders. Total student loan debt in the United States \nis now second only to mortgage debt, and about 90 percent of all \nstudent loans happen to be issued by the Federal Government.\n  When elected officials say we have a student loan crisis because too \nmany students owe more than they can afford to repay, we have to keep \nin mind who it was and is that made those loans to students in the \nfirst place.\n  It was, in fact, Uncle Sam.\n  What is one of the first things a Federal regulator looks at when a \nprivate bank issues a loan? They look at whether the bank has confirmed \nthe ability of the borrower to repay. Federal student loans are given \nout without a credit check or any analysis of the student's ability to \nrepay the loans in the first place.\n  The fastest growing category of student loans is Federal unsubsidized \nstudent loans, which are given out regardless of need. That means that \nstudents across this country get an award letter from their college \nsaying they are eligible for thousands of dollars in Federal loans, \neven though in many cases they may not need all of those loans to cover \ntheir tuition and other costs. Colleges are required to offer the full \namount of Federal student loans for which the student is eligible even \nif a financial aid counselor at that university knows that a student is \nborrowing more than the student needs and even if that counselor \nrealizes they will have trouble repaying. If a private bank followed \nthese same tactics and gave out loans on these terms, that bank would \nbe accused of predatory lending. These easy-money policies may even be \nhelping fuel tuition increases, which then obviously makes the problem \neven worse. A Federal government trying to help a student and at the \nsame time maybe giving incentives to increase tuition actually is not \nhelping that student in the long run.\n  Between Federal student loan policies that effectively encourage \nover-borrowing and the lack of good jobs for college graduates in this \ncurrent economy, it is no wonder that so many college graduates find \nthemselves in over their heads with student loan debt.\n  Unfortunately, for all the concerns we have heard expressed on the \nSenate floor about excessive student loan debt, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle decided to play election-year politics with \nthis issue rather than tackle any of the root causes of the problem. In \nfact, when it comes to economic growth and job creation, the first rule \nought to be do no harm. By including yet another massive tax increase, \nthe bill the Senate declined to take up would have only added to the \nlist of tax and regulatory burdens currently choking our economy.\n  We should be intensely focused on removing burdens to economic growth \nand as a result have some job creation. Instead, the policies we see \nfrom the other side of the aisle seem to be based on the old European \nmodel of accepting anemic economic growth and trying to make up for it \nwith debt-financed government handouts for as long as possible.\n  I just referred to an old European model because many countries in \nEurope have already rejected this failed approach and instead have \nsought to reform entitlements, cut spending, and reduce taxes--measures \nwe ought to be taking right here in the United States. Our goal should \nbe to expand opportunities for young people and the middle class and \nnot add them to the welfare state.\n  Incidentally, the President's recent so-called Executive action on \nstudent loans shows that he shares the same outlook of assuming a \nstagnant economy for the foreseeable future. He is talking about making \npeople who graduated years ago retroactively eligible for programs \nenacted in 2010 that allow students to lower their monthly payments if \nthey have a lower income. First of all, that happens to be a very \ntransparent admission that many students who graduated near the \nbeginning of President Obama's first term in office still don't have \ngood-paying jobs halfway through the second term. What he doesn't tell \nyou is that when you lower your student loan payments, you will pay off \nyour loan more slowly and obviously accumulate more interest. In other \nwords, you will eventually end up paying a lot more to Uncle Sam than \nyou otherwise would have. When banks were offering adjustable-rate or \ninterest-only mortgages, they were criticized for taking advantage of \nborrowers who would be faced with bigger payments down the road.\n  The pay-as-you-earn program may be useful tools short term for those \nin distress, but it will cost every one of them in the long term; that \nis, assuming you ever get a job that pays well. However, the second \npart of the program says that if you still haven't found a job that \npays well enough to pay off your loan after 10 years, your loan will be \nforgiven if you work for the government or a nonprofit or after 20 \nyears if you work in the private sector, which apparently is considered \nless worthwhile. And who foots the bill when these people get their \nloans forgiven? The American taxpayer will pay for those people's \ncollege loans.\n  Creighton University Professor Ernie Goss has analyzed the \nPresident's plan and thinks it is a poor use of taxpayer funds. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       A lot of these men and women that are out there working \n     don't have kids in college, won't have kids in college, and \n     it's a big transfer of income to those of us who have \n     university educations or particularly those of us who are in \n     university education.\n\n  So increasing Federal subsidies for colleges at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayers who work hard to pay for their own bills just \nencourages colleges to keep increasing tuition.\n  Furthermore, expanding a program designed to help student loan \nborrowers who still cannot afford their student loan payments 10 or 20 \nyears after graduation looks a lot like planning for further economic \nstagnation typical of the last 4 or 5 years rather than focusing on \nimproving economic growth and resultant job creation.\n  The political messaging bill the Senate declined to take up today \nwould also do nothing to address the problems of students borrowing \nmore than they will be able to afford to repay in the first place. I \nhave a bill that will help with that problem.\n  The Higher Education Act already contains a requirement for colleges \nto provide counseling to new borrowers of Federal student loans; \nhowever, the current disclosures in the law do not do enough to ensure \nthat students understand what kind of debt they will face after \ngraduation. My bill, which I have entitled ``Know Before You Owe \nFederal Student Loan Act,'' strengthens the current student loan \ncounseling requirements by making the counseling an annual requirement \nbefore new loans are disbursed rather than just for first-time \nborrowers.\n\n  My bill adds several key components to the information institutions \nof higher education are required to share with students as part of loan \ncounseling. Perhaps most significantly, colleges would have to provide \nan estimate of a student's loan debt-to-income ratio upon graduation. \nThis would be based on the starting wages for that student's program of \nstudy and the estimated student loan debt the student will likely take \nout to complete the program. That way, students will have a very real \npicture of the student loan payments they will face and whether they \nwill be able to afford those payments with their likely future income.\n  Students will also be provided with information about the higher risk \nof default if they have a projected loan debt-to-income ratio greater \nthan 12 percent. They will be told that they should borrow only the \nminimum amount necessary to cover expenses and that they do not have to \naccept the full amount of the loans offered.\n  Students will also be given options for reducing borrowing through \nscholarships, reduced expenses, work-study or other work opportunities.\n  Because adding an extra year of study can significantly increase \nstudent loan debt, an explanation will be\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\nprovided about the importance of graduating on time to avoid additional \nborrowing and the impact of adding an additional year of study to the \ntotal indebtedness.\n  Finally, the bill requires that a student manually enter either in \nwriting or through electronic means the exact dollar amount of the \nFederal direct loan funding the student desires to borrow. The current \nprocess almost makes borrowing the maximum amount the default option. \nIf you want to borrow less than you need to borrow, you have to ask for \nless. Students may wrongly assume that the Federal Government has \ndetermined this is the appropriate amount for them to borrow when in \nfact the government doesn't know anything about that student's \nsituation. Surely the Federal Government would not lend them more than \nthey can afford to repay, right? No, that is wrong. This provision will \nensure that students make a conscious decision about how much they \nborrow rather than simply accepting the total amount of Federal student \nloans for which they are eligible.\n  I should add that good college financial aid counselors can and do \nadvise students not to borrow more than they need, but the process \nitself needs to be reformed to give them the proper tools.\n  In fact, the reforms I have outlined were inspired by efforts already \nunderway in my home State of Iowa. Grand View University in Des Moines, \nIA, has a financial empowerment plan where students and families \nconstruct a comprehensive 4-year financing plan. Under this plan, \nborrowing is based on the student's future earning potential in the \nstudent's field of study. The 4-year plan also helps ensure students \ngraduate on time, and tuition is capped at 2 percent a year over those \n4 years.\n  Iowa Student Loan--our State-based nonprofit lender--also has a \nprogram called Student Loan Game Plan, which is an online, interactive \nresource that calculates a student's likely debt-to-income ratio. It \nwalks students through how their borrowing will affect their lifestyle \nin the future and what actions they can take now to reduce their \nborrowing. As a result, in the past year over 15 percent of the \nstudents who participated decreased the amount they had planned to \nborrow by an average of $2,536, saving Iowa students over $1 million in \nadditional loan debt.\n  Finally, my own alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, has a \nprogram called the Live Like a Student Program. This involves a number \nof resources to help students learn to manage their finances better, \nincluding 3-week courses, one-on-one counseling, and workshops.\n  We often tell prospective college students that they will earn on \naverage $1 million more during a lifetime. It is true that college \ngenerally is a good investment; however, when a student's academic \ndreams become a nightmare--and usually upon graduation that happens \nbecause they borrowed more from the Federal Government than they can \nafford to repay on their starting salary--they understandably feel that \nthey have been had. And by whom? Their own government.\n  The Federal Government, as the lender making these loans, has a \nresponsibility to at least ensure that students know what they are \ngetting themselves into before they get in over their heads. This \nlegislation I described that will be introduced will do that.\n  I would urge my colleagues to take a look at that piece of \nlegislation. I would ask them to support it and join as a cosponsor so \ncollectively we can help prevent more students from drowning in Federal \nstudent loan debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

One of those amendments was mine, and I would like to \ndiscuss it briefly because I think it is something the Senate should \npursue.\n  I will note that everybody I spoke to about it--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--liked the amendment and thought it made sense. So I \nwill describe it.\n  A little background: Some time ago, as we entered the computer age, \nwe figured out that there were better ways to maintain health records \nthan in cardboard file folders stuffed away in file drawers. One of the \nleaders in solving that problem--lost information buried in file \nfolders--was the Veterans' Administration. They developed one of the \nbest electronic health records in the country. For years they were \nleaders in the technology of electronic health records. To this day, \nthe VA electronic health record system is one of which they can be \nproud.\n  It has one flaw, and that flaw is that it is limited to Veterans' \nAdministration medical facilities and Veterans' Administration medical \nproviders. If a veteran in Rhode Island is walking through Providence \nand trying to cross the plaza in Kennedy Square and gets hit by a \nvehicle and rushed to the Rhode Island Hospital emergency room, the \nRhode Island Hospital emergency room has no access to that veteran's \nelectronic health record.\n  At the same time a number of States have really stepped up not only \nto have electronic health records but to have a hub that exchanges the \ninformation in an electronic health record. So when you go to get an \nMRI or go to see a specialist or are taken to an emergency room or have \na lab test, the results of that encounter are loaded automatically into \nyour electronic health record. That can only work if you have the whole \nsystem pulling together, and some States are doing that.\n  Now you have the difficult situation where there are States that are \nbuilding an information network for health records and the Veterans' \nAdministration, which has one of the best electronic health records in \nthe country, is not participating in that local effort to tie the \nmedical system together for the benefit of local folks. That is an \noversight that needs to be corrected, and my amendment would encourage \nand support the Veterans' Administration in taking its electronic \nhealth records and connecting them to the information exchanges that \nare growing.\n  In Rhode Island it is called Current Care. It is run by the Rhode \nIsland Quality Institute. It does a phenomenal job. We are reaching out \nto veterans to do it voluntarily, but it has been a real chore to work \nwith the Veterans' Administration to move this along. It has taken an \nenormous amount of time despite the goodwill of the people involved. \nThere has not been much in the way of resources available. We have had \nto go to private and nonprofit and charitable sources to try to fund \nthis. That doesn't make sense.\n  This bill is particularly important--where we are providing more out-\nof-network access for veterans and more ability for veterans to go to \ndoctors that will not be in the electronic health network record--\nbecause it would allow the very good electronic health record of the \nVeterans' Administration to connect with these emerging electronic \nhealth records information networks. It is simply leaving veterans \nbehind to leave them out under these circumstances.\n  I hope I will have a chance to move this legislation on some other \nvehicle, but I have to say, as important as this bill was, it was \ndisappointing that a piece of legislation as simple as mine--an \namendment that would have enjoyed extraordinary bipartisan support and \nprobably would have been agreed to on a voice vote--never had a chance \nto see the light of day because, as I said, of the abbreviation and \nabruptness, to put it mildly, of the amendment process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking a number \nof my colleagues, most especially our good friends who are very active \nMembers of this body, Senators Sanders and McCain, for acting in a very \nbipartisan and courageous way to enable us to reach a compromise and \nvote on a truly historic step forward--as we did recently--to begin to \nbring an end to this crisis in our health care system and the VA.\n  I also thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his amendment, and I\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nhope it has some support in some form--as it and other amendments \ndeserve as well--because as commendable as the bill is, it certainly \ndoes not solve all of the problems in the VA health care system, let \nalone the VA.\n  Let's recognize that the disability claims backlog persists. The \nbureaucratic rigmarole and sclerotic bureaucracy of the VA in many \nparts of the country continue to plague our veterans, and we need to \nrecognize that top to bottom the VA needs an overhaul in its culture as \nwell as its management. But this bill represents a good faith and \neffective way to respond initially--the beginning of a solution to a \nhealth care crisis that is decades long in the building. The delays in \nthe VA health care system are well known and longstanding.\n  I spend a lot of time, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nas well the Armed Services Committee, listening to veterans. I have a \nveterans advisory council that gives me extraordinarily insightful and \nimportant advice. I make a point of visiting the VA health care \nfacilities all around Connecticut, and I spend a lot of time in places \nwhere veterans gather, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nAmerican Legion, and others. Listening to them is a major source of \ninformation for me in forming my judgment about what should be done \nwith the VA health care system. What I hear from them--most commonly--\nis that the health care is good, but it takes too long to get it. The \ndoctors, nurses, and health care providers do very good work, but it \ntakes too long to see them. The delays are what our veterans find most \ntroubling about this system.\n  What we have seen--disclosed first by CNN and then by others--is not \nonly delays but false record keeping to disguise those delays and \nfalsification of documents and lists to hide a failure to meet \ndeadlines--in fact, to provide timely care. That kind of falsification \nof records and destruction of documents, and, in effect, cooking the \nbooks and then covering it up goes beyond simply delaying health care. \nIt is, in effect, a form of fraud. We have taken a first step here to \nmeet the immediate needs and help end the delays.\n  This bill will enable veterans to seek private health care at private \nfacilities or private clinics or private hospitals if they have to wait \ntoo long or live too far away to make use of the VA facility.\n  It also increases resources--a longer-term effort to provide more \ndoctors and fill the 400 vacancies that exist right now. Those \nresources are vitally necessary, not only to provide more providers but \nalso to rebuild, renovate, and construct new health care facilities.\n  In providing more resources, this bill will also aid 26 VA \nfacilities, such as the Errera clinic and facility in West Haven.\n  It also imposes accountability. It makes sure that officials in the \nVA who are incompetent or corrupt can be fired more easily and that \nbonuses or promotions can be stopped for those officials who betrayed a \ntrust. It also shows that what is necessary here is more money and \nbetter management--not one or the other. Both together are necessary to \nreally serve our veterans with the health care they deserve, which is \nfirst class, world class health care and nothing less. That is what our \nNation's heroes truly deserve, and more and more of them will be making \nuse of that health care--2 million more over the past 5 years and \nmillions more over the next 5 years. That burden is not something to be \naddressed at the margins. It has to be addressed head-on and fully and \ngenerously because that is the promise we made to our veterans--first \nclass, world class health care, and nothing less.\n  I will close by saying that accountability means something more than \njust firing corrupt or incompetent officials. It means holding them \nresponsible for criminal culpability when they cook the books, falsify \nrecords, make false statements, and in effect lie to the American \npeople as well as to their superiors in the VA. That will require a \ncriminal investigation by the Department of Justice, which is the only \nlaw enforcement agency that has the resources, expertise, and authority \nto conduct a prompt and effective criminal investigation on the scope \nand scale that is required.\n  There are more than 50 locations where evidence of criminal \nculpability has been found. Thirteen percent of VA schedulers have \nindicated to the auditors that they were coerced or threatened into \nadopting, in effect, improper practices. Another 8 percent kept secret \nor unofficial lists, and many at those facilities and others may have \ncooked the books. I am not jumping to conclusions. I am not rushing to \njudgment. That is why an investigation is necessary and appropriate.\n  Only the Department of Justice can convene a grand jury. Only the \nDepartment of Justice has the FBI resources. The VA inspector general \nhas 165 investigators for the whole country, and that is not enough. \nThat is simply not sufficient for this investigation.\n  The VA is overwhelmed and overworked in its health care facilities, \ncaseloads, and the needs that VA clients and patients are bringing to \nthese facilities. The VA does some things very well when it comes to \namputees, post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, and many kinds \nof injuries associated with the battlefield. Combat medicine is more \nadvanced than it has ever been before, and the VA is part of a very \nprogressive effort to increase and to deliver health care more \nefficiently to that population.\n  But the population of veterans who have fought in the longest wars in \nour history--although they may be a smaller part of our population than \never before in our wars--has been through multiple deployments, and \nthey deserve the kind of intensive and comprehensive health care that \nthe VA has committed to provide, and that will take more resources.\n  This bill is a beginning. It is only a downpayment on what we owe our \nNation's finest and bravest. We owe them the best that we can provide \nin health care and nothing less. That is part of what we promised, and \nthat promise must be fulfilled. Thanks to the action of this body today \nwe have begun on that path.\n\n  I urge the House of Representatives to adopt this measure and to help \nus fulfill that promise. I hope they will do it soon.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3598-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3598-S3599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of World Refugee \nDay on June 20. On December 4, 2000, the United Nations General \nAssembly decided to designate June 20 as World Refugee Day. Each year \non this day, we have an opportunity to honor the women, men, and \nchildren who have faced such extreme persecution, conflict, and \nviolence that they have been forced to flee their homes and their \ncommunities. I am as saddened by their losses as I am impressed by the \nstrength, courage, and resilience demonstrated by their commitment to \nprotecting their families and building new communities around the \nworld.\n  There are more than 45 million refugees and internally displaced \npersons globally. With so many people unable to return to their homes, \nI am proud to be part of a nation that was built on the basic principle \nthat all men and women were created equal and that all people have \nbasic rights, no matter where they come from. Since 1975, our great \nNation has welcomed more than 3 million refugees, and we continue to \nallow thousands of refugees to permanently relocate here every year. \nThe United States is also the world's largest donor to the Office of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n  Today, we recognize that every minute, eight people leave everything \nbehind to escape war, persecution, or terror. We recognize that nearly \nhalf of all refugees are younger than 18 years old. We recognize that, \neven after fleeing from conflict and persecution, refugees continue to \nface numerous challenges, from providing food for their families to \npersevering through homesickness and loss. We recognize that we are a \nnation that shares our home with those who cannot return to their own.\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3599-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to support the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. This bill would allow \neligible students refinance their Federal loans, transfer private loans \ninto Federal loans with better interest rates, and eliminates tax \nloopholes for millionaires and billionaires. This bill would help more \nthan 25 million students in the United States, including 481,000 \nstudent borrowers in Maryland.\n  Middle-class families and their children deserve a fair shot at \nhigher education. Students deserve fair, affordable loans to help them \nget the education they need to succeed, and the working women of \nAmerica deserve a fair shot at fair pay with equal pay for equal work. \nRight now, millions of American students are graduating from college \nand universities, but as they are handed their diplomas, they are being \nhanded a lifetime of debt. The average student debt for 2012 college \ngraduates was $29,400, and for the first time in U.S. history, student \nloan debt topped credit card debt at $1 trillion. When you are fresh \nout of college and paying living expenses and investing in a 401(k), \nthese loans add up and become burdensome.\n  This especially affects young women struggling to pay debts against a \nwage gap. College-educated women earn just 82 cents for every dollar a \nman makes, but they don't get an 18 percent wage gap discount on their \nstudent loans. How can we expect women to achieve their dream when they \nare burdened with crippling debt and fighting against a wage gap that \ncontinues to grow over time?\n  Recently, a Maryland woman wrote to me. She is a single mother and \nwas on welfare for 9 months after giving birth to her son but said she \ndid not want to become a statistic. She pursued higher education so she \ncould improve her life. She got a bachelor's degree and a master's \ndegree and graduated in the top 5 percent of her class. While attending \nschool, she worked full time and raised her son. She enrolled in an \nincome-based loan program and despite paying more than requested each \nmonth, her interest rate has increased. She cannot care for her son and \npay off $63,000 in student loans without assistance in refinancing her \nloans.\n  The women of America want more. Women make up almost half of the \nworkforce and 40 percent are the sole breadwinners for families but \nstill only make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. African-American \nwomen earn 62 cents and Hispanic women earn 54 cents. Even if they have \nthe same grades, degree, and job title, women are consistently paid \nless in their first job out of college. On average, women will lose \nmore than $431,000 over their lifetimes because of the wage gap. This \ndoesn't just affect student loans; It affects their contributions to \nSocial Security, pensions, and retirement security.\n  I am so proud of America's women. We have accomplished so much. We \nhave gone to space, become CEOs of Fortune 500 Companies and even made \nit into the U.S. Senate. Today, women are graduating from higher \neducation in record numbers. It is time to help them get a fair shot at \nachieving their dreams. That starts with equal pay.\n  Getting a college education is the core of the American dream. I am \nfighting to make sure that every student has access to that dream. \nLet's work together to make sure that when students graduate, their \nfirst mortgage isn't their student debt. Carrying the burden of student \nloans drags down young people's financial future, making it harder to \nbuy a home, start a family, or save for retirement. I support Senator \nWarren's bill because it reduces debt and fights for American families. \nIt lowers interest rates, giving everyone a fair shot at repaying their \nloans for a more secure financial future because women deserve a fair \nshot at getting equal pay for equal work.\n  I have said this often, but we in this country enjoy many freedoms: \nthe freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of \nreligion. But there is an implicit freedom our constitution doesn't lay \nout in writing, but its promise has excited the passions, hopes, and \ndreams of people in this country since its founding. The freedom to \ntake whatever talents God has given you, to fill whatever passion is in \nyour heart, to learn so you can earn and make a contribution--the \nfreedom to achieve.\n  When I was a young girl at a Catholic all-girls school, my Mom and \nDad made it clear they wanted me to go to college. But right around \ngraduation my family was going through a rough time because my Dad's \ngrocery store had suffered a terrible fire. I offered to put off \ncollege and work at the grocery store until the business got back on \nits feet. My Dad said, ``Barb, you have to go. Your mother and I will \nfind a way, because no matter what happens to you, no one can ever take \nthat degree away from you. The best way I can protect you is to make \nsure you can earn a living all of your life.'' My father gave me the \nfreedom to achieve. And this legislation will give millions of \nAmericans that same freedom without adding a dime to the deficit.\n  Senator Warren's legislation should be passed in a swift, \nexpeditious, and uncluttered way. It gives our students access to the \nAmerican dream. It gives our young people access to the freedom to \nachieve, to be able to follow their talents, and to be able to achieve \nhigher education in whatever field they will be able to serve this \ncountry.\n  While our work isn't done when it comes to ensuring access to \naffordable higher education, this bill helps us get there. While these \nbills will fix the problem today, I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to figure out a longer-term solution.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act (S. 2432). Student \nloans in this country are at an unprecedented $1.2 trillion and now \nexceed credit card debt as the largest consumer debt market after \nmortgages. Unfortunately, unlike mortgages, student borrowers are \nunable to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and many \nborrowers are stuck in high fixed-rate loans for 20 or more years. This \nmeans that these borrowers must delay, or put off permanently, other \nfinancial decisions such as buying a home, saving for retirement, or \nstarting a small business. This is not just a ``young American'' \nissue--recent data shows that individuals of every demographic have \nincreasing student debt burden, and the impact of those with student \ndebt being unable to fully participate in the economy will affect all \nAmericans for years to come.\n  This issue is particularly important to me, as South Dakota has the \nhighest proportion in the country of residents with student loan debt. \nThat is why I have signed on to co-sponsor Senator Warren's bill to \nrefinance student loans, and why, as chairman of the Banking Committee, \nwhich has jurisdiction over student loans made by private lenders, I \nwill work to consider all actions that can be taken to address both \nexisting and future student debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3599-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3599-S3600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RELEASE OF CRIMINAL ALIENS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the last few weeks, startling data \nfrom the Obama Administration has revealed that the Department of \nHomeland Security has released over 36,000 aliens with criminal \nconvictions into the United States.\n  According to responses to some Members of Congress, Secretary Johnson \nhas acknowledged that 36,007 convicted criminal aliens were released \nfrom Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in fiscal year 2013. \nMany of these aliens had multiple convictions. In fact, among the \n36,007 aliens released, they had nearly 88,000 convictions.\n  Data prepared by ICE, and reported by the Center for Immigration \nStudies, shows that among the criminally convicted aliens released into \nAmerican communities were: 193 homicide convictions, including one \nwillful killing of a public official with a gun, 426 sexual assault \nconvictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 1,075 aggravated assault \nconvictions, 1,160 stolen vehicle convictions, 9,187 dangerous drug \nconvictions, and 16,070 drunk or drugged driving convictions.\n  I have repeatedly said that this administration has failed the \nAmerican public by refusing to enforce the laws on the books. This \nadministration has turned a blind eye to those who have broken the law \nand have irresponsibly exercised their executive authority to find a \nway to allow people here unlawfully to remain in the country.\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\n  In failing to enforce the immigration laws, the administration has \nbetrayed its responsibility to protect the public safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  President Obama's administration has continually stated that they are \nfocused on enforcement against the worst of the worst convicted \ncriminals. Yet they are releasing thousands of aliens every year with \nserious and, in many cases, violent criminal convictions.\n  ICE has responded to criticism by declaring that many of the \nindividuals released were under supervisory restrictions. These \nrestrictions range from bond to ankle bracelets to a periodic telephone \ncall to a designated ICE phone line. Some individuals, however, are \nissued an order of recognizance and therefore are under no supervision \nat all.\n  Is the American public supposed to feel safer because the same \nadministration that released violent criminals into our communities \nclaims to be monitoring them? Is the American public supposed to trust \nthese aliens convicted of crimes and are here unlawfully to follow the \nterms of their release?\n  Despite requests, ICE has failed to specify the nature of the release \nconditions placed upon these violent criminal aliens. In the interest \nof public safety, we should all demand to know the release conditions \nof those aliens released who have been convicted of violent crimes.\n  The administration is also claiming that many of the individuals they \nreleased in 2013 were due to the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision in \nZadvydas v. Davis. This decision limited the Federal Government's \nability to detain aliens who have been ordered removed.\n  This case sets the pitiful precedent that aliens subject to final \norders of removal, including ones convicted of a crime, cannot be held \nlonger than 6 months and will be released in the United States if their \nhome country refuses to take them back or their home country simply \ndelays the U.S. government's request for a travel document. Other \ncountries know that--because of the ruling in Zadvydas--they can simply \nrun out the clock on issuing travel documents for the criminally \nconvicted individual. Therefore, we have aliens, with no legal right to \nbe in the United States, unwanted by their own country, being released \ninto the country by our own administration.\n  This Supreme Court decision has had a detrimental effect on our \nability to obtain travel documents from foreign countries and \neffectuate removal orders. Many countries refuse to take back their \ncriminal aliens, leaving us no choice but to release them into our own \ncommunities.\n  This precedent needs to be corrected. The administration has relied \nupon the ruling in Zadvydas to release thousands of criminally \nconvicted aliens. However, they have refused to help fix it. In fact, \nthe Senate immigration reform bill that they supported does not include \na fix to the 2001 Supreme Court decision. They have not asked Congress \nto extend the length of time they are allowed to detain foreign \nnationals with final orders of removal.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring the ``Keeping Our Communities Safe \nAct'' being introduced today by the Senator from Oklahoma. His bill \nwould close the legal loophole that requires ICE to release dangerous \ncriminals onto the streets of America. It would allow ICE to detain \nnon-removable immigrants beyond six months if the alien is a national \nsecurity threat or is a threat to the safety of the community and has a \npast violent crime conviction.\n  In addition to hiding behind the Supreme Court decision, the \nadministration has refused to use the tools at its disposal to get \ncountries to cooperate. Federal law allows the Secretary of State to \ndiscontinue granting visas to all residents of a country that refuses \nor unreasonably delays taking back its aliens facing deportation from \nthe United States.\n  Secretary Johnson, at a House Judiciary 2 weeks ago, acknowledged \nthat in his capacity as Secretary, his department has never asked the \nDepartment of State to use this authority. This visa sanction authority \nhas only been invoked one time, in 2011 against Guayana, within 2 \nmonths Guayana issued travel documents for 112 of 113 aliens ordered \nremoved from the United States to Guayana. This tactic has been proven \neffective and Secretary Johnson should be employing this measure.\n  Of the 36,000 persons released in 2013, ICE claims that 3,652 were \ndue to the 2001 Supreme Court decision. So, only a small portion of \nthose released were mandatorily released under Zadvydas.\n  While thousands of criminally convicted aliens have been released \ninto the United States, both at ICE's discretion and due to bad Supreme \nCourt precedent, President Obama has called for a reduction of \nimmigration detention capacity by 10 percent.\n  The simplicity of this idea seriously calls into question this \nadministration's management capabilities. The fact that thousands of \npeople are being released from detention clearly suggests that ICE \nneeds more beds, not less, in order to avoid releasing more criminally \nconvicted aliens into America.\n  This administration is knowingly putting the safety of the American \npeople at risk. Releasing violent criminals into the American \npopulation should cause great doubt about this administration's ability \nto enforce current immigration laws.\n  ICE needs to provide the American people with more information about \nthe criminal aliens it releases. ICE needs to tell the American people \nwhat terms of release are given to what criminal offenses. ICE needs to \ntell the American people what types of criminal offenses it deems \nappropriate to release at their own discretion.\n  ICE needs to tell the American people how many of these criminally \nconvicted aliens comply with the terms of their release. ICE needs to \ntell the American people how many of these criminally convicted aliens \ncommit further crimes after being released. ICE needs to tell the \nAmerican people how many of these criminally convicted aliens who are \nreleased become fugitives.\n  This administration tells us to trust them. They say they are \nremoving more people than ever before. They claim the immigration bill \npassed by this body will solve our problems. Yet they have failed us \nand the American people. They continue to turn a blind eye to \nlawbreakers and refuse to take this matter seriously.\n  There should be more outrage about the news coming from this \nadministration. Releasing 36,000 criminal aliens is a serious matter \nand one that better be fixed soon for the sake of the American public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3600-S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LAUCK NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

When confirmed, \nHannah will become the first woman judge on the Federal trial bench in \nRichmond, VA.\n  Hannah is exceptionally well qualified to carry out the duties and \nresponsibilities of a Federal district judge.\n  Hannah earned her bachelor's degree, magna cum laude, in 1986 from \nWellesley College, where she was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\n  She went on to receive her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1991. While \nin law school she directed the Homelessness Clinic and served on the \nboard of the Initiative for Public Interest Law.\n  Hannah began her legal career in the Eastern District of Virginia \nserving as a clerk for Judge James Spencer. Judge Spencer--a Reagan \nappointee to the bench--is extremely well-regarded in Richmond for his \nlegal acumen, honest nature, and service to the community and will be \ntaking senior status this year.\n  Coming full circle, Hannah has now been selected to fill the seat of \nJudge Spencer, her mentor and for whom she clerked right out of law \nschool.\n  From 1994 to 2004, she served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the \nEastern District of Virginia where she handled both civil defense \nmatters as well as criminal prosecutions.\n  Following a brief stint in the private sector, Hannah became a U.S. \nMagistrate judge in the Eastern District of Virginia, where she has \nserved since 2005.\n  As a magistrate judge, she helped begin one of the first Federal \nreentry courts, which is designed to reduce recidivism of individuals \nreleased from prison who have serious addictions. These reentry courts \nare crucial to our\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\nefforts to reduce prison overcrowding and ensure we are helping people \nwho have made mistakes in life become productive members of society.\n  She is also an active member of her community where she has helped \ntrain the next generation of legal experts.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Madison County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Madison County worth over $831,434 \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $3.5 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is the \ncommunity's hard work to secure funding made available in various farm \nbill programs and particularly Madison County Memorial Hospital's \npurchase of a mammography machine. I lost two sisters to breast cancer \nand know the devastating toll it takes on those who have it and their \nfamilies and communities. That is why I have championed prevention and \nwellness throughout my career, especially early detection. I have also \ndramatically increased funding for cancer research at the National \nInstitutes of Health and established the Department of Defense's breast \ncancer research program. I applaud your community's dedication to early \ndetection of breast cancer. Ensuring Iowans have access to quality, \naffordable health care is critical--particularly for those in rural \nareas, who may find this care out of reach. I am pleased that the \nhospital is equipped with the equipment and facilities to care for \nMadison County residents and promote wellness in the area.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Madison County has received $631,434 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Madison County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $20,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Madison County has received more than $596,024 \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Madison \nCounty's fire departments have received over $456,845 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nMadison County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Madison County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Madison \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. Of course, this \nwork is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I have no \nintention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, richer Iowa. \nI will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve the \npeople of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3601-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3601-S3602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STORY COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

I take pride \nin accomplishments that have been national in scope for instance, \npassing the Americans with Disabilities Act and spearheading successful \nfarm bills. But I take a very special pride in projects that have made \na big difference in local communities across my State.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Story County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Story County worth over $750 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $200 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course, I have many favorite memories of working together \nincluding dozens of projects worth more than $200 million at Iowa State \nUniversity like the Community Vitality Center that supports Iowa's \nsmall and medium-sized communities, funding $468 million toward \nconstruction and programming for a state-of-the-art national animal \ndisease laboratory and jail-based meth treatment for non-violent \noffenders provided by the Story County Sherriff's Department.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Central Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Story \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Story \nCounty, I have fought for more than $55 million for innovate businesses \nin Ames such as Etrema Products, Bioprotection Systems, Advanced \nAnalytical, and Powerfilm, helping to create jobs and expand economic \nopportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like Story \nCity to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Story County has earned \n$221,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings; they build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Story County has received $535,488 in Harkin grants.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency \nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster; it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nStory County has received over $2.4 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.

Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Story County has received more than $87 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Story County's \nfire departments have received over $2 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment and more than $470,000 in Byrne Justice \nAssistance Grant funding.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize artist \nRon Spears for sharing his talents to create the Nevada Statehood \nForever Stamp, almost 150 years following Nevada's entrance into the \nwar-torn union.\n  This year commemorates a very special year in Nevada's history during \nwhich we celebrate 150 years of statehood. From those days of bitter \nconflict, Nevada forged a State dedicated to preserving liberty and \nbettering America. Our dramatic entrance is why our State calls itself \nBattle Born and why Nevadans, over the past 150 years, have been \nentrepreneurial, fiercely independent, and as diverse as our terrain. \nIt is an honor to recognize the\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nartist who painted and captured the essence of the Nevada statehood in \nthe Forever Stamp.\n  A resident of Reno, NV, Ron Spears is a university professor with a \nmaster's in fine art. His career is decorated with many different \nprojects, ranging from illustrations on casino games, book covers, \nmagazine articles, and even illustrations for Magic: The Gathering, \nDungeons and Dragons, Harry Potter Card Game, Upper Deck, Blizzard \nEntertainment, and others. Now, Ron can add the Nevada Statehood \nForever Stamp to his long list of works of art. His contribution to our \nState's history is something to be both commended and applauded. Ron's \ncreativity glows from this stamp commemorating Nevada's \nsesquicentennial.\n  The brilliance and the vision that Ron discovered on his 2-year \ntravels throughout this great State exemplifies the very inspiration \nthat was born on October 31, 1864. Just beyond the neon lights of the \nLas Vegas Strip sits the stunning red rocks and bright blue skies that \nset the stage for a destination that is hard to miss, the Valley of \nFire, Nevada's oldest State park. The magnificent formations of \nsandstone and dunes are what make this park a truly unique and \nbrilliant place, one that I am glad was captured for our stamp. To say \nthat I was struck by Ron's workmanship and vision would be an \nunderstatement.\n  I am truly proud that we are able to showcase this incredible \nachievement that I am sure will serve as a model for other artists and \npioneers, right here in Nevada. Today I ask my colleagues and residents \nof the Silver State to join me in recognizing Ron for this great \nachievement and honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3603-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MR.

VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory of \nHank Lauricella, a beloved community leader from Harahan, LA, who \ntragically passed away in March of this year. Hank was born in 1930 and \nwould have turned 84 on October 19.\n  I was truly honored to serve with Hank in the Louisiana Legislature, \nalbeit in different bodies. In all of my many dealings with Hank, he \nwas a pure class act and a truly dedicated public servant. Hank was \nnever a show horse out to grab media or other attention. He was a \nworkhorse who got important, concrete things done, particularly in the \narea of economic development and transportation infrastructure.\n  Hank was born in Harahan, LA, and attended Holy Cross High School. \nFollowing his time at Holy Cross High School, Hank attended the \nUniversity of Tennessee, where he received his bachelors of science in \nbusiness administration. While at Tennessee, Hank was a standout \nathlete who gained immense national recognition. He was a member of the \n1951 national championship team at the University of Tennessee and was \nfirst runner-up for the Heisman Trophy. In 1981, Hank was appropriately \nelected to the College Football Hall of Fame.\n  Following his college career and a year playing professional football \nwith the Dallas Texans, Hank served as a first lieutenant in the U.S. \nArmy from 1953 to 1955, with 1 year of his service in Korea. After his \nservice in the Army, Hank returned to Louisiana where he joined the \nfamily business, John L. Lauricella and Sons, now known as Lauricella \nLand Company. In that role, Hank was instrumental in providing strong \nleadership in guiding the company as they transitioned from residential \nto commercial real estate development.\n  For over 30 years, Hank served the Jefferson Parish community and \nindeed all of Louisiana in both the State House and the State Senate. \nDuring his time in the State legislature, Hank made economic \ndevelopment one of his top priorities. Hank promoted legislation that \nbenefited the Louisiana Superdome, the Morial Convention Center, Louis \nArmstrong International Airport, the Port of New Orleans, and the \nPontchartrain Center. Hank also served as an effective leader in many \nother roles. He was an original member of the Superdome Stadium \nCommission and played an instrumental role in the construction of the \nSuperdome. Hank served on the boards for the Port of New Orleans, the \nWorld Trade Center of New Orleans, the Jefferson Business Council, and \nhe served as the first chairman of the Board of the Jefferson Community \nFoundation.\n  Hank Lauricella was a man of many talents and interests. Not only was \nHank a superior athlete, he also had a passion for gardening and \ncooking. He loved to cook using the tomatoes, basil, and rosemary that \nhe grew in his own garden.\n  Of course Hank is lovingly remembered by his wife of 61 years, Betty, \nhis four sons and one daughter, and his fifteen grandchildren. But well \nbeyond that, Hank is remembered as a great friend and true public \nservant by the entire extended community which he served so ably.\n  I am so pleased to join them in continuing to remember and honor Hank \nLauricella, a man who provided a great example of leadership through \nhis service to others and his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3603-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3603-S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4810.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n        Vitter, and Mr. Cruz):\n  S. 2463. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide for extensions of detention of certain aliens ordered removed, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a year ago this month I stood before you \nduring the Senate's debate on immigration to offer an amendment that \nwould prevent convicted criminal aliens from being released back into \nour communities. Unfortunately, my amendment never came up for a vote \ndespite the fact that this is an issue that should concern us all.\n  This problem arises from a couple of Supreme Court decisions in 2001 \nand 2005, which held that immigrants who have been ordered removed \ncannot be detained for more than 6 months. Even though an alien is an \naggravated felon or has committed a crime of violence, they must be \nreleased back into society if no other country will accept them.\n  By releasing these criminals back into our communities we are \nallowing\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\nthem to commit even more crimes against Americans. For example, a \nVietnamese immigrant, Binh Thai Luc, was ordered deported after serving \ntime in prison for armed robbery and assault. Due to the Supreme Court \ndecision in Zadvydas v. Davis, Luc was released from U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, ICE, custody when Vietnam refused to admit \nhim. He is now facing charges for the murder of 5 people in San \nFrancisco in March of 2012. Five people would be alive today if our law \nenforcement officials had not been handcuffed by the Supreme Court.\n  From 2008-2012, nearly 17,000 immigrants with orders of removal were \nreleased back into our communities. Just last month, we learned that \nthis number has more than doubled in one year. In 2013 alone, more than \n36,000 criminally convicted aliens were released by ICE because their \nhome countries had yet to take them back.\n  That is an astonishing number, especially when you look at what \ncrimes these offenders have committed. These 36,000 criminals have been \nconvicted of more than 87,000 crimes, including: 193 homicide \nconvictions; 426 sexual assault convictions; 1,075 aggravated assault \nconvictions; and 16,070 DUI convictions.\n  These are convictions, not allegations. Convicted murderers, sex \noffenders, and other violent felons that have been ordered removed from \nour country are now free to live among us.\n  Today, in light of these revelations, I am reintroducing my amendment \nas a standalone bill along with Senators Grassley, Vitter, Cruz, and \nSessions. S. 2463, the Keep Our Communities Safe Act of 2014, amends \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Act to allow the Department of \nHomeland Security to detain non-removable immigrants beyond 6 months in \nspecific situations. These situations include circumstances when an \nalien's release would threaten national security, have serious adverse \nforeign policy consequences, or would threaten the safety of the \ncommunity and the alien either is an aggravated felon or has committed \na crime of violence.\n  Some organizations, such as the ACLU, believe this bill amounts to \nindefinite detention in violation of a criminal's due process rights. \nHowever, in addition to the specified circumstances of continued \ndetention mentioned earlier, this bill requires the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to recertify that a person is a threat \nevery 6 months. Furthermore, an alien can submit evidence for a review \nof his detention and aliens will still have access to our federal \ncourts, giving judges a say in the process.\n  I would like to commend my friend, Congressman Lamar Smith from \nTexas, for his good work on this in the House and I ask that both the \nSenate and the House take up consideration of the Keep Our Communities \nSafe Act to protect our fellow Americans from these violent offenders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/11/senate-section/article/S3606-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 469--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE MAY \n  31, 2014, TRANSFER OF FIVE DETAINEES FROM THE DETENTION FACILITY AT \n           UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nCornyn, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kirk, Mr. \nPaul, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Thune) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S. Res. 469\n\n       Whereas in enacting the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66), Congress provided \n     the executive branch with clear guidance and requirements for \n     transferring or releasing individuals from the detention \n     facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba;\n       Whereas the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2014 states the Secretary of Defense may transfer an \n     individual detained at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, if the Secretary determines, following \n     a review conducted in accordance with the requirements of \n     section 1023 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2012 (10 U.S.C. 801 note) and Executive Order No. \n     13567, that the individual is no longer a threat to the \n     United States, or the individual is ordered released by a \n     United States court, or such an individual can be transferred \n     if the Secretary determines that actions have been or are \n     planned to be taken which will substantially mitigate the \n     risk of the individual engaging or re-engaging in any \n     terrorist activity or other hostile activity that threatens \n     the United States or United States persons or interests and \n     the transfer is in the national security interest of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2014 states that the Secretary of Defense must notify \n     the appropriate committees of Congress of such a \n     determination not later than 30 days before the transfer or \n     release of the individual concerned from United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba;\n       Whereas the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2014 states that such a notification must include a \n     detailed statement of the basis for the transfer or release, \n     an explanation of why the transfer or release is in the \n     national security interests of the United States, a \n     description of any actions taken to mitigate the risks of \n     reengagement by the individual to be transferred or released, \n     a copy of any Periodic Review Board findings relating to the \n     individual, and a description of the evaluation conducted \n     pursuant to factors that must be considered prior to such a \n     transfer or release;\n       Whereas the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Public \n     Law 113-76) states that none of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available in that Act may be used to transfer \n     covered individuals detained at United States Naval Station \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, except in accordance with the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014;\n       Whereas on May 31, 2014, detainees Khairullah Khairkhwa, \n     Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mohammed Fazl, Noorullah Noori, and Mohammed \n     Nabi Omari were transferred from United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Qatar; and\n       Whereas the appropriate committees of Congress were not \n     notified of the transfers as required by the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 prior to the \n     transfers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the transfers of detainees Khairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul \n     Haq Wasiq, Mohammed Fazl, Noorullah Noori, and Mohammed Nabi \n     Omari from United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, \n     to Qatar on May 31, 2014, violated the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66) \n     and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Public Law \n     113-76);
