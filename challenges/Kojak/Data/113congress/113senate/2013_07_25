Mr. President, about 80 years ago when President Franklin \nRoosevelt first proposed Social Security as insurance against poverty \nin old age, the idea was controversial, new, never been done before, \nnothing like it. But in 1935, 97 Republicans joined Democrats in \nCongress to create one of the most successful programs--if not the most \nsuccessful program--in the history of our country and in the world.\n  Two decades, about sixty years later, President Dwight Eisenhower \nproposed the Nation's first interstate highway system, proposing the \ninvestment would pave the way for a new era of American growth.\n  Why did Dwight Eisenhower do this? As a young major in the Army, he \nwas directed to bring a convoy of troops and equipment across the \ncountry and he determined at that time something had to be done. The \nroads were nonexistent, and those that existed were not in very good \nshape. So when he became President, after having been such a successful \nleader of our efforts in World War II, he asked Congress to invest $50 \nbillion. Under present-day dollars, that would be about $500 billion. \nThat meant almost 50,000 miles of new highways.\n  There are still ideas out there we should do. Eisenhower, along with \nRoosevelt, did some things that were new and unique. But look back at \nwhat they did. Look at the good of Social Security. Look at the good of \nour interstate highway system.\n  With the highway bill, back in 1956, the bipartisan vote wasn't even \nclose. Listen to this: It passed the Senate 89-1. It was approved in \nthe House of Representatives by a voice vote.\n  About 40 years after President Roosevelt decided he should do \nsomething about taking care of people in their golden years here in \nAmerica, President Harry Truman envisioned a program that would protect \nevery senior citizen from illness and need. Well, 83 Republicans helped \nLyndon Johnson and Democrats in Congress create Medicare. Democratic \nPresident Roosevelt, Republican President Eisenhower, Democratic \nPresidents Truman and Johnson were the reason we have Medicare. Since \nthe law was enacted in 1965, poverty among seniors in this country has \ndecreased and life expectancy has increased every 10 years because of \nMedicare.\n  On each of these occasions I have talked about, and countless others \nthroughout the course of American history, lawmakers--divided by \npolitical\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\nparty--have united to pass important groundbreaking legislation. On the \nissues that matter most--when lives are at stake, when the country and \nthe economy of the country is at stake, when America's competitiveness \nis at stake--lawmakers, divided by political party, have been drawn \ntogether by shared priorities. It is time to renew that tradition.\n  Over the last 5 years, this Nation has dug its way out of the hole \ncreated by the great recession. I could go into reasons why the great \nrecession happened, but let's drop that for now. It happened. We have \nan opportunity now to come together again, this time to lay the \nfoundation for a stronger, smarter, and more competitive America.\n  As Democrats and Republicans came together in the past to ensure the \nhealth and dignity of our Nation's seniors, as Democrats and \nRepublicans came together to pave the way for a mobile and competitive \neconomy, so Democrats and Republicans today must come together to build \na future where hard work is all it takes to turn opportunity into \nprosperity.\n  Yesterday President Obama laid out a roadmap to restore that promise \nfor every American. The speech took an hour, but every minute of it was \nimportant. He laid out a vision to encourage responsible home \nownership, to educate a new generation of workers, and to create jobs \nrebuilding Eisenhower-era roadways and bridges.\n  Every day I am impressed by President Obama's focus on restoring a \nvibrant economy. And every day I am encouraged by his optimism that \nwith a little cooperation and the help of a few reasonable Republicans, \nwe can achieve that goal. We only need a handful of Republicans to \nbreak away from what has gone on this past 5 years. I look forward to \nhearing more details from the President about his proposals in the \ncoming days and weeks.\n  President Eisenhower understood that lawmakers--Republican or \nDemocrat--should be drawn together by shared priorities. We should all \nplay on the same team. This is what he said:\n\n       I have one yardstick by which I test every majority \n     problem--and that yardstick is: Is it good for America?\n\n  General Eisenhower was right then and he is right today.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, Congress has used that same measure. \nBut over the last 5 years, something has changed. When my Republican \ncounterpart said his No. 1 goal was to defeat President Obama, the \nwords ``at any cost'' were implied.\n  Since 2009, Republicans have refused to join Democrats in the \nimportant job of legislating. It has worked. They have refused to join \nus in leading, preferring instead to stake out ideological territory or \ntry to score political points. Republicans have balked at new ideas. \nBut they have also balked at old ideas they once supported, solely \nbecause those ideas are now favored by President Obama. This kind of \nopposition for opposition's sake has resulted in gridlock and \ndysfunction and bitter bipartisanship, hostage-taking and standoffs.\n  I was on a long interview on public broadcasting yesterday. They \nasked, What about the numbers of Congress being so low? I said, I \nhaven't gotten a call from any of the pollsters, but if I had, I would \nagree with this number. Congress is dysfunctional, and that is unfair \nto the American people. It has made it almost impossible for Congress \nto advance the big ideas, to achieve the big things, to realize the big \ndreams it once could. But it is not too late for reasonable people from \nboth parties and on both sides of the Capitol to change that. It is not \ntoo late for lawmakers, divided by political party but sharing the same \npriorities, to unite to pass important legislation.\n  Like President Obama, I am an optimist. I remain hopeful despite the \ndisagreements and difficulties over the last 5 years. I am hopeful my \nRepublican colleagues are using the same yardstick as I am. And I know \nthey are asking themselves, as I am, Is it good for America?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5926-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, like the President, I appreciate a good \nliterary reference every now and then. Placed in the proper context, a \ncitation from some great writer or thinker can sum up a vision and \ninspire people.\n  When Douglas MacArthur bade farewell to West Point, he echoed an \nancient thinker's ominous warning that ``only the dead have seen the \nend of war.'' And the biblical references in JFK's famous inaugural \naddress represent another classic use of the well-placed quote.\n  But I think a lot of people are still scratching their heads about \nPresident Obama's promise yesterday to bring Americans an ``ocean of \ntomorrows.'' Frankly, I don't even think that Carl Sandburg fans out \nthere would get it. I wonder: Does he? Because the President himself \nsaid his speech probably wouldn't change any minds.\n  Even the advisers who endlessly hyped this thing more or less \nconceded there wouldn't be any there there--no groundbreaking \nproposals, no tack to the center, no promise to finally start working \ncollaboratively with Congress. Well, they were right. So you have to \nask, what was the point?\n  Look, this President is a terrific campaigner. We all recognize that. \nHe has a way with words too. But at some point campaign season has to \nend and the working with others season has to begin. At some point you \nhave to stop promising an ocean of tomorrows and start actually working \nwith the representatives of the people. Because, let's be perfectly \nclear, Americans aren't worried about how many tomorrows there are to \ncome. They are worried about what those tomorrows will actually bring: \nthe bills in tomorrow's mail, the cuts in tomorrow's paycheck, the \naffordability of tomorrow's health costs. These are the things that \ncan't be addressed with reheated speeches or clever quotes. They \nrequire actually working with people, including those you might not \nalways agree with.\n  For instance, going around telling people ObamaCare is working the \nway it is supposed to or that it is fabulous or wonderful, as several \nof our Democratic friends have done, doesn't change reality. It is just \nwords. It doesn't change the fact that recent surveys show only 13 \npercent of Americans now believe the law will help them or that about \nhalf believe it will make things worse for the middle class or that \nactuaries are now predicting cost increases of 30 percent or more in my \nhome State of Kentucky.\n  I know the President likes to point to the few places, as he did \nyesterday, where premiums might actually drop under ObamaCare, but he \nis basically silent on the places where it has been announced that \npremiums will go up under ObamaCare, and he will not say a word about \nall the people who have lost their jobs or seen their pay cut.\n  For instance, the Washington Post recently profiled a part-time \ncollege professor from Virginia who, like many in his situation, will \nsee his hours slashed as a result of this law. As the Post put it:\n\n       For [this man], the President's health care law could have \n     meant better health insurance. Instead, it produced a pay \n     cut.\n\n  And, many would agree, not for the better, especially for the growing \nnumber of Americans forced into part-time work with fewer hours and \nsmaller paychecks as a result.\n  One part-time waitress interviewed in another paper said:\n\n       I can't believe I voted for this. This is not the change I \n     wanted, and it feels like there's no hope.\n\n  So if the President is ready to pivot from campaign mode to governing \nmode, he can start by dropping the misleading claims and admitting what \npretty much everybody knows: that a lot of Americans are going to feel \nthe pain once this ocean-full of tomorrows finally crashes ashore. \nAmericans are worried, and I don't blame them.\n  Just last week, as I often do, I met with employers from around \nKentucky who expressed continued concerns about the impact this law \nwill have on their operations. They want the Democrats who run the \nSenate to follow the lead of the House in delaying ObamaCare for \neveryone, both businesses and individuals, and they know it makes sense \nto do so. I know they want the President to sign the bill when it \npasses, and I agree he should. It would be a great first step toward\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nimplementing the permanent delay our country needs--a delay that would \ngive Republicans and Democrats the chance to start over and work \ntogether, this time on a bipartisan step-by-step set of health reforms \nthat would actually lower costs.\n  But we cannot get there until the President changes his mindset, \nuntil he puts the poetry down for a moment, flips the campaign switch \noff and the governing switch on. When he does, I think he will be \nsurprised to find just how many Republicans want to do exactly what we \nhave said all along--to work with him on solutions to get our economy \nmoving, our jobs growing, and our health care more affordable. We are \nwaiting. Americans are waiting. I hope he will finally be ready soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5927-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a problem I have \nspoken about many times over the past 3 years, beginning with debate on \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill. That bill, which Congress \npassed in July 2010, contained a provision I authored with my \nRepublican colleague Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Our provision \ngave the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to issue \nrules to address the conflicts of interest inherent in the credit \nrating industry--conflicts of interest which contributed mightily to \nour recent financial collapse and which have continued to plague that \nindustry through today.\n  I am speaking about this issue again because even though the \nconflicts continue to put our economy at risk, the SEC still has not \nproposed meaningful reforms. The SEC has studied the issue, the \nFinancial Crisis Inquiry Commission has studied the issue, and the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations has studied the issue. Now it \nis time to move forward and take action on the issue.\n  Let me start off by briefly reminding everyone what this conflict of \ninterest is about and why it is important. In the years leading up to \n2008 financial collapse the credit rating agencies were enjoying \nmassive profits and booming business. There is nothing inherently wrong \nwith massive profits and booming business, but there was one \nfundamental problem: Booming business was coming at the expense of \naccurate credit ratings, which is supposed to be the entire reason for \nthe existence of the credit rating agencies.\n  Credit rating agencies were and still are paid to issue ratings \ndirectly by the big Wall Street banks issuing the paper and requesting \nthe ratings. If a rating agency--let's say Moody's--does not provide \nthe triple-A rating the bank wants, the bank can then just take its \nbusiness over to Fitch or S That is called ratings shopping, and it \ncontinues to this day. The opportunity for ratings shopping creates an \nincentive for the credit raters to give out those triple-A ratings even \nwhen they are not warranted, and that is exactly what happened with the \nsubprime mortgage-backed securities that played such a crucial role in \nthe financial crisis--and it happened over and over. It became \ningrained in the culture of the industry.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator \nLevin, took a close look at the big three rating agencies, examined \nmillions of pages of documents, and released an extensive report \ndetailing the internal communications at Moody's, S, and Fitch. Among \nthe many troubling e-mails, there is one in particular from an S \nofficial that sums up the prevailing attitude quite nicely: ``Let's \nhope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards \nfalters.''\n  With all the risky bets in the financial sector--and bets on those \nbets--our financial sector indeed became a house of cards. But without \nthe conduct of the credit raters, the house of cards would have been \njust one card tall.\n  Two years after that e-mail was written, that house of cards did not \njust falter, it collapsed. Because that house of cards had grown \nseveral stories high, when it collapsed it brought down the entire \nAmerican economy with it. The financial meltdown cost Americans $3.4 \ntrillion in retirement savings. It triggered the worst crisis since the \nGreat Depression with its massive business failures and mass \nforeclosures and job losses and the explosion of our national debt.\n  The crisis profoundly affected the everyday lives of millions of \nAmericans in so many negative ways, including in Minnesota. People lost \ntheir homes, their jobs, their retirement savings, and their health \ninsurance.\n  I have previously shared on the floor the story of my constituent \nDave Berg from Eden Prairie, MN. He testified at a field hearing I had \nin May of 2010 and told his story about having to start over--finding a \nnew job and rebuilding his retirement savings--at 57 years of age. His \nreflections on his experience in the recession mirror those of millions \nof other Americans.\n  He said:\n\n       The downturn of the economy, caused in part by the abuses \n     on Wall Street, led to the loss of my retirement security. \n     Reforming the way Wall Street operates is important to me \n     personally, because I have a lot of saving yet to do--and I \n     simply cannot afford another Wall Street meltdown. I need to \n     have confidence in the markets--and I need to know there is \n     accountability to those who caused a financial crisis.\n\n  It is hard to overestimate the extent to which the credit rating \nagencies contributed to the financial crisis in which millions like \nDave Berg lost their jobs, their homes, and far too many Minnesotans \nhad their hopes for the future dashed.\n  These Americans are not necessarily seeking retribution from Wall \nStreet. They just need to be assured it will not happen again. They \nknow there is a problem and the problem needs to be fixed.\n  We do not need further proof of that, but we get it in the February \ncomplaint filed by Department of Justice against S in which DOJ \nalleges--as it stated when it filed the complaint--that the credit \nrating agency ``falsely represented that its ratings were objective, \nindependent, and uninfluenced by S's relationships with investment \nbanks when, in actuality, S's desire for increased revenue and market \nshare led it to favor the interest of these banks over investors.''\n  The complaint highlights the patently problematic way the credit \nrating agencies habitually did business. One e-mail obtained in that \ninvestigation from a high-level S official reads:\n\n       We are meeting with your group this week to discuss \n     adjusting criteria for rating CDO's of real estate assets . . \n     . because of the ongoing threat of losing deals.\n\n  CDOs--collateralized debt obligations--are one of those derivatives, \nor bets, that added stories to the house of cards. This official had \napparently become so comfortable with the culture of conflicts of \ninterest that he appeared to have no reservations about putting it in \nwriting.\n  In fact, a while ago, S asked the judge in the case to throw out \nthe Justice Department lawsuit against them by pointing to a previous \ndecision made by a U.S. district court judge in an earlier securities \nfraud case against them. That earlier suit against the S had been \nfiled by shareholders who said they had bought their shares believing \nthat S's ratings were independent and objective--as the S had\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nlong declared. But the judge in the earlier case dismissed the \nshareholders' suit, finding that the S's statements that their \nratings were independent and objective were ``mere puffery.'' In other \nwords, no one could take S's statements about their ratings \nobjectivity and independence seriously. It was just puffery and \nadvertising that no one could believe.\n  Very recently, S tried to use--in the Department of Justice's case \nagainst them in their filing--the earlier ``puffery'' ruling to try to \nget the Justice Department suit thrown out against them. So S's legal \nargument was that no one could reasonably think that they had a \nreputation for producing independent and credible ratings.\n  Thankfully, earlier this month, the judge in the DOJ suit ruled that \nthe DOJ suit could go forward and said last week he found S's puffery \ndefense to be ``deeply and unavoidably troubling.''\n  S's rationale should strike us all as deeply and unavoidably \ntroubling because their legal defense--this is S's legal defense--\nsaid no one could possibly rely on their ratings. But their job is to \nprovide independent, objective, and accurate ratings. Millions of \nAmericans lost their jobs because S didn't do its job. S didn't do \ntheir one job. They have one job and that is to provide accurate \nratings. They didn't do their one job. They have no other job.\n  I am glad the Department of Justice is pursuing this case, but DOJ's \naction is not enough. It is backward-looking and addresses past harms. \nMy concern is that the conduct continues to this day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 more \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I am glad the DOJ is going forward in \npursuing this case, but as I said it is not enough. It is backward-\nlooking and addresses past harms. My concern is that the conduct \ncontinues to this day. The credit raters are still influenced by the \nrelationships with the banks because that is who pays them. It is a \nclear conflict of interest, and we need to prioritize actions that will \nprevent another meltdown in the future.\n  The Dodd-Frank provision I wrote with Senator Wicker, if implemented \nin full, would root out the conflicts of interest from the issuer pays \nmodel. The amendment we offered and the Senate passed directed the SEC, \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, to create an independent self-\nregulatory organization that would select which agency--one with the \nadequate capacity and expertise--would provide the initial credit \nrating of each structured financial product.\n  The assignments would not be based just on the agency's capacity and \nexpertise but also, after time, on its track record. Our approach would \nincentivize and reward excellence. The current pay-for-play model--with \nits inherent conflict of interest--would be replaced by a pay-for \nperformance model. This improved market finally allows smaller rating \nagencies to break the Big Three's oligopoly.\n  The oligopoly is clear. The SEC estimates that as of December 31, \n2011, approximately 91 percent of the credit ratings for structured \nfinance products were issued by the three largest credit rating \nagencies--Fitch, Moody's, and S of which was implicated in the \nPSI investigation. The other five agencies doing structured finance \nmake up the remaining 9 percent.\n  The current oligopoly does not incentivize accuracy. However, if we \nmove to a system based on merit, the smaller credit rating agencies \nwould be better able to participate and serve as a check against \ninflated ratings, thereby helping to prevent another meltdown.\n  In our proposed model, the independent board would be comprised \nmainly of investor types--managers of university endowments and pension \nfunds--who have the greatest stake in the reliability of credit \nratings, as well as representatives from the credit rating agencies, \nthe banking industries, and academics who have studied this issue.\n  Our amendment passed the Senate with a large majority, including 11 \nRepublican votes. This is not a progressive or conservative idea, it is \na commonsense idea.\n  The final version of Dodd-Frank modified the amendment and, to be \nfrank, put more decisionmaking authority in the hands of the SEC as to \nhow to respond to the problem of conflicts of interest in the credit \nrating agency industry. The final version directed the SEC to study the \nproposals that Senator Wicker and I made, along with other \nalternatives, and then decide how to act.\n  The SEC released its study in December. The study acknowledged the \nconflicts of interest in the credit rating industry and reviewed our \nproposal and many of the alternatives. They laid out the pros and cons \nof each proposal without reaching a definitive conclusion on which \nroute to pursue.\n  The study also proposed holding a roundtable discussion to further \nexamine reform opportunities. This SEC convened this roundtable on May \n14, and both Senator Wicker and I had the opportunity to present \nopening remarks. Bloomberg News had a good article on the roundtable on \nMarch 14, including several key quotes that I am going to use in my \nremarks. The roundtable provided a rigorous examination of our proposal \nand of the alternatives.\n  One executive who was from a smaller rating agency endorsed the \nconcept of a rotating assignment system to help break up the current \noligopoly. Jules Kroll, the CEO of Kroll Bonding Credit Agency, said of \nthe Big Three: ``They're selling themselves out, just as they did \nbefore.''\n  The Big Three were also represented at the roundtable. An S \nrepresentative argued against meaningful reform by suggesting that ``a \ngovernment assignment system could create uncertainty, could slow down \nmarkets, and disrupt capital flows at a time when we could least afford \nit.'' He didn't mention puffery. Unsurprisingly, I disagree with his \ncharacterization and would indeed suggest that what we can least afford \nis to maintain the status quo.\n  An alternative proposal, the continuation of the 17g-5 proposal, was \nmet with more than a little skepticism. The 17g-5 Program seeks to \nencourage unpaid, unsolicited ratings by requiring the sharing of data \non which ratings are based. The theory is, unsolicited ratings will \nkeep paid ratings honest. Joseph Petro of Morningstar Credit Ratings \nsaid using the unsolicited rating program ``is not the best use of \nresources as we're trying to build out our ratings platform.'' SEC \nCommissioner Troy Paredes made a strong point when he noted that \nnegative, unsolicited ratings by a firm ``may not be the best way to \nget business in an issuer-pays setting.'' By the time the report was \nwritten, the 17g-5 Program had produced only one or two ratings.\n  I have said all along that I believe the proposal of Senator Wicker \nand myself is a good one and the right one, and I continue to believe \nthat more and more as I have thought about it and looked at it in the \nyears now since we originally wrote the legislation. But I have also \nsaid I am open to any other meaningful proposals, and I will support \nany proposal the SEC recommends that addresses the conflicts of \ninterest in a meaningful way. But the Roundtable made very clear once \nagain that reform is necessary and that the status quo is inadequate to \nprotect American investors, workers, and homeowners in the years ahead.\n  Dealbreaker.com, a satirical blog that covers Wall Street, ran a post \non the day of the SEC Roundtable with this title: ``The SEC Will Keep \nTalking About Credit Rating Agencies Until Everyone Stops Paying \nAttention.'' That is one approach Wall Street regulators can choose to \ntake and it would be completely unacceptable. To do that would be to \nfail the American people. Senator Wicker and I have worked with the SEC \ncontinuously over the past 3 years, and I will continue to pursue this \nissue until the SEC fulfills its directive to address the conflicts of \ninterest in the credit rating industry. I am obligated to my \nconstituents and to the American public to make sure that satirical \nheadline does not become reality.\n  I look forward to working with the SEC on the next steps toward a \nproposed rule on credit rating reform.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the presence of both of my esteemed \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nfrom Hawaii, including the one presiding, and Senator Hirono, who is \nabout, I believe, to ask for the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5929-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5929-S5930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n1243, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act for 2014. I wish to thank Senators Murray \nand Collins as well as Senators Mikulski and Shelby for their hard \nwork. The bill before us reflects the bipartisan agreement that funding \nour Nation's transportation and housing infrastructure is vital to \ncreating jobs and supporting strong communities.\n  I wish to thank the committee for funding programs that support \nprojects that are especially crucial for my home State of Hawaii.\n  First, the committee's bill provides nearly $2 billion for capital \nimprovement grants which support transit projects across the country. \nEspecially important for Hawaii is Honolulu's rail transit project \nwhich, when completed, will provide much needed relief for Oahu's \ncommuters. Studies have shown that during the morning peak period, the \naverage travel time from East Kapolei to Honolulu is 89 minutes--89 \nminutes for a 17-mile drive. The rail will turn that into a 40-minute \nride above traffic. The project is estimated to remove roughly 40,000 \ncars from Oahu's congested roadways, providing relief for buses and \nother surface public transportation services.\n  While the rail project is a crucial step forward for developing \nHawaii's most populous island, it is the committee's support for \nHawaii's indigenous people for which I especially extend my thanks. The \ncommittee's funding of both the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant and \nthe 184A Loan Guarantee Program will help our Nation continue \nfulfilling its trust obligations to Native Hawaiians.\n  In 2010, the American Community Survey reported that 27.2 percent of \nNative Hawaiians in Hawaii live in overcrowded conditions, compared to \n8.5 percent of Hawaii's total population. In addition, the overall cost \nof living in Hawaii is almost 50 percent higher than the United States \naverage, and housing costs are almost 150 percent higher. Coupled with \nthese costs is the fact that 18 percent of Native Hawaiians live in \npoverty.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Congress created the Hawaiian Home Lands trust to provide housing and \nsettlement opportunities for Native Hawaiians. However, as the \nstatistics I just laid out show, this indigenous population continues \nto struggle with finding affordable quality housing in their place of \norigin.\n  That is why the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, or NHHBG, is so \nimportant. These funds can be used for a variety of initiatives. For \nexample, the current wait list for access to housing on homestead land \nis long and continues to grow. Funding the NHHBG helps the Department \nof Hawaiian Home Lands to continue developing lands to meet the housing \nneeds of those on the wait list as well as future beneficiaries, \nallowing the Department to effectively administer this trust \nresponsibly.\n  The 184A Program is another important tool for assisting Native \nHawaiians in securing homes on homesteads--lands they cannot own. As I \nhave mentioned, the cost of living--especially housing--in Hawaii is \namong the highest in the country. On top of saving up the cost of a \ndownpayment for a mortgage, there is the tricky task of securing a \nmortgage for a home without ownership of the land beneath it. This has \nproved problematic not only for Native Hawaiians but also Native \nAmericans and Alaska Natives. The 184A Loan Guarantee Program helps get \nHawaiians onto homesteads by providing a guarantee for lenders who are \nunfamiliar with the Hawaiian homes program.\n  I also wish to thank the committee for supporting the Essential Air \nServices Program. Being an island State, Hawaii is uniquely affected by \nany changes to air transportation policy. For us, driving between \ncounties is not an option. So air service is, for all intents and \npurposes, the only way to get from one island to another.\n  There is a population in Hawaii that uniquely demonstrates the reason \nfor the Essential Air Service Program: the residents of Kalaupapa. \nKalaupapa is an isolated peninsula on the island of Molokai. Beginning \nin 1966, this area was used as an exile for Hansen's disease patients. \nThis practice continued until a quarantine of the area was finally \nlifted in 1969. It was precisely because of Kalaupapa's remoteness and \nisolation that it was selected to serve this function for Hansen's \ndisease patients.\n  There are Hansen's disease patients who still reside in Kalaupapa. \nTheir only option for getting in and out of the area for medical \ntreatment, or to visit family and friends, is flying. Maintaining \nproper funding for the Essential Air Service Program directly \ntranslates into assuring continued access for the people of Kalaupapa \nto other communities and the services they need.\n  The committee's bill also provides appropriate levels of funding for \nlarger national programs such as the Community Development Block Grant, \nor CDBG. Certainly, Hawaii has been able to put CDBG funds to good use, \nand agencies across the country rely on this essential block grant \nfunding to continue meeting the needs of their most vulnerable \npopulations.\n  The HOME Investment Partnerships Program is yet another example where \nthe funding level in the Senate's bill is warranted. If Hawaii is any \nindication, HOME funds move out the door so quickly that many \nsubgrantees with equally worthwhile projects are left waiting for the \nnext fiscal cycle to compete.\n  The support for CDBG, HOME, and other programs in the bill provides \ncommunities across the country with the means to provide safe, \naffordable housing for the least fortunate, the elderly, and others. \nHowever, as the wide support for these programs demonstrates, there is \nmore need in our communities than there are resources. Since the \nsequester has taken effect, things have only gotten harder for those \nwho are struggling the most. Every day it seems we hear about housing \nvouchers being frozen or rescinded or about how elderly or support \nservices are being cut back or about how the lines for limited public \nhousing grow as people who have been out of work for too long exhaust \ntheir savings. For many of the people who rely on these programs, there \nis nowhere else to turn.\n  This bill doesn't fix all of the problems caused by the sequester, \nnor does it fully address the critical needs to create jobs. However, \nit is a bipartisan step forward that makes positive progress in all of \nthese areas. Perhaps it will give us some momentum in tackling those \nbig challenges our Nation faces in a more comprehensive way.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we now know, the IRS targeting scandal \nimplicates senior officials at the very highest levels of the Internal \nRevenue Service. Indeed, we know the Office of the Chief Counsel of the \nIRS, headed by an administration appointee, was aware of the abuses, \naccording to sworn testimony in the House of Representatives. We know \nthat former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman categorically denied those \nabuses in March of 2012, even though senior IRS officials learned about \nthem as early as June 2011. We know the IRS official who first revealed \nthe abuses to the American people decided to take the Fifth Amendment, \ninvoking her right not to incriminate herself, rather than testify \nbefore Congress. Finally, we know IRS officials improperly targeted not \nonly conservative organizations but also political candidates and \ndonors.\n  Still, yesterday the White House Press Secretary called the various\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nscandals involving this administration phony scandals. Well, I don't \nknow anyone who actually believes that is true. When an institution \nsuch as the Internal Revenue Service, with its power to literally tax \nand destroy, is abusing that power, it deserves the investigation of \nCongress and we need to get to the bottom of it. The idea, as initially \nfloated out, that this scandal was the work of a few rogue staffers in \nthe Cincinnati office is no longer plausible, even if it was at one \npoint.\n  This scandal clearly represents a serious breach of the public trust \nand has created a major credibility problem for this agency that is \nsupposed to be objective and nonpartisan. It is bad enough that \nAmerica's tax collection authority has behaved like a thuggish \npolitical machine, indeed, policing political speech and rights \nguaranteed under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  To make matters worse, the Internal Revenue Service will soon be \nresponsible for administering some of the most important provisions of \nthe Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare, including the \nindividual mandate. In other words, the Internal Revenue Service will \nbe responsible for administering a law that affects one-sixth of the \nU.S. economy, and it will be collecting even more information about \nindividual American citizens.\n  Are we comfortable with dramatically expanding the power of an agency \nthat has proven so abusive and so untrustworthy? I know I am not, which \nis why 2 months ago I introduced a piece of legislation that would \nprevent the Internal Revenue Service from participating in its current \nrole of implementing ObamaCare. Yesterday I submitted this legislation \nas an amendment to the appropriations bill we are currently \nconsidering.\n  Rather than give more power to the Internal Revenue Service, we \nshould be giving more power to patients and their doctors. Remember, \neven before ObamaCare became law, the IRS had enough power to destroy \nthe lives of American citizens. In the famous words, I believe, of a \nSupreme Court Justice, the power to tax is the power to destroy. He had \nit right. Now is the worst possible time to give this agency such \nmassive influence over the U.S. health care system, and this is past \noverdue action on our part. Instead, we should be curtailing the power \nof the Internal Revenue Service, replacing ObamaCare with sensible, \npatient-centered alternatives, and my amendment would do that.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to mention another amendment we will be \nfiling to the appropriations bill--one I cosponsored with my friend \nfrom South Carolina Senator Graham. Our amendment would prevent any \nfunds in this bill from being used to bail out Detroit or any American \ncity that mismanages its public finances. We have a Federal bankruptcy \ncode--chapter 9, specifically--that was designed to handle these \nproblems, and Detroit has filed for bankruptcy. There is no good reason \nwhy Detroit or any other American city ought to receive a taxpayer-\nfunded bailout from Washington. I hope that the normal bankruptcy \nprocess will be allowed to go forward, and I hope that the bankruptcy \nfollows the rule of law and that the Obama administration resists any \ntemptation to meddle in the process and play politics.\n\n  My colleagues might recall that during the 2009 government-run \nChrysler bankruptcy process, the company's secured bondholders received \nmuch less for their loans than the United Auto Workers pension funds. \nMy colleagues might also recall that during the runup to the 2011 \nSolyndra bankruptcy, the Obama administration actually made taxpayers \nsubordinate to private lenders, in violation of the law.\n  Detroit's financial woes offer a warning to all cities and States \nthat are struggling with pension obligations and unfunded liabilities. \nAnd speaking of unfunded liabilities, the Federal Government currently \nowes more than $100 trillion worth of unfunded liabilities ourselves \nfor Medicare and Social Security--something that urgently needs our \nattention. It is time for government officials at all levels--State, \nFederal, and local--to make the hard fiscal choices we have been \npostponing for way too long.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last summer the Supreme Court narrowly \nupheld as a tax the massive government takeover of health care in \nAmerica, known more commonly as ObamaCare. Since then, as the law's \nprovisions have slowly been implemented, the size and scope of this \ncolossal monstrosity have become clear.\n  I opposed the ObamaCare bill from the very beginning as a Member of \nthe House of Representatives serving on the Ways and Means Committee. \nBack then Americans were told that Congress needed to pass the bill \nbefore they could know all that was in it, but the more the American \npeople learn about it, the less popular it becomes. In fact, news \nreports tell us the administration is now looking for help from \nHollywood celebrities to push a bill that many Americans clearly do not \nsupport. That tactic has been used before. In the 1950s and the 1960s, \nHollywood and some athletes were used to sell and glamorize tobacco \nproducts. Today, Hollywood and some athletes are being asked to peddle \nthe Affordable Care Act, perhaps to make up for past sins.\n  While the American people grow more uncomfortable with this law, the \nadministration has allowed $54 million to be spent on ``navigators'' to \nhelp push people toward this program. Reports have suggested that there \nwill be 175,000 of these so-called navigators, whose job it is to \nfacilitate this law. Add that to the 16,000 new IRS agents who are \nbeing hired to implement ObamaCare, and it has become even clearer now \njust how flawed this law is. It is being widely circulated that the \nadministration is willing to spend nearly $1 billion on advertisements \nto entice the American people into buying something they do not want.\n  The President's recent decision to delay for another year the law's \nmandate on employers and small businesses is more compelling evidence \nthat the ObamaCare approach to health care reform is not working and is \nonly going to make matters worse. It is remarkable that the same \nadministration that pushed so hard for this health care takeover is now \nhesitant to put in place the very measures contained in the law, but I \nthink the administration has a very good reason to be hesitant.\n  Since ObamaCare's inception, middle-class families have seen their \npremiums skyrocket by an average of $2,500. Nearly 75 percent of small \nbusinesses in this country have been forced to fire their employees or \ncut their hours and turn full-time employees into part-time workers. In \nfact, just last month 322,000 workers were forced into part-time \nemployment. So the administration has created quite the balancing act \nfor middle-class families: At the same time they are dealing with \nincreased health care costs and higher premiums, they are confronted \nwith reduced work hours and the threat of being forced into part-time \npositions. I say that is an unacceptable situation in which to put the \nAmerican people.\n  Clearly, at a time when we are approaching 5 straight years with an \nunemployment rate over 7.5 percent, ObamaCare's job-crushing provisions \nare only making things worse for our economy, and that is why the \nadministration is having second thoughts.\n  No one argues that the health care system in this country is perfect. \nThere are absolutely steps we can take to increase access to high-\nquality, affordable health care. But ObamaCare's massive expansion of \nthe Federal Government's role in the health care industry is not \nturning out to be the solution its supporters said it would be. That is \nwhy the architects of the legislation are cherry-picking which parts of \nthe law to enforce, delaying some of its key provisions. It is obvious \nthis legislation is well on its way to collapsing under its own weight, \nand that will only further hurt the American people and cause even \ngreater damage to our economy.\n  I have a three-part test that I have told my constituents about \ncountless\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\ntimes. It is a test that I apply whenever I evaluate legislation, and \nit is called the more-higher-less test. When legislation hits my desk, \nI evaluate whether that bill will lead to more competition, higher \nquality, and less cost--hence the more-higher-less test. If the bill \npasses the test, then it is a bill I will consider supporting.\n  That test is rooted in my belief that the American free market system \nhas created the world's greatest economy and allowed innovation and \ncreativity to thrive. Competition is the key to improving our health \ncare system, not burdensome regulations and mandates, especially when \nthey are selectively enforced by government bureaucrats.\n  Perhaps the Obama administration has the same concerns about \nObamaCare that I have, and that is why they would rather not fully \nenforce it until after the next election. But if that is the case, they \nneed to make the tough decisions to address the problems instead of \npretending those problems do not exist.\n  When I was recently back in my home State of Nevada, I toured a \nmedical school and spoke with a number of bright, hard-working students \nwho expressed serious concerns about the effects of ObamaCare. I told \nthem that one of my biggest fears was that the law would turn them all \ninto government employees and it would put a bureaucrat between them \nand their patients.\n  Instead of a system like that, we need to reduce the cost of health \ncare services by enacting meaningful tort reform, making insurance more \naffordable, and providing market-based solutions to meet consumer \nneeds. We need to create an atmosphere that will foster economic growth \nand job creation instead of punishing the middle class with higher \nhealth care premiums and fewer hours at work.\n  I can understand the Obama administration's decision to delay the \nemployer mandate that is crushing small businesses across the country. \nThat is why so many of us opposed the law to begin with. But the \nAmerican people deserve far better than a cherry-picking, tax-\nincreasing approach to health care reform. American families should not \nhave to juggle higher health care premiums with the threat of losing \ntheir jobs or losing hours at work. They deserve commonsense solutions \nthat will reduce costs and increase access to high-quality care. \nObamaCare clearly is not that solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, this week, the President of the United \nStates, President Obama, has made yet another pivot back to the economy \nand to jobs, issues the American people have not had the luxury of \npivoting away from.\n  While the President is yet again attempting to refocus on jobs and \nthe economy, giving speeches is not a real solution to our Nations \nproblems. In fact, yesterday President Obama said in his speech that \nWashington is taking its eye off the ball. Mr. President, you are \nWashington. You have been President now for 4\\1/2\\ years. These are \nyour policies, policies that are hurting our economy and costing \nAmericans jobs.\n  As for taking your eye off the ball, the President appears to be \nswinging with his eyes closed, with his eyes closed to the impact that \nhis policies are having on the economy in this country. We do not have \nto look very far to see the impact of those policies. The ObamaCare \nlegislation is having a crushing impact on jobs in this country--a \ncrushing impact on the economy.\n  As we look at the unemployment rate, it is still over 7\\1/2\\ percent. \nIt has been there now for 54 months. That is the worst job record of \nany President since the Great Depression.\n  The President's signature law, ObamaCare, continues to hamstring the \njob market. In June alone, the last month for which we have data, \n322,000 Americans were forced into part-time employment status. Those \nare people who otherwise would have been willing to work full-time but \nbecause of these policies that are encouraging more employers to push \ntheir employees into part-time status, we have 322,000 individuals in \nthis country who want to work full-time that are now having to work \npart-time.\n  ObamaCare and other policies put forward by this administration have \nbeen probably the best thing that has happened to part-time jobs. \nUnfortunately, for most Americans, they want to be working full-time. A \nrecent chamber of commerce survey shows that nearly 75 percent of small \nbusinesses are firing workers or cutting hours. As implementation of \nthe ObamaCare law continues, the number of small business owners who \ntake those steps, unfortunately, is only going to increase.\n  According to a recent Wall Street Journal article:\n\n       Rod Carstensen, owner of 11 Del Taco restaurants around \n     Denver began in April converting his mostly full-time \n     workforce into one comprising mostly part-time help to \n     minimize his health care costs. . . . He is plowing ahead \n     despite the ObamaCare administration's reprieve, he said, \n     because we need to get there anyway, and it will take until \n     January 1 of 2015 to make this transition.\n\n  He is referring, of course, to the employer mandate which the \nPresident has chosen to delay for this next year when it was supposed \nto take effect, until January 1 of 2015. Most employers, unfortunately, \nare not taking great consolation in the fact that this is being delayed \nby 1 year. They know at some point they are going to have to comply \nwith it.\n  So they are taking those steps already, which is adding and fueling \nthe data--the numbers I just mentioned with regard to people being \nforced into part-time jobs. Americans are facing decreased hours which \nmeans decreased wages. Additionally, families are facing higher \ninsurance premiums, which further erodes their disposable income and \nopportunities to invest in a new home or a better education for their \nchildren.\n  A growing number of Americans are realizing ObamaCare is the wrong \nprescription for families who are at the mercy of an already struggling \neconomy. The administration has been forced to concede that the \nemployer mandate, which is a key component of the ObamaCare \nlegislation, is broken and unworkable, which is why they have delayed \nit.\n  We are starting to see Democrats, who have historically been \nsupportive of the law, suddenly jumping from the ObamaCare sinking \nship. On Monday, a headline in the Washington Post read, ``Moderate \nDemocrats are quitting on ObamaCare.''\n  The article disclosed that fewer than 50 percent of moderate to \nconservative Democrats now support ObamaCare, which is down more than \n25 percentage points since 2010 when it passed. Congressional Democrats \nare also becoming increasingly skittish about ObamaCare. The House vote \nlast Wednesday on the employer mandate delay passed 264 to 161--35 \nDemocrats joined 229 Republicans in support for that bill.\n  Additionally, there were 22 House Democrats who voted to delay the \nlaw's individual mandate. Even a Democratic Senator has introduced \nlegislation for a 2-year--not a 1-year but a 2-year employer mandate \ndelay. In a recent letter to the Democratic leadership, three large \nunions expressed grave concerns with the law, led by the Teamsters \nUnion, the organization that Jimmy Hoffa leads.\n  Once some of the biggest supporters of ObamaCare penned a letter--\nthree major unions penned a letter basically saying that the health \ncare law will ``shatter'' health benefits and cause ``nightmare \nscenarios.'' Shatter health benefits, create nightmare scenarios, that \nis what the unions are saying. The unions also slammed the law for \ndefining a full-time employee as one who works less than 30 hours.\n  The unions went on to say in their letter that the law ``will destroy \nthe foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the \nmiddle class.''\n  It is very clear that even those who were vocal, those who vigorously \ndefended and supported the ObamaCare\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nlegislation, recognize this is not working and are making it abundantly \nclear in the statements that they are now making.\n  Just yesterday, as I mentioned, the President delivered a speech \naiming to yet again pivot, as he says, back to jobs and the economy. He \nused the speech to kick off another campaign-style tour of speeches in \nhopes that touting his continued commitment to an economic recovery \nwill overshadow these harsh realities of ObamaCare and other economic \nwoes that plague this country.\n  During yesterday's speech, the President claimed he is dedicated to \nthe middle class and growing the economy from ``the middle out.'' What \ndo these concerns tell us about the state of the middle class? Hard-\nworking Americans are now fearful about their job security, about their \nhealth care coverage, and their ability to make ends meet all because \nof this catastrophic law.\n\n  The President's strongest political allies who represent millions of \nworkers say the President's signature domestic achievement is \n``destroying the backbone of the middle class.'' Although the President \ncontinues to pivot to and away from these issues, Senate Republicans \nremain focused on creating jobs and growth in this country. It is time \nfor a real recovery. The American people are ready to get back to work.\n  For 54 months, we have seen unemployment at or above 7\\1/2\\ percent. \nThat number does not reflect the people who have given up looking for \nwork. Let's remove the heavy hand of Washington regulations from our \njob creators. Let's create certainty for employers so they might hire \nnew employees, not cut the hours of those they already have.\n  Let's spare the middle class from premium increases. I have seen \nstudies all over the place that suggest, for families, for individuals, \npremiums across this country are going up. According to Kaiser, for \nfamilies, it is $2,500. In order to achieve the goals of addressing \nthese issues in our economy, we have to start with a permanent delay of \nObamaCare for all Americans--not just for the employers, not just the \nemployer mandate but the individual mandates, the other regulations \nthat are 20,000 pages high--7\\1/2\\ feet tall are the regulations that \nhave been promulgated to implement this law. It continues to grow by \nthe week.\n  We did not need a 2,700-page bill. We did not need 20,000 pages of \nregulations to address the problems we have in our health care delivery \nsystem and health care coverage system today. But that is what we got. \nBut the President's job-killing tactics do not stop just at health \ncare. The President's proposed climate change regulations alone would \ncost 500,000 jobs and reduce household income by up to $1,000 per year.\n  Dodd-Frank has already cost $15.4 billion and 58.3 million hours in \npaperwork burdens on businesses across the country. Rather than more \ncampaign-style speeches touting the same old flawed ideas, the \nPresident should work with Congress to put more Americans back to work.\n  By working together, we can enact meaningful regulatory reform that \nwill provide relief to employers and to employees alike. We can fix our \nhealth care system in a manner that lowers costs while allowing \nfamilies to keep the doctors they want. We can enact tax reform that \nwill create economic growth, lower the unemployment rate, and reduce \nour unsustainable budget deficit.\n  We can expand access to domestic energy resources in a manner that \nfully realizes the benefits of increased energy production. This \ncooperation must start with President Obama getting off the campaign \ntrail and getting to work with Congress on these important issues. So \ninstead of pivoting yet again to the economy, in campaign-style \nspeeches, we need a President that is here, that is working to address \nthe economic woes American families are experiencing.\n  If you want to start by going out and touting things that you are \ngoing to do for the economy, start right away by approving the Keystone \nPipeline. That is a no-brainer, in most people's estimation. In fact, \nthe President's own administration has analyzed and reviewed and \nscrutinized and studied this thing now four different times and \nconcluded it would have not an impact on the climate.\n  It would create immediate jobs, thousands of jobs, construction jobs, \nand then jobs over a long period of time. It would help lessen the \ndependence we have on foreign sources of energy by freeing up \ntransportation of energy resources that come from friendly allies in \ncountries such as Canada to get to American consumers in this country.\n  There are things the President could be doing that actually will \ncreate jobs. Come up here and engage in the debate on tax reform. \nCommit to tax reform that is revenue neutral, that does not raise taxes \non people who create jobs in this country but, rather, lowers the rate \nto unleash economic growth and job creation in this country. Work with \nus to repeal, permanently delay, the ObamaCare regulations that are \ncrushing jobs and the economy and, as I pointed out earlier, are \nforcing more and more Americans into part-time jobs, forcing employers \nto either cut and reduce their workforce or not hire people they \notherwise might hire, and raising premiums for hard-working middle-\nclass families.\n  Mr. President, it is not Washington that does not have its eye on the \nball, it is you who does not have your eye on the ball.\n  We need you to focus like a laser on the economy and recognize that \nyou can't close your eyes to the harmful, economic impact that your \npolicies are having on too many middle-class Americans and small \nbusinesses who create jobs in this country to generate the economic \ngrowth that is necessary to improve the standard of living and the \ntake-home pay of every American family. This is what we need.\n  I hope the President will get off the campaign trail, come back, and \nfocus on what really matters to middle-class Americans; that is, jobs, \nthe economy, and a better life for their children and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, as the House and Senate have begun \ndebating our separate appropriations bills for the coming year, we have \nbeen forced to take a very hard look at the numbers and exactly what so \nmany important programs and services will look like next year under \ncuts that are forced by sequestration. I am here to tell you, it is not \npretty.\n  As chair of the Budget Committee, it has only served as a reminder to \nme of just how important it is to fully replace the across-the-board \ncuts that sequestration has forced us to make, because it is only \ngetting worse.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues in the Senate, and most of them in \nthe House, it seems, don't believe sequestration has had a real impact \non families, their communities, and our military.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to talk about what I have already seen \nin my home State of Washington, where the impacts of sequestration have \nbeen very severe.\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\n  Washington State has a proud history of supporting our Nation's Armed \nForces. From Fairchild Air Force Base in eastern Washington to Joint \nBase Lewis-McChord in the Puget Sound region, our State is home to \nthousands of military families.\n  In addition to those active-duty servicemembers, Washington State is \nalso home to thousands of civilian defense employees who work at these \nvarious military installations. Under sequestration, these men and \nwomen have borne the brunt of these across-the-board budget cuts. This \nmonth, weekly furloughs began for nearly 10,000 of these civilian \nemployees in my home State of Washington. So now, once every week, they \ncan't go to work. That amounts to a pay cut for them of 20 percent.\n  These are men and women--many of them veterans--with mortgages and \nmedical bills and tuition costs, just like the rest of us. And thanks \nto the gridlock here in Congress, their lives have become 20-percent \ntougher. One of those people who is impacted is Will Silva. He lives in \nTacoma, WA, and he works at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. We call it JBLM. \nWill is a former marine, he is an amputee, and he is a fire inspector \nat the base. Thanks to sequestration, he is one of 6,700 people in that \ncommunity who won't be going to work tomorrow because Friday is \nfurlough day at JBLM.\n  So tomorrow, Friday, in my home State of Washington, the 911 call \ncenter and fire departments will be understaffed, air fields will be \nshuttered except for emergencies, the military personnel office and the \nsubstance abuse center will be closed, the Madigan Army Medical Center \nwill be forced to close clinics, and even the wound care clinic is \ngoing to be understaffed. All of this is because of the cuts we all \nagree are hurting our country.\n  Jennifer-Cari Green is another person who won't be going to work at \nJBLM tomorrow. Jennifer happens to be a single mother of a 6-year-old \nboy. She works at the Madigan Army Medical Center in the neurosurgery \ndepartment. Her job is to care for servicemembers, many of whom are \nundergoing serious brain operations.\n  Jennifer was here in Washington, DC, on Tuesday to testify at our \nBudget Committee hearing about the impacts of sequestration. It is \nimpossible to forget her story. Jennifer works very hard. She started \nthere as a volunteer in the surgery center but has worked her way up. \nShe doesn't make much money to support herself and her young son, and \nso she budgets every month right down to the dollar. She has no \nluxuries, and in her only spare time she cares for her son and works \ntoward an associate degree at the community college.\n  Jennifer told me that because of these furloughs her take-home pay \nwill be almost exactly $1,000 a month--$1,000 a month. That isn't \nenough for her to pay her most basic expenses. But even with all of the \nchallenges she faces, Jennifer came here to talk about what those cuts \nwill mean for others, for the people she cares for at the army hospital \nwhere she works.\n  Because she has been furloughed--by the way, along with doctors and \ntechnicians and other employees at the hospital--servicemembers and \nveterans aren't going to get the care they need. These furloughs mean \nthat everything from routine checkups to brain surgeries is being \ndelayed for these men and women who served our country. Let me repeat \nthat: brain surgeries at military hospitals are being delayed because \nof cuts from sequestration. That is unacceptable and, unfortunately, it \nis very real.\n  The impacts on our civilian defense employees are just the tip of \nthis iceberg. Sequestration has resulted in dramatic cuts to countless \nother programs throughout our country. Head Start facilities have been \nforced to shut their doors, Meals-on-Wheels Programs--vital to our \nNation's seniors--are serving less needy seniors, and even our judicial \nsystem has been forced to let go of prosecutors and public defenders. \nThe cuts are clear and they are, across the board, impacting so many \npeople in this country in our communities and in our families.\n  I understand many of us have different opinions here on how to \naddress our Nation's financial challenges, but before we do that, all \nof us have to understand the devastating impact sequestration has \nalready had on our Nation. I want to remind all my colleagues that it \ndoesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way. It is now \n124 days since the Senate passed a budget that fully replaced the \nsequestration, and 17 times my colleagues and I have stood here and \nasked to go to conference with the House to fix these ridiculous cuts. \nBut 17 times now our Republican colleagues have said no. They have \nrefused.\n  So I am here today absolutely committed to replacing sequestration. \nIf some of my colleagues think this is about politics or this is some \nkind of game, I would ask them to talk to Will or Jennifer or any of \nthe thousands of families who suddenly today can't pay their bills, \nbecause, for them, these cuts are very real and they need a solution \nnow.\n  I hope other Members of the Senate will come and talk about these \ncuts. We can fix this. We can replace sequestration. We can manage our \ncountry responsibly. We can be much smarter about what we are doing, \nbut we need the will of the Senate to allow us to go to conference to \nfix this and move forward and tell Will and Jennifer we, as a country, \ncan work for them.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform prior to a vote on the nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers President \nObama's nomination of Tony West to be the Associate Attorney General, \nthe No. 3 position at the Justice Department. He is a superbly \nqualified veteran of the Department of Justice who has been serving in \nthis position in an acting capacity for over a year. He had previously \nbeen confirmed by the Senate to be the Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Civil Division.\n  Before his work in the Justice Department, Mr. West spent 8 years in \nprivate practice in San Francisco, where he was a partner at a well-\nrespected law firm and specialized in complex commercial litigation. He \nalso served as a special assistant attorney general in the California \nDepartment of Justice, as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern \nDistrict of California, and as a special assistant to two Deputy \nAttorneys General at the U.S. Department of Justice. Mr. West earned \nhis B.A. from Harvard, and his J.D. from Stanford University Law \nSchool, where he was elected president of the Stanford Law Review.\n  The Judiciary Committee received dozens of letters in support of Tony \nWest from various individuals and organizations, including the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, the National Association of Attorneys General, the National \nSheriff's Association, and Taxpayers Against Fraud. The National \nAssociation of Black Law Enforcement Executives wrote that ``throughout \nMr. West's career, he has proven to be an effective partner to law \nenforcement. With this experience, we believe him to be well-qualified \nto serve as Associate Attorney General and look forward to working with \nhim on a broad range of law enforcement and public safety issues. It is \nour hope that the Senate will confirm Mr. West promptly to serve as the \nAssociate Attorney General of the United States.''\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nThis endorsement is typical of the many letters sent in support of Mr. \nWest. I ask unanimous consent that a list of all 36 letters of support \nfor Mr. West's nomination be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy statement.\n  I am confident that Tony West is well-qualified to be Associate \nAttorney General, and I hope he will be confirmed without further \ndelay.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Letters received for Tony West\n\n       May 14, 2013--Esta Soler, President and Founder, Futures \n     Without Violence\n       May 14, 2013--Ann Harkins, President and CEO, National \n     Crime Prevention Counsel\n       May 14, 2013--William J.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering Tony West's nomination to be Associate Attorney General of \nthe United States today. I have a great deal of respect for Tony. As a \nfellow Californian, I know he will serve the position of Associate \nAttorney General with distinction.\n  The role of the Associate Attorney General--the third-highest ranking \nposition at the Department--is to help lead the Justice Department and \nto oversee the Department's civil units, such as the Civil Division, \nAntitrust Division, and Tax Division, as well as the Office of Justice \nPrograms, which provides grants, including to State and local law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. West's qualifications for this position are unquestionable. He \nhas served as Acting Associate Attorney General since March 2012. He \nalso spent 3 years as Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division, \nso he is no stranger to the responsibilities and demands of leadership \nin the Justice Department.\n  From 2001 to 2009, Mr. West was a partner at Morrison & Foerster LLP, \nwhere he represented major corporations in securities litigation, \nantitrust cases, and white-collar criminal defense.\n  From 1994 to 1999, he served as assistant U.S. attorney in the \nNorthern District of California for 5 years. He prosecuted high-tech \ncrimes, bank robberies, fraud schemes, and sexual exploitation \noffenses.\n  He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University and later \nearned his law degree at Stanford Law School, where he was president of \nthe Stanford Law Review.\n  Simply put, Tony West brings a great deal of experience in Justice \nDepartment leadership, private practice, and criminal prosecution to \nthis position.\n  I am confident he will do an outstanding job, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nunder the quorum call be divided equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          THUD Appropriations\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to propose and support two \namendments to the appropriations bill that is on the floor today and \nwill continue into next week. They both have a common theme, and that \ntheme is to keep faith with the American people; to not put ourselves \nhere in Washington, here in Congress, in a different, higher class than \nmiddle-class Americans but to be one of them; to truly represent them; \nto truly fight for them here in Washington.\n  The two amendments address this in different ways. One is to block a \npay raise that would otherwise happen for Members of Congress even in \nthe midst of this very sluggish economy, barely getting out of the \nrecent recession. There is an automatic pay raise in the law. This was \ndone years ago, really behind closed doors in a bit of a smoke-filled \nroom, to put an automatic pay raise for Members of Congress in the law \nso that almost every year it just happens automatically. There is no \ninconvenience of having to propose it, actually having to come to the \nSenate floor and come to the floor of the House of Representatives and \njustify it and, God forbid, have to vote for it. It just happens.\n  I disagree strongly with that system. I think that entire system and \npremise is offensive. For that reason, Senator Claire McCaskill of \nMissouri and I have a bill, a proposal to undo that and require that \nany future pay raise has to be proposed, justified on the floor of the \nSenate and the floor of the House, and actually voted on. This \namendment is not that entire bill. This amendment is focused on the \nhere and now, to block the automatic pay raise that would happen this \nyear if we do not act.\n  You will hear from members of the committee, handlers of this \nappropriations bill, that this amendment is not relevant, is not \ngermane to this bill. The folks who set up the automatic pay raise \nsystem several years ago were very clever. They figured out a way that \nan amendment such as this would not be germane to any appropriations \nbill, would not be germane to any bill. That is why we need to act on \nthis bill--because this may be one of the few appropriations bills, \nspending bills we actually deal with on the floor of the Senate this \nyear.\n  To the credit of Congress, in the midst of the recent recession \nCongress denied itself these automatic pay raises, so they have not \nhappened since 2009. But we are not into healthy growth. The American \nmiddle class is not doing just fine. Unemployment is still over 7.5 \npercent--7.6 percent, which is well above the 5 percent promised when \nCongress and President Obama passed a $1 trillion stimulus. In fact, we \nhave had 53 straight months with unemployment above 7.5 percent. That \nis not a healthy economy. That is not recovery.\n  As Americans continue to suffer, continue to look for work, continue \nto look for full-time work as part-time becomes more the norm, \nparticularly in the era of ObamaCare, we need to relate to them and not \nset ourselves\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\napart. We need to be a fighter for them, not a member of a higher, \ndifferent class in Washington. One simple but important way to do that \nis to say no pay raise when we are in the midst of this very sluggish \nnonrecovery.\n  Again, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri has joined me in this \neffort. I appreciate her partnership on the broader bill, and I \nappreciate her partnership on this amendment, the Vitter amendment No. \n1746. I urge all my colleagues, Democrats as well as Republicans, to \nadopt and support this commonsense amendment.\n  This is an important message. This is an important statement. The \nquestion and the choice is simple: Are you going to be a true \nrepresentative of the folks back home, relate to them, be one of them, \nor did you really come to Washington to put yourself in a different, \nhigher class? The answer needs to be the first answer provided. We need \nto represent the folks back home, not put ourselves in a different, \nhigher class. This pay raise amendment is one way to do that. Say no to \nany congressional pay raise in the midst of this horribly slow economy.\n  My second amendment also continues this theme. It relates to our \nhealth care benefits, but it is really the same issue, the same theme. \nAre we one with the folks we were elected to represent or are we trying \nto set ourselves out as a different, higher class here in Washington?\n  This amendment is Vitter amendment No. 1748. It would ensure that all \nMembers of Congress, all congressional staff, and all executive \nappointees deal with ObamaCare in the same way ordinary Americans do. \nThey have to go in the exchange; they have to deal with their health \ncare that way. They do not get special treatment.\n  In the midst of the ObamaCare debate, that issue came up. I brought \nup the issue. I brought an amendment to the floor. My Louisiana \ncolleague John Fleming did the same thing in the House. Because of the \nattention we focused on that issue, there was a limited provision in \nthe law that said Members of Congress and their direct staffs would be \nin the exchanges. However, very conveniently, some of the details were \njiggered around so that Members of the leadership and their staffs and \ncommittee staffs would somehow be in a different, higher category and \nthey would not be subject to the same ObamaCare rules. They would \nbenefit from the very generous and very lucrative Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan that Congress has traditionally been under.\n  I think we should undo that. I think we should be one of the American \npeople, relate to the American people, and get the same treatment \nthrough the exchanges that the great majority of them will get under \nObamaCare. The problem is that here on Capitol Hill, again behind \nclosed doors, the effort is largely in the opposite direction.\n  The Wall Street Journal unveiled this on April 25 of this year. It \nreported that Senator Reid and Congressman Steny Hoyer had initiated \nsome behind-closed-doors secret discussions to actually fix the \nproblem, as they saw it, and put all Members of Congress and all of our \nstaffs back in that select category--not with the American people, not \nin the exchanges, but in that select higher category and be granted \npreferential treatment. Because that hit the press, because that word \ngot out, I am hopeful that those secret negotiations have stopped. We \nneed to make sure we do not move in that direction.\n  ObamaCare is a train wreck. Implementation is causing dramatic \nproblems for millions upon millions of Americans. But the solution is \nnot to fix it selectively for us; the solution is to fix it for \neverybody, to fix it for average middle-class Americans. If we do that \nwe would benefit as well.\n  So this amendment not only blocks the effort by Senator Reid and \nSteny Hoyer and others to move Members of Congress and our staffs back \ninto a select category and protect us from the train wreck of ObamaCare \nimplementation, the solution is to broaden that pool and actually have \nthat same treatment, along with ordinary Americans, for every Member of \nCongress, for all of our staffs, for leadership, for committee staffs, \nand also for President Obama's appointees.\n  My amendment, Vitter amendment No. 1748, on which Dean Heller is a \ncosponsor, would do just that. It would ensure that all bureaucrats, \nall Obama appointees, all congressional staff, all Members, leadership \nand otherwise, all of our staffs, committee and otherwise, are subject \nto ObamaCare and are not put into a select higher class and offered \npreferential treatment--again, the common theme with my other \namendment. That is how we relate to the folks we represent. That is how \nwe are truly one of them.\n  ObamaCare is a problem. Implementation is a train wreck. But the \nsolution is not to put ourselves in a higher class, divorced from that \nproblem; the solution is to live that problem ourselves, and hopefully \nthat will promote us and motivate us to solve that problem for all of \nthe American people.\n  This is not a partisan amendment. This should not be a partisan \nfight. This is about are we truly part of the States we represent? Do \nwe truly relate to those citizens who sent us to Washington or do we \ncome here and put ourselves in a select, different class, give \nourselves preferential treatment under law, after law, after law--in \nthis case, ObamaCare?\n  Again, this is Vitter amendment No. 1748. I urge all my colleagues--\nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents, everyone--to support it, to tell \nyour constituents: No, I did not come here to put myself in a special \nclass. I did not come here to get preferential treatment. I came here \nto fight for you.\n  And, yes, ObamaCare has major issues, major problems. Implementation \nis, as one of my Democratic colleagues has forthrightly said, a train \nwreck. But the solution is not to fix it behind closed doors \nselectively for us; the solution is to fix it--which personally I think \nmeans delay or repeal it--for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, am I in order to speak about the \nnomination of Tony West?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is in order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Tony West to be Associate Attorney General. Although I \nwill be supporting Mr. West's nomination, I have some concerns about \nhis record that I want to share with my colleagues.\n  This is a very important position. The Associate Attorney General is \nthe third highest ranking official within the Department of Justice. \nMr. West is currently serving as Acting Associate Attorney General, and \nas far as I can tell he has generally done a pretty good job. However, \nbefore serving as Acting Associate Attorney General, Mr. West was \nconfirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. My \nconcerns are with his record while serving in that position.\n  Specifically, while heading the Civil Division, Mr. West was involved \nin and even defended the quid quo pro deal between the Department of \nJustice and the City of St. Paul, MN. That scheme was orchestrated by \nTom Perez, who headed the Civil Rights Division and was recently \nconfirmed by the Senate to be Labor Secretary.\n  My colleagues have heard me on the floor of this body many times \ntalking about this quid pro quo, most often emphasizing Tom Perez's \ninvolvement with it, but not too much about Mr. West.\n  The quid pro quo involved the Department agreeing to decline two \nFalse Claims cases pending against the City of St. Paul. Remember, if \nsuccessful, those two False Claims cases were estimated--and they were \npretty good cases--to bring $200 million back into the Federal \nTreasury. In exchange, the City of St. Paul would agree to drop a case \npending before the Supreme Court.\n  As I have said, I have spoken at length on the St. Paul quid pro quo \nas it relates to the nomination of Mr. Perez to be Secretary of Labor.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been a major supporter of \nwhistleblowers and their protection under the laws of this country. \nWhistleblowers are a very important source of information in helping us \nif laws are not being abided by\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nor money is being misspent. Of course, that is why I authored the 1986 \namendments to the False Claims Act. It was to protect whistleblowers, \nbut it also gives a resource for getting money back into the Federal \nTreasury if it is misspent.\n  Those amendments--meaning the False Claims Act amendments--\nrevitalized the law by empowering individual qui tam whistleblowers to \ncome forward and file suits on behalf of the Federal Government to \nrecover taxpayer dollars lost to fraud. Since those amendments were \nenacted, over $40 billion has been recovered.\n  Under Mr. West's tenure as head of the Civil Division, that \nDepartment has been successfully utilizing the tools of qui tam \nwhistleblowers' information. Of course, they are not shy about saying \nso, and as far as I am concerned it is their right to do that. The more \npublicity we can have about recovering money under the False Claims \nAct, the more we may encourage more whistleblowers to come forth and \nrecover even more money.\n  The False Claims Act is within the purview of the Civil Division, \nwhich Mr. West oversaw at that time, not the Civil Rights Division. \nHowever, in the quid pro quo, the evidence uncovered by my \ninvestigation suggests that Mr. West allowed Tom Perez to take control \nof the Civil Division in order to cut this deal that saved Mr. Perez's \nfavored legal theory referred to as the ``disparate impact'' theory. As \nI have discussed previously, Mr. Perez was concerned the Supreme Court \nwas going to strike down this theory as unconstitutional.\n\n  In doing so, the Department undercut a viable case against St. Paul \nand, in the process, left the whistleblower who filed the suit to fight \nthe City on behalf of the American taxpayers all alone--left him out \nthere twisting in the wind.\n  This is not how I expect the Department to treat good-faith \nwhistleblowers. They are patriotic people. They are people who probably \ndestroyed their opportunity of livelihood because they know something \nis wrong and they want to report it, just as patriotic people ought to \ndo. In fact, I believe it is contrary to the assurances Mr. West gave \nme during his confirmation hearing in 2009 when he indicated he would \nprotect whistleblowers and vigorously enforce the False Claims Act.\n  Let everybody understand there is not a single individual subject to \nSenate confirmation in the Justice Department who comes before the \ncommittee or to my office for an interview that I don't ask them their \nview of the False Claims Act, because I don't want anyone serving in \nthe Justice Department who doesn't support vigorous enforcement and use \nof the False Claims Act.\n  As I have said, ultimately Mr. Perez was the architect of this ill-\nadvised quid pro quo that left Frederick Newell, a good-faith \nwhistleblower, hanging out there to dry. In my view, Mr. Perez bears \nthe most responsibility in this whole matter. He was the one who was \nmanipulating the process and he did so at times behind the back of Mr. \nWest.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. West was the individual in charge of the Civil \nDivision, and as head of that division the decision regarding whether \nto join those False Claims cases fell to Mr. West.\n  It is troubling to me that Mr. Perez, who at the time was head of the \nCivil Rights Division, would be the one who was so clearly \norchestrating the deal, and acting as de facto head of the Civil \nDivision. Unfortunately, Mr. West let him get away with it. So that \nconcerns me as it relates to the nomination of Mr. West to be the third \nhighest ranking official at the Department of Justice.\n  We need individuals serving in these positions who are willing to \nstand up to those who are trying to advance a political agenda; and \nthat is exactly what Mr. Perez was trying to advance. In this instance, \nat least, it doesn't appear that Mr. West stood up to Mr. Perez as he \nshould have.\n  On the contrary, the record appears to indicate Mr. West allowed Mr. \nPerez to orchestrate this deal on behalf of the Civil Division even \nthough Mr. Perez was head of the Civil Rights Division.\n  However, notwithstanding these concerns, I am willing to give Mr. \nWest the benefit of the doubt and vote for his nomination. Part of the \nreason I am willing to do so is because the Civil Division, under the \nleadership of Mr. West, has established a respectable record in \nutilizing the tools available under the False Claims Act amendments \nthat I got passed in 1986 and that have brought back into the Treasury \napproximately $40 billion.\n  And, as an instance of the use of the False Claims Act by Mr. West, \nthe Civil Division secured approximately $4.9 billion coming back into \nthe Federal Treasury in the single year of 2012. Taken together over \nthe last several years, the Civil Division has secured a total of \napproximately $13.3 billion.\n  Obviously, this is not an insignificant amount of taxpayer dollars \ncoming back. Although the Department's recovery of this money, on the \none hand, does not excuse their behavior in the quid pro quo matter, I \ndo believe Mr. West deserves a certain degree of credit for his \nleadership in this area.\n  So, as I said, I will support his nomination, and I expect he will be \nconfirmed. It is my sincere hope he will perform his job well and not \nlet somebody undercut him as he let Mr. Perez undercut him in regard to \nthe quid pro quo and the False Claims cases involving St. Paul, MN. But \nI want him to know, and everybody else to know, that I plan to conduct \naggressive oversight of the Department to ensure the mistakes that \noccurred as part of the quid pro quo that potentially cost the \ntaxpayers nearly $200 million lost to fraud are not repeated.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Transportation to assess the \n     impact on domestic employment of a waiver of the Buy America \n   requirement for Federal-aid highway projects prior to issuing the \n                                waiver)\n\n       On page 34, line 23, after ``shall'' insert ``assess the \n     impact on domestic employment if such a waiver were issued \n     and''.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, there is a broad consensus among the \npeople of this country that when we spend dollars through the Federal \nTreasury, when we spend taxpayer dollars, they should be used to fund \nAmerican jobs. In fact, that has been a law on the books since the \nearly part of this century. For a long time the Buy American Act has \nrequired that when we buy things, whether it be through the military or \nthrough the Department of Transportation, we buy things from American \ncontractors. That makes more sense today than ever before because as we \nstruggle to try to get our economy back up and running, one of the \nsectors that is hurting more than others is the construction sector. \nEvery time we violate the Buy American provisions of our law, we lose \nthe opportunity to try to alleviate great stress that is currently upon \nour construction industry.\n  Thankfully, the DOT has been one of the best agencies, actually, when \nit comes to making sure American-made material goes into construction \nprojects. The $41 billion the Highway Administration receives in this \nbill to be spent on roads and bridges is an important engine of job \ngrowth throughout the country. I have to say they generally do a pretty \ngood job, as opposed to some other agencies--the Department of Defense \nat the top of the list--in making sure those dollars go to American \ncompanies.\n  There are circumstances in which the Buy American provisions are \nwaived. There are a number of ways you can waive those provisions, but \nit is important for us to have full transparency and disclosure when \nthe Department of Transportation and FHWA are considering awarding a \nmajor project funded by American taxpayers to a foreign company.\n  When the Buy American statute is waived, the requirement that \nAmerican-made material be used is null and void. What this bill says is \nthat when the FHWA provides public notice that they are considering \nwaiving the Buy American clause for a particular project, they include \nin that public notice a consideration of the impact on American jobs. \nIt is worth knowing whether a waiver is simply going to result in the \nloss of 10 American jobs or the loss of 500 American jobs.\n  This amendment very simply says that when a waiver to the Buy \nAmerican law is pending, we should know from the Department of \nTransportation and from the FHWA how many American jobs are at risk. \nThat gives us the opportunity to weigh in and try to make sure that \nwaiver is not granted. This, frankly, gives American companies a little \nbit better information to use when they are trying to make the case \nthat they can actually do the work that may be being considered for a \nforeign company.\n  We all know what is happening to jobs in the building trades. In some \nparts of the country unemployment is hitting 20 percent when it comes \nto carpenters, operating engineers, plumbers, and sheet metal workers.\n  I wish to applaud the DOT for being one of the models when it comes \nto trying to make sure taxpayer dollars are kept here at home. This \namendment would make sure that in those limited cases where the DOT is \nsending work overseas, we get a chance to understand what the real \nimpact will be.\n  We have a lot of work to do when it comes to tightening our Buy \nAmerican laws. We are talking about the DOT, but the real problem is \nanother agency we will hopefully have a chance to talk about later on \nthe Senate floor; that is, the Department of Defense. Seventy percent \nof Federal purchasing comes through the Department of Defense. They \nhave been expediting the offshoring of defense work at a rate that \nshould make every single Senator on this floor shudder.\n  This is an important amendment that I hope will get bipartisan \nsupport. I thank Senator Collins for allowing it to become pending on \nthe floor. I think it is just the beginning of a lot of work we have to \ndo when it comes to enforcing a very simple principle. When our \nconstituents send their hard-earned tax dollars to Washington, DC, and \nthey are used to buy things or build things for the U.S. Government, we \nneed to hire U.S. companies and American workers to do the job.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be a period for debate only until \n2:15 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nconcerns with the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill.\n  I do not take issue with the bill's specific spending provisions, and \nI believe my home State of Georgia needs a strong bill that recognizes \nthe importance of ongoing infrastructure and housing and development \nprojects. As some of my colleagues have already noted, this bill \nincludes many taxpayer protection provisions, specifically that \nextravagant conferences will be curtailed, an issue many of our \nconstituents as well as Members of Congress were shocked to learn \nabout. But my concern is with the overall spending level and the \ndecision of the majority to write this and other appropriations bills \nto levels that exceed the Budget Control Act.\n  In 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act which placed caps on \nwhat the Federal Government could spend. I voted against that bill in \nAugust of 2011. Over the years I have served in both the House and the \nSenate and there have been too many times when I have seen both bodies \ncome together to bust spending caps. For us to have no checks and \nbalances on the ability of either the House or the Senate to bust the \nspending caps that were set in 2011, I thought, was wrong because they \nwere going to get busted. Well, guess what. Here we are, and this is \nnot the first time since 2011 we have had a vote in the Senate that \nwill ultimately bust those spending caps.\n  The THUD appropriations bill the Senate is now debating completely \ndisregards the 2011 Budget Control Act. THUD is the first of 12 \nappropriations bills the Senate will consider on the Senate floor. So \nmy question to my colleagues is, What kind of precedent are we setting \nfor the remaining spending bills?\n  While all Americans deserve for Congress to pass appropriations \nbills, we simply cannot afford to pass bills that spend more than our \ngovernment can fund. This Senate bill alone costs $5 billion more than \nis allowed under the Budget Control Act. How can we demand a cure to \nour fiscal woes if we cannot take our own medicine of fiscal restraint? \nWe should focus our efforts on legislation that can pass both Chambers \nof Congress and be signed into law by the President, not create another \npolitical nightmare that negatively affects the country as well as our \nconstituencies.\n  Right now, the Senate can correct this mistake and allocate spending \nin a manner that is consistent with the law we passed. Shortly, my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Pat Toomey, will come to the floor \nand offer a motion that would require the Appropriations Committee to \nchange the spending levels of this bill to comply with the Budget \nControl Act or, in other words, to comply with current law. I urge my \ncolleagues to follow Senator Toomey's lead and vote to recommit.\n  We should work toward a bill that adheres to the budget guidelines \nset by the Budget Control Act and provides the needed appropriations \nfor the Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, as well as the independent agencies. While I would like to \nsee the Senate pass a Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill, the bill before us now does more harm than it does \ngood.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the very real \neffects sequestration is having. I want to speak about the people of \nVirginia, but I am sure it is equally true of folks in New Mexico and \nfor that matter folks all across the country. I remind folks, \nsequestration was set up so it would be so stupid, so draconian, so \noutside the realm of possibility that no rational people would ever let \nit happen. We are actually seeing now that we did not pass that bar. \nSequestration is happening. It is actually stupidity on steroids.\n  Earlier this week a group of us heard from Dr. Francis Collins, the \nhead of NIH. NIH, as we all know, is America's premier health research \ninstitution. Dr. Collins told us of the real world impacts of sequester \ncuts. He gave heartbreaking examples of lifesaving medical research \nthat is being disrupted, perhaps irrevocably, due to budget cuts and \nemployee furloughs.\n  Two days ago I had the opportunity to chair a Budget Committee \nhearing about the impact of sequestration on our Nation's security. We \nheard policymakers talk about what sequestration was doing to military \nreadiness. But what drove home the point to me was Virginia business \nowner Mark Klett who had actually been named as the Small Businessman \nof the Year back in 2011, who said this start-and-stop environment, \nwhere you did not have any predictability of whether your funding was \ncoming through, was completely wrecking his business model and it \nalready had caused him to bench over a third of his 60 employees.\n  In the last 2 weeks alone, since sequestration has started, I have \nreceived over 500 letters, e-mails, phone calls from Virginians who are \nbearing the very real brunt of our failure to do our job, with real \nconsequences on real people with potentially devastating impacts on a \ndedicated, experienced Federal workforce. This is no way to run a \nbusiness. It is no way to run an enterprise as large as the Federal \nGovernment.\n  One letter is from Virginia Beach. Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach \nare our most concentrated area of naval installations and Air Force and \nArmy installations. This woman is from Virginia beach. Her husband is a \nretired Navy officer who is now furloughed once a week for the next 11 \nweeks. She writes that her husband came home with a letter about the \nfurlough, that he felt his moral character and the oath he had taken to \nprotect his Nation would not allow him to write, so she said she was \ngoing to write. She says:\n\n       It pains me to see what he has worked so hard to defend, \n     you're working so hard to tear down. This country is \n     deserving of good leadership and right now Congress is not \n     providing it.\n\n  Another Navy employee from the Fredericksburg area writes:\n\n       Three years of pay freezes followed by a furlough seriously \n     makes me question if this is where I want to spend the rest \n     of my career.\n\n  Think about the hours and dollars that we as a public have invested \nin getting these individuals trained to provide these services. They \nare now saying they are not sure this is where they want to work.\n  A woman down at the Portsmouth Naval Hospital writes:\n\n       Both my husband and I are DOD employees and will be taking \n     a 20 percent pay cut for 11 weeks.\n\n  She points out they may be able to get by but a lot of her coworkers \ndo not know how they are going to make ends meet.\n  A Federal employee from Woodbridge, VA, down the road in Prince \nWilliam County, says:\n\n       I want all my elected officials to know how disappointed I \n     am that we have been abandoned and let down by our \n     representatives in Congress.\n       I have three children in college, and I am paying for \n     college loans of two children who have graduated. Eleven \n     furlough days don't sound like much, but over the year a loss \n     of over $4,000 in income is crucial. If I ran my own budget \n     like this, I would have to fire myself.\n\n  This employee I do not think is going to get a sequestration discount \non repaying those student loans.\n  A West Point graduate and Iraq war veteran says:\n\n       The failure of Congress is having a tangible and real \n     negative impact on people's lives and livelihood. I do not \n     see leadership, I do not see accountability, and I do not see \n     selfless service that rises above partisan politics.\n\n  Finally, a former Army officer who lives in Springfield, VA, says:\n\n       The morale in our agency is so poor that most workers who \n     used to work 10 or 11 hours a day are planning to work their \n     exact 8 hours [only].\n\n  So the 20 percent cut 1 day a week is actually cutting productivity \nin a much greater percentage.\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\n  I could stand here the rest of the afternoon and go through letter \nafter letter that has the same theme. What strikes me about these \nletters--I am sure, again, the Presiding Officer is hearing from New \nMexicans what we are hearing from Virginians--is that none of these \nletters talk about the red team or the blue team. None of these letters \nsay this is all the Democrats' fault or Republicans' fault. None of \nthese letters say this is a House problem; the Senate has the solution.\n  They are saying, regardless of party, regardless of whether you are \nin the House or the Senate, your job is to get this fixed. It is \nappropriately targeted at the entire Congress and, while our dismal \nperformance recently may be great fodder for late night comedians, I \nthink having a 90-percent-plus disapproval rating candidly undermines \nAmericans' basic faith in our democratic institutions.\n  Let me try to respond. Here is what I have done and will continue to \ndo. I will keep fighting for the significant Federal workforce that \nlives in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In the 4\\1/2\\ years I have been \nin the Senate, I have come down to the floor on a regular basis to \ncelebrate the great work of individual Federal employees. I will \ncontinue to come down to the floor and appeal to my colleagues and \nprovide real examples of the real impacts that this funny name--\nsequestration--is actually having on people's livelihoods.\n  On a personal basis I am giving up 20 percent of my salary through \nthe end of this budget year. I am donating it to the Federal Employee \nEducation & Assistance Fund, which provides emergency loans as well as \nchildcare assistance, scholarships, and other financial help for the \nfamilies of Federal and postal workers.\n  I will continue to work with any colleague, Democrat, Republican, \nIndependent, libertarian, vegetarian--it doesn't matter--who is willing \nto try to, yes, replace sequestration in a more rational way and get \nour debt and deficit under control.\n  I am proud of the fact that the 3\\1/2\\ years--I guess 4\\1/2\\ years I \nhave been here, there is no issue on which I have tried to work harder. \nI am proud of the fact I was one of the founders of the so-called Gang \nof 6 that built on the very good work of the Simpson-Bowles plan. And I \nremind my colleagues, anyone who thinks there is any solution that is \nnot going to involve raising additional revenues and starting to reform \nour entitlement programs either can't read a balance sheet or has not \ngrasped the magnitude of this issue.\n  I will continue to advocate for a balanced bipartisan blueprint that \nwill work on these issues: Raise the revenues, not to grow the size of \ngovernment but to pay our bills, make sure the promise of Medicare and \na Medicaid and Social Security are here, not just for today's \ngeneration but for future generations, in a way that is responsible.\n  We are soon coming up on another series of important fiscal and \nbudgetary deadlines. I know many of my colleagues and the American \npublic probably got to budget fatigue after the end of the fiscal \ncliffs and supercommittees and debt ceilings and thought maybe we were \npast a little bit of that.\n  Well, the economy is recovering and the size of the deficit is \ndecreasing but our challenge is still in front of us. We are soon set \nto come to the end of this fiscal year which will present these issues \nagain at the end of September. The debt ceiling will be not far after \nthat. I have heard there are only slightly more than 20 legislative \ndays left before the new fiscal year starts. It is incumbent upon us to \nrecognize, to reflect the voices of these Virginians who, again, don't \ncall out red team, blue team or House or Senate, but say to us in \nCongress, implore us to do our jobs.\n  We have been joined by my colleague, the Senator from Maryland. I \nthink we could debate whether Maryland or Virginia is more ground zero \nfor the negative impacts of sequestration. But whether it is NIH \nworkers in Bethesda or civilian Navy employees in Woodbridge, the \nstories are the same. This is not fair. It is not right. None of these \nfolks are getting a 20-percent discount on daycare, rent or, as the one \nperson said, repayment on their student loans.\n  It is incumbent upon us to get this problem fixed and that is going \nto require the kind of hard work on revenues and entitlement reform so \nmany of us have tried to avoid; otherwise we will not see an America \nthat will stay as competitive as it needs to be and we will disrespect \nthe literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of workers who work \ndirectly or indirectly to protect our Nation and are trying to provide \nthe services that are so essential to our people.\n  Let's not do any more harm. Let's not waste any more time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have not been on the floor during the \nentire remarks of my friend from Virginia, but I did hear part of it. I \nfirst want to thank him for his extraordinary leadership on behalf of \nthe people of Virginia and on behalf of a sensible way to resolve our \nbudget problems. The Senator has been a leader in building bridges and \nrecognizing how devastating sequestration is, not just to the Federal \nworkers who live in his State, not just to the people who live in his \nState, but to our entire country.\n  This is dangerous, sequestration. The Senator has been a leader in \npointing that out.\n  He has also made it very clear that sequestration is mindless across-\nthe-board cuts and that we have a responsibility to make priority \ndecisions. When we use sequestration we are on automatic pilot but it \nis an automatic pilot that cannot carry out its current mission. It \ncannot safely navigate the air. That is where we are.\n  I applaud my colleague for taking on this issue of saying to our \nfriends on both sides of the aisle: Let's listen to each other. We know \nwe are divided. We have different views. But we need to sit down, work \ntogether, and come up with a sensible way to balance the Federal budget \nto give the predictability that is necessary and to eliminate these \nsequestration cuts.\n  It is particularly painful right now when we have so many \nMarylanders, so many Virginians, so many people in this country who are \nreceiving paychecks with a 20-percent cut. Yet the work they have to do \nis the same.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Maryland for his comments. Let \nme say no Senator has served with more distinction, both here in the \nSenate and prior to that in the House, in being a constant advocate for \nFederal employees and being willing to step up to protect them and \nrebut what we too often hear from some of our colleagues who, across \nthe board, without distinction, demean and denigrate the extraordinary \ngood work that so many countless unnamed Federal employees do.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland for that work. I thank him for his \ncontinued willingness in conversations with me and others to talk \nabout: Hey, we all have to stretch a little way to get things done. I \nknow he is hearing the same thing in Maryland. People are not \ndistinguishing red shirt, blue shirt. They want us to get this done. I \nthank the Senator for his good work and I look forward to working with \nhim and folks on both sides of the aisle on this issue.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my colleague for his comments. I understand he \nalready mentioned what has happened at the National Institutes of \nHealth and the fact that, because of the sequestration cuts, the number \nof grants being given out this year, contracts with young scientists to \ndo research, is going to be cut by the hundreds.\n  We don't know which one of these researchers would have come up with \nan advancement, a major breakthrough, but there would have been some. \nAnd they are going to be denied. They may get discouraged, the people \nwho would have received these grants, and they may go into other \nfields. We may lose them forever. They may go to other professions. \nThey may go to other countries. But we know they are not doing the work \nthey are trained to do and we know they had a proposal that went \nthrough the most difficult vetting process and was selected for funding \nand should have been funded but is not being funded because of these \nsequestration cuts. That we know. That much we know for sure.\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\n  We also know it is not just that researcher who has been hurt by the \nsequestration cuts. It is the businesses that depend upon the basic \nresearch--many of which are small companies--in order to build upon \nthat research to create the products that go into the marketplace and \ncreate the jobs that are necessary for our economy. There is a direct \nloss to the economy of our country as a result of these sequestration \ncuts. It is time we move forward and resolve the problems of our \ncountry.\n\n  I agree with my friend from Virginia that we have to find a way on \nboth sides of the aisle to come together, but I must point out it has \nbeen extremely difficult, particularly with the climate in the other \nbody. In the current issue of New York magazine, Jonathan Chait writes:\n\n       The chaos and dysfunction have set in so deeply that \n     Washington now lurches from crisis to crisis, and once-dull, \n     keep-the-lights-on rituals of government procedures are \n     transformed into white-knuckle dramas that threaten national \n     or even global catastrophe.\n       The Republican party has spent 30 years careering ever more \n     deeply into ideological extremism, but one of the novel \n     developments of the Obama years is its embrace of procedural \n     extremism. The Republican fringe has evolved from being \n     politically shrewd proponents of radical policy changes to a \n     gang of saboteurs who would rather stop government from \n     functioning at all.\n\n  This brinkmanship is preventing the economic recovery from gaining \nsteam, it is preventing us from addressing urgent problems, and it is \npunishing all Americans, not just Federal workers.\n  If we come together on behalf of the American people, we can replace \nsequestration with a measured and balanced approach to deficit \nreduction. We can agree on a path forward to fiscal solvency that \nspreads the burden equitably. We can begin to solve our problems \ninstead of compounding them, but I will tell you what we can cannot do. \nWe cannot balance the budget on the backs of Federal workers. It isn't \nfeasible, and it isn't fair.\n  Increasingly, Federal workers are asked to do more with less. \nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, the size of the \ncivilian workforce relative to the country's population has declined \ndramatically over the last several decades, notwithstanding occasional \nupticks due to military conflicts or the taking of the census.\n  In the 1950s and 1960s, there were, on average, 92 Americans for \nevery Federal worker. In the 1980s and 1990s, there were 106 Americans \nfor every Federal worker. By 2011, the ratio had increased to 145 \nAmericans for every Federal worker. Since the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. \npopulation has increased by 76 percent, and the private sector \nworkforce has risen by 133 percent, but the size of the Federal \nworkforce has risen by just 11 percent.\n  Relative to the private sector, the Federal workforce is less than \nhalf the size it was back in the 1950s and 1960s. The picture that \nemerges is one of a Federal civilian workforce whose size has \nsignificantly shrunk compared to the size of the U.S. population it \nserves, the private sector workforce, and the magnitude of Federal \nexpenditures.\n  I previously talked about the adverse effect of sequestration on many \nof our domestic agencies. I have talked a little bit today about the \ncircumstances at NIH. I have talked about the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Social Security Administration, and other domestic \nFederal agencies.\n  I will focus, if I might, for the next few minutes on the impacts of \nsequestration on a particular group of Federal workers: the Department \nof Defense civilian employees who are part of a Total Force team \nproviding invaluable support to our men and women in uniform serving in \nharm's way. These proud individuals have in the past few weeks suffered \nunnecessary hardships due to sequestration.\n  The primary priority of our government is the defense of our Nation \nand sequestration adversely affects the civilian men and women who help \nprovide that defense. DOD civilians serve our Nation by advancing \nscientific research, providing logistical support to our servicemembers \nwhile forward deployed, and ensuring institutional stability within DOD \noffices as servicemembers rotate to different duty stations.\n  Recently, some in the media have promoted the idea that the $85 \nbillion sequestration cut triggered on March 1 isn't causing drastic \neffects. CNN called the cuts ``not as bad as advertised,'' and the \nWashington Post reported that the cuts are less ``scary'' than \npredicted. Tell that to the 46,000 DOD employees in Maryland and \nanother 103,000 in the Capital region who are being furloughed, losing \nup to 20 percent of their weekly pay through the rest of this fiscal \nyear.\n  Earlier this month, the Defense Department began furloughing 652,000 \ncivilian employees nationwide, forcing them to take up to 11 unpaid \ndays off through September. This is in addition to the furloughs at the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and the Internal Revenue Service. These furloughs \ndisrupt our national and economic security and put hundreds of \nthousands of Federal workers and their families in financial hardship. \nOur government cannot continue to provide for the defense of our Nation \nby maintaining such a harmful policy toward our civilian workers.\n  I have visited installations throughout Maryland. I have heard about \nand have seen the impact of furloughs of Defense Department employees \nand other Federal employees and the impact it will have on their \nability to carry out their mission. These cuts and furloughs are \naffecting the ability of the agency to carry out its legal mission.\n  For instance, at Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center in Charles \nCounty, over 1,870 civilian employees--about 97 percent of the total \ngovernment civilian workforce--are being forced to take leave without \npay 1 day per week. It puts base police and fire protection, safety \nprograms, air operations, air quality programs, and facilities at risk.\n  At Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, furloughs will hit \n2,400 Defense Department civilians--94 percent of the civilian staff. \nWalter Reed is the country's top facility for wounded combat soldiers. \nIts Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation is the largest within \nthe Department of Defense. Its seven specialty service clinics include \none for traumatic brain injuries. Soldiers needing expert care might \nhave to wait longer for appointments or be forced to nonmilitary \nfacilities, both of which will drive up costs and compromise the \nquality of care.\n  I cannot say how many of us have taken the floor to talk about our \ncommitment to make sure our service people--our wounded warriors--get \nthe type of treatment they deserve. Many of us have visited the Walter \nReed National Military Medical Center, and we are proud of the services \nthat are being provided. Sequestration is hurting our ability to meet \nthe mission we promised to the heroes who have served our Nation and \nhave now come home and expect that health care to be available to them.\n  At Fort Detrick 4,900 Defense Department civilians will be \nfurloughed. Those civilians support a multigovernment community that \nconducts biomedical research and development as well as medical \nmaterial management that includes everything from advanced bandages to \nvaccines for soldiers on the battlefield and in military hospitals. \nThat mission is at risk. There is no other place that can carry out the \ntype of advanced lab work that is done at Fort Detrick.\n  Aberdeen Proving Ground, Harford County's largest employer, home to \n11 major commands and more than 80 agencies, has approximately 11,500 \nDOD civilian employees subject to furlough, which is about half of \nAPG's workforce. Before sequestration, APG reported contributing more \nthan $400 million in payroll and $500 million in contracts annually. I \ncan assure everyone that community will be affected and many businesses \nwill be affected, as well as the mission at APG itself.\n\n  Just a few miles away at Fort Meade, Maryland's largest employer, \nsequestration is affecting the entire region. Most of its 27,000 DOD \ncivilian employees face furloughs. These furloughs have all sorts of \nunintended consequences. A furloughed worker, for instance, may have \ntrouble making his or her mortgage or car payments. Reduced credit \nworthiness may affect a worker's ability to maintain or obtain a \nsecurity clearance. Is that how we\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\nwant to treat people who have helped defend us from terrorists?\n  Budgets cuts compounded by sequestration will lead to brain drain in \nthe Defense Department, with some of the best and the brightest defense \nprofessionals in the Federal Government deciding to seek opportunities \nelsewhere.\n  The Federal workforce is better educated, older, and more \nexperienced, on average, than its private sector counterparts. A \nsignificant number of Federal workers provide their services to the \nAmerican people at a discount. They could command higher salaries in \nthe private sector, but they choose to work for the Federal Government \nbecause they are patriots and they believe in public service.\n  The world is still a dangerous place. In such uncertain times, we \ncannot afford to let political dysfunction get in the way of ensuring \nour national security. Sequestration is harming our national security \nreadiness.\n  Sequestration is not just about compromising the ability of Federal \nworkers to carry out their critical missions on behalf of all \nAmericans, and it isn't just hurting Federal workers and their families \neconomically. Private sector businesses and communities across the \ncountry are being hurt by the reduced purchasing power of furloughed \nFederal workers.\n  Federal workers are similar to everyone else; they support the local \nbusinesses in their communities: auto dealers, restaurants, dry \ncleaners, you name it. They all suffer when Federal employees suffer. \nThe local economy suffers and the recovery becomes that much harder and \nslower.\n  We need to stop demonizing and scapegoating and punishing Federal \nworkers. We need to replace sequestration with a rational budget. One \nof the greatest attributes of the American character is pragmatism. \nUnlike what some other Federal employees are actually doing, in \nCongress, balancing a budget is not rocket science. We know the various \noptions.\n  Former President Lyndon Johnson was fond of quoting the prophet \nIsaiah: ``Come, let us reason together.'' That is what we need to do. \nWe can acknowledge and respect our differences, but at the end of the \nday the American people have entrusted us with governing and with being \npragmatic. Let us do our job so Federal workers can get back to doing \ntheir jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Arizona wishes to address the Chamber about an upcoming motion to \nrecommit the bill.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, this is the first appropriations bill we \nare considering for fiscal year 2014. Unfortunately, in my view, it \ngets us off on the wrong foot because of the spending level. The bill \nspends more than $54 billion, which is about $5 billion above last \nyear's spending level and more than $10 billion over the House proposal \nfor this coming fiscal year. Considering that our debt stands at over \n$17 trillion, we ought to be spending less, not more this year.\n  This bill already takes a larger portion of the allowable spending \ncompared to last year. People will point out that the budget agreement \nwe agreed to in 2011 simply sets an aggregate number and that we can \nspend whatever we want in certain appropriations bills as long as the \ntotal doesn't go over $967 billion. That is true, but it is impossible.\n  I can say that with experience in the House and now in the Senate; \nthat if we overspend on the initial appropriations bills, we will \nsomehow cut back in the bills that come later. Often the last bill to \ncome up is the Defense bill. Nobody is going to undercut our troops or \nspend less on a defense bill, but that would be required if we were to \nstay under the budget control agreement number. When we overspend on \nthe initial appropriations bills like this, it simply means one thing: \nthat we are going to bust the budget.\n\n  I can tell my colleagues, to have any credibility with the taxpayers, \nwe have to stick to the agreement that was agreed to in 2011. We passed \nso far. We even went through the sequester because we couldn't come up \nwith an agreement to prioritize spending. But now, to go over the \nspending limit on the first appropriations bill would not set the right \nprecedent moving ahead into the appropriations bills. We simply have to \ndeal with this debt and deficit. This isn't the way to go.\n  That is why I support the upcoming motion to recommit that Senator \nToomey will offer in a few minutes that will simply recommit the bill \nto the Appropriations Committee and say: Come back with something that \nfits within the Budget Control Act that is similar to what was spent \nlast year, not overspending by $5 billion. I hope we will pass this \nmotion to recommit. I hope it will start off the appropriations bills \nin the Senate on the right foot.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Hoeven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from Maine, \nas well as Senator Toomey from Pennsylvania. I wish to express comments \nin regard to the motion to recommit we will be voting on around 3 \no'clock.\n  THUD is an important bill. It includes funding for things we consider \nabsolute priorities, including, certainly, transportation, roads, \nbridges, funds for housing and for other purposes. So we very much want \nto fund the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill.\n  The problem we have is we haven't agreed, as far as the \nappropriations bills, as to an overall total of how much we will spend. \nThat is really the problem we are confronting with this legislation.\n  Under the Budget Control Act, the total for all of the appropriations \nbills cannot exceed $967 billion. That is the law. That is the law. But \nthe majority party is appropriating to $1.058 trillion. That is a \nproblem. So as appropriators we want to go through prioritized \nspending, make sure we are funding the things that should be funded, \nand then for things that are lower priorities, not funding those so we \ncan truly fund the priorities that are important to the American \npeople.\n  The problem is we are not going to be able to do that unless we get \nan agreement on the total funding level, and that agreement is exactly \nwhat the BCA--the Budget Control Act--provides, and it says \nspecifically $967 billion. That is the law. That is the law.\n  We have a $17 trillion debt. We have a deficit this year that CBO \nprojects to be in the range of $750 billion. That is a real problem for \nour country. That is a problem we have to address. We have to get the \ndeficit and the debt under control. There are two ways to do that. One \nis to raise revenue that comes from economic growth, not higher taxes. \nIt comes from economic growth and getting our economy going. Of course, \nthe other way to reduce our deficit is to control spending, and that is \nwhat a budget is all about--and sticking to that budget. We ought to \nhave a balanced budget amendment, which I very much support. But what \nwe have right now is the Budget Control Act. It is the law.\n  So the question I ask is, Why is the majority party saying we are \ngoing to appropriate 12 appropriations bills that total $1.058 trillion \nrather than $967 billion? How are we going to get our deficit and our \ndebt under control if we don't adhere to the budget guidelines that are \nset?\n  So the simple and very clear point I wish to make is this: As \nappropriators and as Senators, I believe we all want to prioritize \nfunding. We want to make sure we fund the things that are important, \nsuch as infrastructure, such as housing, and other priorities. For \nthings that shouldn't be funded, we should say we are not going to fund \nthose items. That is the difference between prioritizing and the so-\ncalled sequester--the across-the-board cuts.\n  We are headed down a trail right now, if we approve this bill as is \nand bring other appropriations bills to the floor and approve them as \nthey are, the sequester automatically kicks in again. Under the law, \nthe sequester comes right back in and will bring these bills down to a \ntotal of $967 billion. So what have we gained? We\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\nhaven't accomplished what we are trying to do, which is to prioritize \nthe funding.\n  So let's find a way across the aisle to come to an agreement to make \nsure we prioritize funding and do so within the BCA limit of $967 \nbillion because that is what the law says. That is what the law says we \nhave to do. We need to find a way to come to an agreement.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, later this afternoon, Senator Toomey \nwill be offering a motion to recommit the Transportation-HUD \nappropriations bill back to the Appropriations Committee. While I \ncommend Senator Toomey's goal of ensuring that the fiscal year 2014 \nspending levels comply with the Budget Control Act spending caps, I do \nnot believe this is the right approach.\n  Let me be clear. I voted in the Appropriations Committee, as did \nevery Republican member of that committee, for a top-line level of $967 \nbillion. That is the amount that is in the Budget Control Act. That is \nlaw. But this is the very first appropriations bill that has been \nbrought to the Senate floor. We have no idea where we are going to be \nat the end of the process.\n  The two leaders of the Appropriations Committee have called for \nregular order, and I commend them for bringing appropriations bills to \nthe floor starting with this one, one at a time, for debate, amendment, \nand full consideration. We have had many amendments filed to this bill. \nSeveral of them would reduce spending that is in this bill. One reduces \nspending by $50 million for the HOME program that is being offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona. There is another that reduces spending by \nover $1 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Program. That \nis not a cut I happen to believe should be made, but that is a \nlegitimate amendment that, if it passes, would reduce spending in this \nbill by $1 billion. There are other amendments that have been proposed \nto reduce spending in this bill.\n  So this is turning the process upside down. It is recommitting to \ncommittee a bill before we have had the opportunity to determine what \nthe final spending level in the bill is even going to be as a result of \nthe many amendments that have been filed. Furthermore, we are not going \nto know if we have reached the cap until we finish all of the \nappropriations bills.\n  I realize my Democratic colleagues want a far higher spending cap \nthan I do and that the Budget Control Act provides, but I don't think \nwe should short-circuit the process when there has been a good-faith \neffort to bring appropriations bills to the floor.\n  What I would propose in lieu of the approach offered by my friend and \ncolleague Senator Toomey is an amendment which I am going to file this \nafternoon that says not later than October 1, the Committee on \nAppropriations shall revise the suballocations to the subcommittees for \nfiscal year 2014 such that the suballocations comply with the \ndiscretionary spending limits that are in the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act--what we refer to as the Budget Control \nAct, the BCA.\n  To me, this is the proper way to do it. If, at the end of the fiscal \nyear, we find that the appropriations bills that have been passed \nexceed the statutory cap in the BCA, then we should reopen the process \nand reallocate the funds--the ceilings, the caps--across each of the \nsubcommittees and produce bills that comply with the law.\n  Frankly, since current law applies this cap anyway, if we don't do \nthat, sequestration will take effect on January 1 of next year. I do \nnot think that is a good approach because it treats all programs as if \nthey are the same and does not allow us to set priorities.\n  So I think the approach of the Senator from Pennsylvania is \npremature, a blunt instrument, and there is a reasonable alternative. I \nthink it discourages a return to regular order where we bring the \nappropriations bills to the floor and where Members are free to \neliminate whole programs, to cut billions if they wish to do so. \nIndeed, Members have worthwhile amendments that would reduce spending, \nbut to send the bill back to committee before we have even had a chance \nto consider those amendments and before we have allowed the Senate to \nwork its will is, to me, completely upside down of the way the process \nshould work.\n  Furthermore, I will make the point once again that this is the first \nappropriations bill. How can we say the cap is breached when it is the \nvery first bill to be brought before the Senate? Frankly, having gone \nthrough this process where we did have a freestanding Transportation-\nHUD bill and Senator Murray and I went to conference with our House \ncounterparts, we came back with a consensus bill that became law that \nwas in between the amounts in the Senate bill and the House bill. So we \nended up at a lower level, which we knew we would, and which I will not \nfeel I am going out on a limb in predicting we would in this case as \nwell, since the Senate bill is higher than the House bill.\n  Why can't we let the process work? Why can't we consider the \namendments that have been offered, some of which may well pass and \nreduce spending? Why can't we go to conference with the House where I \nbelieve additional cuts are probably likely? And why can't we let the \nappropriations process unfold the way it should? Why should we short-\ncircuit it now by saying, that is enough, let's return the bill to \ncommittee, we don't trust what is going to happen, when there are \nsafeguards we can put in to ensure that at the end of the day we will \nbe at the cap of $967 billion?\n  As I said, I will file my amendment this afternoon to give us an \nactual mechanism to ensure that at the beginning of the fiscal year we \nare at those levels. That is one approach, and I think it is a far \nbetter approach.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n           Amendments Nos. 1756, 1803, 1785, and 1789 En Bloc\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, it is my understanding we have a \nRepublican Senator who is coming to the floor shortly to make a motion \nto recommit. For the information of all Members, at some point to be \nagreed upon, we will dispense with that motion this afternoon. We are \nhoping to do that. I know a number of Members have asked the timing on \nthat. I will work with the Senators and our staffs to try and do that \nas soon as possible. I know many Members are waiting.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Tax Code Reform\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Just outside this Chamber are the likenesses of \nWashington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and dozens of statesmen cast in bronze \nand marble. I often look to these individuals for inspiration and \nquotes when writing a speech.\n  On a recent walk across the Capitol to meet my colleague, Congressman \nDave Camp, I passed a giant statue of Andrew Jackson, our Nation's \nseventh President.\n  It was Jackson who famously said--and I quote him\n\n       The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation \n     that would operate with perfect equality.\n\n  Those words were spoken by Jackson in 1832. More than 180 years \nlater, our Nation still struggles with a broken tax system.\n  Our Tax Code today is inequitable, inefficient, and incomprehensible \nto the overwhelming majority of Americans. It contains nearly 4 million \nwords--4 million. If someone were to try to read the entire code out \nloud, it would take them more than 18 uninterrupted days.\n  Not only is the code long; it is maddeningly complex. There are 42 \ndifferent definitions of a small business in the code--42. There are 15 \ndifferent tax incentives for higher education--so many that the IRS had \nto publish a booklet to explain and simplify the higher education tax \nincentives. And that book--I have it with me--is 90 pages long--just on \nthe education tax incentives. Here it is. I defy anybody to read it, \nlet alone somebody trying to go to college or a parent trying to help \nhis or her child go to college.\n  The code is such a labyrinth that 90 percent of American taxpayers \nhave to use an accountant or some kind of computer software to file \ntheir tax returns. Even with all this assistance, it still takes the \naverage taxpayer 13 hours to gather and compile the receipts and forms \nto comply with the code.\n  The Tax Code today is also inefficient and unfair. It is riddled with \nloopholes and deductions that result in more than $1 trillion in lost \nrevenue each year.\n  This complexity in the code is eroding confidence in our economy and \ncreating uncertainty for America's families and businesses. Many \nAmericans think of the other guy, the fancy lawyer who can take \nadvantage of the code and pay lower taxes, which means more tax burden \non to me. It is not fair. Confidence is eroding.\n  It is also threatening to undermine the competitiveness of the United \nStates in the global marketplace.\n  Harvard Business School did a survey last year asking 10,000 of its \ngraduates who live and conduct business around the world about the \nchallenges of doing business in America. These individuals--these \n10,000--are leaders on the frontlines of the global economy, and they \nare pessimistic about America's economic future.\n  The vast majority of those surveyed--71 percent--expected U.S. \ncompetitiveness to deteriorate over the next several years.\n  And what did they identify as the root of America's competitiveness \nproblem? Respondents pointed to America's Tax Code--to the code--as one \nof the greatest weaknesses in the U.S. business environment.\n  Dig deeper and you learn respondents were deterred from investing in \nthe United States not simply by a higher statutory corporate tax rate, \nbut also by the sheer complexity and uncertain future of the Tax Code. \nI might say, when I mention that report to people, to businesses, to \nAmericans, they nod their heads in agreement. That is what they have \nfound themselves too.\n  The survey concludes with a dire warning--and I quote the survey:\n\n       For the first time in decades, the business environment in \n     the United States is in danger of falling behind the rest of \n     the world.\n       That's bad news for everyone. A fundamentally weakened U.S. \n     economy is not only an American problem but also a global \n     risk.\n\n  Chairman Camp and I have been working together for more than 2 years \non comprehensive tax reform. Here in the Senate I have been working on \ntax reform for the past 3 years with my good friend Senator Hatch, the \nranking member of the Finance Committee. We have held more than 30 \nhearings and heard from hundreds of experts about how tax reform can \nsimplify the system for families, help businesses innovate, and make \nthe United States more competitive.\n  A lot of people talk about more jobs. There is a lot of talk about \nmore jobs. This is one way to get more jobs. If we reform the Tax Code, \nit will unleash so much positive energy in this country. It would \ncreate a lot more jobs than any other plan I have recently heard of.\n  We held more than 30 hearings, heard from hundreds of experts on how \nreform can simplify the system, help businesses innovate, and make the \nUnited States more competitive. Last month Senator Hatch and I \ncompleted work with the Finance Committee on an extensive, 3-month, \ntop-to-bottom review of the Tax Code. We met as a full committee every \nweek to collect feedback on different topics in tax reform and issued a \nseries of 10 discussion papers to kick off that conversation.\n  In an effort to include the entire Senate in our efforts, we recently \ncalled on all Senators to partner with us and provide their input and \nideas for reforming the code. Starting with a blank slate, we called on \nevery Senator to submit their proposals for what they want to see in a \nreformed code. This is\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nan important exercise. Everyone needs to be involved. We need every \nSenator to weigh in on tax reform. I might say, the deadline is this \nFriday, tomorrow. I encourage all of my colleagues to submit their \nideas and make their voices heard.\n  I might say, your constituents are certainly making their voices \nheard. We have received more than 10,000 comments and ideas so far \nthrough the Web site that Chairman Camp and I created called \ntaxreform.gov--actually, 10,258 responses, to be exact.\n  Overwhelmingly, Americans, from every corner of our country, are \ncalling for a simplified Tax Code. People think they should not have to \nspend hours upon hours and hundreds of dollars to prepare their taxes, \nand I for one agree.\n  Let me share a couple of submissions we have received on our Web \nsite.\n  Jennifer, from Hollywood, MD, writes:\n\n       I've been doing my family's taxes for 22 years. This year \n     my husband suggested we use a tax service. Why? The tax code \n     is too complicated and he was concerned we were missing \n     deductions.\n\n  Mike, from Fort Collins, CO, provides an example of the complexity in \nthe code, writing:\n\n       I have been a tax assistance volunteer for 19 years. It is \n     difficult to tell someone who knows what a child is that \n     there are actually four different definitions for ``a child'' \n     in the tax law. Make the same definition apply across the \n     entire tax code. The best way is the simplest way.\n\n  Wendy from Irving, CA, writes:\n\n       I do not mind paying taxes--we need education, \n     infrastructure, and a defense. What I do mind is that it is a \n     complete mystery and a complete game to find every allowable \n     deduction and that it is a significant burden as well as a \n     significant expense to pay a qualified preparer. How has this \n     come to be? My returns are 20-50 pages long. Why is it more \n     than two? There must be a way to simplify the process.\n\n  You know what. Wendy is right. There must be a way to simplify the \nprocess.\n  That is the same message Chairman Camp and I heard earlier this month \nin St. Paul, MN. We were in the Twin Cities for the first in a series \nof trips we are taking across the country to speak with people about \ntax reform.\n  We want to get out of Washington. We are doing it this summer. We are \ngoing to Philadelphia next Monday to get input and feedback from people \non dealing with America's tax system.\n  St. Paul was a great trip. We met with leaders of two distinctly \ndifferent types of American businesses--one a U.S.-based multinational \ncorporation with more than 85,000 employees, the other a family-run \nbakery with 85 employees. While dramatically different in size and in \nindustry, they face similar challenges when it comes to dealing with \nAmerica's Tax Code. In conversation after conversation we heard the \nsame thing: We need a simpler Tax Code.\n  St. Paul was just the first stop. As I mentioned, the next trip is \nPhiladelphia. Then we plan to go to the west coast. We have other trips \nplanned over the next couple of months. We are going to talk to groups \nabout how we can make the tax system fairer and easier to deal with, \nand we want to learn how we can restore some confidence in the code.\n  Our efforts on reform have been ramping up. We are continuing to \nbuild momentum. Reform provides a historic opportunity to give families \ncertainty, spark growth, create jobs, and make businesses more \ncompetitive to provide America a real shot in the arm.\n  I will conclude my remarks as I began them--with a quote. These words \nare from our Nation's sixth President, John Quincy Adams. President \nAdams:\n\n       Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before \n     which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish.\n\n  That is where we are. We are patient. We are persevering. We have a \nlot to do. The difficulties will disappear, obstacles will vanish, and \nthe best result will be that the American people have a simpler, fairer \ncode to provide more jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to describe a motion to recommit \nthat I am going to offer. Let me start by providing a little bit of \ncontext to why I am offering this motion to recommit. That has to start \nby reminding my colleagues about the Budget Control Act that was signed \ninto law in 2011, about 2 years ago.\n  The Budget Control Act--which, again, is an act, not a bill--has been \nsigned into law. It is the existing law of the land. It established \nspending caps--limits on discretionary spending--in a modest effort to \ntry to bring out-of-control spending somewhat under control. So we have \na statutory limit on how much the Federal Government is permitted to \nspend. It is a limit on both the defense side and the nondefense side, \nbut it is a limit. It is an attempt to control that which has been so \ndifficult to control in this town, which is Federal spending.\n  I should point out that even if we abide by the spending caps that \nare in the existing law, if we follow the law, we are still going to \nrun a huge deficit. Next year the deficit will be about $560 billion. \nThat means that next year, if we have the spending discipline of living \nwithin the law, we will still increase our total outstanding debt by \nmore than $\\1/2\\ trillion and our debt as a percentage of our economy \nwill rise to 76 percent--76 percent debt-to-GDP ratio. Our debt-to-GDP \nratio is already higher than it should be. It is already costing us \neconomic growth and jobs. It is going to rise further. That is assuming \nwe stick to the spending cap.\n  I should point out that the way we got to this point is just spending \non autopilot, just growing spending every year. I will give one \nexample. Since 2000, total Federal spending has doubled. That is the \nscale of the increases in spending we have been experiencing. That is \nwhy we have been running huge deficits. We now have a massive debt. The \naccumulated debt is causing this big drag on our economy and preventing \nus from having the kind of job growth we ought to have.\n  Here is my big concern. The bill we are considering right now, the \nTransportation-HUD bill, puts us on a direct path to bust the caps, to \nbreak the law, to spend even more than the statutory limits we put in \nplace just 2 years ago. Let me walk through how we get there.\n  The fact is that under the Budget Control Act the cap that is set on \ndiscretionary spending for the fiscal year we are currently debating, \n2014, is $967 billion. That is the number. If you add up the spending \nsums for all of the appropriations bills my Democratic friends want to \npass, it adds up to $1.058 trillion. It is $91 billion more spending \nthan is permitted under current law.\n  It busts the caps by almost $100 billion. We cannot afford this kind \nof spending. We cannot afford the spending we are currently \ncontemplating, much less nearly another $100 billion.\n  Now, I should be clear. Any single bill does not bust the caps all by \nitself. It is what they do in combination. But this bill is one of a \nseries that in combination is designed to bust the caps. All you have \nto do is add up the total spending in each bill, and you get a number \nthat is much greater than the cap. So it is very clear.\n  This particular bill, by the way, is a huge increase. The \nTransportation-HUD bill spends over $54 billion in its current form, as \ncurrently contemplated. That is $5 billion more than in 2013. That is a \n10-percent increase in just 1 year. It is almost $10 billion more than \nwhat the House proposed. It is even more money than what the President \nof the United States asked for in his own budget request. He did not \nask for this much money. Yet here it is on the Senate floor, a bill \nthat busts the cap, increases spending dramatically, and spends more \nmoney than the President even asked for, at a time when we are running \nhuge deficits that are costing us economic growth.\n  I think this is a very bad idea, so I have a motion. I am grateful to \nhave the support of many of my colleagues, including Senator Shelby and \nSenator Hoeven, both who are appropriators. I think Senator Hoeven is \nintending to speak in support of this motion. Let me explain clearly \nwhat it will do. What my motion will do is send the bill back to \ncommittee with instructions to lower the spending in the bill to \n$45.455 billion. That is the number that would be consistent with the \nspending caps. It would allocate an amount of money to this \nappropriations bill, the Transportation-HUD bill, in proportion to what \nthe Transportation-HUD bill spends under the current fiscal year. It \nwould do that for the next fiscal year.\n  I am not suggesting that I would go through and line by line make all \nof\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nthe individual adjustments within the bill. I would leave that to the \ncommittee that has the most expertise, the Appropriations Committee. \nLet them do their work, but let them do it in a way that ends with a \nproduct that is consistent with the law, consistent with the spending \ncaps.\n  One point I should make about the spending caps in the Budget Control \nAct--I think there are some folks in this town who mistakenly think \nthat since deficits have gotten a little smaller in recent years than \nthey were in the past few years, somehow we do not have a deficit \nproblem anymore and we can just crank up spending. I have to say I \nthink that is a profoundly mistaken view. We still have a huge problem \nwith the spending path. A $\\1/2\\ trillion deficit is a devastatingly \nlarge deficit. As bad as that is, several years in the future, under \ncurrent projections--again, this assumes that we live within the law--\nwithin a few years these deficits start to explode again even beyond \nthe current levels, which are already unacceptable.\n  So I think this is very important. This is the first appropriations \nbill the Senate is considering this year. This is the one that is going \nto determine whether we are going to go down a path of disregarding the \nbipartisan, Presidentially signed law of the land which is in existence \nright now. This bill is designed to be part of a process to bust that \nwide open so that we spend more money that we can't afford. That would \nbe a huge mistake.\n  This is a motion to recommit back to the committee, report out a bill \nwhere they can establish the priorities and the allocation within the \nlimit but set the limit at a level that is consistent with the caps.\n  I move to commit S. 1243 to the Committee on Appropriations with \ninstructions to report back with such changes as may be necessary such \nthat total budget authority for fiscal year 2014 is not greater than \n$45.455 billion.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise to strongly oppose this motion \nthat is now before the Senate. I urge all of my colleagues to vote \nagainst it as well. Senator Collins and I have worked very closely \ntogether to write a bipartisan transportation and housing bill that \nworks for our families and our communities. We have been working here \ntogether on the floor to have an open debate and accept amendments from \nboth sides of the aisle. We just accepted a number of them a few \nminutes ago.\n  In addition to six Republicans who explicitly supported this bill in \ncommittee, along with all of the Democrats, a total of 73 Senators \nvoted to start debate on this bill. But now this motion that is now \nbefore us would take all of that bipartisan work we did on this bill in \ncommittee and it would take the strong bipartisan support coming out of \ncommittee and just throw it all away and ask us to simply now adopt the \nHouse Republican budget and start all over again. There is absolutely \nno reason for us to go back to the drawing board, especially not under \nthe conditions that are laid out in this motion.\n  Back in March we had a very vigorous debate here in the Senate about \nour values and our priorities when it came to the Federal budget. We \ndebated about the future of Medicare. We talked about how the \nwealthiest Americans should contribute their fair share. We debated \nwhat should be done with overall spending levels and the automatic cuts \nfrom sequestration that were put in place in the bipartisan Budget \nControl Act in order to bring both sides to the table to replace them \nwith more responsible deficit reduction.\n  Everyone will remember that we spent dozens of hours debating the \nbudget on the Senate floor. Then my colleagues had a choice. We ran an \nopen process. Any Senator could bring an amendment to the floor. We \nconsidered over 100 of them from Democrats and Republicans. One of my \nRepublican colleagues even offered the House budget as an amendment, \nwhich locks in that overall sequestration level but actually ignores \nthe Budget Control Act by simply pushing the entire burden onto seniors \nand families in our communities. But, as we all know, the House budget \nwas rejected by the Senate. It got only 40 votes here, and 5 \nRepublicans actually voted against it. The Senate budget we ended up \npassing replaces sequestration with an equal mix of responsible \nspending cuts and new revenue by closing tax loopholes that benefit the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  The House passed their budget that locks in sequestration on \nsteroids. The Senate passed our budget that replaces sequestration with \nmore responsible deficit reduction. I absolutely agree with my \ncolleagues that we cannot finish that budget process until we find a \nway to bridge that divide between the House and Senate. But I want to \nbe clear here. A motion to recommit on an appropriations bill is not \nthe place to have the debate on the overall spending levels. That is \nwhat a budget conference is for. That is where the two sides need to go \nto work out a deal. But, as my colleagues all know, despite the efforts \nof many Republicans and Democrats alike, a few Senators--very few \nSenators--continue blocking a bipartisan budget conference. So far we \nhave been unable to even get in a room to talk about that.\n  We are going to keep trying to start a budget conference and work \ntoward a bipartisan deal. Until we do, the bipartisan work that is \nbeing done in the Appropriations Committee now, led by the chairwoman \nSenator Mikulski has to continue.\n  Now that my colleague has brought this motion to the floor that \nattempts to lock in sequestration and force the House budget onto our \ntransportation and housing bill, let's talk about it for a few minutes.\n  The bill we are debating right now, the transportation and housing \nbill, could not exist at the worse-than-sequestration levels that are \nbeing pushed in this House. My partner on this bill, Senator Collins, \nhas been clear, as I have, that the differences between the House and \nSenate transportation bills could not be more stark.\n  Our bipartisan bill here in the Senate continues to invest in our \ncommunities through the Community Development Block Grant Program, \nCDBG, while the partisan House bill cut that in half to the lowest \nlevel ever, which would mean 40,000 fewer jobs in this country. \nCommunities across the country would have to halt projects they are \nplanning to help get their communities moving again.\n  Our bipartisan bill in the Senate invests in Essential Air Service \nand makes sure there is enough in the program to cover all the \ncommunities that currently participate in it.\n  The House partisan bill that this motion would recommit and put us \nback into the position of considering would shortchange the entire \nprogram and cut it more than one-third. It includes additional language \nthat would kick out communities in States such as Montana and New \nMexico that absolutely depend on this.\n  The bipartisan bill the Senate has invests in our families to make \nsure they have a roof over their heads when they need it most, to help \nthem if they are disabled or seniors who need to stay off the streets. \nThe partisan House bill would serve 132,000 fewer people, many of whom \nwould end up homeless without this support.\n  Those are only a few examples. I could name many that are in this \nbill. If sequestration numbers were to be blocked in the way this \nmotion that is before us envisions, we will continue seeing the impact \nacross our entire Federal Government.\n  As Secretary Hagel has made very clear, the defense worker furloughs \nwould continue and get worse. In my home State of Washington--I talked \nabout it on the Senate floor this morning--we have seen the \nconsequences of those cuts. Do you know where we are seeing them? In \nplaces such as Madigan Hospital where a young woman came and told me \nabout being furloughed on Fridays and what it translated into in terms \nof people having their brain surgeries delayed because of the shutdowns \non Friday. This is what we are talking about, doctors and nurses being \nfurloughed in our Army hospitals as we have injured soldiers who need \ncare.\n  This sequestration is going to impact funding for our firefighters \nwho are protecting our homes and lands, civilian employees, and it will \nhit the law enforcement officials who are protecting our cities from \nthe threat of terrorism. It will strip funds from cancer research at \nNIH. Our roads, bridges,\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\nand rails will continue to crumble, and small businesses will pay the \nprice.\n  This would be happening while a lot of other countries that are our \ncompetitors in the global marketplace are doing the opposite. They are \ninvesting in themselves. They are setting themselves up to compete in \nthe 21st century economy.\n  This is the reality of sequestration. It may not make the news every \nsingle day in every paper. We may not see all the impacts right away, \nbut it is very real, and it will truly be devastating. It will be \ndevastating for our families. It will be devastating for our national \nsecurity and our long-term economic growth if we don't replace it. By \nthe way, it is not just Democrats who are saying this. Economists such \nas Ben Bernanke have said it is hurting the economy. Many of my \nRepublican colleagues have spent a lot of time going around the country \ntalking about how devastating it is on the defense side.\n  I am happy to have this debate. I don't think this bill, the \nappropriations bill, the transportation and housing bill, is the place \nto do it.\n  If the Senator from Pennsylvania and others wish to start a debate \nand a negotiation between the Senate budget and the House budget, they \nshould stop objecting to us going to conference. That is where this \nshould occur.\n  Until then, I urge my colleagues to reject this motion and allow us \nto continue working on the bipartisan bill we have worked so hard to \nbring to the Senate. Let's work in creating jobs, investing in \ncommunities, and lay down a foundation for long-term and broad-based \ngrowth.\n  I move to table the motion, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask that I be allowed to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I would ask the Senator if the Senator from Maryland \ncould speak for 5 minutes. I would notify all of my colleagues that we \nintend to go to the motion to table once that debate occurs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to thank my colleague Senator Toomey for raising \nthis matter and asking to recommit the legislation so the Senate \ncommittee, the appropriate committee, would produce a THUD plan for \nspending that complies with the Budget Control Act, which is a law of \nthe land.\n  Senator Toomey is one of our most knowledgeable Members on finance in \nthe Senate. He is a member of the Budget Committee. He fully \nunderstands the significance of this matter.\n  If this legislation passes at the level it is moving forward today, \nthen we are eviscerating the promises we made to the American public in \nAugust of 2011. In August of 2011, everyone should remember quite well, \nthat we said we would raise the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion. We will \nreach that by the end of this year. We will have used up and borrowed \nanother $2.1 trillion before the end of the year, but we said that we \nwould reduce spending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years to make it easy on \nourselves and to spread out the spending cuts.\n  This was passed into law with bipartisan support and signed by \nPresident Obama. This is not some law that was made up out of thin air. \nIt was a law that was debated and passed in both Houses of Congress. \nRepublicans and Democrats agreed to it, and it improved our spending a \nlittle bit.\n  We were then spending at the rate of $37 trillion over 10 years. We \nwere projected to increase spending to $47 trillion over 10 years. This \nbill reduced it to $45 trillion.\n  Under the current spending limits we now have, as Senator Toomey has \nso ably pointed out, we are going to increase spending over next 10 \nyears. We are going to increase it from $37 trillion to $45 trillion at \na time when we have been running the largest deficits the Nation has \never seen, bar none. An absolutely irresponsible level of debt has been \nadded to our country.\n  Even this modest proposal agreed to by the President, voted on by the \nmajority party in the Senate, supported in a bipartisan way--is set to \nbe demolished before 2 years is up: Oh, it is too tough. We can't \nreduce the growth of spending from $47 trillion to $45 trillion. Oh, \nthis is going to destroy America.\n  Well, why don't we look for ways to spread out the cuts and \ndistribute some to the departments and agencies that got zero \nreductions in spending, such as Medicaid and food stamps zero \nreduction. No, we can't touch those. They are sacrosanct, and other \nprograms too.\n  We have some reductions in spending on the discretionary accounts \nthat we can sustain, and it will be tough. That is what we are paid to \ndo.\n  The bill should properly go back to the committee, and a vote in \nfavor of the Toomey motion would instruct the committee to produce a \nbill that is consistent with the Budget Control Act.\n  May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Essentially, the majority leader has already said that \nhe intends to bring up the defense bill last, national security last. \nWhy is he going to do that? He is going to do that because he is going \nto let all these other bills go over the budget limit, and then he is \ngoing to produce the defense bill and say: Oh, colleagues, we have to \nadd more money to the defense bill, putting us over the BCA limits that \nwere agreed to and passed into law. We have to waive that and spend \nmore.\n  This is how a Nation goes broke. This is how we lose credibility with \nthe American people.\n  We looked them in the eye in August 2 years ago and we said we were \ngoing to reduce the growth of spending a little bit, $2.1 trillion, in \nexchange for raising the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion.\n  The majority party here is blithely walking in, pretending that never \nhappened and saying: Oh, we didn't intend to pass a limit.\n  Why did you vote for it then, if you didn't intend to pass it? We did \nintend to pass it. We promised the American people $2.1 trillion in \nreducing the growth of spending not a reduction in spending, just a \nreduction in the growth of spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We need to honor that promise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING Officer. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I wish to thank Senator Murray and Senator Collins \nreturning us to regular order and bringing an appropriations bill to \nthe floor that is consistent with the budget resolution passed by this \nbody. I also wish to compliment my colleague from Maryland, the \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee Senator Mikulski.\n  We are returning to regular order in the Senate. I find it amazing. \nIt was only a week ago my colleagues on the Republican side were saying \nwe don't want to turn the Senate into the House. Now we have a motion \nto recommit that would take the House numbers. We didn't do that.\n  Should we only have a unicameral legislature? I thought we thought \nthis body was important. Yet this motion to recommit will have the \neffect of saying that what we do in this body doesn't make any \ndifference; let's just take the House's bill. I don't think that is \nwhat we want.\n  The House bill that has been reported I don't think it has yet been \nvoted on was a partisan bill. What we did in this body is have \nDemocrats and Republicans working together. That should be the model we \nuse in this institution. The motion to recommit would destroy that, \nwould take that away. That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.\n  Let me talk on the merits, if I might, for one moment, and that is \nwhat this motion would mean as far as jobs in this country and \nresponsible investments. Remember that we are operating under a budget \nresolution that will reduce the deficit. It gets us to actually \nstronger efforts to reduce the deficit.\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\n  I can't speak to every category of spending, but I do know something \nabout transportation. I serve on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. There is bipartisan support on our committee to do more than \nwhat is in this budget. We have trillions of dollars' worth of roads \nand bridges that are falling down. We have to invest, to create jobs. \nWe understand transportation creates jobs. The motion to recommit would \ntake us to numbers that are lower than the sequestration numbers.\n\n  I was just on the floor a few minutes ago talking about how the \nsequestration is hurting this country--it is hurting job growth, \nhurting our economy, hurting Federal workers, and hurting ordinary \nAmericans. Well, this motion makes it worse. It goes below the \nsequestration numbers. We need to invest in job growth, we need to do \nit in a balanced, responsible way, and that is exactly what Senator \nMurray did in wearing her hat as chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. She has now brought out an appropriations bill totally \nconsistent with the action there.\n  Here is the real hypocrisy. What we have said on our side of the \naisle is we understand there is a difference. Let's go to conference \nand resolve the differences. And the same people who are supporting \nthis motion will not let us go to conference to resolve the \ndifferences. We should return to regular order. Reject this motion to \nrecommit.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nToomey motion to recommit. This motion to recommit would send the \ntransportation-housing bill back to the committee with a new allocation \nof $45.5 billion, a cut of $8.5 billion from the Senate bill's current \nlevel of $54 billion. The THUD subcommittee would then have to rewrite \nits bill to the new, lower allocation.\n  This motion is simply a backdoor approach to make sequester the new \nnormal by slashing the THUD bill. This is a cut of the magnitude \nproposed in the Ryan budget. I remind my colleagues the Ryan budget \nputs a moat around defense spending, and cuts $91 billion from domestic \nprograms. I will not accept sequester, I will not accept the Ryan \nbudget, as the new normal.\n  The allocation for the THUD bill is based on a topline of $1.058 \ntrillion. This is the presequester topline contained in the American \nTaxpayer Relief Act, a law that passed the Senate by a vote of 89 to 8 \nin January. The allocation for THUD proposed by the Toomey amendment is \nbased on a topline of $967 billion, the postsequester level.\n  Those who support $967 billion want to make sequester the ``new \nnormal.'' They say: We must follow the law, and sequester is the law. \nFirst of all, the House is not following the law. The House ignores the \nlaw by taking all $91 billion of cuts out of domestic discretionary \nprograms.\n  This committee's spending allocations assert that sequester will be \nreplaced with a balanced solution to the deficit problem that will be \ndecided in a conference on the budget resolution. But guess what. Six \nSenators have objected to a conference on the budget resolution. And \nnow this motion to recommit is further sand in the gears of the \nappropriations process. But I am determined that this committee will \nnot be undermined by this obstructionism. While we wait for the Budget \nCommittee to be able to do its job, we will continue to do our job.\n  Colleagues, this isn't a disagreement about whether we should have \nacross-the-board cuts. Nobody thinks across-the-board cuts are smart. \nThis is a disagreement about how much we will invest in America, in our \ninfrastructure, our people, and our national security.\n  The Toomey motion to recommit would require huge cuts--in this case, \n$8.5 billion in cuts--but it provides no specifics. The THUD bill keeps \nAmerica moving on land, at sea, and in the air. This motion to recommit \nstops America in its tracks. If this motion passes, roads will not be \nresurfaced, bridges will not be replaced or repaired, air traffic \ncontrollers will not be hired, and airports will not be upgraded. And \nall these cuts mean one thing--fewer jobs--fewer good American jobs.\n  The FAA modernization program will be delayed--again. This delay will \ncause more congestion at our airports and leave America further behind \nin the global economy. And these cuts mean safety will be put at risk, \nwith fewer resources for the agencies charged with keeping us safe on \nthe roads and in the air. These cuts today have consequences for years \nto come. This is true for our physical infrastructure, and it is true \nfor our human infrastructure.\n  This motion is irresponsible and should be rejected. It demands $8.5 \nbillion in unspecified cuts, which would have terrible impacts on \nAmerica's infrastructure, and on our efforts to create good jobs right \nhere at home.\n  I believe our government should meet compelling human needs. It \nshould provide for the national defense. And our government should make \nsmart investments today so our Nation will grow stronger tomorrow.\n  This motion to recommit puts all of these essential functions at risk \nand would have terrible near-term and long-term impacts. I strongly \noppose the Toomey motion to recommit.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the motion to recommit, offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to let all Senators know that we \nhave made tremendous progress on the transportation and housing bill. \nWe intend to make more progress next week. We are going to stay in \nmorning business this afternoon. We have a few issues we are working \nout through the weekend. We will be back at this next week.\n  I wish to thank all of the Members who have worked very hard with us \nthis week, and I look forward to working with them again next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I too wish to comment on the progress we \nhave made this week. We have been considering this appropriations bill \nunder regular order. We have actually cleared several amendments today. \nWe have had some votes. We have defeated a motion to recommit the bill \nto committee so that we can proceed to go forward.\n  Senator Murray and I will be here on Monday, ready and open for \nbusiness. We will start sequencing amendments.\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\nI hope Members on both sides of the aisle will approach this bill in a \ncooperative spirit with respect to further rights of Senators to offer \ntheir amendments and get votes, and that we will not see Members \ndrawing lines in the sand or deciding that they are going to block \naction going forward because I think this bill could be a model of how \nwe should operate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1744\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Tuesday, the Senate adopted an amendment \noffered by the junior Senator from Louisiana, which effectively imposes \na lifetime ban on individuals who have been convicted of certain \nserious crimes from obtaining Federal housing assistance. Today is a \nnew legislative day, and many of us in this body may have already moved \non to the next meeting, the next issue, the next vote. But as I have \nreflected on that amendment, I am concerned the direction these types \nof amendments are taking us.\n  I had significant concerns with the lack of notice given to Senators \nabout the amendment offered by Senator Vitter, and the speed with which \na vote was scheduled. In the span of roughly 90 minutes, the amendment \nwas filed, made pending, and set for a rollcall vote. This amendment \nwas never considered by the relevant subcommittee in the markup of the \nbill, nor vetted for unintended consequences.\n  I am deeply concerned about what the sort of amendment offered by the \njunior Senator from Louisiana says about us as a Senate, and as a \nNation. Following on the heels of a similar amendment offered by \nSenator Vitter on the farm bill, I expect that similar amendments will \nbe filed and offered on virtually every future bill. This has to stop.\n  In our system of justice, when someone is convicted of a crime and \nserves a sentence, I believe that person deserves a second chance and \nan opportunity to reintegrate as a productive member of society. That \nis a principle of fairness and justice that I know not only from my \ndays as a prosecutor, but through my time as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is a basic notion instilled in me from an early age, and \nreinforced by my faith. As I have long heard from the faith community, \nit is our moral obligation to rehabilitate and restore people who have \ncommitted crimes. We all have made mistakes, and I challenge any Member \nto come to the floor and say that they haven't themselves sought \nforgiveness or a second chance.\n  We have to get past the point where we are scoring political points \non the backs of those who have committed crimes but have served their \nsentence. We must find a way to reintegrate them into society. That is \nhow we make our communities safer.\n  No one in this body should want a convicted felon to become a repeat \noffender. And I assume no Senator wants to punish the family members of \nan offender for crimes they did not commit. Yet that would be the \neffect of the Vitter amendments. Such measures have the effect of \nextending punishment beyond the original term; they would act as a \nlifetime ban and make it harder for ex-offenders and their families to \nget back on their feet. I reluctantly supported the amendment this week \nbecause Federal regulations already give housing officials the ability \nto keep dangerous criminals, sex offenders, and domestic abusers out of \npublic housing. While this diminishes somewhat the overall impact of \nthat amendment, the mandatory draconian nature of the Vitter amendment \nremains deeply troubling. As the senior Senator from Louisiana stated \nwhen Senator Vitter offered a similar amendment a few years ago, such \nan approach is simply ``mean-spirited and counterproductive.''\n  I am concerned that this is just the first of a series of similarly \nmean-spirited and counterproductive amendments. Now that the Senate has \nmoved to impose a lifetime ban on food and housing assistance for some \nwho have served their criminal sentences, what will be next? Will we \nnext decide to take away education or employment assistance? Should we \nban ex-offenders from libraries or public parks? The aggregate effect \nof such efforts will be to relegate an ex-offender and perhaps his or \nher family to a lifetime of poverty, homelessness, and isolation. That \ndoes not make us safer. It just makes us meaner and less compassionate. \nI hope we will stop using this political tactic and work together to \nhelp give people a second chance.\n  I know many Senators here share this goal. This is a complicated \nissue that demands thoughtful solutions, and we must work together if \nwe have any hope of achieving real change. Public safety is about more \nthan lengthy prison sentences. It also requires efforts to reintegrate \ninto our communities those who have served their time. We know that \nreentry efforts reduce recidivism and we must be thoughtful when we \ntake options off the table like we did this week.\n  I praise groups like the Conference of Catholic Bishops, Prison \nFellowship, and the Sentencing Project who have worked tirelessly to \nhelp provide opportunities for individuals who have committed crimes, \nand to work toward the rehabilitation and restoration of their \nfamilies. At the core of their work are fundamental notions of justice \nand compassion--the same principles that I hope will guide the work of \nthe Senate as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5948-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, what we have seen is a recognition that \nthese are tough times and we need some belt-tightening. But to go back \nto this level of sequestration is not the right thing to do because \nthat is taking a meat cleaver approach, across-the-board, on cutting \nFederal programs. It is just not a responsible way of belt-tightening. \nFortunately, this motion to recommit, to in essence go to the level of \nappropriations for Transportation and Housing and Urban Development \nthat was to take it to the level of the House, which is considerably \nlower than what has come out of our Appropriations Committee in the \nSenate--fortunately, this motion to recommit was defeated.\n  Why do we want to cut funding, as the House bill does, to critical \nareas such as air traffic controllers?\n  It is dangerous, shortsighted, and we have been to this rodeo before. \nAs a matter of fact, doesn't anyone remember that earlier in the year \nwe had to fix the sequestration cuts that went into effect in the \ncurrent fiscal year because it was cutting out all kinds of air traffic \ncontrollers and furloughed a number of them and closed the contract \ntowers for the small airports? We had to reverse that. The public rose \nand said: This is not the right nor intelligent thing to do when it \ncomes to the public safety.\n  In addition to compromising the safety of the traveling public, those \nair traffic cuts would have increased the flight delays by hours and \nhours and caused a lot of cancellations. Lo and behold, when the \nAmerican traveling public saw that was exactly what was happening, they \nrose and they said: Enough. The body politic responded. Here was an \nattempt to repeat that. If we reduce the top line of funding for this \nnext fiscal year on this bill, we are going to be right back in the \nsame situation where we were last spring: scrambling to keep our \naviation system functioning safely and again delaying the next \ngeneration of air traffic controllers which we are desperately trying \nto set up.\n  This House of Representatives sequestration budget--outside of \naviation--is going to mean more crumbling roads and bridges, more \nfamilies unable to put a roof over their heads, and our infrastructure \nwill continue to be falling into further disrepair. So it is our \nresponsibility to keep our country safe and the economy moving. Thank \ngoodness we rejected this attempt to go back to the Dark Ages, but we \nare going to have more and more of this.\n  We have a bill that is coming up next Tuesday in a markup in the \nCommerce Committee of the NASA authorization bill. Here is a bill that \nhas never been partisan. It is not only bipartisan, it has been \nnonpartisan. We have never\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\nhad a partisan vote on a NASA authorization bill. Three years ago on \nthe NASA authorization bill that broke a lot of new ground, we passed \nit out of the committee and out of the whole Senate unanimously.\n  I am very saddened to report to the Senate that next Tuesday we are \ngoing to have a markup of the NASA authorization bill. There is not a \ndisagreement as to the balance we have in the bill between the big \nrocket called the Space Launch System, its capsule, its spacecraft, \nOrion, or what we balance against commercial rockets trying to get \ncargo and crew to the International Space Station. There is not a \ndisagreement on that.\n  There is not a disagreement on keeping up the programs on our weather \nsatellites--all of the stuff we put up for NOAA so that, in fact, we \ncan predict our weather, and in hurricane season that becomes \nespecially important. There is not a disagreement about continuing the \nexploration program with the robotic spacecraft to Mars and to other \nplanets as well as putting up a satellite, in part for the Department \nof Defense, to warn us against the solar nuclear explosions on the \nsurface of the Sun so we can get ready to save our satellites by the \ntime that nuclear radiation gets to Earth. There is no disagreement on \nthat.\n  There is no disagreement on the future of the new space telescope \ncalled the James Webb Space Telescope that is going to replace the \nexisting one when it goes on the blink. It has uncovered all of these \nsecrets of the universe as we peer back into time on the universe.\n  There is no disagreement on the substance of this bill. The partisan \nvote that is going to occur on Tuesday in the Commerce Committee is \ngoing to be because of the funding level. The bill Senator Rockefeller \nand I have offered that will be voted on will be, unfortunately, a \npartisan vote because it takes the level of funding of the budget \nresolution which is $18.1 billion. The vote will be partisan because of \nthose who want the sequester to apply, and as such they want $16.8 \nbillion instead of $18.1 billion or even lower, as the House of \nRepresentatives has done, $16.6 billion.\n  I can tell everyone that little agency, NASA, can't do all of these \nthings I just mentioned that there is no disagreement we need to do. \nGetting humans back into space, preparing for the next major \nexploration with humans in the decade of the 2030s, going to the planet \nMars--there is no disagreement with that. But we can't do it if we \ndon't provide the funds now to develop the techniques, the technology, \nthe procedures, and build our way like building blocks to ultimately \nwhere we can send humans multiples of millions of miles away from the \nhome planet and bring them back safely.\n  Sadly, I am afraid we are going to have a partisan vote because of \nthat disagreement on the level of funding. It will be the first time \never we are going to have that kind of vote recorded on that little \nagency called the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. So, \njust like today, here we go.\n  Down the road, this is going to have to be decided, and it probably \nwill come very late in the year. It will probably come when we come to \nanother crisis point of having to raise the debt ceiling. It will \nprobably come to the point where we have all kinds of good and new \nideas on tax reform that will be coming out--a major tax reform--of the \nFinance Committee. We are limping along on appropriations bills just to \nkeep us funded and to keep the government functioning after October 1 \nin the new fiscal year. At some point, all of this is coming to a head, \nincluding what level of funding is it going to be.\n  I hope we will start using some common sense and act accordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5949-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5949-S5950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, even as I speak at this very moment--or \nmaybe he has wrapped up--the President is in Jacksonville, FL, today. \nHe is discussing the middle-class and how to get the middle class \ngrowing again in America, and it is a very worthy topic.\n  I wish the President would do less talking and more listening. If he \nlistened to the middle class--and particularly those middle-class \nAmericans who either work at a small business or own a small business--\nhe would hear the No. 1 concern many of them now have is about \nObamaCare.\n  Recently, I made the statement that I don't believe we should pass a \nshort-term budget here that pays for ObamaCare. Since that time, I have \nheard the comments of some that that is an unreasonable request. I wish \nto outline one more reason why I think it is an unreasonable request to \nactually fund it. It is unreasonable because of the impact ObamaCare is \nhaving on real people--particularly those in the middle class in the \nUnited States.\n  I wish to focus on small businesses today because they truly are the \nbackbone of the American economy. People here throw that term around \nall the time, ``the backbone of the economy.'' It truly is.\n  I live within a few blocks of 8th Street, the famed Calle Ocho, where \nliterally every business is a small business, such as bakeries, \nsandwich shops, you name it. They are primarily run by immigrants who \nare here in search of a better life and the American dream. They own \nthese small businesses. They will be impacted by the changes this law \nwill have, and I wish to describe some of them.\n  Yesterday, we had a hearing in the Small Business Committee where the \nadministration spoke first. Basically, their take on it is that \nObamaCare will be good for small businesses for two reasons: One, we \nwill set up these health exchanges small businesses can go to and offer \nhealth insurance to their employees on these exchanges.\n  Basically, the exchange is a one-stop shop. A company owner can go \nonline--and there are theoretically 8 or 10 private insurers--and the \nowner of the business gets to pick a plan from one of those choices and \ntheir employees get insured from it. In theory that is not a bad idea. \nHowever, in a moment I will outline why that is not working out.\n  The second thing they brag about is the tax credit that small \nbusinesses will be able to use. I want to use the testimony--not just \nof them but of small businesses--to outline why, in fact, these things \nare not only not going to work, but ObamaCare is going to be deeply \nhurtful to small businesses and the middle class.\n  Let's talk first about the exchanges. The exchanges are not unfolding \nas they were planned. I asked the administration yesterday: Is it going \nto be ready about October 1? Are businesses going to be able to go on \nthis exchange and find an insurance plan for their employees? They said \nthey are sure it is going to happen. But the truth is it is not working \nout that way.\n  There are 17 States that have decided to go on to their own \nexchanges. All 17 of those States are behind schedule in one form or \nanother. Maryland was one of the first States to embrace it. They asked \nfor a delay in April because they couldn't get it going on time.\n  A recent report from the Government Accountability Office reported \nthat all 17 States were behind schedule and that they were missing \ndeadlines on 44 percent of the key things they had to do.\n  Here is the second problem: These exchanges only work if you have a \nlot of companies competing against each other, but that is not \nhappening either. Insurers are not flooding to offer insurances on \nthese exchanges.\n  Let me give an example. There are three States: Washington State, New \nHampshire, and North Carolina where only one company has responded. \nThere is no competition, and that is what is supposed to drive down the \nrates. In another State, not a single company responded until very \nrecently when Humana came in to save the day and actually decided to \njump on board.\n  Here is what the vice president of a consulting firm that specializes \nin this--it is called Avalere Health. Caroline Pearson is the vice \npresident and she said:\n\n       Humana may have a difficult time building competitive \n     networks in [Mississippi], so we could see higher than \n     average premiums in this region.\n\n  Again, another reason to doubt that these exchanges are going to work \nand the impact it is going to have is terrible.\n  What about the tax credits? That is a great idea, right? We are \ngiving tax credits to small businesses that they can use to buy health \ninsurance for\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\ntheir employees. That is not working out either.\n  Let me give an example: Only 14 percent of companies that are \neligible for the tax credit are using it, and I will explain why.\n  I have a quote from Pat Thompson, a tax partner at Piccerelli, \nGilstein & Company, in Providence, and chair of the American Institute \nfor Certified Public Accountants, who said:\n\n       The definition of an eligible business is challenging \n     because it is not based on [the number of] employees, but on \n     full-time equivalents. For companies with a lot of part-\n     timers . . . that is not very transparent.\n\n  He went on to say that the way to decide whether you are qualified \nfor this tax credit is so complicated that most small companies can't \nfigure it out. In fact, the companies that benefit the most from the \ntax credit are the ones that are least likely to get it because they \ncannot afford to hire a professional accounting firm to figure it out \nfor them.\n  Here is another one from the Birmingham Business Journal. The manager \nat a health care consulting group, Warren Averett, LLC, said that only \n20 percent of the small businesses they deal with even qualify for the \ncredit. He said many businesses he worked with offered less than 50 \npercent, and bumping their coverage to meet the requirement would have \ncost them more than the credit saved them.\n  These are serious problems with this tax credit, not to mention that \nthe General Accounting Office has already said the credit is so small \nthat it is just not enough to change the equation for these small \nbusinesses to use it.\n  What is the bottom line? The bottom line is that two of the things we \nare being told are going to help small businesses with ObamaCare are \nnot going to. One is an exchange that is relying upon there being \ncompetition among insurers. They are not signing up, folks. The other \nis this tax credit that is being deeply underutilized and it is so \ncomplicated and so small that most small businesses will not benefit \nfrom it.\n\n  I say all that to my colleagues because yesterday we heard from a \nreal small business owner--someone who is the epitome of what it means \nto own a small business in America. His name is Larry Katz. He owns \nsome restaurants called Dots Diner. Here is what he said. His dream was \nto own his own company so he cashed in his whole life insurance policy, \nhe calculated how much credit card availability he had, and emptied his \nlife savings. With less than $200,000, he opened his first diner. \nWithin 12 months he had stopped sleeping. He was down to less than \n$10,000 in savings. He considered two options: Either mortgage his home \nor declare bankruptcy. That is what he faced, but he made it through, \nas many small businesses make it through in America. Today he owns 6 \ndiners, 85 employees, 65 of them are full-time.\n  Here is what he offers those employees today: paid holidays, \nvacation, dental, vision, term life, and health insurance. He offers \nthose to them right now, but because of how much ObamaCare is going to \ncost him, here is what he is going to have to do. He said:\n\n       I have unfortunately made the decision to quit offering \n     coverage as soon as the employer mandate kicks in, as the \n     penalty, while huge, is less than the costs of offering the \n     required coverage to all of our employees.\n\n  What he is basically saying is that there are employees today in his \nbusiness in Louisiana who have health insurance, who are happy with \ntheir health insurance, but because of ObamaCare they are going to lose \nthat health insurance.\n  One of the promises made to the American people was, if you are happy \nwith your health insurance, you get to keep it. I know of at least one \nbusiness in Louisiana where that is not true, and I promise it is not \nlimited to just this business. In fact, the evidence keeps coming in \nfrom all over the country the impact this is going to have.\n  Here is a quote from Texas: At Lion & Rose pubs and Golden Chick SA \nrestaurants, 1,000-plus employees saw their work schedules reduced to \npart-time shifts.\n  From the Wall Street Journal: Ken Adams has been turning to more \npart-time workers at his 10 Subway sandwich shops in Michigan to avoid \npossibly incurring higher health care costs.\n  From the same article: Rod Carstensen, owner of 11 Del Taco \nrestaurants around Denver in Colorado, began in April converting his \nmostly full-time workforce into one comprised of mostly part-time to \nhelp minimize the health care costs.\n  This is the real impact.\n  Interestingly, I asked an administration official yesterday: Can you \ntell us whether anyone who has health insurance now and is happy with \nit will lose it?\n  The answer: I can't answer that.\n  I don't know if she meant she doesn't know or if she meant she can't \ntell me. But I can tell my colleagues, and small businesses will tell \nus, if we talk to them, the impact this is going to have is not only \nthat people are going to lose their health care coverage, they are \ngoing to lose their hours and get moved from full time to part time.\n  Here is something: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did a poll: 74 \npercent of small businesses plan to deduct the costly law of ObamaCare \nby either firing workers, reducing hours of full-time staff and moving \nthem to part time or not offering any coverage at all.\n  This is the real-world impact of ObamaCare on the middle class and \nworking class. This is terrible for our country.\n  This is no longer a Republican or Democratic issue. It doesn't matter \nif a person voted for Mitt Romney or Barack Obama. This is going to \nhurt everybody. There are working-class people in America who have \nexisting insurance who are happy with their doctor, and they are going \nto lose all of that because of this experiment. There are people today \nwho are struggling to make it just as it is, and they are going to lose \ntheir hours. They are going to get forced from full-time work to part-\ntime work. That is the real-life impact of ObamaCare. That is the \nimpact it is having on the working class and on the middle class.\n  How can we go forward with this? We have a chance to stop this. It \nmay be our last best chance, and it comes in September when we have to \npass a short-term budget in this Chamber. If we vote for a budget that \nfunds this, this is going to move forward and hurt people terribly, and \nthose who vote for it are going to have to answer for that.\n  To my Republican colleagues I would just say this: If we are not \ngoing to draw a line in the sand on ObamaCare, we have no lines in the \nsand. If this issue is not important enough for us to draw a line in \nthe sand, what issue is? This is not a political issue. This is not a \npartisan issue.\n  Today I am giving this speech on behalf of the hard-working men and \nwomen of this country--working class, middle class, small business \nowners--who are going to be terribly impacted by this law. We cannot \njust stand by and allow it to go further. We have to do everything we \ncan to keep this from happening to people, and in September we will \nhave our last best chance to do that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5950-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5950-S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, America has a rich history of immigration. \nWe are a nation of immigrants. There is hardly a person in America \ntoday who doesn't have an immigrant parent, grandparent, or at least \nsomeone in their lineage who came to this country from another place.\n  I have told this story many times on the floor: My mother was an \nimmigrant. She was brought to America at the age of 2 from Lithuania. \nHer son now stands in the Senate. That is my story, that is my family's \nstory, but it is America's story. It can be repeated over and over and \nover again.\n  We think about the Statue of Liberty and how it thrills so many \npeople to\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\nsee it for the first time and then to understand the message of the \nStatue of Liberty: To ``lift my lamp beside that golden door'' so that \npeople are welcomed to this country. We knew it from the beginning: It \nwas the key to our future.\n  So many times this issue of immigration is overlooked. It is such a \ncritical part of who we are in America. Think back in your own family \nhistory--one generation, two or three generations--to a person in a \nforeign land who said one day, ``We are going to America,'' who \nundoubtedly was questioned about that decision: You are going to a \nplace you have never been, to a place where they don't speak our \nlanguage, to a place where they eat different kinds of food? That will \nbe quite a challenge. Well, it was. Millions of people made that trip \nand came to this country facing that challenge, and they made us who we \nare today.\n  In the DNA of most of us who live in America is some little \nchromosome that said there is a courage to move and a courage to come, \nand I think it makes us better.\n  I think immigration is one of the most important parts of America. \nThank goodness immigration continues because it brings to our shores \namazing people, new generations of leaders who found companies and \nworked hard so their children and their children's children will do \nbetter.\n  If that is a fact about America and our history of immigration, there \nis also another fact. There have always been haters--people who hate \nimmigrants. I don't know when it started. Maybe after the Mayflower \nlanded, the folks got off and said: Please don't send us any more. But \nit has been part of American history and part of American political \nhistory and part of the Congress.\n  I was reading a book as we started to debate the question of \nimmigration reform entitled ``Coming To America'' by Roger Daniels, and \nit is a history of immigration in America. It speaks of a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives in 1924 named Albert Johnson. He was a \nRepublican from Washington State.\n  When I read this book on the history of immigration, I came up with \nsome interesting quotes. It is in 1924. Albert Johnson, a Republican \nfrom Washington State, is chairing the House Committee on Immigration. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       Today, instead of a well-knit homogeneous citizenry, we \n     have a body politic made up of all and every diverse element. \n     Today, instead of a nation descended from generations of free \n     men bred to a knowledge of the principles and practice of \n     self-government, of liberty under law, we have a \n     heterogeneous population no small proportion of which is \n     sprung from races that, throughout the centuries, have known \n     no liberty at all. . . .\n\n  Congressman Johnson said:\n\n       Our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands \n     diluted by a stream of alien blood with all its inherited \n     misconceptions respecting the relationships of the governing \n     power to the governed. It is no wonder, therefore, that the \n     myth of the melting pot has been discredited.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The United States is our land. We intend to maintain it so. \n     The day of unalloyed welcome to all peoples, the day of \n     indiscriminate acceptance of all races, has definitely ended.\n\n  That was a statement made by a Member of Congress in 1924. You read \nit today and you think to yourself, how could anyone possibly be \ntalking about racial purity in the United States of America, as he did? \nIt draws so many terrifying parallels to a debate that happened not \nmany years later in Europe over racial purity, but it happened. And it \nhappened in the U.S. Congress. Sadly, that was not the end of hatred \ntoward immigration in the U.S. Congress.\n\n  Twelve years ago I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act. The DREAM \nAct was a response to a constituent case in my office. A young woman, a \nKorean woman in Chicago, called our office. She had a story to tell. \nShe said that she had brought her daughter at the age of 2 from Korea \nto the United States, to Chicago, on a visitor's visa, along with her \nhusband. They envisioned that her husband would open a church. They \nlooked forward to that day, and it never happened. Her husband \ncontinued to pray for that miracle for their family, but the mother \nsaid: I have to go to work. The mother went to work in a drycleaning \nestablishment in Chicago.\n  If you have been to that wonderful city, you know that the majority \nof drycleaning establishments are run by Korean families--hard-working \npeople who work 12 hours a day and do not think twice about doing it.\n  Well, this woman went to work, but she was not making much money, and \nher little girl, as well as the girl's brother and sister, grew up in \ndeepest poverty. The little girl tells the story that when she went to \nmiddle school and high school, she would wait until the end of the \nlunch hour, when students were throwing away the part of their lunch \nthey did not eat, and she would dig through the wastebasket to find \nfood. That is how poor they were.\n  But something came along in her life that made all the difference in \nthe world. In Chicago we have something called the MERIT Music Program. \nA woman decided 10 or 15 years ago to leave some money, and she said: \nUse this money to provide musical instruments to children, poor \nchildren in public schools, as well as the lessons they need so they \ncan play the instruments. The MERIT Music Program is an amazing \nsuccess. One hundred percent of the students who are enrolled in that \nMERIT Music Program go to college--100 percent.\n  Well, this little girl, this Korean immigrant girl, was brought into \nthe program and introduced at the age of 12 to a piano for the first \ntime. She fell in love with the piano, and she started working and \npracticing on it. She would stay at MERIT Music Program headquarters \nlate into the night. They finally gave her a key because it was warm \nand she wanted to practice her piano.\n  She became such an accomplished pianist that by the time she was in \nhigh school she was accepted into the Juilliard School of Music and the \nManhattan Conservatory of Music--amazing for this poor Korean girl. \nWhen she applied and went through filling out the application, she came \nto the line that said ``nationally and citizenship,'' and she turned to \nher mother and said: What do I put here?\n  Her mom said: I don't know. We brought you here at the age of 2, and \nwe never filed any papers.\n  The girl said: What are we going to do?\n  The mom said: Let's call Senator Durbin.\n  So they called our office, and we checked on the law. The law in the \nUnited States is very clear and very cruel. The law in the United \nStates said that little girl had to leave this country for 10 years and \napply to come back--10 years. She had been brought here at the age of \n2. She was only 17 or 18 at the time.\n  Well, that is when I decided to introduce the DREAM Act. The DREAM \nAct said that if you were brought here as a child to the United States, \nif you complete high school, if you have no criminal record of any \nconcern and you are prepared to either enlist in our military or finish \nat least 2 years of college, we will put you on a path to becoming a \ncitizen of the United States of America. That was the DREAM Act, \nintroduced 12 years ago, called on the floor many different times for \npassage. It finally passed just a few weeks ago as part of \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  I might tell you the end of the story about this young girl. She did \nnot qualify for any financial assistance because she was undocumented. \nTwo families in Chicago and one woman who is an amazing friend of mine \nnamed Joan Harris said they would pay for her education. She went to \nthe Manhattan Conservatory of Music. She excelled in the piano. She \nplayed at Carnegie Hall. She married an American jazz musician and \nbecame a citizen of the United States, and now she is working on her \nPh.D. in music. She just sent me her tape for her Ph.D., and she is \namazing.\n  Tereza Lee is her name. She is the first DREAMer, and it is because \nof her that I come to the floor today. You see, just yesterday it was \ndisclosed that a Member of the House of Representatives, Congressman \nSteven King of Iowa, spoke to the issue of the DREAMers. I do not know \nhow many DREAMers--students who would qualify for the DREAM Act--\nCongressman King has met. I have met hundreds of them. They are \namazing, incredible, living their entire lives in the United States \nundocumented, fearing deportation any minute of any day, wondering\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\nwhat tomorrow will bring, standing up in the classrooms of America and \npledging allegiance to the only flag they have ever known, singing the \nonly national anthem they know, and being told by so many people: You \ndon't belong here. You are not part of this country.\n  They are completely conflicted and worried and uncertain about their \nfuture, and they are nothing short of amazing. These young people have \ndone things with their lives that are just incredible. They are the \nvaledictorians of their classes in many cases. They have gone on to \ncollege and paid for it out of their pocket in many cases.\n  I have come to the floor on 54 different occasions with colored \nphotos of these DREAMers from all over the United States, when they \ngave us the permission to disclose their identities, and told their \nstories. And every time I have told that story about that DREAMer, \nsomeone has stopped me in the hall and said: That is an amazing story \nabout this young person who just wants to be part of the United States \nand its future.\n  So it was troubling yesterday to pick up and read the quote from \nSteven King, who is a Congressman from Iowa. Mr. King is no newcomer \nwhen it comes to criticizing immigration. He introduced a bill 3 or 4 \nweeks ago in the House of Representatives that would have removed all \nof the Federal funds that are being used now to spare these DREAMers in \nthe United States from deportation. In other words, the President has \nissued an Executive order so the young people who are eligible for the \nDREAM Act can stay. He wanted to remove all the funds so they would \nhave to be deported immediately. He called that for a vote. It passed \nin the U.S. House of Representatives just a few weeks ago, \noverwhelmingly supported by his Republican side of the aisle. So Steven \nKing has a record of opposing immigration and doing it in a very \nforceful way.\n  But they found a quote he had made, a statement he had made on the \nissue of DREAMers, and that is why I come to the floor today.\n  In an interview with Radio Iowa, Mr. King said yesterday, as reported \nin the Washington Post:\n\n       ``It seems as though I have a few critics out there, but \n     those who have been advocating for the DREAM Act have been \n     trying to make it about valedictorians,'' King said in an \n     interview with Radio Iowa. ``I don't disagree that there are \n     DREAMers that are valedictorians, but it also would legalize \n     those that are smuggling drugs into the United States.''\n\n  In his original comments, Congressman King of Iowa said, ``For \neveryone who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh \n130 pounds--and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because \nthey're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.''\n\n       In his interview Tuesday evening, [Congressman King] \n     doubled down on those comments--\n  According to the Washington Post--\n\n     saying, ``We have people that are mules, that are drug mules, \n     that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by \n     their physical characteristics what they've been doing it for \n     months.''\n\n  Mr. President, if you are going to be part of this political \nbusiness, you better have a pretty tough spine and a pretty hard shell \nbecause people throw criticism around all the time, and if you cannot \ntake it, this ain't beanbag, do something else.\n  But I deeply resent what was said by Congressman King about these \nDREAMers. It is totally unfair. It is mean, and it is hateful. Do not \ntake my word for it; take the words of the Republican leaders who \nresponded to Mr. King.\n  House Speaker John Boehner, commenting on Congressman King's \ncomments, called them ``wrong'' and ``hateful.'' That is from Speaker \nBoehner.\n  House majority leader Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, said they \nwere ``inexcusable.''\n  During a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee hearing Tuesday, \nRepresentative Joseph Garcia, Democrat of Florida, described King's \nwords as ``beneath the dignity of this body.''\n  Representative Raul Labrador, Republican of Idaho, who has been \nheavily involved in immigration reform, expressed hope Wednesday that \nKing regretted his remarks. ``There's nobody in the conference who \nwould say such a thing and I hope that he, if he thought about it, he \nwouldn't say such a thing again,'' Labrador said.\n  It is heartening to know that Members of Congressman King's own \npolitical party--Republicans--have stated unequivocally how awful his \nstatement was. It troubles me and it is heartbreaking to think that \nthese DREAMers--these young people who are simply asking for a chance \nto be part of the United States--would be characterized as dope \nsmugglers and drug smugglers.\n  Obviously, Congressman King has never read the DREAM Act because if \nyou have ever been convicted of a crime, you cannot be approved through \nthe DREAM Act for citizenship--not a serious crime. That is part of the \nlaw. He should know better, but I am not sure that he cares.\n  I am glad Members of his own party have stepped up and branded these \ncomments for what they are. What I have to say to him is, take a moment \naway from the media, meet some of these DREAMers, and hear their \nstories. Hear what they have been through, and hear about what they \nwant to do with their lives for the future of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  To the DREAMers themselves, this is not the first criticism they have \nrun into. They have taken a lot. They are courageous young men and \nwomen.\n  When I started this trek, this 12-year trek on the DREAM Act, I used \nto give speeches in Chicago about the bill, and there would be \naudiences full of Hispanics usually. Nothing much would be said. I \nwould go out to my car afterward, and in the darkness there would be a \ncouple students waiting by the car. They would call me to the side, \nafter they looked both ways to make sure no one was around, and they \nwould say: Senator, we are DREAMers. We are counting on you to give us \na chance. Over the years, these young people who waited to greet me in \nthe darkness when no one was around have now stepped up. They are \nidentifying who they are so America knows what is at stake.\n  When you meet the DREAMers, you will realize how awful and wrong \nthese statements by Congressman King are. There will always be critics \nof immigration in America. It is part of our national tradition. But I \ndo believe the vast majority of Americans are fair people. They are \npeople who believe in justice. They do not believe that a child--that a \nchild--should be held responsible for any wrongdoing by their parent. \nIf their parent brought them to the United States as a baby, they had \nno voice in that decision. Why should they be penalized for that \ndecision? They should be given their own chance to become part of this \nNation's future.\n  I will close by saying that maybe Tereza Lee was not the first \nDREAMer in my life. My mother was brought here at the age of 2 and \ncertainly did not have much of a voice in the decision to come to \nAmerica. But thank goodness her mother and father decided to make that \ntrip and that my grandparents located in Illinois and gave me a chance \nto grow up in a great place with a great family. That is my story, and \nthat is America's story.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Durbin is such an eloquent \nchampion for righting injustice, and I am always impressed with him, \nand I do agree that the American people are good and decent people. \nThey want the right thing. They want the right thing on immigration. \nPart of that is a lawful system of immigration that serves the national \ninterests of our country. We disagree on how to get there sometimes, \nbut you cannot dispute the passion of Senator Durbin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5952-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5952-S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts about the \nPresident's tour today and the last couple of days talking about jobs.\n  Well, I have to say, first and foremost, this country is not doing \nwell economically. It is just not.\n  You hear the stock market is up, and people try to translate that \ninto substantial progress in the economy. But it is just not there, \nparticularly with jobs. The fourth quarter of last year, our GDP growth \nwas .4 percent. By the time the first half of this year concludes, we \nare not going to have 2 percent growth over that period.\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\n  You are not going to create jobs unless you have economic growth. We \nare not seeing it. Wages are down. Wages have declined since 1999 for \nworking Americans by virtually any calculation. Wages have been \ndeclining. Unemployment is up. The number of people working today is \n2.1 million fewer than in 2007. We have 2.1 million fewer people \nworking today than in 2007.\n  This is the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, \nthere is no doubt about that. But we have done all kinds of \nextraordinary things. We had the biggest stimulus--all borrowed--spent. \nThey are going to stimulate the economy and create growth. Has it \nproduced real growth or is it just a sugar high, as one of the Wall \nStreet gurus referred to it? It appears quite clear that it is a sugar-\ntype high.\n  We have more and more plans from our leadership here in the Senate. \nIt is basically tax and spend. The American people are hurting. Their \nwages are falling and so forth. They have unemployment problems. So we \npromise to tax more and we are going to spread more money around and \nborrow more. And this is somehow going to put us on a sound path to \nprosperity, job growth, and wage increases, which is what we need. \nPlease note these facts.\n  I do not mind the President talking about the issue. I know he is \nusing the words ``middle class.'' Well, he should. Middle-class working \nAmericans, struggling Americans--someone needs to be thinking about \nthem. But you also have to have policies. A speech is not a policy. A \nspeech is not tangible, something that creates growth, jobs, \nprosperity, and increased wages. GDP growth last quarter was only 1.8 \npercent and has averaged at or under 2 percent since the end of the \nrecession in 2009.\n  There is a major corporation, a CEO--which is common throughout the \nbusiness--he just said quite frankly: We are not hiring anybody if the \nGDP growth in America is not over 3 percent.\n  Well, we haven't had 3 percent growth--hardly had it--since 2009. He \nactually is not filling vacancies still even though we are having \nmodest growth and people possibly are trying to oversell that.\n  I am just saying that the economy is struggling. It is not growing \nrapidly enough to create jobs. We have record unemployment.\n  The Wall Street Journal panel of economic experts expects slow growth \nfor the rest of this year at 2 percent or less. They have revised their \nforecast down. The President and Congressional Budget Office a year or \nso ago were predicting higher numbers than this. They are not coming \nin. Now they are revising downward what they expect the economy to do \nin the second half of the year.\n  We need more than a speech, in my opinion. After 6 years since the \nbeginning of the recession, we still have not created as many jobs as \nexisted in December of 2007. Americans are working 5 billion less hours \nthan in 2007. Think about that--5 billion less hours than in 2007.\n  Some say: Well, our immigration plan--my colleague recalled my \nattention to it--is somehow going to fix that. We will bring in more \nworkers, and everyone is going to get pay raises, and unemployment is \ngoing to be reduced.\n  But that is not what the Congressional Budget Office told us.\n  At a time when we are struggling to find jobs for American workers, \nmany of the unemployed are immigrants to the country, African \nAmericans, poor people struggling to get by, and you continue to bring \nin a larger flow of labor than the country can absorb. As Mr. Peter \nKirsanow from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said, we do not have \na shortage of workers in America, we have an excess of workers in \nAmerica. We have more workers than we have jobs.\n  The fastest growing type of work today is part-time employment. Over \n320,000 part-time jobs were created last month compared to 95,000 full-\ntime jobs. They are counting these part-time employment jobs as \nemployment. Well it is better than nothing, I suppose. We are having a \nsurge of part-time employment, driven in large measure by the \nPresident's health care policies. It just is. Everybody knows that.\n  New unemployment claims, which came out this week, are up. In other \nwords, the number of people who are filing for unemployment insurance \nhas gone up, I hate to say. There were 7,000 more in July, to 343,000.\n  The average net worth of American households is down. Someone said \nrecently that net worth was back to nearly what it was prior to the \nrecession. That was something we heard based on, I guess, the stock \nmarket primarily. But another analysis looked at it and said: Well, \nwhat about the share of the debt of Americans? That has increased \ndramatically since 2007. Once you calculate the debt all of us owe as \nAmerican citizens to the total debt of America, household net worth is \n60 percent lower than it was in 2007.\n  It is time for this Nation to begin a serious discussion about what \nit is that is causing our economy to slide and what we can do \nrealistically to create jobs, increase growth, get higher wages, and so \nforth. One of the things we should not do is bring in more labor than \nwe have jobs for. That is pretty simple to me. One of the things we \nshould do is try to bring down the cost of energy, not increase the \ncost of energy. One of the things we should do is eliminate the \nunnecessary regulations that drive up costs and produce nothing but a \nburden in exchange. We need a tax system that favors growth. We need to \ndefend on the world stage the legitimate interests of America and our \nworking people. We have not effectively fought back against unfair \ntrade. We can do a better job of that. There are a lot of things we can \ndo that do not revolve around taxing more, borrowing more, and spending \nmore. That is what the policies are here.\n  We have a bill on the floor right now that busts the budget wide \nopen. We agreed to these limits 2 years ago. Senator Shelby, the \nranking Republican on the Budget Committee, stood firm for the \nagreement levels we agreed to. It was not easy, but we agreed to it. \nOh, no, the majority has to spend more than the amount that currently \nis limited by law.\n  So I guess what I would say is that President Obama is correct to at \nleast talk about this issue, but we need to do more than talk. About \nall we are hearing when the President talks is plans to invest more, to \nspend more, to tax more, and to borrow more. That will not change the \ndebt course of America. We need real policies to put us on a path to \nprosperity that protects the American worker from unfair foreign \ncompetition, from excessive labor brought into the country, and from \ntoo high energy costs. There are a lot of other things we can do that \nwould promote prosperity in the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MARKEY). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5953-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5953-S5956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as we all know, we have a jobs crisis in \nAmerica. High unemployment and weak economic growth have festered for \nnearly 5 years. American families are increasingly dependent upon \ngovernment, and businesses are being suffocated by it all over this \ncountry.\n  I believe our ability to emerge from this jobs crisis stronger than \nbefore depends upon government performing its proper role in the \neconomy. In my view, that role is to establish the conditions for job \ncreation and economic growth in the private sector. Through stable \nfiscal policy, a simplified tax code, and streamlined regulation, the \ngovernment can create an economic environment conducive to risk-taking \nand innovation that leads to real job creation in this country. \nUnfortunately, the same toxic combination of government overreach and \ninaction which has failed to produce a jobs recovery in this country \nthus far also threatens to prolong the jobs crisis, I believe, for \nyears to come.\n  We learned in the last few days that President Obama is planning a PR \nblitz to gloss over his failed economic agenda. Over a series of \nspeeches he will give around the country, he said he will discuss his \nvision for the future. But he will offer nothing new. According to the \nNew York Times, his jobs plan is ``largely repackaging economic \nproposals that the President has offered for years.'' We need a fresh \nfree market approach to job creation. Stale Obama policy leftovers will \nnot cut it. They are not new ideas. It is not a new beginning.\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\n  I will preface my remarks here on the fiscal, tax, regulatory, and \nmonetary policy challenges we face in this country with a more detailed \ndescription of the current macro-economic conditions, starting with job \nnumbers.\n  The official unemployment rate in the United States is 7.6 percent. \nThat makes 54 straight months of unemployment above 7\\1/2\\ percent. \nHowever, as grim as those figures are, they do not tell the full story. \nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the real unemployment rate \nin this country--known as U6--is 14.3 percent unemployment. U6 includes \nthose who are unemployed, those who want to work but have stopped \nsearching for a job, and those working part time because they cannot \nfind full-time work. Some 22.6 million Americans fall under this \ncategory I have just described. That is the real unemployment. That is \nsad.\n  The real unemployment rate was 14.2 percent when President Obama took \noffice in January of 2009. It peaked at 17.1 percent in late 2009 and \nearly 2010 but has not fallen below 13.8 percent during his time in \noffice. By all measures this has been a jobless Presidency thus far.\n  Digging further into the numbers reveals more troubling trends. The \nnumber of people working part time because their hours were cut back or \nbecause they cannot find full-time work increased by 322,000 people \nlast month to 8.2 million people in this country. The percentage of the \nunemployed who have been without work for 27 weeks or more also remains \ndangerously high at 36.7 percent.\n  An analysis by the Hamilton Project in February of this year found \nthat we will not get back to full employment for another 10 years based \non recent job-creation numbers. Meanwhile, economic growth remains \nsluggish.\n  The most recent figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate \nthat the U.S. real gross domestic product, GDP, grew at a tepid 1.8-\npercent annual rate in the first quarter of 2013--this year.\n  Average annual real GDP growth was just 0.8 percent over President \nObama's first term in office, the full 4 years.\n  We are experiencing the weakest economic recovery since the Great \nDepression. As a consequence, government dependency in this country is \non the rise. Under President Obama, the number of Americans on food \nstamps has increased by 47 percent to 47 million people; 8.9 million \nAmericans collect disability pay, and that number is increasing by \n70,000 people a month, unheard of in the past.\n  These are alarming figures. How did we get there? I will explain.\n  Overspending. The current job crisis, I believe, is a product of the \n2008 financial meltdown we all went through. No one denies that \nPresident Obama was dealt a tough hand coming into office. He was. But \nthe question is, What did he do about it?\n  President Obama's first act in office, if you will recall, was to ram \na $787 billion stimulus package through Congress. He promised the \nAmerican people it would keep the unemployment rate from rising above 8 \npercent. Instead, the unemployment rate hit 10 percent in October of \n2009 and remained above 8 percent for the next 43 consecutive months, \naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  But President Obama's spending binge was just getting started. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the congressional budget \ndeficit in 2009 was $1.413 trillion. In 2010, an additional $1.294 \ntrillion. In 2011 it was another $1.3 trillion, and in 2012 $1.087 \ntrillion--not billion, trillion. Although the 2013 deficit we are in \nnow is projected to get below $1 trillion, it will still be $183 \nbillion higher than any pre-Obama deficit.\n  Looking at the big picture, the national public debt now stands at \njust under $17 trillion, an increase of nearly 60 percent under \nPresident Obama.\n  What has been the result of this spending spree? Taxpayers got more \ndebt, but job seekers didn't get more work.\n  Compounding our fiscal difficulties, Social Security and Medicare \nremain on an unstable long-term footing. These programs alone already \naccount for 38 percent of Federal spending. But over the next 25 years, \nthe Congressional Budget Office projects their share--that is Social \nSecurity and Medicare--of GDP to increase by 40 percent.\n  According to the trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds, Medicare is expected to run out of money in 13 years, and Social \nSecurity will go broke by 2033. Saving these essential programs \nrequires Presidential leadership. Unfortunately, there has been none to \nspeak of. President Obama's spending binges have precipitated multiple \nbudget showdowns and, as a result, they have also presented many \nopportunities for spending and entitlement reform.\n  But President Obama has not risen to the occasion yet, despite broad \nconsensus that we must take action to save Social Security and \nMedicare. President Obama used the power of his office to campaign pre- \nand postelection for one thing, tax increases.\n  Tax increases are not the solution to a spending problem. Tax hikes \ndo not create jobs. Tax hikes will not generate growth. Tax hikes kill \njobs and allow President Obama to spend more and for Congress and the \nPresident to borrow more. I believe what we need in this country is \nstructural tax reform, not tax increases.\n  According to the most recent data from the Internal Revenue Service, \nthe top 1 percent of taxpayers, those making $369,000 or more, pay \n37.38 percent of all income taxes. I wish to say it again. According to \nthe IRS, 1 percent of the taxpayers paid 37 percent of all income \ntaxes.\n  The top 5 percent of taxpayers, those making $161,000 or more, paid \n59 percent of all income taxes. Think about it. The top 10 percent of \nall taxpayers, those making $116,000 or more, paid 70 percent of all \nincome taxes.\n  The top 25 percent of taxpayers, those making $69,000 or more, pay 87 \npercent of all income taxes.\n  The top 50 percent of taxpayers, those making $34,000 or more, pay 97 \npercent of all income taxes.\n  Meanwhile, the other 50 percent, those making $34,000 or less, pay \n2.36 percent, a little over, not quite 2.5 percent of all income taxes. \nIn addition, approximately half of U.S. households pay no income tax.\n  Despite these imbalances, President Obama increased taxes on the \nwealthiest Americans by $617 billion in January of this year. Still, a \nHeritage Foundation analysis of Treasury Department data finds that \nPresident Obama's fiscal year 2014 budget contains an additional $1.1 \ntrillion in proposed tax increases. This is a tax-and-spend \nadministration.\n  The size and complexity of the Tax Code adds to the tax burden on the \neconomy. The code contains 55,600 pages, I am told. Taking into account \nall explanatory materials and IRS rulings, the CCH-Standard Federal Tax \nReporter comprises 70,000 pages. Even the instructions for the easiest \ntax form, the 1040EZ, run 46 pages.\n  The total cost of complying with the individual and corporate tax \nrequirement in this country was $168 billion last year. According to \nthe IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service, there has been approximately 4,680 \nchanges to the Tax Code since 2001.\n  The Tax Code is filled with various credits, deductions, and \ncorporate welfare. Analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation finds \nthat these so-called tax expenditures total $1.3 trillion. We could \ndrastically simplify the Tax Code and lower individuals' rates by \neliminating these provisions alone.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama's approach to taxes is the same as his \napproach to spending: more, more, more--but no structural reforms that \nwould help us establish the conditions for job creation and economic \ngrowth in this country, which we desperately need.\n  Overregulation of the economy further deteriorates the conditions \nnecessary for job creation and economic growth. The aggregate \nregulatory burden on American families and businesses is staggering.\n  A study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that total \ncosts for Americans to comply with Federal regulations reached $1.806 \ntrillion in 2012. This translates to nearly $15,000 annually per family \nor 23 percent of average household income.\n  According to the American Action Forum, the Federal Government so far \nthis year alone has published regulations that will result in $61 \nbillion in compliance costs and 80 million hours of paperwork.\n  Despite the failure of the stimulus package, President Obama put the \nunemployed on hold for more than a year\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\nwhile he forced government-run health care through Congress. He \npromised his plan would reduce health insurance premiums by $2,500. \nInstead, premiums have already increased by that amount, according to \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation employee health benefits survey. A recent \nWall Street Journal analysis finds that premiums could double or even \ntriple for healthy consumers, even under ObamaCare.\n\n  All together, ObamaCare is 2,400 pages long and creates 159 new \nboards, commissions, and government offices. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the 10-year spending estimate for \nObamaCare is $1.88 trillion. Analysis by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation shows that the law creates or raises 21 taxes totaling $1.1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years.\n  The impact of ObamaCare on hiring is not surprising. According to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce Q2 2013 Small Business Survey, 71 percent of \nsmall businesses say the health care law makes it harder to hire \npeople.\n  The same survey finds that one-half of small businesses say they will \neither cut hours, reduce full-time employees, or replace full-time \nemployees with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. In addition, \nGallup finds that 41 percent of small business owners say they have \nheld off on hiring new employees in response to ObamaCare.\n  I welcome recent news that the Obama administration will temporarily \ndelay the employer mandate. But in light of the evidence that ObamaCare \nis increasing health insurance costs and making it harder for the \nunemployed to find jobs, we should delay the whole law permanently for \neveryone. We should repeal it.\n  Congress should start over and craft legislation that will actually \nlower health care costs and preserve high-quality care without crushing \nbusinesses with unnecessary regulations.\n  President Obama's expansion of government did not end with ObamaCare. \nIn 2010, he forced through Congress his purported response to the \nfinancial meltdown, the Dodd-Frank legislation.\n  We were told that the financial regulatory system needed to be \nstreamlined to prevent future bailouts, and that is true. Instead, \nDodd-Frank created more government agencies than it eliminated. \nMoreover, the law totals 2,300 pages and calls for 400 new rules.\n  A study by scholars at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University \nestimates that Dodd-Frank had already generated 2,109 restrictions in \nthe Code of Federal Regulations by the end of 2011, and there is more \nto come.\n  At this rate, they project a 26-percent increase in restrictions in \nrelevant sections of the code once all Dodd-Frank rulemakings are \nfinalized in the future. Dodd-Frank will create jobs only for \nregulatory compliance officers, not for people working every day in the \nUnited States.\n  Earlier this year I introduced legislation that would require \nregulators to perform a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of new Dodd-\nFrank regulations. Under the legislation, a regulation dies if its \ncosts exceed its benefits to the economy.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic majority in the Senate has not brought \nup this legislation for consideration. Some observers have subscribed \nto the cynical view that the legislation is nothing more than an effort \nto undercut financial reform.\n  I am the only current Member of the Senate who voted against both \nfinancial deregulation in 1999 and the Wall Street bailout in 2008. I \nsubscribe to the view that regulations should protect taxpayers without \nharming job creators.\n  President Obama's regulatory zeal finds an outlet now in a war on \ncoal in this country. Aware that it does not have the votes to jam his \ncarbon tax agenda through Congress, he now will direct the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to implement it by way of \nregulation. We all know his environmentalist crusade will kill jobs.\n\n  An analysis by the Heritage Foundation estimates that drastically \nreducing the percentage of coal in our Nation's energy portfolio would, \nby 2030, kill more than 500,000 jobs and increase electricity prices by \n20 percent.\n  In contrast, a Wood Mackenzie study estimates 1.4 million American \njobs could be created if the government adopted policies encouraging \nU.S. energy exploration and production.\n  I believe the Obama environmental agenda will do more to put family \nbudgets in the red than it will to make the world green.\n  Instead of waging a war on coal jobs, I believe President Obama \nshould approve and expedite the Keystone Pipeline. This would create \ntens of thousands of jobs and decrease energy bills for families and \nbusinesses. This is the type of clear-headed energy policy we should be \npursuing in this country.\n  In light of the existing and increasing regulatory burden, it is not \nsurprising the Federal Reserve estimates that manufacturers, domestic \nproducers, and other nonfinancial American companies are sitting on a \nrecord $1.78 trillion stockpile of cash. Why? If we are to create the \nconditions for real job creation in this country, we must start by \nstreamlining the regulatory burden on the economy. The rules, \nrestrictions, and mandates facing those who wish to undertake an \nentrepreneurial endeavor or expand their business through investment \nand innovation is mind-numbing.\n\n\n                            Monetary Policy\n\n  I would also like to talk a few minutes on monetary policy--very dry, \ncomplicated, but very important to all of us.\n  On July 17, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told members of the \nHouse Financial Services Committee ``if we were to tighten policy, the \neconomy would tank.''\n  What does he mean? He was referring to the Federal Reserve's \naggressive use of nontraditional monetary policy to prop up markets \nsince the financial meltdown of 2008. The implied message is striking: \nThe Fed is taking big risks through monetary policy because \nadministration policy is not helping the economy.\n  The Federal Reserve's balance sheet quantifies just how big a risk \nChairman Bernanke feels he must take with so-called monetary stimulus. \nIt currently stands--the Fed balance sheet--at $3.5 trillion, and \ncontinues to grow at $85 billion a month under the Fed's so-called \nquantitative easing program. Among the assets included in the Fed's \nbalance sheet are $2 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities and $1.2 \ntrillion in Federal agency mortgage-backed securities.\n  To put the acceleration of the Fed's balance sheet into perspective, \nit took 95 years from the Fed's creation 100 years ago--1913--to reach \n$1 trillion. The Fed then added the second trillion in just 6 weeks, \nfollowed by the third trillion this past January. Under the current \nquantitative easing program, the Fed's balance sheet will reach $4 \ntrillion in less than 6 months. Where does it end--$5 trillion, $6 \ntrillion, $10 trillion?\n  As with fiscal policy, we are in uncharted monetary policy waters. \nThe Fed's unprecedented measures carry substantial risk and uncertainty \nto every man, woman, and child in this country. Should inflation \nincrease, and it will, the Fed would have to tighten monetary policy to \ncontain it. However, should the Fed tighten monetary policy, it risks \nstalling an already weak economy here. As deep as our fundamental \neconomic challenges already are, the thought that one wrong monetary \npolicy move by the Fed could cripple our entire economy is deeply \ntroubling.\n  In conclusion, I think we face a serious confluence of economic \nchallenges in this country. It is obvious to me that President Obama's \npolicies have not worked and they will not create work or jobs. Real \njob creation is a result of entrepreneurship and innovation and risk in \nthe free market. I believe the government's role is to establish \nconditions for that to occur. We can do this by stabilizing our \nNation's finances, simplifying our Tax Code, and streamlining our \nregulatory framework.\n  The more President Obama and this administration cling to the tired \nliberal ideology that more government is always the answer, the longer \nthis job crisis will persist. America deserves better.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow we celebrate the 23rd anniversary \nof the signing of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the ADA. This \nlandmark civil rights legislation will always be the highlight of my \nalmost 40 years here in the Congress.\n  The Americans With Disabilities Act is one of the landmark civil \nrights laws of the 20th century; as someone once said, a long overdue \nemancipation proclamation for people with disabilities. The ADA has \nplayed a huge role in making our country more accessible, in raising \nexpectations of people with disabilities about what they can achieve at \nwork and in life, and inspiring the world to view disability issues \nthrough the lenses of equality and opportunity.\n  In these times, it is valuable to remember passage of the original \nAmericans With Disabilities Act was a robustly bipartisan effort. As \nthe chief sponsor of the ADA here in the Senate, and as the chair of \nthe Disability Policy Subcommittee at that time, I worked very closely \nwith both Republicans and Democrats. At that time Senator Robert Dole \nwas the minority leader of the Senate, and we received invaluable \nsupport from President George Herbert Walker Bush. Key members of his \nadministration, such as White House Counsel Boyden Gray, worked so hard \non this, as did Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who was magnificent \nin his support for the Americans With Disabilities Act. Transportation \nSecretary Sam Skinner and other Members of Congress also played \ncritical roles in passing the ADA.\n  First and foremost among those, I would have to say, was Senator Ted \nKennedy, who was chair of the full committee at the time and who \nallowed me to take the bill through as the chair of the Disability \nPolicy Subcommittee. Senator Orrin Hatch played a key role at times, \nmaking sure we got the conservatives on the same page. Representatives \nTony Coelho, Steny Hoyer, Major Owens, Steve Bartlett, and I might also \nmention someone who is not mentioned a lot, because he was not here in \nthe Senate at the time we passed it, but who put in a lot of his life's \nwork and who was chairman of that subcommittee before I took it over, \nSenator Lowell Weicker from Connecticut. As a matter of fact, he was \nthe first sponsor of a comprehensive disability policy bill here in the \nSenate. So he became a great supporter, a great personal friend of mine \nthrough all these years, and Lowell Weicker deserves a lot of credit \nfor actually getting us focused on the issue of a comprehensive civil \nrights bill addressing the issue of disability.\n  Before the ADA, life was very different for folks with disabilities \nin Iowa and across the country. Being an American with a disability \nmeant you couldn't ride on a bus because there was no lift, not being \nable to attend a concert or a ballgame or a movie with your family or \nyour friends or loved ones because there was no accessible seating, not \neven being able to cross the street in a wheelchair because there were \nno curb cuts. In short, being disabled in America before the ADA meant \nnot being able to work or participate in community life. Discrimination \nwas both commonplace and accepted.\n  Since then, we have seen amazing progress. The ADA literally \ntransformed the American landscape by requiring architectural and \ncommunications barriers be removed and replaced with accessible \nfeatures such as ramps, lifts, curb cuts, widened doorways, and--for \nanyone who is watching this on C-SPAN and put on the mute button--you \nget closed captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing.\n  More importantly, the ADA gave millions of Americans the opportunity \nto participate in their communities. We have made substantial progress \nin advancing the four goals of the ADA: equality of opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency--the \nfour pillars of the ADA.\n  But I stand here today to remind my colleagues that we have not yet \nkept the promise we made 23 years ago with strong bipartisan support. \nWe still have too many Americans with disabilities living in poverty, \noftentimes in isolation and without control over the supports and \nservices in their lives.\n  For example, last week in my role as the chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, we concluded an \ninvestigation and issued a final report on the state of the \nimplementation of the part of the ADA that provides for people to be \nable to live and receive services in integrated settings, and prohibits \npeople from being unnecessarily separated and isolated from their \nfamily and friends and put in institutions or other segregated \nsettings. What we found is disturbing. Twenty-three years after the \n1999 Olmstead case decision by the Supreme Court, we found that more \nthan 200,000 working-age Americans with disabilities--many in their \nlate teens and early twenties--remain trapped in nursing homes and \ninstitutions, separated from their families and communities against \ntheir wishes--despite the 1999 Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. LC \nthat people with disabilities have the right to be integrated in the \ncommunity.\n  Our committee investigators found that only 12 States devote more \nthan half of their Medicaid long-term care dollars to home and \ncommunity-based services. The number of working-age adults in nursing \nhomes has actually increased by more than 30,000 over the last 5 years. \nIt is shameful.\n  Unfortunately, many States continue to approach community living for \npeople with disabilities as a social welfare issue and not as a civil \nrights issue. This is a failure of vision on the part of many State \nleaders.\n  So how can we correct this injustice? Well, we need to clarify that \nunder the ADA, every individual who is eligible for long-term services \nand supports has a federally protected right to a real choice--their \nchoice--in where they receive these services and supports, whether in \nan institution or in a community.\n  What that also means is, at long last, Congress needs to end the \ninstitutional bias in the Medicaid system. Right now, under Medicaid, \nStates are required to pay for long-term services and supports if you \nare in a nursing home. But if you want to receive those supports and \nservices in an integrated community-based setting, Medicaid has the \noption of covering you. That is the institutional bias that exists in \nMedicaid: They have to pay for you if you are in a nursing home, and \nthey don't have to pay for supports and services if you are in a \ncommunity or integrated setting. As long as it remains that way, the \ndeck will continue to be stacked in favor of costly institutional \nsettings. We know from our investigations that home-based, community-\nbased integrated settings with support services for people with \ndisabilities is more cost effective than putting people in an \ninstitution or a nursing home--not to mention the quality of life, and \nthe fact that so many people with disabilities want to be in an \nintegrated community setting and do not want to be housed in a nursing \nhome.\n  In my remaining 17 months that I have as a Senator here in the \nSenate, I plan to hold hearings and introduce legislation that will \naccelerate the rate at which States move their long-term services and \nsupports in the direction of home and community-based settings.\n  Another area where our work is incomplete is making sure people with \ndisabilities take their rightful place in the American workforce. \nTwenty-three years after the passage of the ADA, it is shameful that \ntwo out of every three adults with a disability are not even in the \nworkforce, not working. That is shameful. We may say, Well, the \nunemployment rate in America is now 8 or 9 percent. Think about if you \nare a disabled adult; it is 60 percent or more who are unemployed.\n  Next week in the HELP Committee, we will mark up the Workforce \nInvestment Act, a critical law that has not been reauthorized since \n1998. The workforce has changed a lot since 1998, and a lot of the ADA \ngeneration have come of age during that period of time. So in the \nbipartisan draft Senators Alexander, Murray, Isakson, and I filed with \nthe committee yesterday, we include provisions that will improve how \nthe vocational rehabilitation system partners with schools to deliver \nservices that will result in more young people doing internships, part-\ntime jobs, in competitive settings. The aim is to maximize the \nlikelihood that young\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\npeople with disabilities will leave school college and career ready--\npeople such as Lily Siegel, who was my intern this summer from the \nAmerican Association of People with Disabilities. They provide summer \ninternships. Lily, and so many like her, have high expectations for \nthemselves. They want to be challenged. They want to work in \ncompetitive, integrated employment. They don't want to be shunted into \nsubminimum wage jobs with no future, no chance for advancement, no \nchance for challenging themselves to do better and to do more and to \ntake more responsibility. We owe it to them to do everything in our \npower to help them transition to the kinds of jobs and higher education \nexperiences that will help them build a career and maximize their \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n\n  I can tell you from my work in this area that this generation of \nyoung people who have come of age under the umbrella of the ADA, who \nwere born in 1990 through 1995, has been integrated into their schools. \nThey weren't segregated as my brother was and sent halfway across the \nState to a State institution. They have higher expectations. They have \nhad accessibility. They see what society has done to make sure that \nthey can travel, they can go out with their friends and their family, \nthey can go to school in integrated settings, they can get jobs and, \nunder the ADA, employers have to provide reasonable accommodations for \nthat job. They don't deserve now to be frustrated by not having the \nopportunity to get that competitive integrated employment.\n  That is what we are doing in the Workforce Investment Act, to provide \nfor young people in high school who have disabilities, to let them know \nthey expect more of themselves, and we do too. No longer will it be \nacceptable for them to leave school and go into some minimum wage \ncovered employment where they are warehoused for the rest of their \nlives. They want to get out there and show what they can do. That is \nwhy we are changing the Workforce Investment Act, changing voc rehab to \nfocus on getting these young people internships, job shadowing, \nmentoring, so they know what their abilities are and what they can \nexpect to do once they leave school.\n  When we passed the ADA, so many people came here from other \ncountries--legislators, parliamentarians--how can we now do this? How \ncan we get our laws changed?\n  About 11 years ago, the United Nations set up a committee to look at \nthis. Out of this came the U.N. Convention on the Rights of People With \nDisabilities, the CRPD. That treaty was sent to our President, and \nunder our system the President sends it out to all his Departments in \nthe executive branch to report back, what things do they need to do to \nchange to conform to the treaty? In other words, if the treaty is the \nsupreme law of the land, what laws do we have to change in order to \ncomply with that treaty?\n  Guess what. After about a whole year of circulating through all of \nour Departments of Justice, Labor, HHS, Agriculture, and everything \nelse, it came back: We don't have to change one law because we are the \nbest in the world when it comes to the civil rights protection of \npeople with disabilities.\n  So last year, under the guidance of then-Senator John Kerry, who is \nnow our Secretary of State, it went to the Foreign Relations Committee. \nThey had hearings. Senator McCain and I were the two leadoff witnesses. \nWe brought that treaty to the floor of the Senate in December, fully \nexpecting it would pass. Under the Constitution of the United States, \nit requires a two-thirds vote to approve the treaty and we thought we \nhad the votes. We brought it on the floor. We fell 6 votes short of the \n67 votes we need. We had a number of Republicans and Democrats on the \nbill.\n  Why did it fail? Right before we brought it up, former Senator Rick \nSantorum and others began to talk about how this was going to prevent \npeople from homeschooling their kids. I thought I knew the treaty. I \nhad read it. I had looked at it. I thought, Did I miss something? Is \nthere something in there I didn't find?\n  I went back to my staff and said, Comb through this. I got ahold of \npeople at the U.N. and said, What is in there that would prevent people \nfrom homeschooling their kids? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. That charge \nwas made out of whole cloth somehow, but at that time in my office \ncalls ran 50-1 against adopting the treaty on that issue. So people \nwere misinformed because of a few people like Mr. Santorum and others \nwho decided to whip this up--for whatever reason, I don't know.\n  There were also a lot of comments made on the Senate floor by my \nRepublican colleagues at that time that we shouldn't be adopting a \ntreaty in a lameduck session, even though we pointed out that many \ntreaties in the past had been adopted in lameduck sessions. I review \nthat history to tell my colleagues that under now the leadership of \nSenator Bob Menendez, who is the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee--and I might add that the person who succeeded Senator Kerry \nin his position in the Senate, the present occupant of the chair, is \nalso on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--there are going to be \nsome more hearings. Under the leadership of Senator Menendez, we intend \nto bring that back to the floor this fall. We need to get the 67 votes.\n\n  People ask: Why is that so important? It is important for the United \nStates to take leadership on this issue around the globe. Over 100 \nnations have already signed the treaty. They are looking to us for \nleadership.\n  I have talked to some of my colleagues and they say: Why do we need \nto join that? We are OK. We are doing just fine. We are doing just fine \nwith disability law in our country. We do not need to join this \nconvention, sign this treaty.\n  It seems to me that is an inherently selfish way of looking at who we \nare and what we are about as a nation. We have provided, I think to the \nworld, guidance and direction on disability issues. If we are a part of \nthe Convention, we get a seat at the table. When countries come and say \nwe want to conform our laws, we want to make sure we meet the \nguidelines of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities, this commission that is set up will be there to both \nguide and direct countries but also to see whether they are fulfilling \ntheir obligations. If we are not a signatory to the treaty, we are not \nat the table.\n  There is another reason we should sign this Convention. I just spoke \nto a group of people yesterday, people with disabilities, and I said: \nThere are a lot of people in this country who use a wheelchair. Guess \nwhat. They would like to travel overseas. They would like to go with \ntheir friends and their family. But in many of these countries they do \nnot have curb cuts. They do not have lifts. They do not have \naccessibility for people with disabilities. Shouldn't people with \ndisabilities in this country have the same right to travel and enjoy \nforeign travel as anybody else? If we are a signatory to the treaty, \nthen we can work with those countries to help change their laws, change \ntheir structures.\n  I cannot tell you how many veterans I have talked to, people who have \ncome back from Iraq and Afghanistan disabled, and do you know what they \nsay. They want us to join the treaty too because they want to travel \noverseas, and they feel constricted because they will not have \naccessibility in other countries.\n  For the life of me I cannot understand why people are not supporting \nthis treaty. I do not get it. I just don't get it. It is supported by \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It is supported by every veterans group \nin this country. It is supported by, I think, every faith-based group \nin this country. It is supported by everyone in the disability \ncommunity. It is supported by every former living President, from the \ntwo Bushes to Clinton, to Carter. It has broad-based support. You would \nthink with that kind of support it would be a no-brainer to pass it in \nthe Senate.\n  We are going to bring it up again this fall. I am hopeful we can do \nit. No one worked harder on a lot of these issues than Senator Bob \nDole. We just had his 90th birthday party Tuesday in Statuary Hall. It \nwas quite an event. So we fell just six votes short. I look forward to \nworking with Senators Menendez, McCain, Ayotte, Barrasso, Durbin, \nUdall, and Coons to bring the treaty back to the floor and get the \nadditional votes needed for it to pass.\n  I tell you, people with disabilities, their family members, \nsupporters, the\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\nbusiness community, the veterans community, faith-based and civil \nrights groups are mobilizing for this. They do not want to take another \nchance that this will not pass.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the time to look at the facts related to \nthe disability treaty. It requires no changes in U.S. law. It has no \nbudget impact. As I said, when we become a party to the Convention, we \nhave a seat at the table with the rest of the world. We will be well \npositioned to accelerate progress for the 1 billion people with \ndisabilities around the world. It is our chance to be that shining city \non the hill for the rest of the world.\n  I might also add this is supported by the high-tech business \ncommunity in America because their global leadership position on \naccessible products and services can be used by the rest of the world.\n  For all those reasons, we need to pass it. Let me just close with \nthis one last thought. Again, I am struck by the fact that these days \nwe are surrounded, as I said earlier, with a new generation of young \nadults with disabilities who grew up since passage of the ADA, \nincluding a number of wounded warriors back from Iraq and Afghanistan. \nI call these younger people the ADA generation. They see disability as \na natural part of human diversity. They reject the prejudices and \nstereotypes of earlier generations. I can tell you this, they have high \nexpectations for themselves. They want to be challenged and they want \nto challenge us to make sure our society is open and they have the \nopportunity to go as far as their talents can take them.\n  We cannot let these people down. If we passed the ADA, now we have to \ntake steps to make sure it is not just a promise, but it is a promise \nwe are keeping and that we will keep.\n  We in the Senate have a responsibility to keep fighting to ensure \nthat they have an equal opportunity to be independent, fully \nintegrated, fully self-sufficient. That, at the heart, is what the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act is all about. Twenty-three years later, \nwe can look at it and say, without doubt, it truly is America at its \nvery best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last few years, I have come to the \nfloor many times to advocate for comprehensive tax reform. I share the \nbelief of many in Congress that tax reform is a necessary step to \nensuring economic growth and prosperity in the future. This is why, as \nthe ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have made tax \nreform my top priority.\n  We are now at a crossroads when it comes to tax reform. Before us \nthere are two alternative paths. The first path is the one we took back \nin 1986. It is the path that former House Democratic Leader Dick \nGephardt and former Treasury Secretary James Baker advised members of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to \ntake.\n  As you will recall, they were two critical players in the last \nsuccessful tax reform effort. In 2011, at one of our hearings, they \nadvised us to not mix deficit reduction and tax reform. This was a \njoint Senate Finance and Ways and Means Committee hearing. To \nparaphrase these two former leaders: Each is a hard enough task by \nitself, but doing them together is nearly impossible. That is one path \nwe can take. The path that separates our tax reform efforts from our \ndeficit reduction efforts.\n  In 2011, they both advised us not to mix deficit reduction and tax \nreform. They just basically said that each is a hard enough task by \nitself, but doing them together is nearly impossible. That is one path \nwe can take, the path that separates our tax reform efforts from our \ndeficit reduction efforts.\n  The other path we can take is to condition tax reform on the raising \nof additional revenues. Sadly, that seems to be the preferred path of \nmany of my friends on the other side of the aisle. I will never fully \nunderstand why, except their propensity to spend. According to many \nDemocrats in the Senate, there can be no deal on tax reform unless they \nget a second significant tax increase this year. We heard just today \nfrom the Senate Democratic leadership that they want the Senate Finance \nCommittee to use the Senate budget, which included nearly $1 trillion \nin tax hikes, as the model for tax reform. Essentially, what they are \nsaying is that unless they get a big tax hike, we have to keep the tax \nsystem as it is, with all of its complexity, inequities, and \ndistortions. Right now this position is held by many on the other side \nof the aisle, and it is the biggest barrier to fundamental tax reform.\n  Today, I would like to take a few minutes to examine this position \nand to discuss the merits of conditioning tax reform on yet another \nsignificant tax increase. Last October, one of my friends on the other \nside put it this way:\n\n       Tax reform 25 years ago was revenue neutral. It did not \n     strive to cut the debt. Today we cannot afford for it not to. \n     Our national debt today is approximately 73 percent of GDP. \n     That is nearly double what it was in 1986.\n\n  At first glance, this argument may appear to be reasonable. However, \nit falls apart under further examination. If my friends on the other \nside of the aisle were serious about deficit reduction, they would not \nfocus their efforts on tax hikes. If they wanted to get a handle on our \nNation's debt problems, they would work with Republicans to address the \nmain drivers of our debt and deficits, our unsustainable entitlement \nprograms.\n  No one who has spent more than 5 minutes examining our Nation's \nfinances seriously disputes that the main drivers of our current debt \nand deficits, and the source of the coming fiscal calamity, are Federal \nentitlement programs, especially our health care entitlements, Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  I have a chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center that tracks the \ntrend lines on Federal spending. As the chart shows, in the coming \nyears, health care entitlement spending will overwhelm our Federal \nfiscal picture and consume an outsized share of our economy. That is \nrepresented by the top blue line on the chart.\n  All other categories of major Federal spending either increase at \nsignificantly lesser rates or decline and stabilize. As we can see, \nSocial Security kind of levels off, discretionary spending--both \ndefense and nondefense--we have seen that go down. This is other \nmandatory programs. As we can see, when it comes to deficit reduction, \ngetting our debt under control, entitlement reform, that upper line, \nthat is going off the charts. That is where the bodies are buried. Yet \nif you listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle, the problem \nis not our entitlement programs. The problem, they say, is that the \nAmerican people simply are not being taxed enough.\n  Of course, the actual numbers tell a different story. Over the last \n40 years, Federal revenues as a percentage of the gross domestic \nproduct have averaged roughly 17.9 percent. While in recent years that \nnumber has decreased due to the struggling economy, tax revenues are at \na pace to rise over the historic average and settle around 19 percent \nof GDP.\n  Let me repeat that. Absent any changes in tax law, revenues are set \nto rise above historic levels relative to GDP, the gross domestic \nproduct. So despite my friends' claims to the contrary, the root of our \ncurrent fiscal crisis is not the lack of revenues, it is unsustainable \nspending. More specifically, it is entitlement spending. That is just \nhealth care. That doesn't include some of the others. That is why all \nserious bipartisan deficit reduction discussions over the last few \nyears have included structural reforms to our entitlement programs.\n  Without significant changes, programs such as Medicaid and Medicare \nand Social Security will remain unsustainable. In order to strengthen \nand preserve these programs for future generations, we need to reform \nthem. If we do not reform them, we face a fiscal disaster, and it would \nbe a terrible disaster for all of our young people living today who are \ngoing to have to foot this bill.\n  All of the major discussions seeking to reach a so-called ``grand \nbargain'' on deficit reduction have come down to a mix of different \npolicies, but while they have all had different approaches, all of them \nhave included structural entitlement reforms.\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\n  When I talk about deficit reduction discussions, I am referring to \nthe Bowles-Simpson plan, the Domenici-Rivlin plan, the negotiations led \nby Vice President Biden, the G8 Senate talks, the negotiations between \nSpeaker Boehner and President Obama, and the so-called supercommittee. \nEach of those grand bargain discussions divided deficit reduction \npolicy issues into four categories. These categories are: No. 1, \ndiscretionary spending; No. 2, nonhealth mandatory spending; No. 3, \nhealth care entitlement programs; and, No. 4, revenue. Those have been \nthe agreed-upon areas of focus in our deficit reduction efforts. Yet, \nif you listen to what my friends on the other side of the aisle have \nbeen saying recently, you will see that their focus is entirely one-\ndimensional. We don't hear much talk anymore about addressing \ndiscretionary spending. We certainly don't hear much in terms of \nreining in entitlement spending. No, their only focus is on raising \ntaxes.\n\n  More precisely, their most recent argument has been that we have cut \nso much spending over the last few years that we are now at a point \nwhere tax hikes are the only viable deficit reduction option. Now, of \ncourse, with the exception of the sequester cuts that took effect this \nyear, we have not really seen any real spending reductions as of yet, \njust promises, which future Congresses could easily undo.\n  Even though only a small portion of the promised spending cuts has \nactually taken place, my friends on the other side of the aisle like to \nclaim they have all already happened. Still, let's take a look at the \nrecord. Let's assume for a few minutes that all of the recently enacted \ndeficit reduction is real and take a closer look at what has been done \nwith respect to deficit reduction categories I referred to earlier.\n  In the last 2 years two bills have been enacted with the purpose of \nmajor deficit reduction. The first was the Budget Control Act of 2011. \nThe second was the fiscal cliff deal or the American Tax Relief Act of \n2012.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office data and consultation \nwith the Senate Budget Committee, here is what has been done so far: \nThe category that has been tapped the most is discretionary spending, \nto the tune of $1.36 trillion of promised spending reductions over 10 \nyears. Remember, that is over 10 years. Once again, these are almost \nentirely promised spending cuts that have yet to be realized. If \nhistory has told us anything, it is that future promises to reduce \nspending aren't likely to be kept. They are very unlikely to be kept.\n  If you don't believe me, look at the efforts by my friends on the \nother side of the aisle to undo even the small amount of spending cuts \nthat are actually in place this year. Indeed, Democrats in Congress \nhave been actively looking for ways to eliminate the cuts for \ndiscretionary spending. If history is any indication, they may very \nwell be successful in spite of the promises they made.\n  Those who argue against these cuts do not want to merely provide \nflexibility over how the cuts will occur. They don't want any cuts to \noccur even though they are spending cuts relative to a bloated baseline \nthat was supposed to be only temporarily elevated. Still, if we assume \nthat against all odds these spending cuts remain in place, we will have \nreduced discretionary spending by $1.36 trillion relative to a baseline \nof bloated spending.\n  The next highest deficit reduction category is revenues. Revenues \nhave been increased by roughly $600 billion over 10 years--part of the \nfiscal cliff deal. This includes only the revenues generated by the \nfiscal cliff deal. It does not include the $1 trillion of new taxes \nenacted as part of ObamaCare.\n  Unlike the promised discretionary spending cuts I cited earlier, this \nrevenue number is very real and not just promises. While it may be a \n10-year number that can theoretically be changed, history tells us that \nonce tax hikes are in place, they always tend to stay there.\n  So of the four deficit reduction categories, we have already taken \nsignificant steps with regard to promised discretionary spending \nreductions and actual revenue hikes. Where are we with the other \ncategories?\n  As I said, health care entitlement spending is the driver of future \ndeficit and debt. No one who looks at this seriously disputes this. The \ntrust funds in Social Security, which are to finance retirement and \ndisability payments, are on clear paths to exhaustion, with the \ndisability insurance trust fund scheduled to dry up in 2016. Yet, to \ndate, very little of our deficit reduction attention has been focused \non entitlement spending. So far we have done absolutely nothing to deal \nwith unsustainable Social Security promises, and we have done nothing \nto address the insolvency of the retirement and disability trust funds. \nSo far we have reduced health care entitlements by a mere $81 billion \nover the next 10 years. That amounts to roughly 4 percent of overall \npromised deficit reduction we have enacted. That amount is minuscule \nrelative to the amount of scheduled spending entitlements over the next \n10 years.\n  Take a look at this chart. We can barely see the red line on the \nright side of the chart. That red line stands for $81 billion in \nentitlement cuts. If we look at the 10-year spending--as the chart \nbehind me shows--over the next decade, we will spend roughly $22 \ntrillion on the three major entitlement programs. That is trillion with \na ``t.''\n  Despite cutting spending and reducing deficits over the last couple \nof years, we have only been able to reduce entitlement spending by a \nmere $81 billion. Look at that little red line compared to the 10-year \nspending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, which is \nunsustainable, and yet nothing is being done by the majority.\n  By the way, all of those spending reductions have come in the form of \ncuts to health care providers. They are cutting out doctors, hospitals, \nand health care providers, as if that is going to keep them on the job. \nThere is a high percentage of doctors who are now ready to retire or \nquit and find other ways of living. All of those spending reductions \nhave come in the form of cuts to health care providers, not structural \nentitlement reforms, and they know that is not sustainable. Just that \nlittle bit is not sustainable.\n  Once again, this approach is at odds with the grand-bargain efforts \nwe have seen over the last few years. All of those efforts--every \nsingle one of them--put structural entitlement reform on the table. \nYet, to date, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been \nunwilling to do the same.\n  As I said, my friends like to brag about all of the promised deficit \nreduction they have enacted thus far--even the deficit reduction they \nare actively trying to repeal--but they refuse to even entertain a \nserious conversation about the main sources of our future debt and \ndeficit.\n\n  So where are we? The Senate Finance Committee is engaged in a \nbipartisan effort to reform our Nation's Tax Code and bring some sense \nof sanity to our Nation's tax system. Chairman Baucus and I have asked \nour colleagues to assist us in this effort by sharing their views on \nwhat elements of the current Tax Code should be preserved. I would like \nto thank my Republican colleagues on the Finance Committee for their \ninput thus far. I have met with every one of them individually on this \nissue except for one, and he is meeting with my staff. I really \nappreciated their thoughtful comments and advice.\n  While I remain hopeful that we will be able to move on tax reform \nthis year, I am disheartened by comments I heard from my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. Indeed, many of my Democratic colleagues have \nstated that they are unwilling to engage in tax reform without \nassurances that it will have to include another massive tax increase.\n  Once again, their message to the American people is that we have to \nkeep the current system--which virtually everyone in the country agrees \nis a problem--unless the Republicans agree to higher taxes. They want \nto hold simplicity in the Tax Code hostage to demands for even more \ntaxes. They want to hold efficiency in the economy--which stimulates \ngrowth and creates jobs--hostage to demands for the second tax hike of \nthe year in order to pay for more of their spending and more of their \nexpansion of government even further. They want to hold competitiveness \nof our businesses at home and around the globe hostage to demands that \nflowthrough businesses face yet another tax hike--even after having \nbeen hit already at the start of this year.\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\n  My colleagues insist that their demands for higher taxes are all \nabout deficit reduction. But let's face it. If deficit reduction was \nthe real goal, entitlement reform would also be on the table. It would \nhave to be on the table. After all, that is where the money is. That is \nwhere we have a chance to really reduce the deficit. That is where the \nfuture of our young people is going to be killed if we don't attack \nthat problem now and do it in an intelligent way.\n  According to my friends on the other side of the aisle, entitlement \nreform is not on the table. Despite the stated desire of President \nObama and a number of congressional Democrats for a grand bargain on \ndeficit reduction, when the rubber meets the road they simply are not \nwilling to engage in a real discussion about entitlement reform. Sure, \nthey will talk about cuts to providers and other cosmetic changes to \nthese programs, and they will talk about modifying cost-of-living \nadjustments in Social Security if they get hundreds of billions of \ndollars of new tax revenue in return. But at the end of the day \nstructural entitlement reforms simply are not part of their deficit \nreduction equation.\n  Despite many claims to the contrary, Republicans are willing to \nengage, as they have in the past, in a bipartisan grand bargain for \ndeficit reduction. Ask Senators Crapo, Coburn, and former Senator \nGregg. They voted for Bowles-Simpson. Oddly enough, the remaining \nsitting Democratic Senator who voted for Bowles-Simpson has walked away \nfrom the entitlement reform concessions he made and instead has focused \non calls for more revenues and as a result tax reform is being held \nhostage.\n  Republicans and Democrats agree on the importance of tax reform. Our \ntax system is in dire need of reform. It is, quite frankly, one of the \nmajor obstacles standing between us and sustained economic growth. Most \nDemocrats claim they agree with this sentiment, but their desire for \nmore revenues apparently trumps this belief in the need for tax reform.\n  Something has to change. As I have said before, we have been \ncounseled by some of our former leaders not to mix tax reform and \ndeficit reduction. I think that is pretty good advice, and these are \ntwo of the leaders who helped to put through the 1986 bill. They are \nboth highly regarded by people on both sides of the aisle here in the \nSenate.\n  Sadly, if Democrats in the Congress continue on their current course, \nneither tax reform nor deficit reduction will be possible. Indeed, if \nthey continue to condition tax reform on additional tax hikes and if \nthey continue to refuse to engage in a real discussion about \nentitlement reform, very little is going to be accomplished on either \nfront.\n  This spending game has got to be over. We have to start living within \nour means. We on this side of the aisle--and I in particular--have seen \nevery tax increase amount to more spending, not deficit reduction, so \nit is a phony argument. And that is what is going to happen if we are \nso dumb as to increase taxes in accordance with the comments of our \nleadership on the other side of the aisle that were made just today. It \nis unbelievable that they get away with it. It is unbelievable that \nafter all of these years we have to put up with that type of argument \nwhen we know they are not going to use that money for the appropriate \nreasons, and they never have.\n  One Senator said to me the other day: I just live for the day where \nwe reform the Tax Code and it is not changed 4 years later by our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle for the worse. The 1986 bill was \na good bill by any standard. It did a lot of good, but in about 4 years \nour friends started to change it. As a result, today we have the \nmonstrosity we call the U.S. Tax Code that nobody really believes in \nand everybody knows is a detriment to our country.\n  I am very concerned. I think we are going to have to have some folks \nstand up on the other side of the aisle. We are willing to stand with \nthem, and we are willing to solve these problems in ways that will \npreserve the entitlement programs. They are not going to be preserved \nin their current form if we keep going the way we are. And tax \nincreases aren't the answer either. We are spending so much, and it \nwill not be long until we will be in a category with Greece if we don't \nwatch it.\n\n  We have to overcome this because no other entity in the world is \ngoing to bail us out; we have to bail ourselves out. We have to do it \nby doing what is right, now, and not by increasing taxes. It means \nresolving these problems on a structural reform basis. It will take \ngood people on both sides of the aisle to do it. I call on my friends \non the other side to get with it. Get real. Quit the tax charade.\n  We know that is not going anywhere. We also know it is phony to begin \nwith.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, when people across the country flip on \nthe news tonight, they are probably going to see pictures of Detroit. \nThey aren't going to be flattering pictures, and they are not going to \ntell the whole story.\n  There is no question that the Detroit city government is going \nthrough an extremely difficult financial crisis, and there are many \ncauses for that.\n  There are more than 20,000 people--retired police officers and \nfirefighters and teachers and city workers--who have been loyal and \nhard-working employees their entire lives, who are now worried about \nhow they are going to pay the mortgage or put food on their tables.\n  The TV cameras are rolling when it comes time to show us bad news \nabout Detroit, but what aren't we seeing?\n  On TV, they aren't showing us the city that is the No. 1 market in \nthe country for tech jobs--No. 1. They aren't showing a city that is \none of the fastest growing in the country for new manufacturing jobs. \nOn TV, they aren't showing us the city that is undergoing a massive \nrevitalization, with businesses and religious leaders and community \nleaders and neighborhoods working together every day. They aren't \nshowing us the Quicken Loans headquarters with 7,000 jobs in downtown \nDetroit; a CEO so committed to the city that he closed a beautiful \nbuilding in the suburbs to bring people downtown; a CEO who is \npurchasing properties and investing in so many ways in Detroit, along \nwith a wonderful coalition of business leaders committed to the \nrevitalization of this great city. They aren't showing us the beautiful \nrenovation of Campus Martius and the amazing things happening downtown \non Woodward Avenue, where people can go on any day now and see people \nwho are there--younger people, older people--enjoying the beautiful \nsurroundings.\n  They aren't showing us the surge of innovative companies that are \nbreaking new ground in creating opportunity in Detroit.\n  On TV, they aren't showing us the new Elijah McCoy Patent and \nTrademark Office--the very first and, so far, only satellite patent \noffice in the country that was put in Detroit. Why? Because Michigan \nhappens to be No. 1 in new, clean energy patents--new ideas on clean \nenergy, coming from Detroit and the surrounding communities. They are \nnot showing us TechTown and the venture capitalists and the 17 tech \nstartups that are investing in technologies that are being developed in \nDetroit right now and that are going to change our lives in the years \nto come. On TV, they aren't showing us Michigan's world-class research \nuniversities and the incredible collaboration that is going on with \nDetroit businesses.\n  They are not showing us the rich depth of culture we are known for in \nDetroit. The city that gave the world Motown once again has an \nexploding arts and music scene. In fact, last weekend, in beautiful \nTraverse City, MI, I was speaking to someone who lives there who said \nhis sister is coming back from Colorado who is an artist; she is moving \nto Detroit. When he asked her why, she said Detroit is where everybody \nis going because there are so many opportunities there in arts\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\nand culture. There are exciting things happening. We have the beautiful \nDetroit Institute of Arts, one of the largest and most important \ncollections of artwork in the country.\n  Jack White, the founder of the band, the White Stripes, stepped up \nand paid off with his own money the back taxes owed on the Masonic \nTemple in Detroit, one of the most stunning theater and music venues in \nthe world.\n  Story after story such as that can be told of people coming forward \nand saying: We are going to make sure that Detroit is coming back.\n  On TV, they are not showing us Eastern Market, the Nation's longest \ncontinuously operated farmers market, and all the great things that are \nhappening there, with new test kitchens and local agriculture. In fact, \nas chair of the Agriculture Committee, I was so proud to learn that we \nin Detroit have the national leaders in urban agriculture who are now \ncreating jobs working with small business to create food entrepreneurs \nand healthy foods for families and neighborhoods.\n  I am so proud of the work we have been able to do with the Detroit \nPublic Schools. Not long ago I stood at a school garden in a \nneighborhood that was put together by the children of the school. We \nnow have 46--46--gardens at schools in Detroit, and in the summer the \nneighborhood makes sure they can help get the work done for the gardens \nso the children can have fresh fruits and vegetables when they come \nback to school.\n  Last month Whole Foods opened their first grocery store in Detroit, \nwhere they are featuring local foods such as Avalon baked goods and \nMcClure's pickles and Good People Popcorn and Garden Fresh salsa and so \nmany other things that are made right in the metro Detroit area.\n  We might just see a shot of the bridge to Canada on TV, but what we \nwill not see is the more than $1 billion in trade that crosses that \nborder every single day. Metro Detroit, in fact, is the fourth largest \ncity in America for exports, and we have the largest, busiest northern \nborder crossing in the country.\n  While the cameras are obsessed with showing us decay, we are seeing \nan auto industry that is roaring back. We are seeing the Chrysler plant \nthat the New York Times called one of the most modern and successful \nauto plants in the world, in Detroit. That plant employs more than \n4,000 people and added a third shift at the end of last year to build \nthe Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n  Ford Motor Company reported record North American profits in the \nsecond quarter and growth in every sales region.\n  GM's global sales are up, and they too are making record profits \nagain, hiring workers and investing in new plants and technologies.\n  So while it is true that the city government is going through a \nterrible time and a bankruptcy, and that process will be very painful \nand very difficult for many people in the city--many people who work \nvery hard--it would be a mistake to count Detroit out. It would be a \nmistake to think there isn't opportunity in our great city of Detroit. \nIt would be a mistake to think Detroit isn't coming back, because if a \nperson is going to say anything about Detroit, a person has to say: \nTimes may be tough, but so are the people of Detroit. Times may be \ntough, but the leaders, the businesses, the educators are tough. Our \npeople, our businesses, are smart and talented and care deeply and are \ncommitted to making sure this great city called Detroit comes roaring \nback better than ever.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5961-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 10 years ago this week, Congress passed a \nwatershed piece of legislation. The Prison Rape Elimination Act was the \nfirst comprehensive legislative effort to prevent something we had long \nbeen reluctant to even acknowledge existed--the incidence of rape in \nour Federal, State, and local corrections facilities.\n  Violence and victimization have no place in our society, including in \nour prisons, and we have an obligation to ensure these facilities are \nsafe. The punishment of incarceration does not, and cannot, include a \nsentence of rape. And yet we know that all too often it does. A recent \nreport by the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that nearly 1 in \n10 inmates in America had been sexually assaulted in custody.\n  Too often the victims of such violence end up being the most \nvulnerable members of our population. Women, racial minorities, and \nthose suffering from mental illness face increased rates of sexual \nviolence while incarcerated.\n  Children in adult jails are at the greatest risk of being victimized. \nJuveniles housed with adults are 35% more likely than other inmates to \nbe targeted for sexual assault, and that abuse is taking a terrible \ntoll on this already vulnerable population. Youth under the age of 18 \nare 36 times more likely to commit suicide than if they were housed in \na juvenile detention facility. With 100,000 youth held in adult jails \nand prisons every year, this is a problem we must address head on.\n  The Prison Rape Elimination Act gives us the tools to do that. \nBecause of this law the Department of Justice now collects data about \nthe incidence of sexual violence in our prisons so we can better \nunderstand the scope of the problem. We have adopted national standards \nand best practices to create safer environments, especially when it \ncomes to juvenile detention and the dangers inherent in incarcerating \nour youth with adult prisoners. The law provides for increased training \nfor prison staff, makes it easier for inmates to report violence, and \nrequires prompt medical and mental health treatment for victims.\n  These protections make sense, and that is why we made sure that the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act that was signed into law \nearlier this year made clear that these protections also apply to every \nimmigration detention facility operated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We are making good progress, but more work lies ahead.\n  Sexual violence in our detention facilities compromises the health \nand safety of the inmates, staff, and the communities to which these \nprisoners will someday return. Although improvements have been made in \nthe past 10 years, let us pause on this anniversary to reflect on the \nimportance of ensuring that every American is safe from violence, and \ntreated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5961-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5961-S5962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING VIVIAN MALONE JONES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night, the National Museum of Women in \nthe Arts hosted a screening of the documentary entitled, Crisis: Behind \na Presidential Commitment. As we prepare to observe the 50th \nAnniversary of the March on Washington, this important film focuses on \nfour individuals who will forever be connected with the battle for \nracial equality and the pursuit of Dr. Martin Luther King's dream. I \nwant to recognize one of those individuals, Vivian Malone Jones.\n  Ms. Malone was one of two brave African-American students to enroll \nat the University of Alabama in 1963, despite the threat of Alabama \nGovernor George C. Wallace to stop integration at ``the schoolhouse \ndoor.'' The picture of Ms. Malone walking into the University of \nAlabama, flanked by National Guard troops, is an iconic image that is \nforever etched in our Nation's memory.\n  Ms. Malone grew up in the racially segregated city of Mobile, AL. She \nwas just 12 years old when the Supreme Court ruled segregation \nunconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education. The historic decision \ninspired Ms. Malone, who as a National Honor Society student in high \nschool committed herself to efforts ending segregation. She went on to \nbecome one of the most important civil rights figures in our country's \nhistory.\n  In her lifetime, Ms. Malone personified dignity and strength. She \nalso lived history. The day after she and classmate James Hood were \nescorted into the University's Foster Auditorium by the National Guard \nand Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, seeking to enroll in \nclasses, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was shot and killed in \nMississippi. This only made Ms. Malone more determined. She once said \nthat she ``decided not to show any fear and went to class that day.'' \nWhile an undergraduate student, she found a community of support and\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nfriendship among fellow members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority--the \nNation's largest predominately African-American women's organization. \nAnd in 1965, she became the first African American to graduate from the \nUniversity of Alabama, earning a degree in Business Management.\n  Ms. Malone was not just a symbol of courage; she also set an example \nof forgiveness. In 1996 Governor Wallace, who 3 decades earlier stood \nin the entryway to the university's auditorium, flanked by State \ntroopers, to prevent Ms. Malone from enrolling, awarded her with the \nfirst Lurleen B. Wallace Award for Courage. Later recalling their \nconversation, Ms. Malone said that she simply spoke with Governor \nWallace about forgiveness.\n  Throughout her life, Ms. Malone was dedicated to the preservation and \nenforcement of our civil rights laws. After graduation, she worked for \nthe U.S. Department of Justice in the Civil Rights Division. In 1977, \nshe took over as Executive Director for the Voter Education Project \nfollowing the resignation of another civil rights legend, Congressman \nJohn Lewis. Eventually, Ms. Malone rose to become a Director of Civil \nRights and Urban Affairs for the Environmental Protection Agency in \nAtlanta, GA, before retiring there in 1996.\n  In 2000, she gave the commencement address at the University of \nAlabama and advised the new graduates: ``If there is any lesson for the \ngraduates to take from my experience, it is that you must always be \nready to seize the moment.'' Ms. Malone passed away on October 15, \n2005, but her legacy continues. It lives on through her children, \ngrandchildren, and siblings. It also lives on through the important \nwork of her brother-in-law, Attorney General Eric Holder. He has done \nso much in the past 5 years to return the Civil Rights Division to its \ncore mission. I have no doubt that his sense of purpose is informed by \nthe proud history of the Malone family including his sister-in-law, \nVivian, and his wife, Dr. Sharon Malone.\n  As we honor our Nation's civil rights heroes in preparation for next \nmonth's momentous anniversary of Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech \nand the historic March on Washington, let us honor another courageous \nicon who told those University of Alabama graduates in 2000, ``You may \nnot live in a time of great social change as I did, but you will just \nas certainly face moral choices.'' I hope Ms. Malone's courage, \ndetermination, and forgiveness will serve as a guiding light for \ngenerations to come, and to make the right moral choices in our own \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5962-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CRIME GUN TRACING ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a new bill I have \nintroduced called the Crime Gun Tracing Act. This bill will create a \nstrong incentive for police departments and sheriff's offices across \nthe nation to trace every crime gun they recover. I am pleased that my \ncolleagues Senators Feinstein, Whitehouse, Blumenthal, Levin, Boxer, \nJack Reed and Murphy have joined me as cosponsors of this legislation. \nI thank them for their support.\n  The issue of gun regulation is complicated, and people may not always \nagree on all aspects of it. But one thing we can all agree on is the \nneed to reduce criminal gun violence. Far too many violent shootings \nare taking place across America. We need to catch the criminals who \ncommit violent gun crimes, and we need to identify and stop the people \nwho are putting guns in criminals' hands.\n  Crime gun tracing is a powerful tool that helps law enforcement solve \ngun crimes and identify gun traffickers. Law enforcement agencies \nshould be tracing 100 percent of guns they recover in criminal \ninvestigations, and the legislation I am introducing will help get us \ncloser to that goal.\n  Here is how crime gun tracing works. When a gun is recovered in a \ncriminal investigation, a police department or sheriff's office can \nsend the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives--ATF--\ninformation about the gun's make, model and serial number. ATF can then \ntrace the gun from its manufacturer to its first retail purchaser. This \ninformation can help generate leads in identifying the person who used \nthe gun to commit a crime. Also, when all crime guns in an area are \ntraced, it can help law enforcement identify broader crime gun trends \nand trafficking patterns.\n  ATF has described crime gun tracing as a ``cornerstone'' of its \nefforts to combat gun crime and illegal gun trafficking. And ATF has \nmade it free and easy for local police departments and sheriff's \noffices to trace guns. ATF has created an online tracing program, \ncalled E-Trace, that it makes available for free to any law enforcement \nagency that signs up for it. E-Trace allows gun trace requests to be \nsent to ATF quickly over the internet. And it provides a searchable \ncomputer database that police departments and sheriffs can use to \nanalyze all gun traces and gun crimes in their jurisdiction.\n  Let us be clear: This is only a database for crime guns. This is not \na registry of law-abiding gun owners. ATF only traces guns that are \npart of criminal investigations by law enforcement.\n  E-Trace is a great law enforcement tool. I have been working for \nyears to get every police department and sheriff's office in Illinois \nto sign up for E-Trace and to use it for every crime gun they recover.\n  We are about halfway there in Illinois--around 400 out of 800 law \nenforcement agencies in my state are using E-Trace, and I am reaching \nout to the rest to urge them to sign up. But we can do better, both in \nIllinois and nationally.\n  I am introducing my bill, the Crime Gun Tracing Act, to help move us \ntoward 100 percent tracing of crime guns nationwide. There are about \n18,000 law enforcement agencies in America, and right now about 4,700 \nhave signed up to use E-Trace. All of these agencies should sign up to \nuse E-Trace and should use it every time they recover a crime gun.\n  My bill will require law enforcement agencies that apply for Federal \nCOPS grants to report how many crime guns they recovered in the last \nyear and how many they submitted for tracing. The bill will then give a \npreference in COPS grant awards to agencies that traced all the crime \nguns they recovered.\n  To be clear, police chiefs and sheriffs should not just wait for this \nlegislation to pass before they start tracing. They should start \ntracing today, and I hope many will. But for those local agencies that \nneed a push to start tracing their crime guns, my bill will give them a \nsignificant incentive.\n  Gun violence is a complicated problem, and there is no one solution \nthat will stop all the tragic shootings in our nation. But \ncomprehensive crime gun tracing will make a big difference when it \ncomes to solving gun crimes and identifying gun traffickers. Crime gun \ntracing is free, it is easy, and law enforcement leaders will tell you \nthat it is a powerful tool that helps them fight crime.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. And I \nalso urge my colleagues to call on law enforcement in their States to \nstart tracing all their crime guns, as I have done in Illinois. Many \npolice departments and sheriff's offices simply do not know about this \nfree law enforcement resource called E-Trace, and once they learn how \neasy it is to sign up and use E-Trace, they are thrilled with it.\n  We can make important progress on the issue of crime gun tracing \nright now if we alert all our State and local agencies about this \npowerful investigative tool. Every additional crime gun that gets \ntraced makes it harder for illegal gun traffickers to hide. If we can \nidentify and root out these trafficking networks, it will help reduce \ngun violence in our communities. That is a goal we should pursue, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5962-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5962-S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SMARTER SOLUTIONS FOR STUDENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the choice before the Senate yesterday was \nvery difficult. If we had failed to pass the student loan bill, \nstudents and their families would be stuck with interest rates for \nstudent loans that are double what they were just last year. American \nstudents and parents who worry every single day about whether they can \nafford college cannot be burdened with such an enormous rate hike.\n  The cost of tuition at public 4-year colleges is up more than 15 \npercent since 2009. Student loan debt has reached historic proportions. \nYet we allowed the rate on new federally subsidized student loans to \ndouble, to 6.8\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\npercent, as of July 1. If we had allowed this rate increase to \ncontinue, we would have subtracted thousands of dollars from the \nwallets of American students and their families or, worse, be \nresponsible for pushing college beyond the financial means of some \nfamilies who already wonder whether they can afford to give their kids \nthe education they need and deserve.\n  The bipartisan legislation we passed yesterday will temporarily \nresolve this crisis for American families, but it is far from perfect. \nIt switches these interest rates for these critical student loans from \nfixed rates to floating rates, with caps that are far too high. This \nopens the door to rising interest rates 4 years from now that students \nand their families simply cannot afford.\n  The student debt problem which for many families is a student debt \ncrisis requires a carefully considered long term solution. I am hopeful \nthat such a solution will eventually emerge, but this legislation is \nnot it.\n  That is why I supported an amendment offered by my colleagues, \nSenators Reed and Warren, and another amendment offered by Senator \nSanders, which would have mitigated some of the long-term damage of \nthis legislation. Even though we did not adopt those amendments, I \nsupported this bill for the simple reason that it removes the burdens \nfacing America's students and their families in the next few years.\n  The chairman of the HELP Committee, my friend Tom Harkin has pledged \nto try to fix the likely spiking interest rates facing students when \nthe higher education reauthorization bill comes up next year. I will \nstrongly support that effort.\n  Yesterday we in the Senate had a choice, but America's college \nstudents do not they have no choice but to pay the ever-rising cost of \na college education, not if they want the skills and knowledge that \nhold the promise of a better life. They have no choice but to live with \nthe decisions we make here in this Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5963-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MICHAEL WINTER\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this week Americans are celebrating the \n23rd anniversary of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. As \nchief Senate sponsor of that legislation, I know that we could not have \nprevailed without the tireless, passionate, never-give-up advocacy of \ndisability rights advocates and leaders across America. One of those \noutstanding leaders, Michael Winter, cannot be with us to celebrate \nthis year's anniversary. He passed away earlier this month. But I would \nlike to take a few minutes today to celebrate the life of this \nwonderful person.\n  Michael was born with a disability, and grew up in Chicago at a far \nless enlightened time, when students and other young people with \ndisabilities were excluded from the mainstream. Michael used a \nwheelchair, but he was not the kind of person to take discrimination \nsitting down. At an early age, he began to speak up. He discovered the \npower of advocacy. He was determined to change the world for people \nwith disabilities.\n  In 1969, Michael was enrolled in Southern Illinois University. \nBecause the school president's wife used a wheelchair, the SIU had made \na commitment 15 years earlier to become one of the first accessible \ncolleges in the United States. But Michael was not satisfied. He \nbelieved that the university needed to be more inclusive for students \nwith disabilities. So Michael and other students with disabilities took \nover the university president's office and chained a wheelchair to his \ndesk. They did so to drive home the point that the campus needed to \nhave accessible transportation for people with disabilities. The \nuniversity, to its great credit, made improvements, and Michael had \nfound a special focus for his advocacy. His passionate and highly \neffective advocacy for accessible transportation became a constant \nthroughout his life.\n  In addition, Michael was one of the early leaders in the Independent \nLiving movement. In 1977, after college and attending graduate school, \nhe went to the fledgling Berkeley Center for Independent Living, where \nhe completed an internship with Judy Heumann. He ended up staying on as \na staff member for another 4 years. He then directed a Center for \nIndependent Living in Hawaii before returning to the Berkeley as \ndirector of the Center for Independent Living for 12 years. During that \nperiod, Michael also served as president of the National Council on \nIndependent Living.\n  As I said, Michael's special passion was to advocate for more \naccessible transportation. Later in his career, he held various \npositions at the U.S. Department of Transportation, and was responsible \nfor helping enforce civil rights with respect to transportation under \nthe ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, the Civil Rights Act, and other laws.\n  He also advocated for more accessible transportation internationally. \nMarca Bristo, CEO of Access Living in Chicago, recently shared a memory \nof Michael Winter, whom she considered a mentor on independent living. \nShe wrote:\n\n       I'll never forget being in Seoul riding the most accessible \n     subway I've ever been on with my son. Later I asked my host \n     from Rehabilitation International, Dr. Il Yung Lee, how did \n     it happen? He said: ``The Convention on the Rights of Persons \n     with Disabilities and Michael Winter.''\n\n  Many Americans got to know Michael in Eric Neudel's award-winning \ndocumentary, ``Lives Worth Living,'' which chronicled the rise of the \ndisability rights movement in the United States. The documentary \nrecounts the historic day in 1990 when hundreds of disability rights \nadvocates crawled and climbed up the steps of the Capitol Building in \nWashington to protest the slow progress in passing the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. One person who was there recalled the scene as \nfollows:\n\n       A young girl with cerebral palsy, fiercely determined to \n     reach the top (``I'll take all NIGHT if I have to!''), \n     inspired the admittedly out-of-shape Michael Winter to follow \n     close behind. When the activists gathered en masse in the \n     Capitol rotunda, Winter was approached by a young, able-\n     bodied woman who was excited by the crowd. Turns out she was \n     a tour guide, expecting to host a group of ``handicapped'' \n     people on a tour through the capitol. ``I have to tell you \n     something,'' Winter wryly informed her. ``I don't think these \n     people are here for a tour.''\n\n  Hundreds of disability rights activists are in Washington this week \nto celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. We also celebrate the contributions of leaders like Michael \nWinter, who are responsible for America's remarkable progress toward \nfulfilling the four great goals of the ADA--equal opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. \nDespite this progress, we know that our journey is far from finished. \nWe have not yet achieved the full promise of the ADA. But we go forward \ninspired by the memory and example of Michael Winter and other \noutstanding leaders in this movement.\n  Thank you, Michael Winter, for a job well done. Thank you for helping \nus to create a better, fairer, more inclusive and accessible world for \npeople with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5963-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5963-S5964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OBSERVING TED STEVENS DAY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this upcoming Saturday marks the third \ntime Alaskans from across my home State will join together to ``get out \nand play'' in memory of the life and legacy of Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Since Ted's passing nearly three years ago, we have followed his \nexample by getting out and embracing Alaska's great outdoors on this \nfourth Saturday of July. On this day, as envisioned by Senator Stevens' \nfamily, we embody his passion for Alaska's unique wilderness, his love \nfor fishing, and his immense affection for nature. We celebrate his \nlife, one dedicated to public service--from his days as a pilot in \nWorld War II to his four decades in the United States Senate fighting \nfor roads, buildings, and other infrastructure needs in a State as \nyoung as ours.\n  This year, Alaskans in communities across the State--from Anchorage, \nFairbanks, Juneau, and the Kenai Peninsula--are coming together for \nBBQ's, Potlucks, and fishing, while countless others take part in their \nown unique and special way.\n  We remember Ted Stevens, among many things, as one of Alaska's great \nleaders, the Alaskan of the 20th Century, and a tireless advocate for \nthe 49th State. He was committed to our people, our economy, and the \nrole we played in the success of America--from\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\nnational security to energy independence to our bountiful fisheries. As \npolitical as things get in our State and in Washington, DC, Uncle Ted \nhad perspective: ``The hell with politics, just do what's right for \nAlaska.''\n  This weekend, however, is about Senator Stevens' deep love for the \noutdoors and adventure. It is as if this summer, one of the most \ngorgeous we have had back home in ages, Uncle Ted is looking down upon \nAlaskans and encouraging us to take up activities that require a little \nsweat, a little more effort than usual, maybe one that leaves us \ncatching our breath afterwards. Whether one decides to walk or run, \nhike or climb, reel in a nice rainbow or salmon, take a spin on a bike \nor just play outside, I encourage Alaskans to spend some time this \nweekend getting out and enjoying our beautiful Alaskan Summer.\n  Mr. President, for Senator Stevens and the entire Stevens family: \nLet's get out and play.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5964-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEVIN COVERT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Kevin Covert, our \nhuman rights officer at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Very shortly, he \nwill move on to another assignment as is the usual practice at the \nDepartment of State. During his recent tour, Mr. Covert brought a \nremarkable level of initiative and leadership to his job. A diplomatic \nfirst responder to raids, attacks, and show trials, his was the face of \nAmerican diplomacy there to listen to the stories of civil society \nleaders who found themselves branded foreign agents for simply working \nto better their own country. His handshake was there to remind those \nRussians who dared meet with him that the United States is committed to \ntelling their story for the record and will not forget them--and Mr. \nCovert did just that as a lead drafter of the Russia section of the \nannual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices as well as through \nobjective and incisive reporting chronicling an assault on rights \nunprecedented in modern Russia. All the while, his composure, and \nlikely a good sense of humor, enabled him to listen patiently to host \ngovernment interlocutors as American concerns were disingenuously \nconstrued as so much meddling while he politely, and with good judgment \nand integrity, reminded his counterparts of their own freely undertaken \ncommitments to the rule of law and democracy.\n  As chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and a senior member of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have the regular opportunity, \nand distinct honor, to interact with the hard-working men and women of \nthe Foreign Service. They do not wear uniforms, but they make numerous \nsacrifices, take significant risks, and serve our country honorably.\n  Our relations with Russia are at the heart of a truly comprehensive \nsecurity and cooperation in Europe and I have paid close attention to \nthis country in recent years. In that context, I am acutely aware of \nthe challenges that our diplomats, serving in Russia under the \nleadership of Ambassador Mike McFaul, face. Over the past year, as a \ncrackdown on fundamental freedoms gained scope and speed, professionals \nat our embassy in Russia never wavered in their support for the \nuniversal values that we as Americans hold especially dear. Our \npersonnel, particularly those covering sensitive issues such as human \nrights, met adversity with poise and served our Nation with great \ndedication. They represent this country well and do us all proud.\n  Mr. Covert will be missed in Moscow by his colleagues at Post, as \nwell as by countless Russians who got to know him in recent years. I \nsalute Kevin Covert and all his State Department colleagues working the \nRussia beat during this difficult, but exciting, period of change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5964-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JAMES T.

Over the past three years \nCaptain Loeblein has served as the director of the Navy Senate liaison \noffice.\n  Since Captain Loeblein arrived on the Senate deck he has escorted 37 \ncodels to 42 countries. In addition to his travels, Captain Loeblein \nled his team of sailors with the highest degree of professionalism in \nsupport of every Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  Throughout his time serving in the Senate liaison office, I got to \nknow Jim. Captain Loeblein is a native of Salisbury, NC. Jim received \nhis commission as an ensign after he graduated from the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, Annapolis, MD, in May 1985. He went on to graduate from the \nNaval War College, Newport, RI, in 1997.\n  He has served as the executive officer aboard the USS John S. McCain, \nDDG 56. Captain Loeblein has also led sailors on multiple deployments \ncommanding two strike group deployments and served as the sea combat \ncommander for the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group all in support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Under Captain Loeblein's leadership and sharp instincts, his team has \nbeen instrumental in supporting the Senate's legislative responsibility \nto provide our sailors with the resources they need to carry out their \nmission. The Senate and our Nation are indebted for his service.\n  Next week, Captain Loeblein will officially be promoted to rear \nadmiral, lower half. We wish him well as he prepares to take over as \ndeputy commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command in Manama, Bahrain. \nI want to thank Captain Loeblein for his service and congratulate him \non this hard earned promotion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5964-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5964-S5965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDWARD J. LODGE\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Crapo to give recognition to U.S. District Judge Edward J. \nLodge, the longest serving jurist in the great State of Idaho. This \nmonth, Judge Lodge marked 50 years on the bench in combined State and \nFederal service.\n  His long and notable career on the bench began in 1963 when he was \nselected probate judge in Canyon County. Judge Lodge was then appointed \nby Governor Robert Smylie just 2 years later to serve on the Idaho \nState District Court. He was the youngest person to be appointed a \ndistrict judge.\n  After 23 years there, his name was put forth by U.S. Senator James \nMcClure for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the District of \nIdaho. President George H.W. Bush appointed him in 1989 and shortly \nthereafter, his nomination was confirmed in the U.S. Senate by \nunanimous consent.\n  Judge Lodge has earned the respect of his colleagues as a jurist who, \nno matter the pressure or how big the case, works to ensure a trial is \nfair. Throughout the years, he has consistently received high ratings \nfrom the Idaho State Bar.\n  Though it may say more about my State than I would like, Judge Lodge \nis believed to have presided over more murder cases than any other \njudge in Idaho. And, in fact, he may just be the only judge who \npresided over two such cases simultaneously. These cases and the many \nothers upon which he has presided distinguish Judge Lodge as a lifelong \nstudent of the law and as someone wholly dedicated to serving the \npeople in judicial matters.\n  A native of Caldwell, ID, Judge Lodge earned a bachelor's degree from \nthe College of Idaho in nearby Nampa, where he graduated cum laude. He \nthen went north to the University of Idaho in Moscow to earn his juris \ndoctorate.\n  Many may not know that throughout his education--from high school \nthrough university--he was an outstanding athlete. He was named three \ntimes an All-American in football at Caldwell High School, Boise Junior \nCollege and the College of Idaho. In addition, he was a Golden Gloves \nchampion and successfully participated in track-and-field. These \naccomplishments landed him a place in the Boise State Athletic Hall of \nFame and the College of Idaho Hall of Fame.\n  Judge Lodge is married to long serving Idaho State Senator Patti Anne \nLodge. They have three grown children: Mary-Jeanne, Edward and Anne-\nMarie.\n  Idaho is proud to call Judge Lodge a native son.\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5965-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       THE UNIVERSITY OF SCRANTON\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the University \nof Scranton on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of its founding. \nFor more than a century, this esteemed institution of higher education \nhas made invaluable contributions to the City of Scranton, the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and, most importantly, the lives of its \nmany alumni.\n  Founded in 1888 as Saint Thomas College by Most Reverend William G. \nO'Hara, the first Bishop of Scranton, the college was staffed by \ndiocesan priests and seminarians until 1896, and then briefly by the \nXaverian Brothers. From 1897 until the arrival of the school's first \nJesuit administration in 1942, the college was administered for the \nDiocese by the Christian Brothers. Renamed the University of Scranton \nin 1938, it is today ``a community dedicated to the freedom of inquiry \nand personal development fundamental to the growth in wisdom and \nintegrity of all who share its life.''\n  I am proud that my hometown is host to an academic institution of the \ncaliber of the University of Scranton. An anchor of the city's Hill \nSection, the university has grown well beyond its roots as a commuter \nschool into a nationally recognized and respected university with a \ntotal enrollment of over 6,000 students in undergraduate, graduate and \nnontraditional programs.\n  As a Senator representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, ensuring that our Nation's children and young adults have \naccess to high quality educational opportunities is one of my highest \npriorities. I firmly believe that anyone with the drive, fortitude and \ndesire to pursue the opportunities afforded by higher education should \nbe able to realize that dream. Throughout its history, the University \nof Scranton has enabled countless students to further their education \nand become productive members of society.\n  It is with great pride, as both a Senator from Pennsylvania and as a \nnative of Scranton, that I honor the University of Scranton today. The \ncontributions that this institution has made to both our Commonwealth \nand to our Nation are commendable, and I wish them all the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5965-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   2013 STENNIS CONGRESSIONAL INTERNS\n\n Ms. BALDWIN.

Mr. President, I stand today to honor the Kraft \nFoods Group, Inc. plant and its dedicated employees in Champaign, IL, \nas they celebrate its 50th anniversary.\n  This Champaign plant has the unique distinction of being Kraft's \nflagship facility, employing more than 1,100 of my\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\nfellow citizens of Illinois, and proudly producing more than any other \nKraft plant in the country. From the time it opened in 1963, this \nfacility has grown in both size and production. For generations, \nmillions of Americans have enjoyed the products made in Champaign, from \nMiracle Whip and Velveeta, to Kraft Singles and Cheese Whiz. The plant \ncontinues to expand its output, with new varieties of pasta, dressing \nand cheese being added to their production line in 2012, and earlier \nthis year, Kraft chose to dedicate their entire Velveeta production to \nthis single facility.\n  The Kraft Foods Group has called Illinois home since its founding in \n1903, and Champaign has been a critical part of this company for more \nthan half of that time. Kraft has so greatly contributed to Champaign's \neconomic climate, helping to make the city this plant calls home a \ngreat place to live and work. Likewise, the people of Champaign helped \nmake Kraft great. Our State is proud of all that Kraft produces, but we \nare especially proud of the ingenuity, industry, and drive that this \nplant's workers have embodied for 50 years. It is clear that because \nKraft's Champaign employees have been dedicated to achieving success, \nthis plant has continued to thrive after half a century.\n  In closing, I ask all my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nKraft Foods Group on reaching this incredible milestone and honoring \nthe employees at their acclaimed flagship plant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5966-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING ``AUNTY'' MARY BOURDUKOFSKY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay my respects to an Aleut elder and spiritual leader, ``Aunty'' Mary. \nIt is with a heavy heart I say that Mary-Nicolai Bourdukofsky, age 90, \npassed away on June 2, 2013 in Anchorage, AK.\n  ``Aunty'' Mary was a dedicated leader and fought to preserve the \nAleut culture, language and traditions by the formation of the Aleut \nDancers, sharing her knowledge of Aleut songs and stories, and native \nfood preparation. She participated in educating youth and leaders in \nvarious venues including the Pribilof, Unalaska and Sand Point Aleut \nCulture Camp and the Anchorage Aleut culture camp. She worked with the \nAlaska Federation of Natives, AFN, Youth and Elders and served as an \nAFN delegate for many years. ``Aunty'' Mary also assisted with \ndeveloping the Aleut culture exhibits at the Alaska Native Heritage \nCenter and the Smithsonian Institution's Alaska Native Collections. \nAdditionally she was honored as 2004 Aleut Corporation Elder of the \nYear. As a lifelong educator of traditional knowledge, she understood \nthe importance of western education; she was one of the first women on \nthe school board in St. Paul Island and later taught at the University \nof Alaska (both Fairbanks and Anchorage) and at Alaska Pacific \nUniversity. ``Aunty'' Mary was a positive role model for all. She was \nthe heart and soul of the family and the Aleut Community of St. Paul \nIsland. She was also a proud shareholder of TDX, the St. Paul Village \nCorporation.\n  Mary Bourdukofsky was born January 9, 1923 on St. Paul Island to \nNicolai and Olga Kozloff. Her role as natural leader began at an early \nage when she lost her own mother during childbirth and stepped up to \nhelp raise her three siblings. In 1939 she married George Bourdukofsky, \nand they had seven beautiful children. Despite being stricken by TB at \nbirth and losing one of her sons to polio, she pressed on and grew into \na well-respected community leader, advocating for equal rights and fair \ntreatment of her fellow Aleut people.\n  During World War II, her family and the rest of the Aleut Community \nof St. Paul Island were forced from their homes and placed in \ninternment at Funter Bay, AK. While all the Aleut men left as they \nvolunteered to join the war effort, she led female advocates in filing \na petition with the U.S. Government about the inhumane and unlivable \nconditions they were being forced to live in, knowing all the while \nthat the Island managers had threatened them all with expulsion from \ntheir homes back on St. Paul forever if they complained. Some 50 years \nlater she testified before the U.S. Congress, seeking an apology and \nretribution for how she and her fellow Aleut U.S. citizens were \nmistreated during WWII.\n  On behalf of the Senate I extend condolences to Mary's family, the \nAleut community and every life she touched through her tireless \nadvocacy. ``Aunty'' Mary was a truly remarkable individual, and I am \nproud to honor her as the outstanding leader that she was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/25/senate-section/article/S5966-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOME HELPERS OF EASTERN IDAHO\n\n Mr. RISCH.

Res. 200\n\n       Whereas on July 26, 1908, Attorney General Charles \n     Bonaparte ordered newly-hired Federal investigators to report \n     to the Office of the Chief Examiner of the Department of \n     Justice, which subsequently was renamed the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation;\n       Whereas on July 26, 1947, President Truman signed the \n     National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), \n     creating the Department of Defense, the National Security \n     Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, thereby laying the foundation for today's \n     intelligence community;\n       Whereas the National Security Act of 1947, which appears in \n     title 50 of the United States Code, governs the definition, \n     composition, responsibilities, authorities, and oversight of \n     the intelligence community of the United States;\n       Whereas the intelligence community is defined by section \n     3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)) \n     to include the Office of the Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \n     Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \n     National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National \n     Reconnaissance Office, other offices within the Department of \n     Defense for the collection of specialized national \n     intelligence through reconnaissance programs, the \n     intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, \n     the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the \n     Department of Energy, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research \n     of the Department of State, the Office of Intelligence and \n     Analysis of the Department of the Treasury, the elements of \n     the Department of Homeland Security concerned with the \n     analysis of intelligence information, and other elements as \n     may be designated;\n       Whereas July 26, 2012, was the 65th anniversary of the \n     signing of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 \n     et seq.);\n       Whereas the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458;

which was considered and \nagreed to.:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day \n     will raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic \n     kidney disease, one of the most prevalent, life-threatening \n     genetic kidney diseases;\n       Whereas National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day \n     will also foster understanding of the impact polycystic \n     kidney disease has on patients and their families;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a progressive, genetic \n     disorder of the kidneys that causes damage to the kidneys and \n     the cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal \n     organ systems;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease has a devastating impact \n     on the health and finances of people of all ages, and equally \n     affects people of all races, genders, nationalities, \n     geographic locations, and income levels;\n       Whereas, of the people diagnosed with polycystic kidney \n     disease, approximately 10 percent have no family history of \n     the disease, with the disease developing as a spontaneous (or \n     new) mutation;\n       Whereas there is no treatment or cure for polycystic kidney \n     disease, which is one of the 4 leading causes of kidney \n     failure in the United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of patients with polycystic \n     kidney disease reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States as the largest segment of the population \n     of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', continues to age;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease instills in patients fear \n     of an unknown future with a life-threatening genetic disease \n     and apprehension over possible discrimination, including the \n     risk of losing their health and life insurance, their jobs, \n     and their chances for promotion;\n       Whereas countless friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause \n     many patients to live in denial and forego regular visits to \n     their physicians or avoid following good health management, \n     which would help avoid more severe complications when kidney \n     failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression and its resultant consequences of 7 times the \n     national average because of their anxiety over pain, \n     suffering, and premature death; and\n       Whereas the PKD Foundation and its more than 60 volunteer \n     chapters around the United States are dedicated to conducting \n     research to find treatments and a cure for polycystic kidney \n     disease, fostering public awareness and understanding of the \n     disease, educating patients and their families about the \n     disease to improve their treatment and care, and providing \n     support and encouraging people to become organ donors, \n     including by sponsoring the annual ``Walk for PKD'' to raise \n     funds for polycystic kidney disease research, education, \n     advocacy, and awareness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the first Wednesday in September 2013 as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Day to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research to find a \n     cure for polycystic kidney disease;

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 20\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea (in this resolution referred \n     to as ``South Korea'') and the Democratic People's Republic \n     of Korea (in this resolution referred to as ``North Korea'') \n     have never formally ended hostilities and have been \n     technically in a state of war since the Armistice Agreement \n     was signed on July 27, 1953;\n       Whereas the United States, as representing the United \n     Nations Forces Command which was a signatory to the Armistice \n     Agreement, and with 28,500 of its troops currently stationed \n     in South Korea, has a stake in the progress towards peace and \n     reunification on the Korean Peninsula;\n       Whereas progress towards peace and reunification on the \n     Korean Peninsula would mean greater security and prosperity \n     for the region and the world;\n       Whereas, at the end of World War II, Korea officially \n     gained independence from Japanese rule, as agreed to at the \n     Cairo Conference on November 22, 1943, through November 26, \n     1943;\n       Whereas, on August 10, 1945, the Korean Peninsula was \n     temporarily divided along the 38th parallel into two military \n     occupation zones commanded by the United States and the \n     Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, on June 25, 1950, communist North Korea invaded \n     the South, thereby initiating the Korean War and diminishing \n     prospects for a peaceful unification of Korea;\n       Whereas, during the Korean War, approximately 1,789,000 \n     members of the United States Armed Forces served in-theater \n     along with the South Korean forces and 20 other members of \n     the United Nations to secure peace on the Korean Peninsula \n     and in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas, since the end of the Korean War era, the United \n     States Armed Forces have remained in South Korea to promote \n     regional peace;\n       Whereas provocations by the Government of North Korea in \n     recent years have escalated tension and instability in the \n     Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas one of the largest obstacles to peace and \n     reunification on the Korean Peninsula is the presence of \n     nuclear weapons in North Korea;\n       Whereas the refusal of the Government of North Korea to \n     denuclearize disrupts peace and security on the Korean \n     Peninsula;\n       Whereas, beginning in 2003, the United States, along with \n     the two Koreas, Japan, the People's Republic of China, and \n     the Russian Federation, have engaged in six rounds of Six-\n     Party Talks aimed at the verifiable and irreversible \n     denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and finding a \n     peaceful resolution to the security concerns resulting from \n     North Korea's nuclear development;\n       Whereas the three-mile wide buffer zone between the two \n     Koreas, known as the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, is the most \n     heavily armed border in the world;\n       Whereas the Korean War separated more than 10,000,000 \n     Korean family members, including 100,000 Korean Americans \n     who, after 60 years of separation, are still waiting to see \n     their families in North Korea;\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\n       Whereas reunification remains a long-term goal of South \n     Korea;\n       Whereas South Korea and North Korea are both full members \n     of the United Nations, whose stated purpose includes \n     maintaining international peace and security, and to that end \n     ``take effective collective measures for the prevention and \n     removal of threats to the peace'';\n       Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and \n     South Korea have continuously stood shoulder-to-shoulder to \n     promote and defend international peace and security, economic \n     prosperity, human rights, and the rule of law both on the \n     Korean Peninsula and beyond, and the denuclearization of \n     North Korea;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Transportation Empowerment \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) that objective has been attained, and the Interstate \n     System connecting all States is near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the Federal Government's perceptions of what \n     is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. 3. FUNDING LIMITATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines for any of fiscal \n     years 2015 through 2019 that the aggregate amount required to \n     carry out transportation programs and projects under this \n     title and amendments made by this title exceeds the estimated \n     aggregate amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for \n     those programs and projects for the fiscal year, each amount \n     made available for such a program or project shall be reduced \n     by the pro rata percentage required to reduce the aggregate \n     amount required to carry out those programs and projects to \n     an amount equal to that available for those programs and \n     projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 4.
