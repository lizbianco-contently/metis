Mr. President, I think it is appropriate that I say just a \nword or two about the eight Senators who have worked to get us to the \npoint where we are now. I was thinking this morning that this is really \nAmerica at its best. Each one of those eight Senators does not know, as \nI do not know, whether this work they have done is going to help them \nor hurt them in their political careers. But this is one of those \nopportunities where I am confident that they believe they are doing it \nfor the right reasons no matter what the political consequences are.\n  We have a broken immigration system. They have led us to a path to be \nable to fix it--but for them we would continue with this broken \nimmigration system--which, as we know now from the reports we got from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, is going to help tremendously reduce \nour deficit for the next two decades by $1 trillion--$1 trillion.\n  When people came before this legislation and said: We have to do this \nlegislation because it is good for the security of this Nation and good \nfor the economy, people really did not know if they were speaking the \ntruth. Well, we know now. That is absolutely true. It improves the \nsecurity. We see what is going to happen with the border. We are going \nto have 40,000 Border Patrol agents. We are going to have all methods \nto make sure that border is secure and the northern border is secure. \nIn addition to that, it is going to improve our economy significantly.\n  I applaud and congratulate those eight Senators for the remarkably \ngood work they have done.\n  It was 6 a.m. when immigration officials came to take Maria \nEspinoza's husband away in handcuffs. She walked out the front door to \nhand her husband his lunch money and watched as he was loaded in a \ntruck and carted to an immigration detention center. That is a fancy \nword for a jail. He was not a criminal. He works hard, pays his taxes, \nand he is a good father and a good husband. But Jorge is in the country \nwithout the proper immigration paperwork, so he spent a month in this \njail. Maria, who is also an undocumented immigrant, was also set to be \ndeported but was able to remain at home with her teenage daughter, who \nis, by the way, a U.S. citizen. Maria and Jorge were basically able to \nsecure a stay of deportation, but they live with the fear that they \nwill be torn away from their family and deported to a country they have \nnot set foot in in 25 years.\n  They came from Mexico. They have made their home in Las Vegas. They \nhave been there for 25 years--almost as\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\nlong as they have been married. In Nevada, Maria and Jorge have a large \nand vibrant family. They have two daughters and a son, and now they \nhave an 8-month-old grandson as well. They have loving friends and a \ntight-knit community. In Mexico, the country where they were born, they \ndo not know a single soul except a really old relative.\n  Because Maria and Jorge are undocumented immigrants, they live with \nthe fear every minute of every day--and sometimes as they awaken at \nnight--that they will have to leave the country they love, the United \nStates. Maria lives with the fear that she will have to say goodbye to \ntheir children and her grandson. Here is what she said yesterday:\n\n       When you lose your mother or your father, you are an \n     orphan. When you lose your husband, you are a widow. What do \n     they call it when you lose a child, when you are separated \n     from a child? There is no name for that.\n\n  Maria and Jorge's family members are all legally present in the \nUnited States. Maria and Jorge's youngest daughter, a freshman in \ncollege, was born in the United States. So was their grandson.\n  A directive issued last year by President Obama allowed their two \noldest children, both of whom are married to U.S. citizens, to obtain \ntheir legal residency. The President's directive suspended deportation \nfor 800,000 DREAMers--young people brought to America illegally when \nthey were children and in many instances just babies. But millions of \nfamily members of those young DREAMers do not qualify for legal status \nor an earned pathway to citizenship. Millions of mixed-status families \nworry every day that a loved one--a parent, a spouse, a sibling--will \nbe torn away from them at any time. That is why it is crucial that \nCongress pass this bipartisan legislation.\n  This is reform legislation that protects and preserves families. We \nneed to do it right now. I am happy the Senate will pass such a bill \nthis week. A permanent, commonsense solution to our dysfunctional \nsystem is really in sight. It is my hope our colleagues in the House \nwill follow the Senate's lead and work to pass bipartisan reform and do \nit now because whether we serve in the House or Senate, whether we hail \nfrom red States or blue States, we should all be able to agree that the \ncurrent system is broken. We should all be able to agree that \ncongressional action is necessary.\n  I have seen firsthand the devastation caused by our broken system. \nBut each time I have an opportunity to speak with Nevadans about the \nurgent need for action on immigration, I am reminded that this issue is \npersonal to them also. It is personal, as I have indicated, to me, but \nit is just as personal to Maria and Jorge. It is personal to 11 million \nother undocumented immigrants and tens of millions of their U.S. \ncitizen relatives, whose eyes are turned toward Washington and whose \nhearts are filled with hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5204-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday morning I made a prediction \nabout a speech the President was expected to give later in the day. I \nsaid we could expect him to announce a plan to impose the will of some \nof his most radical backers on the American middle class. I said he \nwould be undeterred by Congress's rejection of his national energy tax \neven when Democrats held commanding majorities in both Houses. I said \nhe would announce his intention to push through job-crushing \nregulations anyway but this time largely through the back door over the \nobjections of many working-class Americans rather than through the \nregular democratic process. Lo and behold, that is essentially what he \ndid.\n  I was surprised by one thing, though, and that was his continued \neffort to play politics with the Keystone Pipeline jobs. Remember, we \nall know that the oil this pipeline would carry is going to come out of \nthe ground either way. It is going to come out of the ground whether or \nnot he approves it. In other words, whether he gives approval to the \npipeline or not, the oil is coming out of the ground. The only question \nis whether that energy and those jobs will go to America or whether \nthey will be allowed to travel across the Pacific to governments that \nharbor terrible environmental records to begin with.\n  That is just one reason why the Keystone Pipeline has enjoyed such \nbroad bipartisan support here in the Senate. Even Big Labor--a sector \nthat is usually supportive of the President--is all behind the Keystone \nPipeline. Yet, yesterday, when the President had the opportunity to \nside with the working-class families across the country by approving \nthe pipeline, he took another pass--just took a pass.\n  Sometimes you have to wonder about this administration. In making \ndecisions such as these, you have to wonder if they truly understand \nthe worries most Americans have to contend with in the Obama economy. I \nhave long warned, for example, that the White House was determined--\ndetermined--to wage a war on coal. They denied it, of course, but only \njust long enough to get through the last election. So it is not a \ncoincidence that the President did not give his speech before the \nelection or that he gave it at a university that symbolizes the DC \nelite rather than somewhere in coal country. He should have made this \nspeech down at Morehead State University in my State or the University \nof Pikeville in my State. That would have been the place to make the \nspeech, not here in town.\n  Now the President's supporters seem all too happy to admit there is a \nwar on coal. Just yesterday an adviser to the White House said, ``A war \non coal is exactly what's needed.'' You have to give him points for \ncandor.\n  Look, Republicans are all for developing the fuels and the energies \nof the future. We are all for that. We just think it should come about \nas part of an all-of-the-above strategy, which is exactly what the \nWhite House said it supported too back before the election. But now \nwith the election year over, the truth comes out.\n  In truth, the administration seems to adhere to a dogma that could \nbest be described as ``none of the above''--not ``all of the above'' \nbut ``none of the above, except a couple of things that make our base \nhappy.'' I would note that such an approach is basically nonsense since \nit ignores what is necessary to keep our country's growing energy needs \nmet in order to move toward a future where renewables look set to play \na greater role because it simply tries to pretend that it will not take \nyears, if not decades, for these other types of energy to come online \nin a way that will truly meet our energy needs.\n  In a phrase, it is a strategy that subordinates almost everything to \npolitics. That is why Republicans believe a true all-of-the-above \nstrategy means developing wind, solar, natural gas, oil, and coal, and \nembracing American jobs that come along with producing American energy.\n  Here is what we believe it absolutely does not mean: It does not mean \npicking out a class of vulnerable people and declaring war on them. \nThere is a depression in central Appalachia, which includes eastern \nKentucky, because of the government itself, this administration. \nSometimes people in Washington forget the decisions here actually \naffect the lives of others. I am often left to wonder, do they not \ncare?\n  Of course, coal is an important industry to my State, and I am going \nto defend Kentucky workers from out-of-touch Washington attacks, but it \nis pretty naive to think it is just about Kentucky, West Virginia, or \nPennsylvania. As I said yesterday, a war on coal is actually a war on \njobs. Coal is important to our entire country. It is critical to the \ngrowth of manufacturing, and it is important to our national economy.\n  One can say a coal miner in Kentucky relies on coal for their well-\nbeing, just as a line worker in a manufacturing plant that uses coal \nrelies on it too. Pretty much everyone who lives or works in a building \nwith electricity relies on coal in some way. That is why even some in \nthe President's party are trying to distance themselves from his \napproach.\n  As one of my Senate Democratic colleagues put it yesterday:\n\n       The fact is clear: our own Energy Department reports that \n     our country will get 37 percent of our energy from coal until \n     2040.\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n     Removing coal from our energy mix will have disastrous \n     consequences for our recovering economy.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with our Democratic colleague.\n  It is time for the White House to stop pivoting from job-destroying \npolicies to campaign-stop PR pitches for jobs right back to job-\ndestroying policies. It is time for the administration to get serious \nabout pursuing a truly workable strategy for this country, for energy, \nfor the economy, and for jobs.\n\n\n                              Senate Rules\n\n  Briefly, on another matter, another day has gone by. We are still not \nclear that the majority leader is going to keep his word given back at \nthe beginning of this Congress that the issue of the rules for the \nSenate of this Congress have been settled. They have been settled as a \nresult of bipartisan discussions that occurred back in January leading \nto the passing of two rules changes and two standing orders, after \nwhich the majority leader had said it had been settled, that we had the \nrules for this Congress.\n  Later we learned that maybe we didn't, and there were these implied \nthreats issued to groups around the country that he would exercise a \nso-called nuclear option. The definition of the nuclear option is to \nbreak the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the \nSenate.\n  The minority, and I suspect a reasonable number of the majority, are \nwaiting to find out whether the majority leader intends to keep his \nword. Your word is the currency of the realm in the Senate. His word \nhas been given. We expect it to be kept.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5205-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:30 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nmanagers or their designees.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have expressed my frustration many times, and more \noften in the last week, about the lack of progress on getting votes. We \nhave been on this bill for 3 weeks. Yet we have only dealt with nine \namendments. It is unclear if any more amendments will be debated and \nvoted on. We have provided a list to the majority on amendments that we \nbelieve will make the bill better. It seems as though the only \namendments that will be made in order before we vote on final passage \nwill be the Schumer-Hoeven-Corker so-called grand compromise. This is \nthe one that was concocted behind closed doors for days, stalling \nprogress we wanted to make in the public. In other words, we lost a lot \nof time while this grand compromise was being concocted behind closed \ndoors. Even while that was going on, we could have been debating \namendments and voting on amendments.\n  Not only is the amendment before us, meaning the Schumer-Hoeven-\nCorker amendment, loaded with provisions that some would call earmarks, \nbut it continues to promote false promises that the border will be \ntruly secured. We get the impression from hearing the authors debate \ntheir amendment that tomorrow we are going to have a secure border. \nThis is not going to happen, and I will explain that in a moment.\n  Let's get back to basics. We are a Nation based upon the rule of law. \nIn that concept, every Nation has a right to protect its sovereignty. \nIn fact, it has a duty to protect the homeland. Any border security \nmeasures we pass then must be real and, more importantly, immediate. We \ncan't wait 10 years down the road to put more agents on the border or \nto implement a tracking system to track foreign nationals. We have to \nprove to the American people today that illegal entries are under \ncomplete control and the visa overstays are being punished. Being \npunished means leave our country when your visa says you are supposed \nto leave the country.\n  Unfortunately, too many people have been led to believe the bill \nbefore us, and this grand compromise amendment, will force the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to secure the border. The fact is, it \ndoesn't do that, but we are led to believe that tomorrow the border \nwill be secure. The amendment basically is a continuation of the basic \npremise of the underlying bill--legalization first, enforcement later, \nif ever.\n  It is very simple and it is wrong. People will be legalized merely on \nthe submission of a plan by the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Will that plan secure the border? Who is going to know until a long \nway down the road. In the meantime, you have legalization and possibly \nenforcement, but you aren't going to know. Then you end up making the \nsame mistake I made by voting for the bill in 1986. I don't intend to \nmake that mistake again.\n  We are saying the Secretary puts forth a plan. This very same \nSecretary is the one who thinks the border is already strong enough, \nthe same Secretary who has refused to even answer questions we \nsubmitted to her 2 months ago about how she might interpret some of \nthis legislation. She obviously hasn't been forthright in answering \nwhat those department policies would be.\n  The amendment puts additional agents on the border, yes. It does it, \nquite frankly, in opposition to people on the other side of the aisle. \nSome of the sponsors of the bill have argued already that more agents \naren't necessary. Maybe I should be satisfied we are going to have more \nagents. The point is, it is so far down the road--don't sell this \namendment to me as border security.\n  Let's be honest with the American people. This amendment, this grand \ncompromise concocted behind closed doors, may call for more Border \nPatrol agents, but it surely doesn't require it until the undocumented \npopulation, who are now RPIs, apply for adjustment status or a green \ncard, and that is down the road several years.\n  I am all for putting more agents along the border, but why should we \nwait? It ought to be enforcement now, legalization later. Why allow \nlegalization now and simply promise more agents in the future?\n  Even then, who believes the Secretary, like the one we have today, \nwill actually enforce the law? When I say like the Secretary we have \ntoday, I mean the policy. She says the border is secure.\n  In this amendment there is the issue of fencing. One of the \nconditions that must be met before the Secretary can process green \ncards for people here illegally is the southern border fencing strategy \nhas been submitted to Congress and implemented. This fencing strategy \nwill identify where 700 miles of pedestrian fencing is in place. Note \nthat this is not double layered, as in current law, so current law is \nweakened.\n  The amendment states the second layer is to be built only if the \nSecretary deems it necessary and appropriate. This is another \ndelegation of authority to a Secretary who says the border is already \nsecure.\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\n  Additionally, the underlying bill still specifically states that \nnothing in this provision shall be interpreted to require her to \ninstall fencing. Yes, they talk about this being a strong border-secure \ngrand compromise, but it leaves so much discretion to a Secretary who \nalready says the border is secure.\n  Another part of the amendment requires an electronic entry-exit \nsystem is in use at all international air and sea ports. This sounds \nlike all international air and sea ports--and look at this caveat--but \nonly ``where U.S. Customs and Border Protection are currently \ndeployed.''\n  This is actually weaker than the underlying bill which required the \nelectronic entry-exit system be used at air and sea ports, not just \ninternational. Here again we have a grand compromise, supposed to get \nmore votes for this bill, but it is weaker than the underlying \nlegislation, because the underlying legislation requires biometric \nentry-exit at all ports of entry, including air, sea, and land.\n  The amendment dictates to the Secretary which equipment to purchase \nand deploy at the border. The Members who wrote the bill were \napparently given some secret list of technology that agents need, but I \nam not sure if this came from the Department or some defense \ncontractor.\n  Have no fear, the border will be secure because the amendment calls \nfor fixed towers and cameras, unattended ground sensors, night-vision \ngoggles, fiberoptic tank inspection scopes, a license plate reader, and \nbackscatters. Obviously, I am facetious when I say the border will be \nsecured by this concocted, behind-closed-doors grand compromise.\n  What is not so funny is the spending of taxpayer dollars in this \namendment. Originally the legislation allocated $6.5 million for the \nSecretary to carry out the law, and $6.5 billion is a lot of money. \nWhen we got to committee, the Gang of 8 increased the trust fund \nallocation by $6.5 billion to $8.3 billion, and $8.3 billion is still a \nlot of money. We have this grand compromise concocted behind closed \ndoors before us, and now we are looking at not $8.3 billion but $46.3 \nbillion upon date of enactment for the Secretary to spend as she \nwishes.\n  As is often the case here in Washington, the solution always seems to \nbe throw money at a problem. This grand compromise measures the success \nof their amendment by the amount of money that is going to be spent, \nnot by outcomes. The American people, in the polls of this country, \nwant the outcomes to be a secure border, not the amount of money that \nis going to be spent on the success of a piece of legislation. Of \ncourse, the money has to come from somewhere, so the amendment requires \nthe government to raid the Social Security trust fund. It is ObamaCare \nall over again, where the Medicare trust fund was raided to help \nfinance that. It is irresponsible and unacceptable.\n\n  Moreover, the amendment's sponsors will claim that people here \nillegally will pay for our border security needs. But money has to come \ninto the trust fund, and after it gets into the trust fund it has to be \nrepaid to the Treasury. Where will the American people be reimbursed? \nThe sponsors of the bill say the taxpayers will not bear the burden. \nYet there is no requirement the funds be paid back. There is no time \nlimit or accountability to ensure the taxpayers or the Treasury gets \nits money back.\n  The Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment increases fees on visas for legal \nimmigrants in order to replenish the trust fund and the Treasury. \nEmployers, students, and tourists will pay the price. Talking about \nemployers, students, and tourists, these are people who abide by the \nlaw who are paying the price. Meanwhile, the amendment says for those \nbeing legalized--in other words, people who came here undocumented, \nthose people having not subjected themselves to American law by \ncrossing the border illegally--they cannot be charged more than what is \nallowed already. The Secretary cannot adjust the fees or penalties on \nthose who apply for or renew their RPI or blue card status, and those \nare the people who came to this country without papers, in violation of \nour law.\n  The amendment in the underlying bill will not end illegal immigration \nbecause the border is not going to be secure. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says illegal immigration would only be reduced by 25 percent due \nto the increased numbers of guest workers coming into the country. The \namendment does nothing to radically reduce illegal immigration in the \nfuture and does not provide any resources to interior enforcement \nagents whose mission it is to apprehend, detain, and deport illegal \nimmigrants.\n  Just as with the 1986 amnesty--and I voted for that, which was a \nmistake I regret--we are going to be back in the same position in 10 \nyears, facing the same problem.\n  The authors have talked a lot about the border surge in their \namendment, but they seem to be hiding from the fact the border changes \nonly account for about half of the total amendment. There are changes \nto every title. There are changes to exchange visitor programs, the \nfuture guest worker program, and visas, even for the performing arts. \nThis isn't just a border amendment. There are provisions in the bill \nthat were put in there specifically to get Senators to support passage \nof this bill, because they think if they can get 70 votes, the House of \nRepresentatives is going to buy into this thing. I expect to vote \nagainst the bill, and I expect the House of Representatives to fix this \nmiserable failure, both the underlying legislation as well as the grand \ncompromise amendment before us, so we can vote for a bill going to the \nPresident that has border security before we have legalization.\n  That is going to happen. I trust the other body isn't going to buy \ninto the argument the Senators in this body want to use; that somehow, \nif this gets 70 votes, it is so bipartisan how could the other body not \ndo it? This body is not the deliberative body on this amendment that \nhistory tells the American people the Senate is. This is a body that \nfor 3 weeks, with 451 amendments, didn't deliberate. We stalled and \nvoted on 9 or 10 amendments. The House of Representatives is going to \nbe the deliberative body on immigration reform, and it is going to put \nthe Senate to shame.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the amendment. It does nothing to \nchange the legalization first philosophy and offers little more than \nfalse promises the American people can no longer tolerate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an agreement I have \nreached with Senator Graham on the Hirono-Murray-Murkowski amendment \nNo. 1718, which has been cosponsored by Senators Boxer, Gillibrand, \nCantwell, Stabenow, Klobuchar, Warren, Baldwin, Mikulski, Shaheen, \nLeahy, Franken, Menendez, and Schumer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Landrieu be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I have been speaking on the Senate floor \nand talking with my colleagues about my concern that the immigration \nbill we are considering inadvertently disadvantages women who are \ntrying to immigrate to the United States. I believe the new merit-based \npoint system for employment green cards will significantly disadvantage \nwomen who want to come to this country, particularly unmarried women.\n  Many women overseas do not have the same educational or career \nadvancement opportunities available to men in those countries. This new \nmerit-based system will prioritize green cards for immigrants with high \nlevels of education or experience. By favoring these immigrants, the \nbill essentially cements unfairness against women into U.S. immigration \nlaw. That is not the way to go.\n  After I brought these concerns to Senators Schumer and Graham, \nSenator Graham graciously agreed to sit down with me. We were able to \nwork out a way to address the concerns about women in the merit-based \nsystem that I believe will significantly improve this bill. The new \nHirono-Murray-Murkowski amendment reflects a few changes which we \nagreed to after working with Senator Graham.\n  The changes we made include: limits on the ability for certain types \nof health care workers to obtain points multiple times based solely on \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nemployment, clarification that there must be a personal relationship to \nobtain points under the humanitarian concerns section of the amendment, \nelimination of the provision that awarded points for being a last \nsurviving relative of a U.S. citizen, harmonization of tier 3 with \ntiers 1 and 2 by adding points for English language skills, and \nensuring the tier 3 visas do not--do not--reduce the overall numbers of \ntier 1 and tier 2 visas available.\n  We should continue to increase the opportunities for women in our \nimmigration system, but I believe this agreement will help level the \nplaying field for women. Our amendment would establish a new tier 3 \nmerit-based point system that will provide a fair opportunity for women \nto compete for merit-based green cards.\n  Complementary to the high-skilled, tier 1 and lower skilled tier 2, \nthe new tier 3 would include professions commonly held by women so as \nnot to limit women's opportunities for economic-focused immigration to \nour country. This system would provide 30,000 tier 3 visas and would \nnot reduce the visas available in the other two merit-based tiers.\n  I wish to thank Senator Graham for working with me to modify this \nproposal in such a way he could agree to lend his support while still \naddressing the real concerns that women will be at a disadvantage under \nthe new merit-based system. I believe our amendment is a step in the \nright direction toward addressing the disparities for women in the new \nmerit-based system, and over 100 organizations, including faith-based \norganizations, support the Hirono-Murray-Murkowski amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to improve the new \nmerit-based immigration system and make this bill better for women. I \nhope we can reach an agreement to bring this amendment to the floor for \na vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we will have a vote before much longer \non the question of whether the legislation before us violates the \nbudget. I think that is going to be established quite clearly. The \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Murray--and I am the ranking \nRepublican on that committee--is going to acknowledge that and the \nParliamentarian will so rule that the legislation violates the budget \nand violates it in a number of ways, contrary to the promises made by \nthe sponsors of the bill.\n  The sponsors of the bill proposed a large piece of legislation and \ntold everyone a great deal about their bill, one fact after another, \nand those promises and representations have been shown to be \ninaccurate. They are not accurate and that is unfortunate. That is why \nthe bill is having the difficulties it is.\n  If it simply was a bill that provided a legal status for people who \nhad been here a long time without difficulties and it was a bill that \nactually fixed the border, fixed the workplace enforcement, fixed the \nentry-exit visa, and created an effective internal enforcement \nmechanism for the future, the legislation would have a good chance of \nhaving popular support. But as people find out more about it, they find \nall those factors are not going to be achieved effectively--in some \ninstances even weakened from current law--and as a result the \nlegislation is in trouble.\n  When we get a piece of legislation that is 1,200 pages and people are \nunable to digest it, it boils down to talking points. So the sponsors \nproduced a series of talking points that they said reflects what is in \nthe legislation. One of their talking points was that the bill is not \ngoing to cost the taxpayers money; that we would fine the people who \nare here illegally and they will pay the cost of this bill so it would \nnot impact the budget. We were promised that in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee when this legislation came up. Senator Schumer made that \nexplicitly clear. This is a quote from him in committee, and this is \nwhat their talking point said and what their Members have been saying \nrepeatedly:\n\n       And here, what we're simply doing is making sure that all \n     the expenses in the bill are fully funded by the income that \n     the bill brings in. This is to make sure that this bill does \n     not incur any cost on the taxpayers. It's to make it revenue \n     neutral.\n\n  That was the promise we had heard. People like to hear that. They \nwere pleased to hear that. It was a positive spin for the bill. He goes \non to say:\n\n       Section 6 provides start-up costs to implement the bill, \n     repaid by fees that come in later.\n\n  Then he goes on to say money will be paid from companies and workers \nand by the immigrants who get the legal status in terms of ``their \nfines as they go through the process.''\n  That was the promise that was there. Yet now we have legislation and \na score that demonstrates that is plainly not correct. First, the \nCongressional Budget Office analyzed the cost, and this was before we \nadded the extra money last week or what we will vote on today. This was \nbefore they added the substitute Corker-Hoeven-Schumer amendment, and \nthat substitute adds a lot more money.\n  What our experts in the budget office tell us is that it would add \n$14 billion to the on-budget debt of the United States, but it is \nreally more than that.\n  Most of the individuals who will be legalized will be able to have \nSocial Security cards and will pay FICA, Medicare, and Social Security \nwithholdings on their paychecks every week, which will incur extra \nrevenue for the U.S. Government. Our colleagues claim credit for the \nFICA money to try to justify their claims that they are within the \nbudget and that we should not just count the on-budget score that debt \nincreases from the CBO. But we have to know that the FICA money is \nmoney that goes to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and \nevery one of the individuals whose average age now is in their thirties \nwill eventually claim the benefit of Medicare and Social Security. They \nwill draw out of the Medicare and Social Security trust funds the money \nthey paid in.\n  Statistically speaking, they will draw out a lot more than they pay \nin because those funds are not on a sound basis. Medicare and Social \nSecurity are on an unsound basis today. They are counting that money to \npay for their bill when that money is dedicated to the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds.\n  By spending that money today, they are simply adding to the debt of \nthe United States. They cannot claim that twice. They cannot claim that \nthe individuals who are going to be given Social Security cards and \nwill be on a path to receive Social Security and Medicare when they \nretire--that they are paying into Social Security and Medicare if their \nmoney is being spent on funding this program. That is double counting, \nand Mr. Elmendorf of CBO showed that.\n  This chart shows it is really more than just the $14 billion, which \nis significant. This chart shows how much the deficit of the United \nStates is impacted by this legislation. The unified budget surplus \ncounts all the Social Security money and all the tax money in one pot. \nIt is one way to do the accounting of the United States. It is not \naccurate in this case. It should not be used. It claims a $197 billion \nsurplus. That is the Social Security and Medicare money. But if we take \naway the Social Security surplus this bill creates, $211 billion, and \nthe money they pay into the Medicare trust fund, $56 billion--the net \ndeficit is $70 billion. We have to get our minds correct.\n  The reason this country is going broke, the reason this country is so \nfar off a sound fiscal path, is that we continue, we persist, in using \na unified budget number when that money for Social Security and \nMedicare is dedicated money. It is set aside to pay for something in \nthe future.\n  If someone sets aside money in their savings account for their \nretirement, they cannot spend it today and pretend they still have it \nfor their retirement account. It is just that simple.\n  This is a bad trend we have been in. It was not so obvious when \nSocial Security and Medicare were bringing in a lot more money than was \ngoing out. But now that is not so, and we will soon be in deficit, and \nvery serious deficit. So we should not in any way suggest, believe, or \ntell the American people that this bill is paid for. It is not\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\npaid for, and as a result it violates the Budget Act. That is the point \nof order that Senator Vitter has made, and we will vote on it.\n  In addition to that, it is worse. There are 10 more budget violations \nin the bill: One is for new direct spending to exceed the Judiciary \nCommittee's authorization levels over a 5-year period. Another one is a \n10-year violation of spending over authorized levels in violation of \nthe committee allocations.\n  Another is an emergency designation to increase spending pursuant to \nemergency spending from the comprehensive immigration trust fund; \nemergency spending designation for the comprehensive reform trust fund \nin violation of the PAYGO Act; emergency designation in violation of a \n2010 budget resolution; emergency designation for Social Security \ncards, in violation of the statutory PAYGO Act. This bill calls it an \nemergency to have funds for Social Security implementation. That is not \nan emergency.\n  Another is an emergency designation for the E-Verify system. That is \na system we have established and should be able to expand rapidly. That \nis not an emergency to expand that. That is in violation of the 2010 \nbudget resolution.\n  Another is an emergency designation for E-Verify in violation of the \nPAYGO act; emergency designation for passenger manifest information \nexpenditures, in violation of the 2010 budget resolution; emergency \ndesignation in violation of the Statutory PAYGO Act for passenger \nmanifest information.\n  All of those represent violations of the Budget Act. Senator Vitter \nraised the one that plainly violates the flat spending limit we agreed \nto and are now operating under. When the response came from Senator \nLeahy, he moved to waive that. He moved to waive not only that, but all \nthe other 10 violations of the Budget Act. You only raise one at a \ntime. Senator Vitter raised one, and they moved to waive them all and \neliminate this pesky complaint that their bill spends more money than \nthe budget allows.\n  We will be voting on that, colleagues, and this Senate has been in \nrecent months doing well with regard to adhering to the budget limits \nwe agreed to. We have had seven consecutive votes in which the Senate \nhas voted not to violate the budget when a bill hit the floor that \nviolated the budget. We sent the bill back for reform so if it comes \nback it has to be in harmony with the bill--seven consecutive votes.\n\n  My colleagues who have been there and who believe they have a \nresponsibility to honor the budget limitations we agreed to should not \nvote to waive the budget. Let's stay within the budget. Let's require \nthe bill's sponsors to do what they promised to do, and by right they \nshould be able to do, which is produce a bill that comes within cost \nwithout raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, as they \nnow intend to do. That is just the way it is. I wish it were not so, \nbut it is.\n  I will take a minute to point out that recently--last night or late \nyesterday--Senator Bennet, one of our most able Members of the Senate \nand a Member of the Gang of 8, took the floor to promote the bill and \nclaimed that before jobs are offered, the bill ``requires an American \nis offered the job first.''\n  He went on to say: ``We are not bringing in a whole bunch of new \npeople when there are Americans looking for work.''\n  We are not bringing in a whole bunch of new people when there are \nAmericans looking for work--well, we are. The guest worker program that \nis in this bill, in addition to the legalization process of normal \nimmigration, doubles the number of guest workers who will be coming to \nAmerica over current law. These are not people who come to be permanent \nresidents and immigrate to America. These are people who come to take a \njob and work for a certain period of time--really up to 3 years, and \nthey can extend for 3 years. They have become permanent job takers, in \nmany instances.\n  He says: First of all, you have to certify an American has been \noffered the job first. He and other supporters claim this bill is not \ngoing to impact wages, is not going to impact jobs. They say don't \nworry about it--I am worried about it. First and foremost, we are going \nto have 1.1 million people, and many of those are not able to work in \nthe economy fully today because they are illegally here. They will be \ngiven a legal status, a Social Security card, driver's license, and the \nability to apply for any job in America. So all of a sudden we are \ngoing to have a half million people, perhaps, out there competing for \njobs that Americans cannot find today because unemployment is very \nhigh. That is going to happen promptly.\n  Then we are going to accelerate another 4.5 million people into the \ncountry, without regard to their skills, and they will be looking for \njobs mostly in the lower skilled workforce area. Then, in addition to \nthat, we add the normal flow of immigration into America. We currently \nwelcome 1 million immigrants every year, but this is going to welcome \n1.5 million a year. So, there will be an additional 500,000 workers a \nyear in America under the normal immigration system. In addition to \nthat, the guest worker program will double--all at a time when we are \nnot doing well economically.\n  Today's announcement that the government revised downward \nsubstantially the growth in the first quarter is a real problem. We are \nnot seeing job growth. Let me just show this chart about the impact on \nwages and workers in America that will occur as a result of this \nlegislation. I think probably these numbers are modest. I think it will \nbe more dramatic than this.\n  This is our Congressional Budget Office. They looked at the numbers, \nand they said: the average wage would lower over the first dozen years \nif this bill passes.\n  For 12 years, if we pass this bill, the average wages of Americans \nwill be lower than would have been the case if the bill had not passed, \naccording to our own CBO.\n  Somebody came and said on the floor: We won't worry about that \nbecause in 20 or 30 years they say it might be better.\n  First of all, our problem is today. People are unemployed today, and \nthey cannot find work today. Wages have been declining every year since \n1999. Working wages of Americans have been declining relative to \ninflation steadily for over a decade. This bill will accelerate that. \nIt takes us in exactly the wrong direction. Why would we do that?\n  Then it says CBO--this is their own report and this chart is in their \nown report:\n\n       CBO estimates that S. 744 would cause the unemployment rate \n     to increase slightly between 2014 and 2020.\n\n  So for the next 7 or 8 years we are talking about increased \nunemployment.\n  This chart shows the wage situation. This is the current rate. The \nbill passes, wages drop, and they start going up out here, according to \nCBO, in year 2025. If the bill had not passed, the growth would have \nbeen higher still, but now it knocked it down dramatically. Even though \nit is growing, it doesn't mean it is getting back to where it would \nhave been had the bill not been passed.\n  People who say this bill will not impact adversely--working Americans \nare facing an economic reality that is unfortunate for them.\n  Finally, they say it will make the economy stronger. You have heard \nthat. Under this bill we will give legal status, in the next 10 years, \nto 30 million people; permanent legal status to 30 million people \ninstead of 10 million people who would be given legal status in America \nif we followed current law.\n  Virtually all of those will be able to work, and we would see some \nincrease in GDP/GNP if that were to occur. However, how much increase \ndo you get and how does it compare out per person in America?\n  CBO said S. 744 would reduce per capita GNP by 0.7 percent in 2023. \nThat is page 14. In fact, per capita GDP, according to their own chart \nthat I have reproduced from their report, drops from 2017, 2021, 2025, \n2029, 2030. It takes until 2030 before it starts getting back. If the \nbill hadn't passed, GDP per capita would hopefully be going up.\n  This is way below what would happen, and this hurts Americans when \nper capita GNP is reduced. Everybody will feel that--maybe not the \nmasters of the universe in their suites out here that are nipping off \nextra profits because they have lower wages. It may not impact them. \nThey may make more money.\n  In fact, Professor Borjas at Harvard says the people who gain the \nmost from this immigration bill will be the people\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nwho hire the most low-wage workers because wages will go down. They \nwill make bigger profits, but the people who will be hurt are the \nvastly more numerous workers whose wages will go down.\n  This needs to be talked about. People seem to be in denial, but we \nhave to talk about that. I ask my colleagues to consider this as they \ndecide how to vote on this important piece of legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to \ntalk to an issue I have been speaking about for a couple of days. I \nmost certainly can appreciate the frustration of the Senator from \nAlabama and the Senator from Iowa.\n  The Senator from Alabama has been opposed to this bill from the \nbeginning. He may have a different view. I am not sure any amendments \nwould satisfy him, but of course he has been debating in good faith, \nand that is part of this process that needs to go on.\n  The Senator from Iowa has been working very hard. He has spent so \nmuch time both in the committee and on the floor trying to work out a \nbill he is comfortable with, but sometimes that happens and sometimes \nit doesn't.\n  I think what should happen, no matter what, is that after all the \ncontroversial issues are debated, there should be a coming together on \nboth sides at a certain time, recognizing that all time has expired, \nall probability of any serious negotiation on any bills or any \namendments that have to be voted on is over, and as friends and \npartners and as the leaders trying to move--appropriately and \nmaturely--forward, we could come together at least with a short list of \namendments that are completely uncontested and cleared on both sides. I \nam going to continue to ask for this because I think it will send a \nvery positive signal to people that even though things have broken down \nsome in the Senate, it is not completely broken.\n  To frame this issue so people can understand why I might be concerned \nis that there have been 800 amendments filed on this bill--300 in \ncommittee, about 150 of which were debated and voted on or dispensed \nwith, 500 filed on this floor. So in order for those amendments to get \nany consideration at all--which they haven't in any large measure--good \nwill has to prevail, and the good will flew out of this Chamber a long \ntime ago. I would like to get a little piece of it back. I wish I could \nget all of it back. I wish we would act as we did 4 or 5 or even 6 \nyears ago. It is not happening. Maybe it will.\n  I would like to begin to move in that direction by asking my \ncolleagues for consideration of a small group of amendments that, to \nour knowledge, have no opposition. I am going to read a few of those. \nSenator Grassley and his staff have been working on this. Senator Leahy \nand his staff have been working on this. I provided a list to Senator \nMcCain and to every Member of the Gang of 8. I am hoping we can salvage \nsome effort.\n  What people might not realize: When a major bill such as this is \nbeing debated, there is a lot more going on besides what they see in \ncommittee or what they hear on the floor. The evidence of that would be \nthat 800 amendments have been filed. Someone had to write all of those \n800 amendments. Staff worked very hard to think about ideas--not to \nderail the bill but to help the bill. No draft is perfect. Very smart \nstaffers and Members actually do read the text and come up with ideas \nto improve.\n  One in particular: I had a hearing in my Small Business Committee. I \nnotified the immigration subcommittee, Judiciary. We conducted our \nhearing with the blessing of the chair. We didn't talk about any of the \nmajor pieces of the legislation except for the one or two that talked \nabout small business. In all the discussion of major businesses needing \nskilled workers and major businesses and hotel chains, I thought maybe \nsomeone could gather some information about what small businesses might \nneed and maybe improve the bill.\n  I am supporting immigration reform. I think all Democratic Members--I \ndon't know of anyone who is not. There are some Republican Members who \nare not supporting the bill, but there are some who are. So one \namendment is requiring a mobile ap to be developed so a farmer, for \ninstance, or a person in a rural area who has either high-speed \nconnection or particularly wireless connection could pull up E-Verify \non their mobile ap. They wouldn't have to drive 200 miles, as in the \nPresiding Officer's State in North Dakota or South Dakota or Louisiana \nor Mississippi. We have areas that people are working hard, and they \nare not right next door to an Internet cafe. So one idea we had was for \nmobile aps. That is what one of these amendments is. Wouldn't that be a \nbig help? There is no one I know who is opposed to that. There are \nbillions of dollars in this bill. Some of it most certainly could be \nspent helping small businesses access better E-Verify.\n  There is another provision in this bill from Klobuchar, Landrieu, \nCoats, Blunt, Barrasso, and Enzi. This is as broad a coalition as could \nreflect broad-based support. Klobuchar is from Minnesota, Landrieu is \nfrom Louisiana, Coats is from Indiana, Blunt is from Missouri, Barrasso \nis from Wyoming, and we are Republicans and Democrats. I appreciate \nthat this amendment has been cleared by both sides, and it requires \ncertificates of citizenship and other Federal documents to reflect the \nname and date of birth determination made by State courts to help \nensure that name and date of birth changes for adopted children are \nreflected in Federal records.\n\n  We adopt about 100,000 children in America every year. I think these \nparents should be given our best efforts. These are parents who are \nadopting children domestically, keeping them off the streets, out of \nmental institutions, pouring their hearts and souls into helping raise \nchildren who others have either thrown away or given up. Yet we make it \ndifficult.\n  A few of us who work on this issue a lot know how things need to be \nfixed. This is a bill that comes to the floor. We think, gosh, this \nbill is not big enough to command its own attention on the Senate \nfloor, so we are going to prepare an amendment for when the immigration \nbill comes up and we hope the Members will allow it to go through.\n  I am not going to give up on my Members yet. I am going to remain \nvery optimistic and very hopeful that even Senators who are opposed to \nthis bill and have done everything they can to stop it or people \nopposed to the original draft who have done everything they can to \namend it--some of that has been successful, some of it has not been. \nBut I am hoping at the end of the day, even those who have been making \nthese great efforts will step back and understand and be respectful \nthat other work should go on as well. This amendment is an example.\n  There is another amendment that Senator Cochran and I have, amendment \nNo. 1383. It simply requires reports on the EB-5 visa program. The \nrequirement for reports is not in this bill. It is a program everyone \nhere is familiar with. It has many problems. The underlying bill fixes \nit, and I think to those of us supporting the bill, fixes it \nadequately. I am not sure what the opponents think. But there is no \nrequirement to report back to the committee so we can continue to \nmonitor this program. Because it has been so off-track in the past, \nlet's make sure we get it on-track in the future. This is just standard \nSenate operations. Unfortunately, we are now at a place in time in the \nhistory of the Senate, there are no standard operating procedures \nanymore, and it is a sad day.\n  There is another amendment that I understand has been completely \ncleared. Murray-Crapo amendment No. 1368 prohibits the use of restraint \non pregnant women in DHS detention facilities during labor and \nchildbirth except in extraordinary circumstances. Now, please, the \namendment simply would say you cannot shackle women during childbirth \nand labor. Is anyone on the Senate floor opposed to this? If so, please \nmake yourself known.\n  Nelson-Wicker is a very important amendment to Senator Wicker, who is \na Republican, and Senator Nelson, who is a Democrat. I am a cosponsor \nof this amendment, but it is Senator Nelson's amendment. I can't \nbelieve there would be anyone in this Chamber who would disagree. All \nit is saying is since we are spending now--and I might need to ask the \nSenator from Iowa to give\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\nme the final update on the number because the number keeps going up--if \nSenator Grassley would mind giving me the number--$46.3 billion on the \nsouthern border, California, Texas, New Mexico.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me correct that. That is money total to be spent, \nnot necessarily all on the border. But about $30 billion was added in \nthis amendment for the border.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So $30 billion on the land border, and it could be \nsomething between 30 and 46 and those numbers keep changing. But it is \na lot of money. Senator Nelson's amendment says that at least $1 \nbillion of that money be spent on maritime border security, not land \nborder. As he said so eloquently, if we continue to put up fences and \nborders on the land and make it secure--which we all want to do--there \nare maritime assets that need to be stepped up. I think most everybody \nunderstands that and would say that is a very good amendment.\n  These are amendments that don't need to be voted on. I am not asking \nfor votes on these amendments. They don't need to be voted on. They \nwould normally go by voice vote en bloc--no votes required. Out of the \n800 amendments, this list has less than 45 amendments that probably \ndon't need any vote, no time, just a simple--it is a consent. Staff has \nbeen given these and looked at these amendments.\n  I am going to continue to come to the floor today in hopes that after \nthe leaders negotiate on the contested amendments--and I have a list of \nthe contested amendments. It looks quite different than the list I am \ntalking about. The list that is being contested has names such as: \nVitter, Vitter, Vitter, Vitter, Vitter, Vitter, Vitter, Lee, Lee, Lee, \nLee, Cruz, Cruz, Cruz, Cruz, Cornyn, Cornyn, Cornyn, Cornyn. That is a \nlist. There is another list: Chambliss, Portman, Vitter, Inhofe, \nToomey, and Fischer. These lists are lists from Members who really \nbelieve they need to get a vote on their amendments. I would like them \nto get a vote. I am not opposed to them getting a vote.\n\n  What I am opposed to is this list which is not one Senator, it is \nnumbers of Senators who have worked very hard to get bipartisan support \nfor amendments that improve the underlying bill, which is going to \npass.\n  The bill is going to pass. It is either going to pass with 69 votes, \n72 votes, or 74 votes. There is no way this bill is not going to pass \nthe Senate. It is clear it is going to pass. People don't like that it \nis going to pass, but it is going to pass.\n  So before it passes, I am asking with all of my heart for the \nconsideration of amendments that have been brought by Democrats and \nRepublicans who have been working in good faith to make the bill better \nand to solve problems for our constituents. Our constituents are not \ntrying to negotiate on the number of Border Patrol agents. The Gang of \n8 did that. They are not trying to negotiate whether we are going to \nhave 40,000 or 80,000 Border Patrol agents. My constituents want help \nfor the kids they adopted. Some of these amendments are to get help for \nHolocaust survivors. There are only a few of them left in the world. We \nwould like to give some attention to them. Some of them spent 6 years, \n7 years, or 4 years in a prison camp, and this might help them to die \nin peace.\n  Madam President, I ask that there be order on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order, please. The Senate will be in order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I--as well as many colleagues--have gotten to the point \nwhere we would like to try to get back to a place where after all the \nfighting is over, all the yelling is done, all the posturing is done, \nall the message amendments are done, we could at least trust each other \nenough to have a consent package of items that would be helpful to the \npeople we represent. That is a simple request.\n  I will yield the floor. Others want to speak, but I will come back \nonce we have a clear list and again ask unanimous consent for these \namendments. But I will not do that now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  I want to give an update, not only to Senator Landrieu, but for all \nthe Senators. First of all, 10 days ago we started out with 27 \namendments that were noncontroversial--or supposedly noncontroversial. \nObviously, they were not all noncontroversial. That grew to 44 or 45, \nand I think we are back at 35 now on that list.\n  Remember, about 14 of those were included in the Hoeven-Corker \namendment. They were included in that for sweetener--to buy people off \nto get their votes on final passage. So there are 14 that will probably \nbe passed when we vote on final passage.\n  Last night my staff cleared 12 amendments, and that does not count \nseveral Republican amendments that were added to the list. We are \nmaking progress. Some are noncontroversial, but others are not. The one \nthat the Senator from Louisiana mentioned that appeared to her to be \nnoncontroversial, we suggested some technical changes to make it more \ndefinitive. If that is done, we can probably accept that.\n  Also, everyone has to remember that there are amendments on this list \nwhich are under the jurisdiction of other committees and not under the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. Some of the amendments were \nrejected for that reason. Some of the amendments are technical, but \nsome are more complicated.\n  I give my assurance to all of my colleagues that we will continue to \nwork on this list.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of whatever time is left \nwhen Senator Cornyn is done.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator from Texas yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would be glad to yield as long as it \ndoesn't come out of my 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank Senator Grassley for those \ncomments. I will continue to work with him in good faith on this list. \nI realize not all of these amendments are under the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee, so that is why we have been working with leaders \nof other committees that have jurisdiction over these amendments to \nhelp get them passed.\n  I appreciate my friend's work and will continue to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we have been on this bill for about 2\\1/\n2\\ weeks. We find ourselves in a very strange position where we have \nhad votes on 10 amendments, and now Senators are talking about clearing \nanother 45 amendments 2 days before the majority leader has basically \nset a deadline and said we are going to be through with this bill one \nway or the other. This strikes me as a strange way to do business, but \nhere we are.\n  I have always believed that even though you want something--and in \nthis case I believe virtually every Senator in this Chamber wants an \nimmigration bill--that you can want something so bad and be so \ndesperate that you will get a bad deal. I think we are beginning to see \nsome elements in this bill, which I want to talk about briefly, that I \nthink ought to give all of us pause and cause us to wonder whether this \nis the way we should be doing business.\n  One of the things my constituents in Texas found so infuriating about \nthe process of passing the Affordable Care Act--all 2,700 pages--was \nthe way there were backroom deals and various special interest \nboondoggles that helped garner the 60 votes necessary to pass ObamaCare \nback in 2010. Some of them became somewhat famous. There was the \n``Cornhusker kickback,'' ``Gator aid,'' and the ``Louisiana purchase.'' \nThey became symbols of Congress's irresponsibility when it came to \ndischarging our duties as Members of the Senate.\n  It is suggested that if, in fact, individual Members got sweeteners \nthat were sufficient to get their vote, that was the way we ought to be \ndoing business. Unfortunately, we are starting to see similar tactics \nbreak out here on this immigration issue, suggesting that some Members \nare so desperate to get a deal, any deal, they are willing to take a \nbad deal, one in which none of these standing alone would pass muster \nor scrutiny.\n  Immigration reform is a nationwide challenge, and immigration reform \nshould promote the national interests, not the special interests of \nindividual\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nSenators or any region or State or lobbying group. Yet when we look at \nthe underlying bill, I see a litany of de facto earmarks, carve-outs, \nand pet spending initiatives. Because we have been in such a rush since \nlast Friday to move to the designated deadline the majority leader has \nset for this bill, there may be many Members who are unfamiliar with \nthese special carve-outs, de facto earmarks, and pet spending \ninitiatives. I want to talk about a few of them.\n  The bill directs $250 million from the comprehensive immigration \nreform trust fund to boost immigration-related prosecutions in a single \nsector. There are nine Border Patrol sectors, but the Tucson sector is \nthe surprise beneficiary of $250 million in a special earmark in this \nbill.\n  I have a simple question: Don't all of the border sectors need \nincreased funding for prosecutions? Well, I believe the answer is yes. \nSo I believe carving out the Tucson sector for special treatment is \nentirely inappropriate. So we see that even longtime opponents of \nearmarks are now cosponsoring legislation that is filled with de facto \nearmarks, including one that benefits their State alone. We wouldn't \nsee this sort of thing, I believe, if we had a stand-alone bill. But \nthey have jammed that in here in order to get the maximum number of \nvotes. We have seen strange things happen.\n\n  This bill also creates a bureaucracy to determine which occupational \ncategory should be prioritized under the new guest worker program. \nHowever, it requires a new bureaucracy to automatically designate \nAlaska seafood processing as a shortage occupation that receives \nspecial treatment. We might as well call this the Alaska Seafood \nSpecial.\n  I will mention one more boondoggle, and that is the jobs for youth \npet program, which authorizes $1.5 billion to expand an Obama stimulus \nprogram that could conceivably be used to give free cars, motorcycles, \nscooters, and other vehicles to young people who participate. I am \nreferring to page 1,182 of the jobs for youth amendment. It is title V \nunder the bill, which says: The funds made available under this section \nmay be used to provide supportive services, such as transportation or \nchildcare, that is necessary to enable the participation of such youth \nin the opportunities.\n  So I believe this is an open-ended invitation to take this $1.5 \nbillion and use it for purposes that many of us would cringe at if we \nreally understood it.\n  I want to make two final points about the spending in the bill. \nFirst, we are going to be asked to waive all 11 budget points of order \nunder the bill at a time when there is bipartisan concern about our \nfiscal standing, at a time when our debt is $17 trillion. I think we \nhave been pretty good recently in not waiving budget points of order. I \nbelieve we are recognizing on a bipartisan basis that it is important \nwe hold the line against increased deficit spending and increased debt. \nBut we are going to be asked to vote to essentially violate our own \npay-go rules in waiving the budget points of order, busting the \nJudiciary Committee's spending limit, and to designate certain spending \nas emergency spending even though it is obviously not emergency \nspending. So much for fiscal responsibility.\n  Supporters of the underlying bill continue to argue that this \nlegislation will actually reduce the Federal deficit. It is a bizarre \nsituation where we can spend almost $50 billion and claim that it \nactually reduces the deficit, but that is the argument. Yet, as I \nexplained on Monday, the only way we can transform this bill into a \ndeficit reduction bill is by double counting more than $211 billion \nworth of Social Security revenue. In other words, the money paid in in \nterms of Social Security taxes is eventually going to have to be paid \nout in benefits, and they can't say we will pay it out in benefits and \nthen also use that surplus to fund the underlying bill because that is \ndouble counting.\n  Indeed, the bill assumes the very same pot of money can be used to \nfund new spending initiatives and fund these future Social Security \nbenefits, but only in Washington can we get away with such magical \naccounting techniques. In the real world this bill actually increases \nthe Federal Government's on-budget deficit over the next 10 years.\n  I am just suggesting that in our rush to get a bill we are making \nconcessions we ordinarily would not make on stand-alone legislation, \nwhether it is in these sweetener provisions, the de facto earmarks, \nspecial carve-outs, or by double counting revenue. But to add it all \nup, we are left with a bill that is chock-full of de facto earmarks, \nporkbarrel spending, and special interest sweeteners. This is a bill \nthat increases the on-budget deficit but fails to guarantee a border \nthat is secure and offers only promises, which historically Congress \nhas been very bad about keeping.\n  Does that sound like real immigration reform? I know we can do \nbetter, and I know we must do better if we are ever going to solve our \nbiggest immigration problems.\n  Again, I would love to support an immigration reform bill. \nUnfortunately, the way this bill is shaping up, I cannot and will not. \nMy hope is that the House of Representatives will take up this issue on \na step-by-step basis and in smaller increments so people can actually \nread and understand it. By working through this issue in the House, \neventually they will be able to come up with a conference committee \nthat will produce a responsible immigration reform bill, one that \ndoesn't offer de facto earmarks and various sweeteners to people who \nsupport it, but one which will stand on its own merits and will not \nbust the budget by double counting Social Security funds paid into the \nbill in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, it is my understanding that Senator \nLeahy is yielding time--or maybe it is Senator Landrieu who is yielding \ntime. Somebody is yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I want to speak today on the amendment. \nI know the Senator from Texas, my friend and someone I respect, made \nnumerous comments about the bill. But actually the vote we have today \nis about the border security amendment that has been negotiated and a \nlot of people have worked on. I know some of his comments refer to some \nportions of the amendment. Mostly, he was talking about the bill \nitself.\n  The issue before us today is the border security amendment the \nSenator from North Dakota and myself and many others worked on. I want \nto put this in context, if I can. Fifteen days ago in the Republican \ncaucus at what we call our conference lunch, there was a discussion \nabout the ways of trying to make this immigration bill better. The \nSenator from North Dakota had a base bill dealing with border security, \nand many of us at the time said what we could do is take a base border \nsecurity amendment, expand it, and try to accommodate many of the \ndesires of people in our caucus with other provisions in it that many \nSenators here in this body wanted to see happen. Two Fridays ago, we \nactually had about 12 offices come together for a meeting to talk about \nmany of those attributes they felt would make this bill better. So over \ntime we developed a 115-page amendment--some people say 119-page \namendment--dealing with not just border security but many issues people \nin this body thought would make this bill better.\n  There has been some dispute about the size of this amendment; I know \nwe have had some discussion from people on the floor. It is unfortunate \nthat sometimes people will come to the Senate floor and say things that \nare a little over the top in order to make a point. But I will note \nthat today some of my friends on my side of the aisle received multiple \nPinocchios, if you will, from a very well-respected publication, \nbecause the fact is the amendment is as we have said.\n  Because of the rules of construction in the Senate, when we add a \n119- or 115-page amendment to a 1,100-page bill and we intersperse the \namendment throughout it, no doubt we come up with a 1,200-page bill, if \nyou will. The fact is, 1,100 of those pages we have had since April. \nThey have been through committee. People offered amendments. So let me \nsay I think the amendment size issue has been totally rebutted. I would \nsay the Senator from\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\nNorth Dakota and myself have certainly carried the day on that issue. I \nthink it is a fact now. We understand the size.\n  We know this amendment has some things in it other than border \nsecurity. That was part of the process in getting to a place where we \nenhanced the bill.\n  Some people are talking about the cost, and my friend from Texas was \njust speaking. If my colleagues noticed--and it is very important \naround here to listen--he talked about on-budget costs. First of all, \neverybody in this body knows the problem we have in America today is \nthe off-budget items and that our entitlement programs are what are \ndriving the huge deficits we have in this Nation. So it is the \nentitlement issues most people who speak about deficit reduction are \nfocused on because we have done so much already on what we call the \ndiscretionary side, which is the on-budget piece.\n  CBO has scored this bill and basically they have said--not basically, \nthey have said if this bill were to pass, when we take into account the \nentitlements and we take into account the discretionary spending, which \nis what is called on-budget, we will reduce the deficit by $197 \nbillion. One of the main reasons that is the case is when immigrants \nmove into what is called the temporary status, they pay in for 10 \nyears, and one of the toughest provisions in this bill is they cannot \nreceive any benefits for 10 years. Think about that. We have this huge \namount of money that is going to be coming into the Social Security \nProgram and coming into the Medicare Program which, candidly, helps \npeople in this Nation because it makes those programs more solvent.\n  We have to listen to the words here. Let's think about it when people \ntalk about the cost of this border security amendment. Yes, it costs \n$46 billion to implement these items--which, by the way, almost every \nRepublican has championed for years, all of the items in this border \nsurge, if you will--but it costs $46 billion. I will tell my colleagues \nI have been here 6\\1/2\\ years and I would put my credentials on \nfocusing on deficit issues with anyone in this body. I have never had \nan opportunity to vote for a bill that cost $46 billion over a 10-year \nperiod but generated $197 billion into the Treasury without raising \nanybody's taxes and, I might add, also generating economic growth for \nour country. So I want to debunk that. This is a tremendous opportunity \nfor us to actually reduce our deficit while, at the same time, securing \nour border.\n  People are talking about process--and I am coming to the end here. It \nis interesting to me that the very people, I hate to say it, on my side \nof the aisle who have been raising cain, if you will, about the fact \nthere aren't enough amendments are the very people who are objecting to \namendments being offered.\n  Look, this is the old game that is played around here: Well, we think \nwe ought to have 35 amendments. We think we ought to have--but somebody \non my side is objecting. Most people in the country don't understand \nthat in the Senate we have something called unanimous consent, and if \none Senator disagrees, it cannot happen--one Senator. So we have had \nthis situation going back and forth where we have tried to have \namendments. I agree, let's have amendments. There is one amendment in \nparticular I wish we could vote on and pass. I would love to see it. \nBut guess what. I want everybody to know the very people who are saying \nthey want to have more amendments are objecting to more amendments. So \nunderstand what is happening here on the Senate floor.\n  There will be some people who say, Well, I am going to vote against \nthis because of the process. I want America to understand what is \nhappening in this body right now. As a matter of fact, I don't know if \nit is true, but my understanding was the other side was actually going \nto agree to 35 amendments, and people heard that and they said: Well, \nmy gosh, they might accept 35 amendments. Go down there and file more \namendments because we are afraid they are actually going to agree to \nwhat it is we are asking for. So we will see.\n  Let me close with this: Nobody in this body can say the amendment we \nare voting on today does not do anything someone can imagine relative \nto border security. My good friend from Texas spent a lot of time \ndrafting a border security bill that had 5,000 Border Patrol agents. \nThis one has 20,000--20,000 Border Patrol agents. This amendment calls \nfor 20,000 Border Patrol agents. It doubles the number of Border Patrol \nagents on our southern border.\n  We are adding $4.5 billion worth of technology that the chief of \nborder control has been trying to get for years, bought and paid for in \nthis bill.\n  We are adding an entry-exit visa program that has to be fully in \nplace.\n  We are adding E-Verify for every employer in the country.\n  We are also adding 350 miles of fencing.\n  People are saying: Well, we don't know if this will ever happen. My \ncolleagues should read the triggers. If it doesn't happen, nobody gets \na green card, and every American can see whether this happened.\n  Then people are saying, Well, on the fencing piece--nobody, by the \nway, debates the 20,000 Border Patrol; nobody debates E-Verify; nobody \ndebates entry-exit; nobody debates the $4.5 billion in technology. But \nthen people are saying, Well, wait a minute. On the fencing piece, \nthough, the Homeland Security Secretary can decide where it goes. Well, \nmy friends in good government--and I happen to be with one of those--\nyes, it does say she can decide in section 5 of the bill which places \nwork best.\n\n  We know the people from Texas don't even want a fence. People in \nArizona wish to have a fence. But it still says under the triggers--and \npeople are trying to malign and trying to fool people all out across \nAmerica because they know what is getting ready to happen. The fact is, \nwithout the 350 miles ironclad, in place, there is no green card. So \nall five provisions have to be in place.\n  I know people try to spin things when they get on television and they \ntry to say things to confuse America. What I would say to America is \nread the bill. I think Americans would be proud of border security, \nwhich brings me to a close here today.\n  Here is what I want to say: On the procedural vote that took place 2 \ndays ago, every single Democrat voted to end debate on this border \nsecurity measure. We had 15 Republicans who voted for it. The process \nissue is behind us and today we are voting on the amendment itself. I \ndon't know how any Republican can look a TV camera or a constituent in \nthe eye and not say this amendment strengthens--surges--on the border \nand makes our border more secure. So if, for some reason, Republicans \ncome to the floor today--a majority of Republicans--and they vote \nagainst this border security amendment, what is going to happen is the \nDemocrats are going to own the border security issue, and basically \nRepublicans--whose constituents I think in some cases care more about \nthis issue than many people on the other side--will be giving up this \nissue.\n  I don't know how any Republican can go back home and say to their \nconstituents: I voted against adding Border Patrol agents and I voted \nagainst adding a fence on the southern border and I voted against an E-\nVerify system and I voted against an exit-entry program and I voted \nagainst the technology our Border Patrol chief wants. I voted against \nit because I didn't like the process. I voted against it because this \nbill has been before us now for over 2 months and I had a chance to \nmake amendments in the Judiciary Committee and I had a chance to make \namendments on the floor but, candidly, I didn't want that to happen, so \nI kept that from occurring.\n  I would ask my friends: Please, today is about an amendment to a bill \nthat makes it stronger. My colleagues may not like every provision, but \nwe cannot look folks in the eye back home and say this isn't something \nthat those who care about border security would know surges the border, \nmakes this country safer, and I would say makes this bill a much \nstronger bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I hope my good friend and great partner \nfrom the State of North Dakota will make some comments.\n  I wish to thank Senator Leahy from Vermont for his generosity with \ntime this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nSenator from North Dakota, and I ask unanimous consent that the last 5 \nminutes be reserved for the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, and I wish to particularly thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom the State of Tennessee for all of his work on this border surge \namendment. That is what we are talking about: a border surge amendment. \nThe amendment we have offered, Hoeven-Corker, is about securing the \nborder first. As the good Senator from Tennessee described, that is \nabsolutely the focus of what we are doing here.\n  We are willing to work with everybody on both sides of the aisle in \nthis body and in the House to come up with legislation that secures the \nborder. We believe that is what Americans want. That is what we are \nworking so hard to do.\n  What I would like to start with, though, this morning in terms of my \ncomments is this budget point of order we are going to be voting on in \na few minutes. I would like to cite right from the Congressional Budget \nOffice report. So I am going to just take facts, statistics right out \nof the CBO report because, as the good Senator from Tennessee explained \na minute ago, so much of this is getting either misunderstood or \nmisinterpreted. So let's get right to the CBO report, and let's look at \nexactly what it says.\n  According to CBO, it is clear that this legislation will reduce our \ndeficit. The CBO report shows that in the first decade there is $197 \nbillion provided from this legislation that we can use for deficit \nreduction--less, obviously, as Senator Corker just explained so well a \nminute ago, as we are putting significant resources into securing the \nborder. So if you take out that additional $40 billion that our \namendment costs to make sure we secure the border, to make sure we have \nthe E-Verify system, to make sure we have electronic entry and exit at \nall of our international airports and seaports--deduct that $40 \nbillion, that is $157 billion that we have available in the first \ndecade and, according to CBO, in the second decade, $700 billion. So \nthat is about $850 billion over the next two decades that is available \nto help us reduce the deficit, and that is after putting the five \ntriggers in place that we provide in this legislation to secure the \nborder first.\n  That means a comprehensive southern border strategy: 20,000 \nadditional Border Patrol agents; 700 miles of fence in total--350 in \naddition to the 350 we have; a national mandatory E-Verify system; and \nelectronic entry and exit identification must be in place, as I said, \nat all international airports and seaports. These things must be done \nupfront. These triggers must be met and illegal immigrants must be in \nprovisional status for 10 years before anyone can get green cards, \nother than DREAMers or some blue card ag workers. So the cost of border \nenforcement is paid for, and we still have $850 billion available for \ndeficit reduction.\n  So you might ask, well, why the budget point of order, then? Why the \nbudget point of order when we are trying to get the debt and the \ndeficit under control? Well, the budget point of order goes to the \namount of dollars coming in on-budget and off-budget. What do we mean \nby off-budget? That means entitlement programs. So the amount of \ndollars coming in do not match up with what is exactly in the budget, \nnow both on-budget and off-budget. But that is understandable, isn't \nit?\n  This is new significant legislation, so of course we have to adjust \nthe on-budget and the off-budget to account for this $850 billion we \ndid not have before. OK--almost $1 trillion now that we have. OK. So of \ncourse we have to make some adjustments.\n  So the real question here, the real question on this budget point of \norder is, Would you rather have $850 billion available to reduce the \ndeficit or would you rather not have it? Because if you do not pass the \nlegislation, you do not get the $850 billion in funds to help with \ndeficit reduction. That is, if you will, kind of the bottom line here, \nisn't it?\n  Now, it is true, as I say, we have to adjust our budget categories, \nbut overall, CBO scoring--after paying for an incredible amount of \nadditional resources to secure the border first--$850 billion over the \nnext two decades.\n  Also, this funding strengthens entitlement programs. Right. Why? \nBecause the funding we are talking about is paid into Social Security \nand Medicare. CBO shows that in both the first decade and the second \ndecade more is paid into those programs to make them solvent. But \nopponents say: Well, yes, sure. More is paid in, but those payers \nsomeday are going to get benefits, so they are going to take it out. \nBut CBO shows that the amount being paid in is more than the benefits \nbeing paid out and that the amount is on a growth trajectory, not the \nreverse, meaning more is paid in in the second decade than the first \ndecade, so we make those programs even more solvent, and it gets us on \nthe right trajectory. That is why we should defeat the budget point of \norder--because, quite simply, we want the $850 billion to help reduce \nthe deficit. That is the real issue we are dealing with.\n  Also, I want to take a minute again to address the GDP, GNP, wages, \nand unemployment. Again, I want to quote from the CBO because I really \nbelieve these things are getting misinterpreted.\n  GDP--gross domestic product--in the first decade grows 3.3 percent \nmore with the legislation. In the second decade, it grows 5.4 percent \nmore. OK. GNP--gross national product--per capita in the first 10 \nyears, 0.7 of 1 percent less, it is true, in the first decade, but \nafter that we get more GNP. So long term, more GDP, more GNP.\n  Unemployment. This talk about increasing unemployment--0.1 of 1 \npercent in the first 6 years, as you adjust. After that, there is no \ndifference in unemployment.\n  The same thing with wages--initially 0.1 of 1 percent lower because \nyou have immigrants coming in who earn a lower wage, but over time, in \nthe second 10 years, wages go up. OK.\n  What is my point? The point is that for all of these categories, in \nall four of these categories, we do as well or better--as well or \nbetter--over the long run. Isn't that what we want?\n  I will summarize.\n  The first order of business for immigration reform is to secure the \nborder. Americans want immigration reform--of that there is no doubt. \nBut they want us to get it right, and that means securing the border \nfirst.\n  Our amendment, as the Senator from Tennessee said, is 119 new pages--\nnot 1,200. Madam President, 1,100 is in the base bill. That has been \nout here since May.\n  Our amendment secures the border with five tough provisions or \ntriggers that must be met before green cards are allowed. We have \ntalked about that. A comprehensive, high-tech plan on the southern \nborder must be in place: 20,000 Border Patrol agents, a total of 700 \nmiles of fence--things our colleagues on our side of the aisle have \nbeen asking for are here--a national, mandatory E-Verify system, \nelectronic entry and exit at international airports and seaports. That \nis about securing the border first. That is what this amendment is \nabout. It is objective, and it is verifiable. That is what the \ntechnology on the border--$4.5 billion in technology for sensors, \nradars drones, helicopters, planes--that is what it is all about, so we \nknow we have the border secured.\n  So we ask our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with us. \nLet's rise up. Let's meet this challenge for the American people, and \nlet's address border security. That is what this legislation does.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Hoeven-Corker amendment is subject to \na budget point of order because it increases the net on-budget deficit \nover both the 5- and 10-year periods and exceeds the Judiciary \nCommittee's allocation for direct spending. But on-budget effects do \nnot take into account the significant off-budget savings.\n  Last week the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that \nour bill is going to help us achieve nearly $1 trillion in deficit \nreduction. We have also learned that the Hoeven-Corker amendment would \nsignificantly increase our border security, and, as the CBO said and as \nmy friends from Tennessee and North Dakota have said, the\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\namendment would reduce both illegal entry into the country and the \nnumber of people who stay in the country beyond the end of their \nauthorized period.\n  So when we vote on waiving the point of order, I will vote to waive \nit because the Hoeven-Corker amendment and the overall amendment will \nspur job growth and will dramatically reduce our deficit.\n  Then we are going to vote on the substitute. The substitute is the \nproduct of many months of hard work and bipartisan collaboration in a \nvery transparent process. No one should oppose the cloture motion on \nthe committee-reported substitute, as amended.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee held lengthy and extensive public \nmarkup sessions to consider the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, \nand Immigration Modernization Act, S. 744. This was after a couple \ndozen hearings over the last few Congresses. We did it in as \ntransparent a way as possible.\n  Madam President, over 300 first-degree amendments were filed. We had \nthem online for a week and a half before the Senate Judiciary Committee \neven took up the bill.\n  Over the course of 3 weeks, we debated the bill for nearly 40 hours. \nWe often worked late into the evening. That was online. That was \nstreamed. That was open to everybody. And certainly the thousands and \nthousands and thousands of e-mails that came in from all over the \ncountry showed people were watching.\n  The committee considered a total of 212 amendments--we had 212 \namendments during that time--136 of which were adopted. Every member of \nthe committee--Democratic or Republican--who filed amendments to the \nlegislation was afforded the opportunity to offer multiple amendments. \nNearly every member of the committee, in both parties, who offered an \namendment had an amendment adopted. All but three of the amendments \nadopted passed on a bipartisan vote, and the committee reported the \nlegislation by a bipartisan vote of 13 to 5.\n  So, as I said, the public witnessed what we did. They saw us streamed \nlive on the committee's Web site. They saw broadcasts on C-SPAN. All \nour amendments were posted, and as we had developments, they were \nreported in real time. Members from both sides of the aisle praised the \ntransparent process and the significant improvements to the bill made \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  Let me also compliment the ranking Republican on the committee, the \nsenior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. We were on different sides of \nthe legislation, but we worked very well together. We talked numerous \ntimes throughout the whole markup to make sure it would go. He would \ncome to me at times when some of their members had to be out for one \nreason or another--other committees--and we worked around that. We made \nsure everything went--we made sure neither side was surprised. I \nappreciate the cooperation I received from Senator Grassley. I think it \nis one of the reasons we could actually show the Senate the way the \nSenate is supposed to work.\n  I hope colleagues will vote for the committee-reported substitute, as \namended.\n  This is one of our Nation's toughest problems, but we were not \nelected to do easy things. In fact, if all we had were easy things, I \ndo not know why anybody would want to be in the Senate. We were \nelected, the men and women of this body, from all over the country--\nfrom both parties, with philosophical differences--and we are supposed \nto fix our Nation's toughest problems.\n  We are on the eve of coming one step closer to fixing our Nation's \nbroken immigration system. I hope the vast majority of Senators will \nvote yes. There has been a great deal of work on this. Is this bill \nperfect? No. Is any bill perfect? No. Is this much better than what we \nhave today? Yes. Is it exactly the bill I would have written? No. It is \nnot the bill Senator Grassley would have written. It is not the bill \nany one of us individually would have written. But we are not a \nmonarchy. We are not a dictatorship of one. We have 100 people here \nrepresenting over 300 million Americans, and we are supposed to mold, \nas best as possible, the sentiments and needs of those 300 million \nAmericans but also the aspirations of those who would be Americans, \nlike my grandparents and my wife's parents and even Members of this \nbody.\n  So, Madam President, I hope that, one, we will waive the budget point \nof order and then, secondly, we will vote for the amendment, as with \nthe substitute.\n  I believe we are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will use leader time so I can talk. We \nare going to be in a vote in a few minutes to waive the Budget Act, and \nthen we are going to have two more. One is on the adoption of the Leahy \namendment, as modified, and then a cloture vote on the committee-\nreported substitute amendment.\n  I mentioned on the floor this morning the work done by the Gang of \n8--extremely important. As I indicated at that time, as I look at the \nRepublicans and Democrats who did this, I do not know of anything in it \nfor them politically. It was done because they believed the immigration \nsystem is broken and broken badly and needed some repair work. They did \na remarkably good job.\n  But I would like to add to that the junior Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. Corker, and Senator Hoeven. What they have done to help us with \nthis bill is remarkably important and good. Could we have passed this \nwithout them? Maybe. But the point is that they have strengthened this \nlegislation. When I worked on it 7 years ago, the issue was always, is \nthere going to be a secure border? What they have done is made that \nwithout any question a fact. So I admire what they have done--again, \nnot for any political benefit because, as I look, I doubt they will get \nany from this, but they will get the benefit of doing what they believe \nis right for our country. I appreciate that. History will indicate that \nI am right. Maybe in the short term it may not be, but history will \nindicate, when the books are written, that these two good men allowed \nus to do something that is important for our country.\n  What if we did not fix this broken immigration system today, in 2013, \nthis week? What would the future be for this country? No. 1, as we have \nsaid, the security of this Nation would be not as good as it would have \nbeen had we passed this bill. Secondly, the economic security of this \ncountry would be not nearly as good as it will be if we pass this bill. \nA $1 trillion debt will be reduced in this country.\n  So I admire all of these Senators for the good work they have done \nfor the country. I know we have been working for the last couple of \nweeks and very intensely for the last couple of days to come up with a \nlist of amendments. I have people on my side of the aisle who are very \ninterested in having a vote on their amendments. I even have had a \nnumber of Republican colleagues come to me and say: You have to do \nsomething to allow us to have some amendments. We have tried very hard \nto do that, but I have to say, honestly, I am not really happy with \nwhat has taken place since I have left here last night and got here \nthis morning because we are going backward, not frontward. So I hope \nthat when we get these three votes out of the way, people agree. Let's \ndo the possible. There is a way we can come up with some amendments. I \nunderstand both sides want their amendments heard and voted on; they \nare important to them. If it is important to them, it should be \nimportant to us. So we are going to continue to work on that to see if \nwe can come up with a list of amendments.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention, together with the 10 Senators \nI have already talked about, the chairman of the committee. We would \nnot be where we are without a fair, open markup. That is not the way it \nalways is around here. This man is the President pro tempore of the \nSenate. He is the chairman of the committee. He has a lot of power. He \ncould run that committee any way he wants. That is the way it is here. \nHe did. He ran it the way it should be run. I admire and appreciate the \nwork he has done.\n  So let's get these votes out of the way, see if we can come up with a \nlist of amendments, something we can work on. Each side is going to \nhave to give a little.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the second and third votes in this \nseries be\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n10 minutes in duration and that there be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Americans want immigration reform, but they want border security \nfirst, and that is exactly what this amendment does. It secures the \nborder with five tough provisions or triggers that must be met--that \nmust be met--before green cards are allowed. Those five triggers are: a \ncomprehensive southern border strategy that must be deployed and \noperational, 20,000 additional Border Patrol agents, a total of 700 \nmiles of fence, a national mandatory E-Verify system must be in place, \nand electronic entry and exit identification must be in place at all \ninternational airports and seaports.\n  Simply put, this is about making sure we secure the border, and we do \nit in an objective and verifiable way.\n  I want to thank all of my cosponsors on this legislation, and turn to \nthe good Senator from Tennessee and thank him for his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this grand compromise makes false \npromises to the American people and throws money at the border, but \nthere is no accountability to get the job done. We need to see the \nresults, but the only result we are being assured of is legalization--\nlegalization first, border security later.\n  On top of all the earmarks that are in this amendment, the grand \ncompromise also has a grand plan for spending taxpayers' dollars, and \nwe have to raid the Social Security trust fund to get it.\n  The American people expect us to get this right. This amendment is \nthe wrong answer. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CORKER.

Mr. President, we have been talking about a couple of \nthings, including the schedule. We are moving forward. This vote \nsuggests it is obvious that a very large and bipartisan majority of the \nSenate will support an immigration bill. I know there have been \nproposals for amendments. I am not going to make a proposal at this \ntime. I will leave that for the leader. There have been efforts to get \na finite number of amendments from both Republicans and Democrats so we \ncan vote. Under normal circumstances, we would probably have voice \nvotes on some of those amendments. I hope we can do that because I \nthink we would be able to complete this immigration bill.\n  Our staffs have a great deal of work to do in putting everything \ntogether. The staffs on both sides of the aisle have worked long hours. \nThey have been here working even after the rest of us have left. After \nthis is completed, maybe they can actually have some time with their \nfamilies and prepare for this great Nation's celebration next week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue \nto speak for 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Supreme Court Ruling\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Supreme Court struck down section \n3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. I think that helped this Nation take \na major step toward full equality. The ruling confirms my belief that \nthe Constitution protects the rights of all Americans--not just some \nbut all of us--and that no one should suffer from discrimination based \non who they love. I share the joy of those families who had their \nrights vindicated today, including many legally married couples in my \nhome State of Vermont. I have already heard from many and the joy they \nhave expressed is so overwhelming.\n  In August, my wife Marcelle and I will celebrate our 51st wedding \nanniversary. Our marriage is so fundamental to our lives that it is \ndifficult for me to imagine how it would feel to have the government \nrefuse to acknowledge it. Without her love and support over the past 51 \nyears, there is nothing I could have ever accomplished that would have \nbeen noteworthy in my life. It has taken the joining together of two \npeople who love each other.\n  Today we have thousands of gay and lesbian individuals and families \nacross the country who have had their rights vindicated by the Supreme \nCourt's decision, including the same rights Marcelle and I have had for \n51 years.\n  Despite today's historic ruling, there are still injustices in our \nFederal laws that discriminate against these married couples. I will \ncontinue to work with Senator Feinstein on legislative fixes to protect \nall families.\n  As we continue to fight for equality and against discrimination in \nour Nation's laws, I am hopeful today's ruling will address a serious \ninjustice. By just striking down section 3 of the Defense of Marriage \nAct, the Supreme Court has pronounced that our Federal laws cannot \ndiscriminate against individuals based on who they love. I believe this \nshould extend to our immigration laws as well.\n\n  Last month I was forced to make one of the most difficult decisions \nin my 38 years as a Senator when I withdrew my amendment that would \nhave provided equality in our immigration laws by ensuring that all \nAmericans--all Americans--may sponsor their lawful spouse for \ncitizenship. It was one of the most disappointing moments of my 38 \nyears in the Senate, but I took Republicans, many who spoke in good \nfaith, at their word that they would abandon their own efforts to \nreform the Nation's immigration laws if my amendment had been adopted. \nI believed what they said, and I withdrew it.\n  However, with the Supreme Court's decision today, it appears the \nantidiscrimination principle I have long advocated will apply to our \nimmigration laws, and binational couples and their families can now be \nunited under the law. As a result of this very welcome decision, I will \nnot be seeking a floor vote on my amendment.\n  Today's decision should be seen as a victory for all of those who \nsupport justice, equality, and family values.\n  I had the privilege of serving with a wonderful Senator from Vermont \nwhen I first came here, Robert Stafford. He was ``Mr. Republican'' in \nour State. When we were debating the question of same-sex marriage in \nthe Vermont Legislature, Senator Stafford said: If we have two people \nwho love each other and make each other better--two Vermonters who love \neach other and make each other better because of that love--what \ndifference does it make to us whether they are the same sex or not? \nVermont is better because they make it better.\n  I agree with him. There is still important work to be done so all \nfamilies are protected under our Federal laws. Until we fully achieve \nthe motto engraved in Vermont marble above the Supreme Court building \nthat declares ``equal justice under the law,'' I will continue to fight \nfor the equal treatment of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, over the last few days I have received \nnumerous e-mails and calls from conservatives and tea party activists \nfrom across the country regarding immigration. Their opinions really \nmatter to me because they were with me 3 years ago when so many people \nin Washington--and in Florida, for that matter--thought I had no chance \nto win my election.\n  Let me say these people are patriots. They are Americans from all \nwalks of life who are deeply concerned about the direction our country \nis headed, and they are increasingly unhappy about the immigration \nreform proposal in the Senate. It is not because they are ``anti-\nimmigrant'' as some like to say, and it is not because they are closed-\nminded. They believe, as do I, that as a sovereign country, we have a \nright to secure our borders and we have a right to have immigration \nlaws to enforce them.\n  They are increasingly opposed to this effort because for over three \ndecades and despite many promises to enforce the law, the Federal \nGovernment, under both Republicans and Democrats, has failed to do so.\n  In the end, it is not just immigration reform itself that worries \nthem; it is the government that has failed them so many times before. \nThey realize we have a legal immigration system that needs reform. They \nrealize we have over 11 million people currently living in our country \nillegally and that we have to deal with them. They just simply believe \nno matter what law we\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\npass, we cannot trust the Federal Government to ever actually enforce \nit.\n  This sentiment was best summed up for me in an e-mail I received from \nSharon Calvert, a prominent tea party leader in Tampa, FL. She wrote:\n\n       Today, June 2013, we are in a very different political \n     climate than we were after the last election. We are in a \n     political climate of distrust. Distrust of government and \n     elected representatives is at its highest.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Do we want to trust this administration to faithfully \n     enforce a bill to the best interests of all Americans with a \n     bill that few have read?\n\n  She makes a powerful point.\n  After finding out that the IRS investigates people based on their \npolitical views, all the questions that remain about Benghazi, and \nseeing the Justice Department target reporters, trust in the Federal \nGovernment is rightfully at an all-time low.\n  I share this skepticism about this administration and Washington in \ngeneral. In just the 2 years I have been here, I have seen the games \nplayed and the promises broken and how the American people ultimately \nsuffer the consequences. That is exactly what led me to get involved in \nthis issue in the first place.\n  We have a badly broken legal immigration system--not only one that \ndoes not work; it actually encourages illegal immigration. We have a \nborder with Mexico that, despite billions of dollars already spent, is \nstill not secured. Every day, people, drugs, and guns are trafficked \nacross the border, and we have 11 million people living in this country \nillegally in de facto amnesty.\n  What I am describing is the way things are now. This is the status \nquo, and it is a terrible mess. It is hurting our country terribly, and \nunless we do something about it, this administration isn't going to fix \nit.\n  Political pundits love to focus on the politics of all this, but for \nme this isn't about catering to any group for political gain. \nPredictably, despite all the work we have done on immigration reform, \nsome so-called ``pro-immigrant'' groups continue to protest me daily.\n  This isn't about winning points from the establishment or the \nmainstream media either, by the way. No matter how consistent I have \nbeen in focusing on the border security aspects of reform, whenever I \nhave spoken about it the beltway media has accused me of trying to \nundermine or walk away from this reform.\n  This isn't about becoming a Washington dealmaker. Truthfully, it \nwould have been a lot easier to just sit back, vote against any \nproposal, and give speeches about how I would have done it differently.\n  Finally, this certainly isn't about gaining support for future \noffice. Many conservative commentators and leaders--people whom I \ndeeply respect and with whom I agree on virtually every other issue--\nare disappointed about my involvement in this debate.\n  I got involved in this issue for one simple reason: I ran for office \nto try to fix things that are hurting this special country. In the end, \nthat is what this is about for me--trying to fix a serious problem that \nfaces America.\n  The proposal before the Senate is by no means perfect. As does any \nproposal that will come before the Senate, it has flaws; but it also \nhas important reforms that conservatives have been trying to get for \nyears. For example, it changes our legal immigration system from a \npredominantly family-based system of chain migration to a merit-based \nsystem that focuses on job skills.\n  This proposal mandates the most ambitious border and interior \nsecurity measures in our Nation's history. For example, it requires and \nfunds the completion of 700 miles of real border fence. It adds 20,000 \nnew border agents. It details a specific technology plan for each \nsector of the border. It requires E-Verify for every employer in \nAmerica. And it creates a tracking system to identify people who \noverstay their visas.\n  These are all things that at a minimum must happen before those in \nthe country illegally can apply for permanent status. And the proposal \ndeals with those who are here illegally in a reasonable but responsible \nway. Right now, those here illegally are living in de facto amnesty. \nThis is what I mean by that: They are unregistered, many pay no taxes, \nand few will ever have to pay a price for having violated our laws.\n  Under this bill they will have to come forward. They will have to \npass background checks. They will have to pay a fine. They will have to \nstart paying taxes. They will be ineligible for welfare, for food \nstamps, and for ObamaCare.\n  In return, the only thing they get is a temporary work permit, and \nthey can't renew it in 6 years unless they can prove they have been \nholding a job and paying their taxes. For at least 10 years, that is \nall they can have. After all that, they cannot even apply for permanent \nstatus until the fence is built, the Border Patrol agents are hired, \nand the border security technology, E-Verify, and the tracking system \nare fully in place.\n  Yet despite all of these measures, opposition from many conservatives \nhas grown significantly in the last few weeks. Why? Well, because they \nhave heard the Secretary of Homeland Security can just ignore the \nborder requirement. But this is not true. The Department does have the \ndiscretion on where to build the fence but not on the amount of fencing \nit must build. At the end of the day, it is simple: 700 miles of \npedestrian fencing must be built.\n  They have also heard the Secretary of Homeland Security can just \nwaive the radar and the drones and the ground sensors and the other \ntechnology required in the bill. But that is just not true. The \nSecretary can always add more to the plan, but the list of border \nsecurity measures we mandate in the legislation is the minimum that \nmust be implemented.\n  Some oppose it because they have heard ``a future Congress can just \ndefund all of the security measures'' as they have done in the past. \nBut that is just not true. The money is built into the bill. Unlike \nprevious border security laws, it doesn't leave it dependent on future \nfunding.\n  They also oppose the bill because they have heard it creates a \ntaxpayer subsidy for people to buy a car or a scooter. That is just not \ntrue. Nothing in this bill allows that.\n  Finally, they oppose the bill because they have heard that last \nFriday, a brandnew, 1,100-page bill no one has read is what is now \nbefore the Senate. That is just not true. This is the exact same bill \nthat has been publicly available for 10 weeks. The main addition to it \nare about 120 pages of border security because in order to add 700 \nmiles of fence, 20,000 border agents, and a prohibition on things such \nas foreign students or tourists from getting ObamaCare, we had to add \npages to the bill.\n  Now, I understand--I do--why after reading these false claims people \nwould be opposed to this bill. I also understand why, after we have \nbeen burned by large bills in the past, people are suspicious of big \nreforms of any kind. I understand why, after promises made in the past \non immigration have not been kept, people doubt whether they will ever \nbe kept again in the future.\n  But I also understand what is going to happen if at some point we do \nnot come up with an agreement we can support on immigration reform. \nWhat is going to happen is we will still have a broken legal \nimmigration system. We will not have more Border Patrol officers. We \nwill not have enough fencing. We still will not have mandatory E-\nVerify. And we will still have 11 million people living here illegally.\n  That is why I am involved, because despite all of the problems we \nhave with government, the only way to mandate a fence, E-Verify, and \nmore agents is to pass a law that does so.\n  I knew getting these requirements into the bill would not be easy. \nThis administration insisted the border is already secure, and they \nfought every effort to improve the border security parts of this bill. \nThe administration wants the fastest and easiest path to citizenship \npossible, and they fought every condition and every trigger in this \nbill.\n  I got involved because I knew if conservatives didn't get involved in \nshaping this proposal, it would not have any of the border security \nreforms our Nation desperately needs.\n  Getting to this point has been very difficult. To hear the worry and \nthe anxiety and the growing anger in the voices of so many people who \nhelped me get elected to the Senate, whom I agree with on virtually \nevery other issue, has been a real trial for me. I\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nknow they love America, and they are deeply worried about the direction \nthis administration is trying to take our country.\n  When I was a candidate, I told people I wanted to come here and \nfight. I want to fight to protect what is good for America and fight to \nstop what is bad for America. I believe what we have now regarding \nimmigration is hurting our country badly, and I simply wasn't going to \njust leave it to Democrats alone to figure out how to fix it.\n  I guess perhaps at the heart of my support of this proposal is that I \nknow firsthand that while immigrants have always impacted America, \nAmerica changes immigrants even more. Just a generation ago my parents \nlived in poverty in another country. America changed them. It gave them \na chance to improve their lives. It gave them the opportunity to open \ndoors for me that were closed to them. And the longer they lived here, \nthe older their kids got, the more conservative they became, the more \nconvinced they became that limited government and free enterprise and \nour constitutional liberties made this Nation special.\n\n  I am a firsthand witness to the transformative power of our country, \nhow it does not just change people's pocketbooks, it changes their \nhearts and their minds. Despite all the challenges and despite our \nbroken government, I still believe this is that kind of country.\n  I realize in the end many of my fellow conservatives will not be able \nto support this reform. But I hope you will understand that I honestly \nbelieve it is the right thing to do for this country--to finally have \nan immigration system that works, to finally have a fence, to finally \nhave more agents and E-Verify, and to finally put an end to de facto \namnesty.\n  In my heart and in my mind, I know we must solve this problem once \nand for all or it will only get worse and it will only get harder to \nsolve.\n  To my fellow conservatives, I will continue to fight alongside you \nfor real tax reform, for lowering our debt, for balancing our budget, \nfor reducing regulations, for rolling back job-killing environmental \npolicies, and for repealing the disaster of ObamaCare. To my fellow \nconservatives, I will continue to fight alongside you for the sanctity \nof life and for traditional marriage. But I will also continue to work \nin the hopes of one day uniting behind a common conservative strategy \non how to fix our broken immigration system once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to say how much I respect the \nSenator from Florida. I respect his viewpoint. I respect the amount of \neffort he has put into this issue, which is a very difficult and a very \ncomplex issue. He speaks from the heart. I have never questioned his \nmotives, and he has worked very hard to put together the very best \npiece of legislation that I think could have been accomplished on this \nSenate floor.\n  I wish I could stand with him in terms of final support because I, \ntoo, believe our current system is broken, that it needs to be \naddressed. The status quo is not an option. We will continue down the \nsame road, and only to a greater degree than where we find ourselves \ntoday.\n  I am deeply concerned. For me, the most difficult of things to work \nthrough--it finally came down to the fact that, as Senator Rubio has \ntalked about, there is a great level of distrust in this country today \ntoward whatever comes out of Washington and whomever's mouth it comes \nout of.\n  I think some of this is due to certain events that have happened in \nthe last several months. Benghazi is still not settled. The American \npeople still are not satisfied with what has been said about what \nhappened in Benghazi and what our response should have been. There have \nbeen changing narratives. That feeds into the distrust.\n  Certainly, there are the scandals--the IRS scandal and others \ncontinue to feed this distrust. It is a very dangerous thing for a \ndemocracy when people have lost trust in their elected Representatives, \nin their government. It is a very dangerous thing for the future. We \nneed to restore that.\n  To me, that element that now exists means when we take up legislation \nas comprehensive as this bill is, as sweeping as this bill is, we need \nto ensure the American people understand it and that they have trust in \nus that what we promise we will do in this bill will be fulfilled.\n  All this, from my perspective, has to be measured against the 1986 \nImmigration Reform Act, which I voted for and supported. Ronald Reagan \nwas President at the time. We had a divided Congress--Republicans and \nDemocrats. This Senate was under one party and the House was under \nanother. So the situation was somewhat similar to today. But with \nPresident Reagan's leadership, and with the promises that were made, \nthe 3 million people who were here illegally at that time were granted \nan opportunity to get on a path to citizenship--and it was combined \nwith the fact that we promised in that bill, verbally and in language, \nthat we would secure the border so we would not have to deal with this \nagain. Well, here we are in 2013 dealing with it again, but there are \nnot 3 million illegal immigrants; there are now 11 million illegal \nimmigrants.\n  It is having an enormous impact on our country, and it is an issue \nwhich we have to address. But I think we have to do it in a way that \nacknowledges that the promises made then were not fulfilled. When added \ntoday to the broken promises and the growing level of distrust than any \nof us could possibly imagine, that has to be addressed. The way, in my \nopinion, to address that is--to borrow from Ronald Reagan trust, but \nverify.\n  I think verify, because of this trust deficit, has to come first \nbefore people are ready to trust. They simply do not believe that the \npromises made will work, that they will be fulfilled.\n  When the underlying bill basically says the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity will state that the Department has a strategy to address the \nborder security problem, that does not play very well with people who \nhave seen strategies promised before. They want to see results. The \nreal issue here has been--at least for me, and I think for many of my \ncolleagues--whether we are able to prove to the American people they \nare going to get their results before we start moving people through a \nlegalization process which we know we are never going to be able to \npull back.\n  There were some amendments offered by my colleagues which I supported \nbecause essentially they said we want to look at results first before \nwe begin the process--from which we are never going to be able to pull \nback--of granting legal status for illegal immigrants in this country.\n  So it is that cart before the horse that, for me at least, and I \nthink for many, is the reason why we cannot support this bill as it is \ncurrently written.\n  I hope the House will come forward with something more credible, \nperhaps more sequential, that addresses this very fundamental flaw in \nthis bill to prove to the American people that we will fulfill the \npromises we are making in this legislation before we start a process of \ngranting legal status to illegals. We need to ensure we will not get \nyears down the road only to find we have not succeeded in fulfilling \nthose promises, and have created yet another amnesty situation.\n  I am the son of an immigrant. My mother came here with her family. It \nhas been the narrative in our family that legal immigration is what has \nmade America the country that it is. So I do not fear immigration. The \ndiversity has been good for our country. I served as Ambassador to \nGermany for 4 years, and I cannot tell you how many Germans and \nEuropeans from other countries came up to me and basically said: \nSomeday I hope to get in the lottery, that my name will be pulled. I \nhave been in line for 15 years; I have been in line for 20 years \nwaiting to come to your country through a legal immigration process.\n\n  It is pretty hard, when you are the son of an immigrant--you know \nyour family came here the right way--to know there are millions of \npeople in this world who would love to come to America and become \nresponsible citizens, and yet to see them look at people flooding \nacross the borders and being granted that privilege which they have not \nyet been able to attain.\n  So I trust that we will be able to go forward. I hope the House will \ncome forward with something that is more credible than what the Senate \nis poised to pass. I voted earlier for a procedural\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nmotion to allow debate on this issue because I think we need to have \nthis debate. I was hoping that we could address this fundamental issue \nthrough the amendment process. The employee verification has been \nstrengthened, the border security has been strengthened, the exit visa \nproblem has been strengthened, assuming the promises come true, but \nthey have only been strengthened on a piece of paper. We need to see it \nstrengthened for real on the border, at the employment offices, and at \nthe exit visa offices on the portals for people coming in and out of \nthis country. That is yet to be seen. That is yet to be demonstrated.\n  So without that fundamental approach of demonstrating results first \nin order to restore that trust, which is so lacking with the American \npeople--yet justified, on the failures of Congress and the failures of \nthis administration, in particular, or any administration to deliver \nwhat they said they would and--to fulfill their promises--that is why I \nwill not be supporting the bill.\n  I do hope, given the problems we have with the status quo--as I think \nwas clearly outlined by my colleague from Florida--we need to keep at \nthis. We need to find the solution to the problem because America \ncannot continue to be the country that it is and be the country that we \nwant it to be if we do not address this wound and this flaw in the \ncurrent immigration system.\n  We need the ability to attract and maintain people with skills for \nmany of our businesses. Some of our most important industries--\npharmaceutical, software, and others--important to our national defense \nand national security need those employees coming here the legal way \nthrough visas. We also need our agriculture industries and others to \nhave access to workers. I have a lot of processing plants in my State \nand agricultural sources in my State that cannot find enough American \nworkers to fill the positions they have offered. That ought to be \naddressed. I want to address that.\n  So I am not simply someone standing up and saying we do not have to \nfix the problem. We do have to fix the problem. I respect the efforts \nthat have been made in a bipartisan way to try to do that. I just think \nthis bill has one major fatal flaw; that is, promises are not \ndemonstrated, are not fulfilled, before the process starts. For that \nreason, I cannot support the bill in its final form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Supreme Court Ruling\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about college \naffordability and student loan interest rates. But before I do that, I \nwould like to take a moment to comment on the historic decision this \nmorning by the Supreme Court.\n  I have been married to my wife Franni for 37 years. It is the best \nthing that ever happened to me, and I have long believed that every \nloving couple should be seen as equal under the eyes of the law. So I \nhave been fighting for years, along with others, to overturn the so-\ncalled Defense of Marriage Act. I am very happy today that the Court \ndid so in part this morning.\n  Today all Minnesota couples will be treated equally under Federal \nlaw, and this will make a real difference for those families.\n  We still have work to do. I think Americans should have the freedom \nto marry the person of their choosing regardless of the State in which \nthey live. So we still have work to do, but today is a happy day.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  OK. Back to college affordability and student loan interest rates.\n  The interest rate on the Stafford subsidized loan is set to double on \nJuly 1. Along with a number of my colleagues, I am fighting to prevent \nthat from happening and to reach an agreement to protect students and \nmake college more affordable for them and for their families.\n  Not long ago I had a group of student leaders from MnSCU--the \nMinnesota State Colleges and Universities--come to my office in DC to \ndiscuss college affordability.\n  Now, remember, these are members of the student government of many of \nMinnesota's public colleges and universities. They are the student \nleaders. There were about 20.\n  I asked them: How many of you work while you are going to school, \nwhile you are in college?\n  Every one of them put up their hand.\n  I said: OK. How many of you work at least 20 hours a week?\n  Most of them.\n  How many of you work 30 hours a week while you are going to school?\n  More than I expected.\n  Then I asked them: How many of you work full time, work 40 hours a \nweek while you are going to college?\n  A number of them raised their hand.\n  Mind you, these are the student leaders of these schools. So they \nalso spend their time in student government. Working in college is not \nnecessarily a bad thing. Some work can help students better manage \ntheir time, become more productive, and help pay for college. I worked \nduring college. It was like 5 hours a week in our dorm kitchen.\n  Evidence shows that when a student starts to work more than 15 hours \na week, it becomes harder for the student to maintain good grades at \nschool and to graduate from school on time. Students are working more \nbecause college is becoming less and less affordable. They are still \ntaking out more and more student loans and graduating with more and \nmore debt.\n  Minnesota has the unfortunate distinction of being the State with the \nthird highest average debt for students graduating from college, at \nover $30,000 a student. Whether those student Americans are attending \ncommunity college or 4-year public or private colleges, it is \nincreasingly difficult for them and their families to afford higher \neducation.\n  Part of what has happened is that State support for higher education \nhas gone down in recent years, shifting more of the burden onto \nstudents and their families. According to the latest report from the \nState Higher Education Executive Officers, public colleges experienced \na 9-percent decrease in State funding per student from 2011 to 2012, \nincluding in Minnesota.\n  Minnesota public colleges saw a 27-percent decrease in State funding \nper student from 2007 to 2012. Meanwhile, and partially because of \nthis, the University of Minnesota saw an increase of 65 percent in its \naverage tuition and fees in constant dollars from 2002 to 2012. Our \nother public 4-year universities saw a 47-percent increase in average \ntuition and fees. Our public 2-year colleges saw a 39-percent increase \nin tuition and fees over the same time period.\n  After more than a decade of higher education spending cuts and \ntuition increases in Minnesota, things have started to turn around this \nyear. The State legislature passed a bill that increased funding for \nhigher education in Minnesota by $250 million, including a tuition \nfreeze at the University of Minnesota and Minnesota's other public \ncolleges and universities for 2 years. That is very good news. While \nthis is a great victory for Minnesota's students and families, it \ncertainly will not solve the college affordability problem in \nMinnesota.\n  As college has gotten more expensive, our Federal student aid system \nhas not kept up. In 1975, Pell grants--long the cornerstone of our \nFederal financial aid system--a full Pell grant covered almost 80 \npercent of the cost of attending a public 4-year college, but now it \npays for approximately 33 percent of the cost of a year at a public 4-\nyear college.\n  As students have turned to student loans, more of them are ending up \ntens of thousands in debt. In Minnesota I have held several college-\naffordability roundtables and heard from a number of extraordinary \nstudents. One of them is Taylor Williams, who was a senior at the \nUniversity of Minnesota in the spring. He grew up in a low-income \nfamily. Taylor was afraid of taking the advanced placement courses \nbecause he did not think he could afford the tests. The tests cost too \nmuch money. Fortunately, Taylor had a guidance counselor who found \nfunding to help him pay for the tests, and his success in those AP \ntests helped him start college with 1 year's worth of credit. Taylor, \nwhen I talked to him, was also working 30 to 40 hours a week and \nreceiving\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\ncommunity scholarships. Yet, in spite of all of this, he is graduating \nwith student debt.\n  Because of stories like Taylor's, I recently introduced the \nAccelerated Learning Act, a bill to reauthorize an existing Federal \nprogram that provides funding to low-income students to help pay for AP \nand IB--International Baccalaureate--exams. This is a Federal program \nthat has been around for over a decade and has helped students lower \nthe cost of college. I am pleased that this legislation was included in \nthe larger bill to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct that we passed out of the HELP Committee earlier this month.\n  Taylor and countless other students at schools across Minnesota \ndemonstrate tremendous perseverance and grit in getting a college \neducation and cobbling together the resources to pay for it. They are \nworking incredibly hard, and they are still taking on significant \namounts of debt--debt that will stay with them for a good portion of \ntheir lives.\n  Paying for college should not have to be that hard. In many other \ncountries it is not. In fact, in many other countries, students can go \nto college for free--for free--or pay extremely low tuition. According \nto the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, \ncountries where students pay zero tuition for their postsecondary \neducation include the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, \nIceland, Mexico, Norway, and Sweden. Other countries, such as France, \nAustria, Switzerland, and Belgium have postsecondary systems where \nstudents have to pay tuition of less than $1,500 per year.\n  Because of this it is not a surprise that many of these countries are \nalso surpassing the United States in higher education attainment. Not \nvery long ago the United States ranked first in the world in the \npercentage of 25- to 34-year-olds with a higher education. According to \nthe latest data from the OECD, the United States is now 14th in that \ncategory. This is a trend we need to reverse if the United States is \ngoing to remain globally competitive. In an ideal world the United \nStates would provide free or extremely low cost postsecondary education \nto its citizens, as so many other nations do. Unfortunately, that is \nnot going to happen anytime soon. So we need to take smaller but \nimportant steps to help our students pay for college.\n  The interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans is going to double \nfrom 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1 unless Congress takes action \nto prevent that from happening. This interest rate--this is an increase \nthat would affect almost 200,000 students in Minnesota, who would end \nup paying about $1,000 more for each student loan they take out over \nthe life of that loan. That is above what they are already paying.\n\n  At a time of record-low interest rates, it makes no sense to let the \nstudent loan interest rate double. We should prevent that from \nhappening. Ultimately, we need a long-term fix so that interest rates \ndo not become more unaffordable for students and their families. We \nalso need to make sure that whatever action we take does not make the \nproblem worse.\n  Several of my colleagues have proposed short-term fixes to this \ninterest rate problem. I am proud to support efforts by Senators Jack \nReed and Tom Harkin to freeze the interest rate at 3.5 percent while \nCongress works out a longer term solution. I am also a proud cosponsor \nof Senator Warren's legislation to tie the student loan interest rate \nto the rate at which the Federal Reserve lends money to banks. At a \ntime when the Fed is lending money at an interest rate of .75 percent \nto banks, it makes no sense for students to borrow money from the \ngovernment at a rate of 6.8 percent a year or even higher. Senator \nWarren has been an important voice in this debate in the Senate, making \nthe student loan interest rate the focus of her first piece of \nlegislation.\n  We need to get this done. Democratic leaders have been negotiating in \ngood faith on this issue. If we need to pass a short-term extension of \nthe current interest rate to give negotiators more time to produce a \nsolution that works for students and their families, well then that is \nwhat we should do.\n  Fixing the student loan interest rate is far from the only issue we \nhave to tackle to make college more affordable for students. I just \nreintroduced my bipartisan Understanding the True Cost of College Act \nto standardize financial aid award letters among universities so \nstudents can have clear and consistent information about the cost of \ntheir education. Students and their families and high school counselors \nneed to have uniform financial aid letters so they can make real \ncomparisons about all the costs before deciding where the student \nshould go to college. That is what my bill makes possible.\n  I also stand ready to work with my colleagues to protect the Pell \nGrant Program and to support other programs that make college more \naffordable for students, such as the TRIO and Work-Study Programs.\n  We have a lot to do and a long way to go to make college more \naffordable for our students. Doing that will help more Americans find \njobs to support their families, help more employers find qualified \nworkers for their businesses, and help our economy prosper. This is one \nof the most critical issues we face as a Congress. Addressing the \nstudent loan interest rate is a solid first step we can take toward \ntackling this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In the last 3 weeks, I have pointed out several flaws \nin the immigration bill. Within a couple of days, we will have a bill \nthrough the Senate. I think I owe to my colleagues and to my \nconstituents, since I have been pointing out flaws, what it would take \nfor me to vote for an immigration bill because I am just like most \neverybody and maybe everybody in the Senate who will tell you that the \nstatus quo is not legitimate to maintain and that we have to reform the \nsystem.\n  So there are, I would like to say, 100 Senators who believe the \nimmigration system needs to be fixed. I can guarantee that there are \nalso 100 different ways to fix it. Nobody has a perfect solution, but I \nbring an experience to the table that very few others have.\n  My deep-rooted concern with this bill stems from my strong belief \nthat we made a mistake in 1986. We allowed legalization and ignored the \nlaws on the books. Another major shortcoming was that we allowed \nlegalization without creating adequate avenues for people to enter, \nlive, and work in this country legally. In other words, if we had a \nsystem that works, where we had a shortage of workers, if they could \nlegally come to the country, we would not have the problems we have \ntoday. We did not do that in 1986.\n  These were crucial flaws that have led us to the debate we have been \nhaving the last 3 weeks, and I am not willing to pass that mistake on \nto future Congresses.\n  What will it take for somebody such as I, a Senator who voted for \namnesty in 1986 and wasn't a part of the Group of 8 or Group of 10, to \nvote for immigration reform this year? This is what I need to see in an \nimmigration bill in order to support it and send it to the President.\n  When I mentioned four different points, it doesn't mean that takes \ncare of everything, but if these things were taken care of, regardless \nof the other things, I would feel I would have to support it. They are:\n  No. 1, legalization after border security; No. 2, meaningful interior \nenforcement, including allowing ICE to do its job and work with State \nand local people; No. 3, strengthening, not weakening, current law with \nregard to criminals; and, No. 4, protecting American workers while \nenhancing legal avenues.\n  I will explain them at this point, starting with legalization after \nborder security. Most Americans contend that a legalization program is \na compassionate way to help those who are unlawfully in the country. \nHowever, those compassionate people who support such a program of \nlegalization do so only on the promise that the government will secure \nthe border and stop the flow of illegal immigration.\n  We are a nation based upon the rule of law. We have a right to \nprotect our sovereignty, and, of course, a duty to protect our \nhomeland. Any border security measures we pass must be real and \nimmediate. We can't wait 10 years to put more agents on the border or \nto implement a tracking system to track foreign nationals. We have to \nprove to\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\nthe American people that illegal entries are under complete control and \nthat visa overstays are to be punished.\n  Unfortunately, too many people have been led to believe this bill \nbefore us will force the Secretary of Homeland Security to secure the \nborder. It doesn't.\n  A fundamental component of any legislation is border security first \nand foremost, not legalization now and enforcement later, if ever.\n  There has to be pressure on the executive branch to get the job done. \nWe must tie legalization to results. Only then will advocates and a \nfuture administration truly try to secure the border.\n  Secondly, meaningful interior enforcement, including ICE being \nallowed to do its job and work with State and locals. Enforcement of \nthe immigration laws has been lax and increasingly selective in the \nlast few years. As a result, States have been forced to deal with the \ncriminal activity that surrounds the flow of people here who are \nundocumented.\n  They have stepped up efforts to control the effects of illegal \nimmigration in some States, and the States should be able to protect \ntheir people and stem the lawlessness within their border. Yet time and \nagain this administration has denied States the opportunity and tried \nto stop them from enforcing immigration laws.\n  Federal immigration enforcement officers have also been handicapped \nfrom doing their job. The bill would practically render these officers \nuseless since they are required to verify a person's eligibility for \nlegalization before apprehending and detaining. They need to be \nprovided the resources to fulfill their mission and not be told by \nWashington to sit idly by.\n  The unfortunate reality is that the bill does almost nothing to \nstrengthen and enhance our interior enforcement efforts. The bill does \nnothing to encourage Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts \nto apprehend and detain individuals who pose a risk to our community. \nThe Federal Government will continue to look the other way as millions \nof new people enter the country undocumented.\n  Meanwhile, the bill gives the States no new authority to act when the \nFederal Government refuses. I will be the first to say that border \nsecurity is a must, but people who enter illegally and overstay their \nvisas and are residing in the interior of the country, this cannot be \nignored. This is something that if it is fixed, I would feel very \ncomfortable voting for an immigration bill.\n  Strengthening, not weakening, current law with regard to criminals. \nIt is not going to go over well back home if we say one can have \ncriminal activity, even be deported from the country, and make \napplication again to have the benefits of this legislation.\n  One of the major reasons why immigration is a subject of such \nsignificant public interest is the failure of the Federal Government to \nenforce existing laws. Eleven million people have unlawfully entered \nthe country or overstayed their visas because the Federal Government \ndid not deter them or take action to remove them.\n  This bill before us significantly weakens current criminal law and \nwill hinder the ability of law enforcement to protect Americans from \ncriminal undocumented aliens.\n  The bill weakens current law regarding passport fraud, only charging \nthose who make or distribute illegal passports three or more times. It \nallows a person to knowingly purchase materials for making illegal \npassports but only charge the person with a crime if 10 or more \npassports are made.\n  It also weakens current law for those who illegally enter the \ncountry, changing existing laws by removing the crime of illegally \nattempting to enter the United States. This essentially incentivizes \nforeign citizens to attempt to illegally enter the country as many \ntimes as they wish.\n  Further, once they successfully enter the United States illegally, \nthe alien would only be subject to criminal punishment if they are \nremoved from the country three or more times. Why isn't once enough?\n  Taken together, the bill weakens current law and will make it easier \nfor undocumented aliens to enter the country illegally by not \ncriminalizing their attempts to enter, nor their actual illegal entry, \nunless they had been previously removed three or more times. This is a \ndrastic change that will encourage future entries by undocumented \npeople.\n  Given the serious nature of criminal street gangs, we need to pass an \nimmigration bill that prevents entry into the country if one is a gang \nmember. More important, we need to ensure that gang members are not \nbeing rewarded with legal status. Regrettably, the bill is weak on \nforeign national criminal street gang members in several regards. In \naddition to weakening current law, the bill does very little to deter \ncriminal behavior in the future. The bill ignores sanctuary cities, \nallowing criminals to seek safe harbor in jurisdictions where they have \npolicies aimed to protect people in the country illegally.\n  It increases the threshold required for actions to constitute a \ncrime. It punishes persons only if they have already been convicted of \nthree or more misdemeanors on different days, and it only punishes \nundocumented aliens who are removed from the country three or more \ntimes.\n  I am committed to making sure any bill that is sent to the President \nmakes a more serious effort to penalize those who attempt to enter or \nreenter the United States. It needs to be tough on lawbreakers and send \na signal that fraud and abuse, including identity theft, will not be \ntolerated. It needs to ensure that gang members are not granted \nlegalization but rather made deportable and inadmissible.\n  We need to protect victims of crime and ensure that child abusers and \ndomestic violence perpetrators do not receive benefits under the \nimmigration law. Finally, we need to ensure that dangerous, \nundocumented criminals are not released in our country but are detained \nuntil they are properly returned to their home country.\n  Fourth and last, we need to protect American workers while enhancing \nlegal avenues.\n  While I support allowing businesses to bring in foreign workers, they \nshould only do so when qualified Americans are not available. There \nhave been too many stories about U.S. workers who have had to train \ntheir replacements who come in through the H-1B visa program. Foreign \nnationals are being hired but then working in locations not specified \nin their application. Other work visa programs are not free of \ncontroversy.\n  I agree with the creation of a temporary worker program, such as the \nW visa program created in this bill. I have long argued we must enhance \nand expand opportunities for people who wish to work legally in this \ncountry. Yet as we do that, we cannot forget the American worker. We \nneed to fight for them and ensure that they are not disadvantaged, \ndisplaced, and underpaid because of our generation laws.\n  The bill before the Senate makes that move in the right direction by \nincreasing worker protection for Americans and by providing more \nauthority to the executive branch to investigate fraud in the H-1B visa \nprogram. Unfortunately, the bill is slanted to ensure that only certain \nemployers undergo more scrutiny. All employers who bring in visa \nholders should be held to the same standard. All employers, not just \nsome, should be required to make a good-faith effort to recruit U.S. \nworkers. All employers, not just some, should be required to attest \nthat they did not or will not displace a U.S. worker within 180 days of \napplying for an H-1B worker. All employers, not just some, should be \nrequired to offer the job to a U.S. worker who is equally or better \nqualified.\n  Our employment-based immigration program, including the H-1B program, \nhas served and could again serve a valuable purpose if used properly. \nHowever, they are being misused and abused. They are failing the \nAmerican worker and not fulfilling the original purpose that Congress \nintended when it was created.\n  Reforms are needed to put integrity back into the program and to \nensure that American workers and students are given every chance to \nfill vacant jobs in this country.\n  Again, how I vote on the final bill coming out of conference with the \nHouse is undecided. I want to be able to support something that will \nmake Americans proud, that will not make the same mistakes we did in \n1986, and\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\nwill stand the test of time so future generations can benefit. I need \nto see at least these four key changes before I can cast a vote in \nsupport.\n  I have said to Iowans and to my colleagues that the bill before the \nSenate is precooked, but I have faith that a better bill is achievable, \na bill that can gain more votes, including mine. This body, the Senate, \nis described as the most deliberative parliamentary body in the world--\nand I believe it is--but when we had 451 amendments offered to this \nbill, we were promised free and open debate. We have only dealt with \nabout a dozen of them, and we can't say we had a fair and open debate \nas we were promised.\n  It surely did not meet the standard that was set by Chairman Leahy \nwhen he promised in committee a free and open debate. There was free \nand open debate and no limit on amendments. We stuck with it until we \ngot done.\n  We could have just as well stuck with this bill until we got it done \nand we could have had votes on more amendments.\n  Now we are going to pass a bill that is not the best for the country \nand doesn't accomplish even what the authors of the legislation hoped \nto accomplish, particularly when they say secure the border first and \nthen legalize. We have to rely upon a body that is not considered a \ndeliberative body, the House of Representatives, to correct these \nmistakes that are made in this bill. I think they will, I hope they \nwill, and then I hope I can vote for the product that will go to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n10 or 12 minutes as in morning business and then have the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Ms. Warren, be recognized at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse and Ms. Warren pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1229 are located in Today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we just saw on the news today that the \nGDP for the first quarter, according to the Wall Street Journal, was \nrevised downward dramatically from previous estimates. I am not saying \nthere is anything wrong with their accounting, but they go back and \ndoublecheck their numbers and add other analyses and they come up with \nwhat the growth of the economy was in the first quarter. The previously \nannounced growth level was 2.4 percent for the first quarter, which is \nlow. Coming out of a recession, we need to be doing better than that. \nBut now that it was revised downward, they found there was only 1.8 \npercent growth in the first quarter. That is a very dangerous trend, \nand the article said it is evidence of a slowing growth in America.\n  The fourth quarter of last year GDP growth was only .4 percent. If \ncontinued throughout the year, that is a very troubling number. The \ndata shows for the last 15 quarters, almost 4 years, we have averaged \nonly about 2 percent growth in our economy--growth in GDP.\n  I would say to my colleagues, as we vote to bring in more and more \nworkers at a time when jobs are not being created in any significant \nnumber, we need to be aware that this can cause severe consequences.\n  The Atlanta Federal Reserve Economic Study, done several years ago, \nfound the immigration flow today in the Atlanta area of the Federal \nReserve had reduced the wages of American workers in that region by as \nmuch as $1,500 a year. That is $120 per month less money for an average \nfamily to take care of themselves.\n  Unemployment and declining wages are a big reason that people are \ngetting in trouble on their credit cards. Professor Borhaas and others \nhave done studies on this.\n  Another study found a $960 decline in people's annual wages, which is \nabout $80 a month. Eighty dollars a month may not sound like a lot for \na Senator, but it sounds like a lot for a working American--maybe equal \nto their gas bill, or part of it.\n  I would say that as we consider our votes on the immigration bill, \nlet's consider that this economy is not growing and is not creating \nlarge job growth. We have projections that we are not going to do so \nfor the next decade. And I am not talking about people who will be \nlegalized that are here, but we ought not overload the economy with a \nnew flow that is much larger than the current flow of immigration \nlegally.\n  I see my colleagues are here, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business to offer a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it has now been 95 days since the Senate \npassed a budget, and I have come to the floor myself now 6 times to ask \nunanimous consent to move to conference. My Democratic colleagues have \nasked unanimous consent to move to conference another eight times. \nAfter every request, a Senate Republican has stood up and said no--no \nto the opportunity to work on a bipartisan budget deal.\n  I want to say to the Republicans who are blocking a bipartisan budget \nconference: Enough is enough. We have heard so many excuses--refusing \nto allow conference before we get to a so-called preconference \nframework; putting preconditions on what can be discussed in a \nbipartisan conference; claiming that moving to a budget conference--\nwhich leading Republicans did call for just a few months ago--was \nsomehow not regular order; to, most recently, claiming we need to look \nat a 30-year budget window before looking at the major problems we have \nright now in front of us--which, I add, is unacceptable, because the \nAmerican people rightly expect us to work on both at the same time.\n  Hearing these changing excuses week after week has been frustrating \nnot just for Democrats but for many of my Republican colleagues as \nwell.\n  A large group of us--Republicans and Democrats--think that although \nwe do have major differences between the parties' values and \npriorities, we should at least come to the table and try to work out a \nbipartisan deal. That is what American people do every day. And when \nthere is a disagreement, they can't afford to play a game of chicken \nand hope the other person gives in, because when that happens, \nimportant work cannot get done. Kids don't get picked up from school, \nbills don't get paid, small businesses miss a major opportunity for \nexpansion. Every day regular Americans avoid those kinds of situations, \nand we here in the Senate should at least try to do the same.\n  There are extremely important things that are not getting done in the \nSenate right now because some Republicans want to embrace the harmful \ntop-line spending level in sequestration which has a major gap between \nthe House and Senate appropriations levels for the next fiscal year. We \ndon't have much time left to resolve that gap. After we come back from \nnext week's State work period, we will have 1 month to try to come to \nan agreement or else we are going to find ourselves in a very tough \nsituation in September. We could, once again, be working against the \nclock to avoid a harmful crisis. The last thing the American people--\nwho come together and resolve differences every day--want to see is \nanother round of manufactured crises coming out of Washington, DC, and \nthey do not have to. We still have time.\n  I know there are leaders on both sides of the aisle who would \nstrongly prefer to solve problems rather than to get into yet another \npolitical fight that creates uncertainty for our families, our \nbusinesses, our country, and our economy. I am confident that if those \nof us who prefer commonsense bipartisanship over artificial crisis work \ntogether, we can reach a fair agreement and show the American people \nour government does work.\n  I urge Senate Republican leaders to drop the tea party-backed \nstrategy of delaying until the next crisis, and allow the Senate to \njoin the House in a formal bipartisan budget negotiation.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res.\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\n25; that the amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. \n8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to \nreconsider be made and laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate; that following the authorization, \ntwo motions to instruct conferees will be in order from each side--\nmotion to instruct relative to the debt limit, and motion to instruct \nrelative to taxes and revenue; that there be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees prior to votes in \nrelation to the motions; and further, that no amendments be in order to \neither of the motions prior to the votes; all of the above occurring \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The issue before this body is not complicated. There are a \nlot of procedural ambiguities that make it difficult to penetrate, and \nyet it is one very simple issue. The issue before this body is whether \nthe Senate can raise the debt limit of the United States with simply \nusing a 50-vote threshold or whether it should go through the regular \norder before raising any debt limit, subject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  What is the difference? The difference is simple: If the debt limit \ncan be raised using 50 votes, then the majority party--the Democrats--\ndo not need to speak to the Republicans, do not need to sit down at the \ntable and work with the Republicans, do not need to listen to any \nopposing views.\n  Indeed, the President of the United States has been very candid. He \nhas been unequivocal. President Obama has said he believes we should \nraise the debt limit, with no preconditions, with no negotiations, with \nno changes whatsoever.\n  If you think it is OK that in 4\\1/2\\ years our Nation's debt has gone \nfrom $10 trillion to nearly $17 trillion, if you think it is OK that \nour Nation's debt is now larger than the size of the entire economy, if \nyou think it is OK that our children and grandchildren are being be \nbankrupted--in 4\\1/2\\ years the national debt has grown over 60 \npercent--and if you think it is OK that the Senate Democrats want to \ncontinue borrowing trillions more while doing nothing--nada--zilch--to \naddress the spending problems, to rein in out-of-control spending, then \nyou should welcome this motion.\n  Over and over again the majority has asked to go to conference on the \nbudget. Why? Because going to conference on the budget allows a \nprocedural back door to enable them to raise the debt ceiling using \nonly 50 votes.\n  How do we know that is what this is about? We know that is what this \nis about because my friend the Senator from Washington could go to \nconference on the budget right now. This instant we could go to \nconference on the budget--right now--except, when I ask--as I am going \nto in a moment--for unanimous consent not to use it as a procedural \nback door to raise the debt ceiling, my friend the Senator from \nWashington is going to object. And I know this because we have done \nthis kabuki dance more than once and we continue doing it back and \nforth. But it makes clear that is what this fight is all about.\n  Of course the Senate budget didn't address the debt ceiling; the \nHouse budget didn't address the debt ceiling; we didn't have a debate \non the floor of this Senate about the debt ceiling; we didn't have a \nvote on the floor of the Senate about the debt ceiling; and yet the \nreason the majority is so adamant that they want to go to conference is \nbecause it presents them with an avenue to use 50 votes--the votes of \nonly the Democrats in this body--to raise the debt ceiling to dig us \nfurther in debt and to do nothing--nothing--to fix the problem.\n  I would suggest that is irresponsible. That is not what Americans \nwant. That is not what Democrats, Republicans, or Independents outside \nof the Washington beltway want.\n  We fundamentally know it is wrong to stick our kids and grandkids \nwith $17 trillion in debt. It is even more wrong to keep on doing it \nand making it worse and worse and not rolling up our sleeves to fix it.\n  One of the great frustrations of this body is that for some time now \nthe American people have been unequivocal: Their top priority is jobs \nand the economy, and is turning around what is going on. Yet this body \ndoesn't talk about that. It doesn't talk about generating jobs, getting \nthe economy growing, and stopping our out-of-control debt. Instead, we \ndebate every other priority under the Sun--whether it is restricting \nSecond Amendment rights to keep and bear arms or whether it is a \nnational energy tax through the President's climate change proposal.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am not sure whether there has been an \nobjection.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator modify her request so that it not be in order for the \nSenate to consider a conference report that includes reconciliation \ninstructions to raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would object. What the Senator is \nasking for is a precondition on a conference committee without the \nconsideration of this whole Senate.\n  What I have offered to him and to this body in my unanimous consent \nrequest is a vote on the motion to instruct conferees, which is what \noccurs in the Senate if we want to put any precondition onto a budget.\n  I reject his unanimous consent, and I ask again my unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Washington object to the \nrequest as modified?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Washington objects to the request as \nmodified, and again reasks my original unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to object, I would note the comment \nfrom my friend from Washington suggesting a motion to instruct the \nconferees. What she of course knows is that is a typical Washington \nmaneuver, because the motion to instruct is nonbinding and it is \nsubject to 50 votes. So if we had a motion to instruct the conferees \nnot to raise the debt ceiling, every Democrat in this body would vote \nagainst it. It would be defeated. And even if it were passed, it would \nbe nonbinding on the conferees.\n  No one should be confused. What the Democrats want is to raise the \ndebt ceiling. And they want to do it using 50 votes, ignoring the views \nof the minority, and doing nothing to fix the problem.\n  Accordingly, I object.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I make my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I was here to talk about immigration, and \nthat is what I will talk about. But I have been caught in a crossfire \non this subject, and I want to say my view is this is exactly what \npeople hate about Washington, DC. It is exactly why we have a 10-\npercent approval rating.\n  For 4 years I went to townhall meetings and was asked over and over \nand over: Why don't the Democrats in the Senate pass a budget? Which I \nthink is a very legitimate question. We got a new Chair of the Budget \nCommittee and we passed a budget after 4 years, and now we are told we \ncan't go to conference to have a discussion with House Republicans \nabout what our budget ought to look like.\n  I actually disagree with the Senator from Texas, I have to say \nrespectfully, on the merits of this issue; that is to say, on the debt \nceiling itself. This is the reason I think folks in Colorado can't \nstand this place. There is not a mayor in my State, whether they are a \nRepublican or a Democrat or a tea party mayor, not one--not one who \nwould threaten the credit rating of their community for politics. Not \none. We would run them out on a rail, because that is not the way you \ndo business. The credit rating of a community is the most important \nthing it has. The\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\nfull faith and credit of the United States of America--which until the \nlast debt ceiling discussion had never been questioned--was questioned \nfor the first time in our history; not because of the size of our \ndebt--which, by the way, I have spent 4 years trying to work on because \nI believe it is a very severe problem we face, and I look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Texas on this issue--but because of the \npolitical dysfunction in DC. That is why we got this downgrade.\n  The Senator from Alabama, who has left the floor, was talking about \nthe restatement of our GDP numbers in the first quarter. I worry a lot \nabout that. The people I represent are not concerned with the \nprocedural stuff that goes on here. What they are worried about is an \neconomy they are living in day after day after day where, even in \nperiods of economic growth, median family income is falling, middle-\nclass families are falling behind. They are worried about an economy \nwhere they are earning less at the end of the decade than they were at \nthe beginning, but their cost of higher education continues to \nescalate, their cost of health care continues to escalate. As \nindividuals, as families, and as members of a generation, they are \nworried we are going to be the first generation of Coloradans and \nAmericans to leave less opportunity and not more to the people who are \ncoming after us.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNET. I wish to finish my statement, and then I will gladly \nyield for a question.\n  I was glad to hear the Senator from Alabama. He and I disagree on the \nimmigration bill, but we certainly agree on the issue of the concern \nall of us have about this economy--or most of us have about this \neconomy. It is one of the reasons we should pass this immigration bill. \nThe Congressional Budget Office tells us we would see 3 additional \npoints of GDP increase in the first 10 years, 5 over the two 10-year \nwindows, if we pass the bill.\n  To the point about American jobs, I was very glad to hear him say he \nwas not talking about the 11 million people who are here because most \nof the 11 million people who are here are working. But they are working \nin a shadow economy, a cash economy, under circumstances where they can \nbe exploited. We have allowed that to happen because of the broken \nimmigration system we have. If all you cared about--and I deeply care \nabout it--was raising wages for the American worker, you would want to \nbring those 11 million people out of that shadow economy. You would \nwant them paid in something other than cash, and you would want them, \nfor heaven's sake, paying taxes at a time when we have the kinds of \ndeficit problems the Senator from Texas is describing.\n  The Senator also talked about the future flow of immigrants. I should \nsay I was part of the bipartisan group. This is not a partisan bill, \nthis immigration bill. There were eight of us. Four Republicans and \nfour Democrats worked together on this bill, and one of the things we \nthought hard about was the future flow of immigrants to this country \nbecause generation after generation of Americans, since the founding of \nour country, has relied on new immigrants to bring their ideas, to \nbring their talents, to bring their energies to our shores to build \ntheir businesses here.\n  Today what we are saying to people--even people who get college \ndegrees in the United States, degrees that we subsidize, that we pay \nfor--even to those people, we are saying: Don't stay here. Even if you \nwant to stay here, please go home to China and start your business \nthere. Go home to India and compete with us there. Hire people there \ninstead of creating jobs here in the United States.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. We subscribe to the rule of law. This \nbill is a ratification of those two American ideals--ideals that you \ncan almost not find in any other country in the world.\n  That is why I am so glad that for once this body is actually acting \nin a bipartisan way to deal with not an easy problem but a tough \nproblem. I will tell you the kids who are visiting today from 4-H all \nacross the country and from my State of Colorado actually are expecting \nus to do these hard things, as our parents and grandparents did before \nthem, so we don't leave them in the lurch.\n  That is what is at stake. That is why I wish we could find a way past \nthis budget impasse as well so we actually could start to have a \nresponsible conversation about what we are going to do on the \nentitlement side and on the revenue side, so we do not continue to hack \naway at domestic discretionary spending in ways that could lead us, \nwith some of the House proposals, to invest only 4 percent of the \nrevenue we collect in the future--4 percent in transportation and \nagriculture and education. There is not a business in this country that \nwould last a year if it invested 4 percent of its cash flow in the \nfuture of that business.\n  At some point we have to move beyond where we have been here and \nactually get into a serious discussion about how we are going to manage \nthis debt down over the next decade or two in ways that do not prevent \nus from growing our economy and in ways that do not subject our \nchildren to unpaid bills. It would be as if I went to the mortgage \nlender on my house and I said: I would like to buy a house, and I am \ngoing to take out a mortgage, and then I am going to give it to my kids \nto carry for me instead of paying for it myself. That is the position \nwe are in today. The only way we are going to solve that is if \nDemocrats and Republicans can sit down together and actually move past \nthe talking points.\n  With that, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRUZ. If I may ask my friend two questions on the two topics he \naddressed, the first being the debt ceiling, the second being \nimmigration. On the debt ceiling, the question I will ask is, Does my \nfriend from Colorado believe Congress should continue raising the debt \nceiling in perpetuity, with no changes and no preconditions, and should \nthe Senate be able to do so with just 50 votes?\n  Mr. BENNET. Here is how I answer that. I appreciate the question. \nThrough the Chair to the Senator from Texas, it is clear that this is \nnot going to get us anywhere, this procedural fight the two of you are \nhaving every couple of weeks. I think that is clear. I think it is \nclear that the debt ceiling is something that has been raised time and \ntime again by Republicans and by Democratic Presidents over the years. \nI think it is also clear that we have to deal with our debt and our \ndeficit. I believe that. But for myself, I don't feel like I would come \nto the floor and say that I am only going to allow this bill to go to \nconference with the Republicans in the House if all the money comes to \nColorado--or some other stipulation I would want that 99 other Senators \nwould not agree with.\n  The second thing is that I think it is important for people to \nunderstand that this issue--again, I am not in any way trivializing the \nissues around our deficit and our debt. I want the Senator from Texas--\nI hope he understands that. I hope he knows that about me. But I worry \nabout the debt ceiling as a tool for accomplishing this, first for the \nreasons that have to do with our credit rating but also because there \nis a view among some that the debt ceiling is about bills we are going \nto incur as opposed to the ones we already have incurred.\n  In other words, it would be one thing if somebody said: I am spending \ntoo much money and I am going to cut up my credit card, and that is \nwhat they would do, but that is not what the debt ceiling is about. \nWhat the debt ceiling is about is somebody saying: You know what, I \nwant the best cable package I can find, I want the best satellite \npackage I can find, and when the bill comes to pay for it, I am just \ngoing to chop it up into little pieces and not pay it. That is what I \ndon't like about this approach.\n  But everybody is entitled to their own approach on this question. I \njust wish we could move forward here instead of continuing to earn the \n10-percent approval rating Congress has. That is all I am asking for.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield for an additional question at that \npoint?\n  Mr. BENNET. Sure.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I like and agree with his analogy about cutting up a credit \ncard. Indeed, if my friend from Colorado supports anything resembling \nCongress cutting up the credit card, that will truly be a dramatic \nposition, a position on which he and I could find common cause.\n  Mr. BENNET. May I.\n  Mr. CRUZ. If I can ask the question. I ask, the natural results of \nwhat my\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\nfriend from Colorado just said are that I assume, then, that he would \nreadily support Pat Toomey's Default Prevention Act? What Pat Toomey's \nDefault Prevention Act does is it ensures what the Senator said--money \nthat we borrowed we will keep paying. It says that in the event the \ncredit limit is not raised, the United States will always, always, \nalways pay its debt. We will never, ever, ever default on the debt, and \nwe will take that completely off the table. Then the debt limit fight \nwould only be about, as my friend from Colorado put it, cutting up the \ncredit card for future spending.\n  Would my friend from Colorado support the Default Prevention Act of \nPat Toomey, making it impossible--taking default off the table \npermanently?\n  Mr. BENNET. I say through the Chair to my friend from Texas, I have \nnot read the bill, but I will read the bill. I commit to him that I \nwill do that.\n  I appreciate the implication of this, which is that the Senator is \nnot objecting to my metaphor about the cable bill being cut up, because \nI do think that is a real problem.\n  We are not saying to people--we should not be saying to people that \nwe are going to behave in an irresponsible way. As somebody who used to \nspend his time restructuring companies that were really well run, \nreally well operated but had horrible balance sheets, I would have to \nthink hard about the treatment that creditors would provide to, in this \ncase, the U.S. Government when I look at that. I will look at that.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas that there are other things we might \neven be able to agree on too around here. For a long time I have \nthought it would be important for us to put health care on a budget in \nthis country. We are not on a budget. During the health care debate I \nhad an amendment called the fail-safe amendment that would say to the \nAmerican people and to the Congress: This is what we have to spend on \nhealth care. That is all there is. There is not any more. We have to \nmanage toward that. If we failed, if we tripped over it, we would \nactually have to make cuts, make changes to our system of health care.\n  We spend twice as much as any other industrialized country in the \nworld, and it is crowding out a lot of other things that the 4-H kids \nand others whom I worry about care about.\n  So I think there is much we can work on, but I just don't think we \nare going to get to it through this kind of discussion. We might get to \nit through this kind of discussion.\n  In any event, I will commit to the Senator from Texas that I am going \nto sit down and stop talking about what he said.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, there is no one else on the floor. I \nthought I would take the opportunity to talk again a little bit about \nour immigration bill. This has been such a gratifying process to me \nbecause it has been bipartisan from the start. In fact, I have been \ntelling people that it is not even that it has been bipartisan, it has \nbeen nonpartisan. The work on the Gang of 8, which led to work in the \nJudiciary Committee, which led to work on the floor is the way this \nplace ought to operate on a whole host of issues, from energy--the \nPresiding Officer cares a lot about that--to infrastructure, to the \nbudget issues I was just talking about with the Senator from Texas.\n  It is important for people to know that this is a bipartisan bill \nbecause I think people are fed up with the partisanship in this town, \nand they do not believe it reflects the way they live their lives. \nThere is a reason for that. It does not. This place is decoupled from \nthe lives of ordinary American people, and this is an effort--among \nothers, hopefully--to recouple those priorities.\n  I have been interested in the objections to the immigration bill \nsince the beginning. First there was the objection that it was actually \ngoing to drive up our deficit. Not surprisingly, we learned from the \nCongressional Budget Office that this bill actually would create the \nmost significant deficit reduction of any piece of legislation we \nconsidered here, certainly that we passed here--$197 billion in the \nfirst 10 years, $700 billion in the second 10 years. Even in \nWashington, $1 trillion is still a lot of money. That is what we heard, \nboth because people now not paying taxes would be paying taxes and also \nbecause of the economic growth that would be generated if we could \nrestore the rule of law to our immigration system and to this economy. \nThat was an objection. That objection was answered--not by me but by \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  The second objection was that the legislation was not going to get a \nfair airing, that it was going to be rushed through in the dead of \nnight. I don't like doing work that way.\n  There were eight ``no'' votes on the fiscal cliff deal at the end of \nthe year, and I was one of those ``no'' votes, one of three Democrats \nwho voted no not largely but partly because it had not had any process \nand it was in the middle of the night. This bill, by contrast, had 7 \nmonths of negotiations among four Democrats and four Republicans. It \nhad 3 weeks to go through the Judiciary Committee, a markup that had \n160-some amendments, many of which were accepted. Forty-one Republican \namendments were accepted to this bill. It came to the floor for the \ndebate we have had over the last few weeks.\n  I realize the amendment process is jammed up, and I am sorry about \nthat because I think people ought to be able--including the Presiding \nOfficer--to offer the wise amendments they have and the not-so-wise \namendments they have, at least in my opinion. But there certainly has \nbeen an open process for this bill. Sometimes I have heard people say, \nwell, it is just like health care all over again. I was here during the \nhealth care bill, and I can say this process looks nothing like that \nprocess.\n\n  There is a third objection from some who say there is no border \nsecurity in this bill. First of all, that wasn't even true of the Gang \nof 8 bill. We had substantial border security, and as my lead, I was \ntaking what John McCain and Jeff Flake--both Senators from Arizona--\nsaid was important. They are two Senators who have a border State, and \nthey have been working hard to resolve these issues in our group. We \nmade a substantial investment in that bill for border security and \ntechnology. Even fencing was included in that bill.\n  I think it is a reasonable expectation--not of Republicans but of the \nAmerican people--that our border should be secure. Certainly the people \nin Colorado believe our border should be secure. So when Senators came \nand said: We would like to vote for this bill, but we would like to do \nmore on border security, not only was I open to that, I supported that. \nThe bill before us has incredibly substantial border security. There \nare 700 more miles of fencing. We doubled the number of Border Patrol \nagents on the border.\n  One of the Senators said to me that we are at a point now where there \nis a Border Patrol agent every 1,000 feet on the southern border. One \nmight ask whether that is a wise use of resources, but it was important \nfor some people to have that before they would sign on to this bill. So \nI don't think any reasonable person looking at this could say border \nsecurity has not been addressed.\n  So what are the objections to moving forward? We have heard people \nsay: Well, it is the path to citizenship or we don't like that part of \nthe bill. That was a core principle for the four Democrats and four \nRepublicans who started this negotiation, and it has been a core \nprinciple for a lot of people who voted for this bill. A very important \nreason to pass this legislation is to resolve the situation for the 11 \nmillion people who are here illegally. The pathway to citizenship is \nthe right way to do it.\n  This is not amnesty. This has to be earned. People have to pay a \nfine. People have to learn English for the first time in our history. \nPeople have to pay their taxes. It takes 10 years to get a green card, \nthen 3 years after that. They have to pass background checks all along \nthe way so we know who the people are we want to stay in this country \nand who the people are we want to leave this country.\n  I see the Senator from Louisiana is here, so I will wrap up. To my \nfriends\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\nwho think some lawful status that doesn't include a pathway to \ncitizenship is useful to this country, I ask them to look at countries \nall around the world that have created a subclass of people--not even \ncitizens, just a subclass of people--who have no attachment to their \nculture, no feeling they are ever going to participate in their civic \nor political institutions or meaningfully in their economy, no chance \nto believe their children or the children after them are actually going \nto make those contributions as well, and ask: Does that look like the \nUnited States of America to you?\n  That is not what the Founders had in mind. We hear a lot of cheap \ntalk about the Founders around here these days. That is not what the \nFounders had in mind when they wrote into the Constitution that it was \nour responsibility as a body to deal with immigration.\n  So I hope people will consider that objection, take a look at the \nSenate bill, and will, hopefully, support it.\n  With that, I know the Senator from Louisiana was scheduled to speak, \nso I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am here to speak about an amendment I \nhave filed on this immigration bill that I have been working hard to \nget a vote on. It is certainly not the only amendment I filed, but it \nis a top priority. My amendment is the violence against women and \nchildren amendment, amendment No. 1330.\n  We have heard a lot of promises and a lot of rhetoric on this issue \nfrom many people, including the Gang of 8. What I have found \ndistressing, as I have actually gotten to read the bill--and let's \nalways remember one of the great lessons of ObamaCare was to read the \nbill before we vote--is that the details and exact language does not \nmatch a lot of the rhetoric.\n  One of the earliest and most important promises by the Gang of 8 was \nthat in this amnesty process folks who were guilty of serious crimes \nwould not be eligible for citizenship; in fact, they would be deported. \nThat is why the bipartisan framework for comprehensive immigration \nreform that the Gang of 8 released in January of this year said:\n\n       Individuals with a serious criminal background or others \n     who pose a threat to our national security will be ineligible \n     for legal status and subject to deportation. Illegal \n     immigrants who have committed serious crimes face immediate \n     deportation.\n\n  We can all agree with that. The problem is the details in the text of \nthe bill do not agree with that because it does not include several \nserious offenses, particularly against women and children.\n  My amendment is simple. It is to beef up and strengthen this part of \nthe bill by including the Violence Against Women Act offenses as \ncrimes, which would disqualify someone from being granted amnesty and \nwould trigger immediate deportation. These include serious, violent \ncrimes such as sexual assault, stalking, domestic violence, sex \ntrafficking, dating violence, child abuse and neglect, as well as elder \nabuse. It is specifically Violence Against Women Act offenses. These \nare serious, violent crimes against some of the most vulnerable people \nin our society. In my opinion those offenses should clearly be \ndisqualifiers. So that is what the amendment would do.\n  Now, VAWA, which we debated and voted on a few months ago, has \nwidespread bipartisan support. More than 200 national organizations and \nmore than 500 State and local organizations expressed support for that \nbill. A great majority of Senators voted for it. I voted for it. So we \nshould certainly follow up on that rhetoric and that vote by making \nsure these serious offenses in the Violence Against Women Act are \ndisqualifiers to amnesty in the immigration bill.\n  This is not my only amendment, and not getting a vote for this \namendment so far is a frustration. It is a frustration for a lot of us \nwith regard to a lot of amendments. This immigration debate is \nenormously important. This bill is enormously long. It is well over \n1,000 pages. So far we have had 10 rollcall votes on amendments--10, \nperiod. That is one amendment per--I don't know--120, 130 pages. That \nis ludicrous, and that is not the full, robust amendment process we \nwere promised for months and months by both the majority leader and the \nGang of 8.\n  I hope I can get a vote on this amendment, and I also want and expect \na vote on the other amendments I filed. I have many amendments, but I \nhave narrowed that list down.\n  So, with that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \nViolence Against Women and Children amendment No. 1330 be made pending \nand eligible for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. In closing, I find that very disheartening. This is a big \nsubject. I agree with the proponents of the bill when they say this is \na big problem that needs fixing. It has been on the Senate floor for 3 \nweeks. The bill is well over 1,000 pages long, and we need more \nopportunity for serious debate and amendments than we have gotten.\n  As soon as a path to passage was identified late last week--as soon \nas that happened, the amendment process was basically shut down. It \ncontinues to be shut down today. The important amendment I have brought \nto the floor that has been denied a vote is an example of that. I find \nit very regrettable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         College Education Cost\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we have a major crisis in our country \ntoday in terms of the high cost of a college education, and in addition \nto that the incredible debt burden college students and their families \nare facing. This is a major problem in Vermont, and it is a major \nproblem for every State in our country.\n  The job of the Senate is to understand that crisis, improve the \nsituation, lessen the burden on students and their families, and not to \nmake the situation worse than it is today. At a time when we need the \nbest educated workforce in the world, hundreds of thousands of bright, \nyoung Americans who are qualified to pursue a higher education--who \nwant to pursue a higher education--do not go to college, and they do \nnot go to college for one very simple reason: They cannot afford to go \nto college.\n  According to a Pew study of 18- to 34-year-olds who have not \ncompleted college, 48 percent say they cannot afford to do so. Higher \neducation for middle-class families and working-class families is \nsimply too expensive, and this is an issue we must address.\n  What does it say about our country when hundreds and hundreds of \nthousands of young people who want to contribute and do more with their \nlives cannot get the education they need? In many cases it deprives \nthem from making it into the middle class, and it denies this Nation \nthe intellectual capabilities they have.\n  Further, millions of young people who graduate college are saddled \nwith an incredible debt burden which radically impacts their lives. In \nAmerica today, the average debt for a college graduate is over $27,000 \nin my State of Vermont. It is about $28,000. That is the average. That \nmeans there are many young people who have more debt. For those who go \nto graduate school or medical school or dental school, the debt can be \nmany times higher. Last year I talked to two young dentists in the \nState of Vermont. They are in debt to the tune of over $200,000 for the \ncrime of having gone to dental school.\n  This horrendous debt burden impacts the lives of young people in many \nways. It can determine--and this is a hugely important issue--the \nprofession they choose to enter. How can a person become a teacher, a \nchildcare worker, a legal aid attorney or even a primary care physician \nif the salary a person earns will not enable them to pay off their debt \nand take care of the obligations they face? In other words, this debt \nis forcing many young people into professions which are not necessarily \ntheir love. It is not what they wanted to do; it is what they have to \ndo in order to earn money to pay off their\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\ndebts. This crushing debt burden determines where many young people \nwill live and whether they can even afford to buy a home. How does a \nperson go out and buy a home if they are spending 20 or 25 percent of \ntheir income paying off their student debt? This debt burden on our \nyoung people even determines, in some cases, whether they get married \nand have kids.\n  The higher education debt burden the American people are now carrying \nat $1.1 trillion is now higher than our credit card debt and is having \na significant impact upon our economy. In fact, the Federal Reserve and \nthe Department of Treasury have both issued warnings that high levels \nof student loan debt could drive down consumer demand and have a \nnegative impact on economic growth. In other words, if a person is \nspending all their money paying off debt, they are not buying goods or \nservices. So this high level of student loan debt is having a negative \nimpact on our overall economy.\n  According to a report released by the New York Fed--and this is \nimportant for people to hear--student loan debt has nearly tripled \nsince 2004. In less than 10 years it has nearly tripled. Total student \nloan debt in the United States now exceeds $1.1 trillion. The average \nstudent loan balance has increased 70 percent since 2004.\n  If we do not act immediately, the subsidized Stafford Loan Program \nwill see a doubling of interest rates on July 1, a few days from now. \nLet me repeat: If Congress does not act immediately, within the next \nfew days, the subsidized Stafford Loan Program will see a doubling of \ninterest rates on July 1. The rates will rise from 3.4 percent to 6.8 \npercent for subsidized Stafford loans. This would be a disaster for \nmillions of students and their families all over our Nation. We must \nnot allow that to happen. At the very least, we must immediately pass \nlegislation that extends interest rates at 3.4 percent for several more \nyears on the Stafford Loan Program. Meanwhile, as part of higher \neducation legislation, we must begin work on a long-term solution that \nguarantees the students of this country will be able to attend college \nand graduate school and not be burdened with suffocating debts.\n  As we contemplate long-term new policy on student loans, one thing we \nshould be very clear about: The Federal Government should not be making \na huge profit off the needs of low-income and working families who \nutilize the Stafford Loan Program. That is simply wrong. In fact, that \nis what we are doing today.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Government \nmakes a substantial profit from student loans. For loans made this \nyear, in 2013 alone, that profit is expected to exceed $50 billion, and \nthis is higher than the profits made by ExxonMobil, the most profitable \ncompany on Earth. As I hear every day on the floor of the Senate, we \nare reminded we live in a competitive global economy. I hear every day \nfrom my colleagues that the United States is not doing all we can do in \nterms of educating our young people in such areas as science, \nengineering, technology, and math. In fact, in the immigration bill we \nare debating, there is an effort to bring hundreds of thousands of \nworkers from abroad, presumably because we do not have enough workers \nwho are knowledgeable in terms of engineering, science, math, and other \ntechnologies. What sense does it make if we are doing a bad job now in \neducating our young people in general, and specifically in the STEM \nareas, that we make it harder for kids to get a college education? What \nsense does that make?\n  I should mention that countries all over the world understand this \npoint, and they are doing a much better job than we are of investing in \ntheir young people in general and specifically in higher education. \nAccording to a report released just yesterday by the OECD, the United \nStates was one of the few advanced countries in the world that did not \nincrease its public investment in education. In fact, the vast majority \nof advanced nations do everything possible, and a lot better job than \nwe do, to make higher education more affordable for all of their \nstudents.\n  A couple weeks ago I had the Ambassador from Denmark coming to the \nState of Vermont to talk about what goes on in Denmark. People asked \nhim: How much does it cost to go to college in Denmark? The answer was: \nNothing, not a penny out of your pocket. It is paid for out of the tax \nbase. In fact, students there get a stipend.\n  But Denmark is not the only country which makes sure all of their \nkids can get a higher education, a graduate school education, a medical \nschool education, while not having to pay for it out of their own \npocket. Austria, Finland, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden also do the \nsame. In Canada, which is an hour away from where I live, average \nannual tuition fees were $4,288 in 2010, roughly half of what they were \nin the United States. Yet the OECD says Canada is one of the most \nexpensive countries for a student to go to college--half the cost of \nwhere we are. Germany is in the process of phasing out all tuition \nfees. Even when German universities did charge tuition, it was roughly \n$1,300 per student.\n  Here is the bottom line: All over this country, students and their \nfamilies are facing crushing debt, radically impacting their lives and \nthe choices they make. There are some in the Senate who say: Yes, that \nis pretty bad. How can we make it even worse? How can we raise interest \nrates for our kids and make it harder for them to go to college and \nmake sure when they get out of college they are deeply in debt?\n  I say: No, I think that is absurd.\n  I remind my colleagues that when Wall Street banks borrow money--do \nmy colleagues know what they are getting it for today? They are getting \nit for less than 1 percent--three-quarters of 1 percent. We are talking \nabout families having to spend 6 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent, 9 \npercent in order to send their kids to college, to help our country, to \nmake it into the middle class. That is absurd. We have to understand \nthat a well-educated population is perhaps the most important thing we \nneed as a nation if we are going to survive in a highly competitive \nglobal economy.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: This Congress has to act and act \nimmediately to prevent the disaster we are looking at from happening; \nthat is, the doubling of interest rates on the Stafford Loan Program, \nwhich will go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1. Short term, we \nhave to extend the 3.4-percent interest rate. Long term, we need to \nmake certain every kid in this country, regardless of income, can go to \ncollege and leave school without a crushing financial debt.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am here today on the immigration bill, \nbut I wish to thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing our attention \nto this very serious issue. It is a little bit of a variation on a \ntheme today about trying to reconnect the priorities of the American \npeople--frankly, whether they are Republicans or Democrats or anybody \nelse--and this place, which has become totally disconnected. I wish to \nsay through the Chair to the Senator from Vermont how on point he is.\n  The people I represent care about the fact that they are living in an \neconomy that even when it grows--I was talking about this a little bit \nearlier--it is not producing sufficient jobs and it is not driving up \nincome. That is what they are concerned about. The student debt crisis \nthe Senator speaks about, where it tripled over the last 10 years, is a \nhuge part of this story. It is a significant part, because if a \nfamily's income is going down but the cost of higher education is \nskyrocketing--by the way, at the same time the cost of health care is \nskyrocketing--it makes it very hard to get ahead. People are \ndesperately worried, as I said earlier, that we are going to be the \nfirst generation of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more, to \nour kids and grandkids.\n  But there is another issue as well, which is today, in the 21st \ncentury in this country, if a person is born and living in poverty, \ntheir chances of getting a college degree or the equivalent of a \ncollege degree are 9 in 100--9 in 100. For the folks in the Chamber, \nfor the pages who are here today, we have 100 chairs, 100 desks in the \nSenate. If these desks represented poor children living in this country \ninstead of Senators, those four desks in the front row and four at that \nend right there, and another one, those are the only folks who would be \ngetting a college degree. Ninety-one other people in this Chamber would \nbe constrained to the margin\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\nof this economy and a margin of our democracy from the outset.\n  Matters are getting worse, not better. We led the world in the \nproduction of college graduates when George Bush--this is not a \npartisan observation, it is a temporal one--when George Bush, the son, \nbecame President. We led the world. Let me tell the young people who \nare here today, 13 years later, we are 16th in the world in the \nproduction of college graduates. Because of our inability to come \ntogether and figure out how to deal comprehensively over time in a \nthoughtful way with the fact that we don't want to stick our kids with \nthis debt we have acquired--which we need to do; we are just hacking \naway at domestic discretionary spending for higher education, for K-12 \neducation, for agriculture, for infrastructure.\n\n  Some of these budgets we have considered--we have not passed them \nhere; they passed them over in the House--would invest only 4 percent \nof our revenue, 4 percent of the revenue we collect, in the future of \nthis country. Ninety-six percent on something else is not going to get \nthe job done.\n  On an issue such as this, where our students are saying: How do you \nat least not make matters worse, we ought to be able to come together \nin a bipartisan way and solve this problem.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for coming to the floor to focus our \nattention on something the American people actually care about.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNET. With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to give my colleagues a point of \nview on the immigration bill before the Senate from somebody other than \na Senator.\n  In the weekend Des Moines Register, there was an article called \n``Another View: Immigration reform plan adds disorder to a failing \nsystem'' by Mark H. Metcalf, who had been an immigration judge and now \nis a county attorney in the State of Kentucky.\n  I am quoting:\n\n       The most recent push for immigration reform is compelling. \n     True to our heritage of inclusion, it succeeds. False to our \n     tradition of rule of law, it fails.\n\n  For any law to forge consensus, it must appeal to both fairness and \ncommon sense. The measure now on the U.S. Senate floor fails this \nlitmus.\n\n       What is sold as a means to simplify and dignify one of our \n     most important national institutions--immigration and \n     naturalization--mandates complexity and much of the same \n     disorder that got us where we are today. The bill's neglect \n     of an effective court system only aggravates this disorder.\n       America's immigration courts are weak, and this latest \n     measure keeps them that way. Put simply, immigration courts \n     cannot impose order. Few aliens ordered removed after years \n     of litigation are ever deported.\n       Edward Grant, a senior immigration appeals judge, noted \n     this impasse in 2006.\n\n  Then he quotes Edward Grant: ``All should be troubled that only a \nsmall fraction of [deportation orders] . . . is actually executed.''\n\n       And he was right. A 2003 Justice Department report found \n     only 3 percent of aliens free during trial were actually \n     removed after courts ruled against them. Those who deserve \n     relief fare just as poorly.\n       By last count, more than 330,000 cases were backlogged. \n     This historic dysfunction offers a glimpse of things to come \n     if the current version of reform passes.\n       The cause of this dysfunction is simple. Immigration courts \n     have no authority over immigration enforcement agencies. \n     Unlike federal district courts that have U.S. marshals, among \n     others, to execute their orders, federal immigration courts \n     have no such muscle.\n       Numbers tell the story.\n       Some 11 million illegal aliens now live in the U.S. Visa \n     overstayers--those who entered America legally and then \n     refused to leave--comprise 40 percent of this total. The rest \n     crossed unguarded borders and entered illegally. Both groups \n     brought children with them. From these two populations, 1.2 \n     million deportation orders remain unexecuted.\n       The immigration courts observed this dysfunction first \n     hand. From 1996 through 2012, the U.S. permitted some 2.2 \n     million aliens to remain free before trial. Nearly 900,000 of \n     these individuals--39 percent of the total--skipped court and \n     disappeared.\n       In the shadow of 9/11, things were even worse. From 2002 \n     through 2006, half of all aliens free awaiting trial \n     vanished. Nothing in the details now being debated addresses \n     this systemic defect, and continued neglect will only \n     diminish public support for worthy initiatives intended to \n     elevate the foreign-born.\n       Fine improvements dot the present legislation. Enhancements \n     that protect lawful American workers, recruitment of the \n     highly skilled into our tech-driven economy, and real-time \n     tracking of visa holders into and out of ports of entry \n     provide overdue fixes.\n       Emphasis on border security demonstrates a seriousness \n     absent from earlier proposals. Those illegally brought to the \n     U.S. as children--better known as ``Dreamers''--earn tracks \n     to citizenship incentivized through higher education and \n     military service.\n\n  Now, let me editorialize here. There are two paragraphs where he says \ngood things about this legislation. I do not necessarily agree with a \ncouple of those points.\n  Now continuing to quote:\n\n       Some reworking is needed; but this value-added approach \n     appeals to our better instincts as a nation. Problems \n     persist, though, in that essential mechanism upon which a \n     rule of law nation depends: effective courts.\n       While the bill authorizes 225 new judges, judicial \n     authority declines. Deportation orders are further enfeebled. \n     Aliens deported from the U.S. may apply to come back, and the \n     thousands who skipped court can request a waiver--and get in \n     line with the many who played by the rules.\n       Fraud is enabled. Courts and immigration agencies alike \n     will be required to accept--without independent \n     verification--aliens' claims to work and residency that make \n     them eligible for the path to citizenship.\n       Constitutional protections are turned upside down.\n\n  Here I editorialize. Listen to this on how our laws are turned upside \ndown. Continuing to quote:\n\n       Aliens in civil deportation proceedings will receive \n     counsel on demand, while citizens receive counsel only when \n     facing criminal charges and only after proving they are \n     indigent.\n  So again editorializing, it gives more constitutional rights and more \nlegal counsel than the common criminal in this country might get.\n\n       Order is subverted. Even felons who are subject to \n     deportation may seek injunctions that allow them to remain in \n     the U.S. In the end, courts that spent years deciding the \n     cases of those who should be removed will see their orders \n     overturned by waivers that mock the judicial process.\n       America's immigration courts express fundamental confidence \n     in those who embrace our shores and the redemptive power of \n     our democracy. For the immigrant in particular, they reveal \n     the beginnings of accountability that are a surety of our \n     exceptionalism.\n       But ignored by administrations both Republican and \n     Democrat, these courts have ceased to do the critical work \n     for which they were created--to definitively decide the \n     claims of those who ask to join our nation and see that those \n     decisions are impartially enforced.\n       So now, instead of debating how we extend the great prize \n     of American citizenship to more of the world's bright and \n     talented, Congress argues whether felons should be deported. \n     This is the small-ball politics that has sabotaged public \n     confidence in immigration. It shows how far we have fallen \n     both in the mission of these special courts and with \n     immigration in general.\n       Courts without authority cannot provide order. Even less \n     can they assure liberty.\n       Only independent and empowered courts are an equal match \n     for the certain risks and superior opportunities that \n     American immigration offers. History proves them not just a \n     priceless check against tyranny, but also an effective \n     antidote for drifting government agencies that delay relief \n     to the deserving and deny sanction to the offender.\n       Such courts are a necessary complement to immigration \n     reform that is inclusive, accountable and commands consensus.\n\n  That is the end of the article in the Des Moines Register by this \nformer immigration judge, Mark H. Metcalf.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening to this, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 744, the Border \nSecurity, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.\n  From the very beginning of this debate, I have said that our Nation \nneeds immigration reform. I have also urged Senate leadership to ensure \nthat the Senate has ample opportunity to debate this bill, amend it, \nand take the hard votes necessary to make the bill as good as it can \nbe. To ignore this problem and to do nothing to change the status quo \nwould be a disservice to the American people and a great detriment to \nour country.\n  I have also said throughout this process that in order to enact \nmeaningful,\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\ncomprehensive immigration reform we have to strengthen border security. \nIt is true that the border security portion of the underlying bill \nneeded significant improvement. Through the hard work and negotiations \nled by my colleagues Senator Hoeven and Senator Corker the border \nsecurity portion of this legislation has been addressed, and for that \nreason I can support this bill.\n  The Hoeven-Corker amendment, which I cosponsored, adds 20,000 \nadditional Border Patrol agents to the southern border. It requires \ntwice the original amount of fencing along the border--700 miles total, \nto be exact--and requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nimplement a border fencing strategy to help ensure that the fence is an \neffective deterrent. It also mandates that the E-Verify system be fully \nimplemented before any registered provisional immigrant can adjust \ntheir status. This will help make sure businesses have a safe and legal \nworkforce. And the amendment requires an electronic entry-exit system \nat all international air and sea ports of entry where U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection officers are currently deployed.\n  By increasing and enhancing security efforts at our borders, by using \nnew technology that will allow us to better monitor activities at our \nborders, we will ensure that those who are here are here lawfully and \nthat they have the opportunity to thrive and succeed, just like many \ngenerations of American immigrants have done.\n  To do nothing now amounts to de facto amnesty for 11 million people \nwho are already here illegally. We must take action to prevent further \nunlawful entry. The current system is backward, and it is broken.\n  This legislation represents a product of many long hours of debate, \ndiscussion, and deliberation in this body. It addresses a problem in \nour country that requires dramatic change and meaningful reform. While \nthis bill is just one step in the process, it is a step in the right \ndirection. It takes into consideration the necessity of securing \nAmerica's borders, while encouraging the lawful immigration of those \nwho would come to our shores to contribute to America's greatness, as \nimmigrants have done since our Nation's founding.\n  In the past, attempts to reform our immigration system failed due to \na process that was neither transparent nor fair.\n  But from the Judiciary Committee proceedings to today, the Senate has \nhad ample opportunity to debate this legislation and amend it. As a \nresult, we have a bill where the good far outweighs the bad. With this \nlegislation, we can address the 11 million undocumented individuals \nliving in the country under de facto amnesty. We can finally secure our \nborders and stop more people from living here illegally. We can fix a \nsystem that has been broken for decades once and for all.\n  We can continue to maintain the smartest, hardest working, most \ncreative workforce in the world. Fighting for what you believe in and \nworking with Members from both sides of the aisle does not mean you are \nturning your back on your principles. Democrats and Republicans can \nfind ways to work together and pass legislation this great Nation \ndeserves. Republicans can do so and still stay true to their \nconservative principles.\n  No question, this has been a contentious debate. My constituents feel \nstrongly about this issue on both sides of the spectrum. Some reporters \nin Nevada like to harp on the fact that my work to find a solution \nbetween Democrats and Republicans has been politically motivated. One \nsuch reporter even resorted to describing my actions in racially \ninsensitive terms.\n  The bottom line: The easy thing to do politically is nothing. The \nharder choice is to govern. We must remember that long before America \nwas the great Nation we are today, before we were the world's greatest \neconomy, a military superpower, a global champion for democracy that \nhas forever changed human history, America was merely an idea. America \nbegan as an idea in the hearts and minds of a persecuted minority that \nlonged for freedom and the opportunity to decide for themselves what \ntheir destiny would be. That idea was brought here by immigrants who \ncrossed the oceans and devoted themselves to the formation of a free \nsociety unlike any the world had ever known.\n  America has always been a Nation of immigrants. That heritage is one \nof the defining aspects of our national success story. When I think \nabout a true American immigrant success story, I think about one of my \nconstituents back home, Mr. Carlos Pereira. Carlos came to America from \nPeru in the 1990s. He and his wife Kathia set out to build their very \nown bakery. But they wanted to build more than a bakery, they wanted to \nbuild a new life for themselves and for their children. They did just \nthat. They built a bakery with their bare hands. They laid the bricks \nand hammered the nails, and after a lot of long nights and hard work, \nthey built Bon Breads in Las Vegas. Today, their company is a world \nrenowned, internationally respected enterprise, and their products are \nused by chefs and restaurants all over the world. Bon Breads is \nresponsible for creating hundreds of jobs in Nevada, and is a perfect \nexample of what our immigration system should encourage.\n  Carlos' hard work, dedication, and perseverance allowed him and his \nbusiness to succeed in a way that would be impossible in many other \ncountries today. I have three naturalized citizens on my staff about \nwhom I can say the exact same thing. That is a true immigrant success \nstory. That is the kind of potential we can unlock by fixing what is \nbroken with our current system.\n  We can improve our economy, create jobs, and strengthen our Nation as \na whole with this immigration reform bill or we can choose to protect \nthe status quo, do nothing to fix the overall problem. This bill is a \nstep forward toward much-needed reform to our immigration system. It is \ntrue to the American idea that has defined our Nation since its \nfounding, the idea that is inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, \nwelcoming the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses, yearning to \nbreathe free.\n  Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made a profound statement \nrecently, that in America it does not matter where you came from, it \nonly matters where you are going. Our immigration laws should embody \nthat principle and enable good hard-working people to come here, study \nhard, start businesses, raise families, and contribute as productive \ncitizens. The bill before us is a good step toward preserving that \nidea.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this immigration reform \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Massachusetts makes his remarks that Senator Grassley be \nrecognized, then I be recognized after him, and then Senator Kaine, \nthose four in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Massachusetts is \nhere, and I look forward to hearing his farewell. Before he does, I \nwanted to say thank you to the Senator from Nevada for his work on this \nbill, for getting us to a bipartisan result, for helping us grow the \nvote, and for the statement he made about surely not one of us would \nhave written the bill exactly the way it is written. But there is much \nmore that is good about this bill than not. I am grateful for his \nsupport. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. COWAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. COWAN. Mr. President, I rise today in my final full work week and \nnot yet 150 days into my Senate career, yet at the precipice of the \nclose of that career. On January 30 of this year, Governor Deval \nPatrick sent me to this Chamber to represent the people of \nMassachusetts and their interests.\n  Yesterday, on June 25, those same people took to the voting booth and \ncalled me home. In doing so, they called Senator-elect Ed Markey to the \nhigh honor of serving this august body. After 37 distinguished years in \nthe House, Senator-elect Markey now has this opportunity to offer his \nvoice, wisdom, accumulated experiences, humor,\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\nesprit de corps, and tireless commitment to justice and equality to the \nSenate. I, for one, believe that Massachusetts and the country will be \nbetter for it. Like a majority of Massachusetts voters who expressed \nthemselves yesterday, I am quite confident Senator-elect Markey will \nserve with distinction and act in the best interests of the citizens he \nis now privileged to represent.\n  The Senator-elect bested a strong candidate who brought a new voice \nand, yes, a new visage to the Massachusetts political scene. I applaud \nGabriel Gomez on a well-run campaign and, most importantly, his \nwillingness to sacrifice so much in an effort to serve the people of \nthe Commonwealth. He started this journey as a relative unknown, but I \nsuspect we have not heard the last of Mr. Gomez. I thank him and his \nfamily for their sacrifices and their willingness to engage.\n  When it comes to farewell speeches, few will top the words offered by \nJohn Kerry on this floor a few months ago. After 28 years of \ndistinguished service to the people of Massachusetts, now-Secretary \nKerry spent nearly an hour reflecting on his service to this body. By \nthe same measure, as merely an interim Senator serving but a few short \nmonths, I probably should have ended my remarks about 45 seconds ago. \nBut before I yield, I will take a few minutes to reflect on my brief \ntime in this body and extend my gratitude to a number of folks.\n  First, I want to acknowledge and recognize the outstanding staff \nmembers in Boston and DC who have helped me serve our constituents to \nthe best of my ability. When Governor Patrick named me as interim \nSenator, a few people--okay, more than a few--openly questioned whether \nI would be up to the task and whether I was capable of accomplishing \nanything other than locating the lavatory during my temporary \nassignment. But I knew something those doubters did not know. I knew I \nwas going to be able to do my best for the folks back home because I \ncame to the Senate armed with the knowledge of the issues by dint of my \ntime in the Patrick-Murray administration. I planned to make a few key \nhires and convince the bulk of Secretary Kerry's Senate staff to stay \non and help me do the job the Governor sent me to do. In other words, I \nknew what I did not know, but I knew enough to hire the people who knew \nthe considerable rest. Boy, have they proven me a genius. If you work \nin the Senate but a day--and I suspect the same is true in the House of \nRepresentatives--you will learn quickly that staff make this place hum, \nand good staff make all the difference in the world. I hope my team \nwill forgive me if I do not list them all by name, thereby avoiding the \nsin of omission, but, instead, all of the staff will accept my \nheartfelt appreciation for their willingness to join my team, show me \nthe ropes, teach a new dog some old tricks, educate me on all of the \nrules that matter, which seem to be written nowhere, and their \nexhibition of degrees of professionalism and service to our country \nthat the public too often thinks is missing in their Congress.\n  To my entire staff, I have been in awe at your greatness. I am \nforever in your debt for your immeasurable contributions to our work in \nthe interests of Massachusetts residents. I look forward to your many \nsuccesses yet to come.\n  To two of my team in particular, Val Young, my chief of staff, and \nLauren Rich, my scheduler, who have known and worked with me for years, \nthank you for your continued willingness to partner with and trust in \nme.\n  If I am being honest about the people who helped me look as though I \nbelong here, I must spend a moment or two acknowledging the wonderful \nwomen and men who comprise the Senate staff. From the Capitol Police, \nwho protect us every day and somehow knew my name on the first day, to \nthe subway operators who always deliver us on time and unfazed, to the \nelevator operators who excel in the art of cutting off reporters and \ntheir annoying questions, to the cloakroom staff who field every \ncloying call about voting schedules and presiding hours, to the clerks \nand Parliamentarians who discreetly tell you what to say and do as \npresiding officer while the public in the gallery silently wonders why \neveryone addresses you as Mr. or Madam President while sitting in that \nchair, to the generous food service staff who look the other way when \nyou go back for seconds and sometimes thirds, and to so many others who \nare the oil that makes this engine hum, each of you has shown me such \npatience, support, and grace that I know your love for this institution \nmay trump even the Members' affection for this place and will sustain \nthe institution long after any one or all of us leave this Chamber. You \nare tremendous resources for every new Senator, and I suspect great \ncomfort to even the longest serving among us. The public may not know \nyou by name or know the importance of your work, but now I do. I have \nbeen honored to serve you.\n  The next folks I recognize are the youngest and most silent among us. \nOf course, I speak of the pages, the young women and men who spend part \nof a high school year dressed and acting in formal traditions of this \nbody. I have yet to speak with an uninteresting page or a page \nuninterested in the Senate and our government. These are dynamic young \npeople who could be doing so many different things with their time but \nthey give their time and service to the Senate and its Members. They \nare indispensable to both. I look forward to the day when my young boys \nwill be of age to follow in the footsteps of these outstanding young \npeople.\n  Last, and by no means least, I want to thank the family and friends \nwho supported my family and me during my short tenure. We often say it \ntakes a village to raise a child, but I can attest it also takes a \nvillage to help an interim Senator meet his duties at Congress and at \nhome. Whether offering me a spare bedroom in Silver Spring or agreeing \nto last minute babysitting duties so my wife and I both could celebrate \nBlack History Month at the White House, our village is vast and \ngenerous. Of course, every village needs a queen. The queen of my \nvillage is my wife Stacy. I was able to serve because she was willing \nto be mom and dad and sacrifice in ways known and unknown while I have \nbeen in DC. Over the past few months, I have missed many homework \nassignments, some birthday dinners, pediatric appointments, school \nperformances, and parent-teacher meetings, but our sons never felt \ntheir dad was absent and unaccounted for because their mom, a supermom, \nmore than made up for my absence.\n  Stacy has been my rock and salvation for nearly 20 years now. I am \nbetter every day for it. Let the record show for now and all time my \nlove and dedication to Stacy.\n  In January of this year I planned to leave the Deval Patrick \nadministration and transition back into private life. I was looking \nforward to more conventional hours, a reprieve from working under the \npublic scrutiny of the press, and spending more time with my wife and \nour young son. So I came to the Senate. Go figure.\n  I was surprised, but deeply honored, when Governor Patrick sent me \nhere to represent the folks back home. I am eternally grateful to the \ngovernment's faith and trust in my ability to serve. This floor on \nwhich I stand today and with which I have become so closely acquainted \nover the last 5 months has been occupied by some of the most dynamic \nand greatest political figures of our Nation's history.\n  From my own State of Massachusetts alone: Adams, Webster, Sumner, \nSaltonstall, Brooke, Kennedy, all who held a seat in the Chamber before \nme, are enough to make any person feel daunted when assuming a desk on \nthis floor.\n  I was appointed to the Senate to fill the seat of another great \nSenator, John Kerry, and work alongside another great Senator, \nElizabeth Warren.\n  Thank you for being here, Elizabeth.\n  Although my time was short, I only sought to uphold not only Senator \nKerry's legacy in this body but the work of all of the esteemed \nSenators who have dedicated their service to the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, and I pledged to be the best partner I could to Senator \nWarren.\n  I entered the Senate at a vexing time in this body's history. As we \nall know, congressional approval levels are dismally low. People across \nthe Nation and political pundits everywhere believe partisanship is a \ndivide too wide to bridge and a wall too high to overcome. Yet despite \nthe overwhelming public pessimism, I came to Washington with two \nachievable objectives:\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\nto serve the people of Massachusetts to the best of my ability and to \nwork with any Senator willing to implement smart, sensible, and \nproductive policy to advance the ideals of our Nation.\n  From the outside, the prospects for bipartisanship may seem slim. \nParty-line votes are the norm. The threat of the filibuster demands a \nsupermajority to pass meaningful legislation. The American people have \ncome to believe Congress is more committed to obstruction than \ncompromise.\n  To the everyday observer we have reached a standstill where \npartisanship outweighs progress and neither side is willing to reach \nacross the aisle for the good of the American people.\n  What I have encountered in the Senate is not a body defined by \nvitriol but one more defined by congeniality and common respect. That \nbegan before I even started here.\n  On the day the Governor announced my appointment, I was pleasantly \nsurprised to receive calls on my personal cell phones--I still don't \nknow how they got those numbers--from Senators King, Hagan, and Cardin. \nI had the pleasure of receiving warm welcomes from Majority Leader Reid \nand Republican Leader McConnell, among so many others that first day.\n  One of the first persons to congratulate me after Senator Warren and \nSecretary Kerry escorted me for my swearing in was my colleague from \nacross the aisle, Senator Tim Scott. Since then Senator Rand Paul and I \nhave recounted our days at Duke and our affection for college \nbasketball.\n  On a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Middle East, I traded \nlife stories and perspectives with Senators Klobuchar and Hoeven and \ndiscussed the comedic genius of Will Ferrell with Senators Gillibrand \nand Graham.\n  Senator Portman stopped by my Commonwealth Coffee last week to wish \nme well as I leave the Senate. He encouraged me every day during my \ntime here.\n  Senator Burr, my next-door neighbor in the Russell Building, has \nalways been good to remind me that I came from North Carolina before I \nhad the privilege to serve in Massachusetts.\n  Senator McCain invited me to cosponsor my first Senate resolution.\n  Senator Manchin has shown me more kindnesses than I can count.\n  The freshman Senators on both sides welcomed me to their class and \noffered never-ending encouragement.\n  Indeed, one of them, Heidi Heitkamp, has become the North Dakota \nsister I never knew I had.\n  I wish I had time to recount every kindness each of the other 99, \nincluding the late Senator Lautenberg, gifted me while here, but I \ndon't. Each has been recorded indelibly in my memory and is returned \nwith gratitude.\n  In April I experienced the very best of this body's character in the \nwake of the Boston Marathon bombings when Members from every corner of \nthis Nation extended their sympathies, their prayers, and pledged their \nassistance and support for the city of Boston and to all those affected \nby that tragedy. In the aftermath we all came together as Americans to \nhonor those killed and to support the wounded during their time of \nrecovery.\n  We saw the same in the wake of terrible tornadoes that swept through \nOklahoma.\n  Upon closer inspection, it is clear all of us here have common bonds \nand share similar goals. If only we are willing to seek out those bonds \nand focus on the goals that are in the best interests of our Nation.\n  While we may not agree on every policy, every line item, or every \nvote, we have each embraced the role of public servant, committed to \nimproving the country we have pledged to support and defend. As I have \ndiscovered in my time here, there is more opportunity for cooperation \nthan the American public might believe. This cooperation has led to \nsome noted successes.\n  Thanks to the bipartisan work in the Agriculture Committee and on the \nSenate floor, we were able to send a farm bill to the House. Through \nthe joint leadership of the so-called Gang of 8, we are debating right \nnow a workable approach to comprehensive immigration reform. We have \nconfirmed five Cabinet Secretaries.\n  In what will remain the most memorable all-nighter of my Senate \ncareer, through a marathon session and more votes in one night than \nmost interim Senators have in a career, the Senate passed a budget. Now \nwe anxiously await the urgent opportunity to conference with the House.\n  I have seen progress, and I remain a true believer in the democratic \nprocess, the core functionality of our government endowed to us by our \nFounding Fathers so many decades ago. I remain a true believer in the \nSenate's system of government and the Senate's role in that system.\n  If I have been asked a question any more frequently than: What are \nyou going to do next, Mo, it has been: Is our system of government \nbroken? Is Congress broken?\n  I have answered truthfully each time: No, our system of government is \nthe greatest ever known and the best example of democracy in human \nhistory.\n  The genius of our Founding Fathers is on display every day on Capitol \nHill, in every State capitol, and every city or townhall across this \nNation. Part of the Founders' genius was the birth of the government \ndesigned to function as the people needed it to but function only as \neffectively as the privileged few empowered within it want it to work, \nor as Secretary Kerry himself said best a few months ago in his final \nfloor remarks:\n\n       I do not believe the Senate is broken. . . . There is \n     nothing wrong with the Senate that can't be fixed by what's \n     right about the Senate--the predominant and weighty notion \n     that 100 American citizens, chosen by their neighbors [or \n     Governor, in my case] to serve from States as different from \n     Massachusetts and Montana, can always choose to put parochial \n     or personal interests aside and find the national interest.\n\n  What an awesome responsibility and privilege.\n  In my scant 5 months I have seen the promise of those words realized \nin more ways and in more interactions than the public, unfortunately, \nhas had occasion to witness. I believe in that unlimited promise still.\n  I also have been part of history while I was here. With my \nappointment, in coincidence with the appointment of Senator Scott, two \nAfrican Americans are serving in this body concurrently for the first \ntime in our Nation's history.\n  Senator Scott and I are, respectively, the seventh and eighth Black \nSenators to serve in this body. While I believe this number to be far \ntoo few, I am also hopeful that it is a sign that these United States \nwill soon be represented by a more diverse population that more closely \nreflects the diverse country that we are and the diversity of opinions \nthat exist across and within our diverse Nation.\n  With different perspectives, different backgrounds, different races, \nreligions, and creeds, we are better equipped to confront the issues \nthat face our vast and changing Nation. America has always been and \nalways will be a nation of immigrants, where religious freedom is in \nour DNA, where more and more we are chipping away at the barriers \npreventing us from achieving true marriage equality, and where people \nworldwide still yearn to reach our shores to enjoy our freedoms.\n  A Congress that is more reflective of this America, as this Congress \nis becoming, will be good for America.\n  Finally, I offer my heartfelt gratitude to the people of \nMassachusetts. Not one person was given a chance to vote for or against \nme, but I have gone about my work every day as if they had. I came to \nthis body beholden to Massachusetts, her residents, and the country \nonly, and leave confident that I have stayed true to that honor.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Commonwealth, it has been a true honor \nand privilege to represent you as your junior Senator in the Senate.\n  With that, this will likely be the final time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I appreciate very much the remarks of Senator Cowan. The only thing \nhe said that I disagree with is: No one had a chance to vote for him to \nget here.\n  There was one big vote that was very important, a man by the name of \nDeval Patrick. Once he made that decision, you were our Senator as well \nas the Senator of Massachusetts.\n  I, of course, know Deval Patrick. We all saw him at the convention \ngiving his brilliant speech. He was swarmed with people giving him \nadvice as to\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\nwho he should select to replace Senator Kerry. He called me and said: \nDon't worry about it. I am going to select the best person from the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts to represent Senator Kerry's seat for the \ninterim.\n  He was right, and I have told Governor Patrick on the telephone. A \ncouple of weeks ago I said: Make sure to call Governor Patrick for me--\nbecause I know they are good friends--and tell him I told you how much \nwe all admire you.\n  In the Democratic caucus yesterday, this good man didn't get one \nstanding ovation, he received two. This is rare. He got that because he \nis a genuine person. He came here now and talked about the goodness of \nthis body. We need more of that.\n  Senator Cowan, thank you very much. I admire you. I know in the paper \ntoday you said that you are always going to be Mo, but to me you are \nalways going to be Senator Cowan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts--the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. May I interrupt for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. President, first of all, we are operating under a unanimous \nconsent request, and I would ask if we can modify that to hear from the \nSenator from Massachusetts and then revert back to the unanimous \nconsent request that has been granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I will be brief.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, for 4 months I have had the privilege of \nserving alongside my good friend Mo Cowan. From the time he was sworn \nin, Mo hit the ground running. Even though his time here was short, Mo \nhas been a committed and strong advocate for the people of \nMassachusetts and here in Washington.\n  As former chief of staff to Governor Patrick, Mo brought to the \nSenate a deep knowledge of the issues facing our Commonwealth. Through \nhis committee work and his outreach to his constituents, his careful \nconsideration of important national issues, he has worked tirelessly to \nensure that the interests of the people of Massachusetts are well \nrepresented and the people of America are well served.\n  He has built great relationships and earned the respect of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  I very much enjoyed getting to know Mo's wonderful family: his smart, \ntalented, and patient wife Stacy and their two young boys. I am sure \nGrant and Miles are looking forward to having their dad closer to home \nagain.\n  Mo has been a dedicated public servant, and his time in the Senate \nonly adds to his fine record of service on behalf of the people of the \nCommonwealth. It has been an honor to work together with Mo fighting \ntogether for Massachusetts families. I wish him and I wish his family \nthe very best. It has been an honor to be a partner of Senator Cowan in \nthe Senate.\n  Thank you, Mo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator yield for a second? I hate to \ninterrupt.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Go ahead.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will buy the Senator's book.\n  May I have 1 minute to say something about our departing colleague \nbecause I may not be able to get back. Literally, 1 minute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate that, I say to the Senator.\n  I would like to say to Senator Cowan, ``Mo,'' from Massachusetts: I \nhaven't known you very long, but I have found you to be someone who has \nbeen, quite frankly, very earnest in their time in the Senate, very \nsmart, and a lot of fun. We got to travel to Egypt, to Turkey, to \nIsrael to see some of the more dangerous places in the world, and I \njust want to let the people of Massachusetts know that I have met a lot \nof colleagues in my time here, but this is one fine man. I wish you all \nthe best. I have learned a lot from you. I know you are originally from \nNorth Carolina. That is probably why we hit it off. I have learned a \nlot and I have laughed a lot. You are a fine man and we wish you well. \nI hope that maybe public service is in your future, but whatever you \ndo, I know you will do it well. Godspeed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me just say kind of the same thing. I \nhad occasion to research Senator Cowan. I do this because one of the \nthings I enjoy doing every Wednesday morning, when we have our Prayer \nBreakfast, is introducing those who are speaking. He was speaking. When \none researches someone like him and you find things out, you kind of \nredevelop a love for everyone, and I wonder: Are you sure you are in \nthe right place here? I have to question that.\n  But I hold you in the highest regard. I am very familiar with how you \ntick, how you think, what you said, and we will miss you in this place. \nThank you so much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have a unanimous consent request. \nSenator Grassley was going to be next, and I will go ahead and take his \ntime.\n  The unanimous consent request was that I be recognized as in morning \nbusiness for such time as I shall consume.\n  Let me share a couple of things. First of all, I am looking forward \nto serving with the Senator who was elected yesterday. I think he will \nfind out something that I found out when I was first elected to the \nSenate after serving for several years in the House of Representatives: \nIt is a more civil place. It is a place where we can have differences \nof opinion, where we disagree with each other, but we do so in a very \nfriendly way.\n  I am actually looking forward to that because there have been times \nwhen our discourse, our discussions with each other were not friendly, \nbut I think it will turn out to be a total change. I wish to get on \nrecord to say that I am looking forward to serving with our newly \nelected Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I look forward to being with him, although I think he has every \nreason and opportunity to change his mind on some of the positions he \nhas taken in the past.\n  Let me share something I didn't say when I had the floor yesterday \nand was talking a little bit about President Obama's talk. There were \nfour things that I didn't hear, and I am going to repeat them. They are \nstatements that were made by President Obama talking before an \naudience.\n  I have to say I truly believe I know the reason for this long talk \nthat he gave yesterday, because he had served for 4 years. He knew his \nfar-left base was demanding some type of cap and trade. He knew he \ndidn't have the votes to pass it. So he was not able to push that, \nknowing before the election, if this came out, what kind of a tax \nincrease this would be on the American people. So he waited until after \nthe election, and that is what we heard yesterday.\n\n  Some of the things he said were a little bit insulting, but I can \nhandle that. He said he lacks ``patience for anyone who denies that \nthis problem is real.'' He is talking about global warming. He is \ntrying to revive global warming.\n  I say revive because it is interesting that when it started out 12 \nyears ago it was global warming. Remember Kyoto? That is what it was \nall about, the Kyoto treaty. In fact, they came back from Rio de \nJaneiro and the treaty was never submitted by President Bill Clinton to \nthe Senate for ratification. The reason was the votes weren't there. So \ntime went by and they decided, since it is not warming and we want to \nkeep this thing alive and we want to do all we can to destroy \nCO2 in our society, let's call it something else. So they \ncalled it climate change. A few other titles came along in the \nmeantime. For the first time it has now reverted back, after several \nyears, to global warming.\n  Some of the statements he made were: ``We don't have time for a \nmeeting of the Flat Earth Society,'' and ``sticking your head in the \nsand might make you feel safer, but it's not going to protect you from \nthe coming storm.'' Listen to this:\n\n       The 12 warmest years in recorded history have all come in \n     the last 15 years. Last year, temperatures in some areas of \n     the ocean reached record highs, and ice in the Arctic sank to \n     its smallest size on record--faster than most models had \n     predicted it would. These are the facts.\n\n  Those aren't the facts. That is not even true, but it is interesting \nwe would be trying to revive this. I know there are a lot of people all \nexcited out there who have said: Oh, for the last 4\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\nyears we haven't said anything about global warming. Now we are talking \nabout it and now something is going to be done. I would like to quote \nthis from the Economist:\n\n       Over the past 15 years air temperatures at the Earth's \n     surface have been flat while greenhouse-gas emissions have \n     continued to soar. The world added roughly 100 billion tonnes \n     of carbon to the atmosphere between 2000 and 2010. That is \n     about a quarter of all the CO2 put there by \n     humanity since 1750.\n\n  Of course, we know that is true because we know the major surge came \nin the 1940s following World War II.\n  Continuing to quote the article, which quotes James Hansen, who is \none of the major movers behind this whole thing--the global warming \nmovement:\n\n       And yet, as James Hansen, the head of NASA'S Goddard \n     Institute for Space Studies, observes, ``the five-year mean \n     global temperature has been flat for a decade.''\n\n  This is a guy on the other side who has always been held up to be the \nauthentic knowledgeable person.\n  Here is a quote from the NASA Goddard Paper from January of this \nyear:\n\n       The five-year mean global temperature has been flat for a \n     decade, which we interpret as a combination of natural \n     variability and a slowdown in the growth rate of the net \n     climate forcing.\n\n  A quote from Reuters in April, 2013:\n\n       Scientists are struggling to explain a slowdown in climate \n     change that has exposed gaps in their understanding and \n     defies a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions. . . . Some \n     experts say their trust in climate science has declined \n     because of the many uncertainties. The UN's Intergovernmental \n     Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had to correct a 2007 report \n     that exaggerated the pace of melt of the Himalayan glaciers \n     and wrongly said they could all vanish by 2035.\n\n  All that sounded good at the time, but it was a lie. Still quoting \nfrom the article:\n\n       ``My own confidence in the data has gone down in the past \n     five years,'' said Richard Tol, an expert in climate change \n     and professor of economics at the University of Sussex in \n     England.\n\n  I could go on and on. Yesterday on the floor I talked about Richard \nLindzen with MIT, considered by many people to be the foremost \nauthority on climate anywhere in the country, and he is talking about \nwhat the motive is behind people to promote this thing. He said \ncontrolling CO2--and I am quoting from memory now--is a \nbureaucrat's dream. If you control climate, you control life. That is \nexactly what we were talking about at that time, and it was true.\n  We have covered all these things, and I have said for several years \nnow that people understand the science isn't there. I can remember some \nof my Republican friends got upset with me because I often said good \nthings about Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson was the first Administrator of \nthe EPA under President Obama, and she is, of course, a liberal and all \nof that. But she has a propensity for telling the truth, and that is \nall I ask for in people who are serving in public office. In fact, she \nhas done that, and I wish to share one thing with my colleagues.\n  When they are unable to pass any kind of cap-and-trade bill--and keep \nin mind the last time they tried to do it was the bill that was \nintroduced by two House Members, one of whom was elected to the Senate \nyesterday. In that cap-and-trade bill, people realized what the size of \nthe tax increase would be and it went down in flames. So when the big \nU.N. party--by the way, when I talk about the U.N.'s Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change--the IPCC--that is something a lot of people \ndon't know about. That is the United Nations. They are the ones that \nput that together to fortify their position that we need to do \nsomething to equalize the wealth of nations worldwide.\n  In fact, I wrote a book about that. I would not ask anyone to buy it \nbecause that would be inappropriate, but I will loan it to you, if you \nwant to read it, and I cover that in a lot of detail. But on this \nsubject, I asked Lisa Jackson the question, right before going to \nCopenhagen--and Copenhagen is the biggest party of the year.\n  I am going to wind this up, and I will continue this later, but I \nwould only say the science is not there, with what they were talking \nabout yesterday. I think I pretty much made the point I came to make.\n  But returning to Lisa Jackson, right before everyone was going to \nCopenhagen--and remember, IPCC is part of the United Nations and once a \nyear they throw a big party. Friends of mine, I can remember one from \nAfrica showing up at one of these parties and I said: You don't believe \nall this global warming stuff, do you? He said: No, but this is the \nbiggest party of the year. So they all show up.\n  At that time--I am not sure where it was, but the time I am talking \nabout, 2 years ago, it was in Copenhagen. So I said, right before I \nleft for Copenhagen to be a one-man truth squad there, I said to Lisa \nJackson, the Administrator of the EPA serving at the time, in a hearing \nwe had: I have a feeling once I leave town, since you can't pass any \nkind of cap and trade, you are going to try to do it through regulation \nand you are going to have to have an endangerment finding, and when you \nhave an endangerment finding, it has to be based on some type of \nscience. What science are you going to use? She said: The IPCC, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--the United Nations.\n  As luck would have it--it wasn't months after it or weeks after \nthat--hours after that Climategate came in and they were exposed for \nlying about the science for all those years. So the timing could not \nhave been better.\n  I would only say I am glad this issue has opened up again because I \nhad a dusty old file on climate change I haven't used for 5 years and I \nhave gotten it out and we are ready to use it again. I just hope the \nAmerican people will look at the beautiful political speech made by the \nPresident yesterday for actually what it is.\n  Let's keep in mind the cost of this anytime we want to go into the \nextreme position of saying that CO2 is the cause of climate \nchange or of global warming. We are talking about a tax increase to the \nAmerican people. One of the Senators stood after I said this yesterday \nand said there is no evidence of that yet. That was the Wharton School \nof Economics and MIT that came out with those figures.\n  The last thing I will say, God is still up there and climate is going \nto change and it has. I can remember studying this--and going from \nmemory now, not reading anything--and reading about the first time they \ncame out with this fact that we are all going to die because the world \nis going to freeze over. That was in 1895. In 1895, they talked about \nthis disaster that was coming upon us--the coming ice age, they said. \nThen, in 1918, all of a sudden the climate started getting warmer. It \nwas going through these cycles. It has been happening since the \nbeginning of time. It got warmer. That is when global warming first \ncame up, in 1918.\n  Then, in 1984, the next cycle came in, and that was a cold cycle. But \nlisten to this, because what is interesting about this is in 1944, \nafter the Second World War, we had the largest surge in CO2 \nin our country's history. It precipitated not a warming period but \nanother cooling period, which lasted until 1975. Then, of course, \nanother warming period came in, which I disagree with all the \nstatements that were made--certainly by the President yesterday and by \nmany of the Members of this body--now we are precipitating going into a \nleveling off and perhaps a warming period.\n  So it is going to be changing, and it is a little arrogant for us in \nthis country to look at these God cycles up there and say we can do \nsomething to change that because we can't. It is a beautiful world we \nare in, and we are going to try to make it better, but we don't need \nthe largest tax increase in America's history to make it better.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the only unanimous consent request I am \ngoing to make is at the end of my remarks I will ask for inclusion of \nsomething in the Record.\n  I wish to share with the public what is taking place on the \nimmigration bill before us. Unfortunately, very little is taking place. \nWe have been on the floor of the Senate considering this bill for 2\\1/\n2\\ weeks, and only 13 amendments have been disposed of. We have had \nnine rollcall votes on amendments, and three of those amendments were \ntabling votes. Yet over 550 amendments have been filed to this bill. \nSenators are still filing amendments. The fact is less than 3 percent \nof all amendments filed have actually been considered. For a process \nthat was labeled as ``fair\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\nand open,'' with the invitation to file amendments, even from the \npeople who wrote the bill, the Gang of 8, it has become laughable.\n  Our side has been asking for votes. We have tried to call up \namendments. Last night we sent a list of 34 amendments over to the \nmajority and requested votes on them. I am told they have refused that \nlist, and I think it is because there are some tough votes on those \namendments. They want to limit the number of amendments that can be \nconsidered. They want to choose the amendments. In a sense, they want \nto tell Republicans which amendments we can offer from our side.\n  That is not right. I am very disappointed not just for myself but for \na lot of other Members of the body. There is no deliberation. It seems \nas though there is no path forward to have votes to make the bill \nbetter. And, of course, this isn't the way to legislate. Immigration \nreform is an important matter. We have to get it right. We shouldn't \nrush a bill just to get it done, especially if we are going to pass a \nbad bill. This bill shouldn't be rushed if we are getting it wrong. We \nhave to get it right. It is unfortunate that what has happened on the \nfloor of the Senate--9 rollcall votes out of 550 amendments, and \ncounting, that have been filed. So much for the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.\n  Immigration reform hasn't been debated on this floor since 2007, and \nas far as I can remember, a major piece of legislation such as this on \nimmigration hasn't passed the Senate since 1986.\n  It may seem that we have been on the bill for a long time. Compared \nto a lot of other issues, it has been a longer time. But most of the \ntime has been spent delaying actual debate and consideration of \namendments, while Members craft a grand bargain compromise behind \nclosed doors. Of course, that has been adopted at this point in the \nprocess.\n  Unfortunately, it appears this bill has been precooked, deals have \nbeen made, and apparently having an open debate on amendments to the \nbill isn't part of that deal on any more than the few amendments we \nhave discussed--particularly those amendments that could substantively \nchange the underlying bill for the better. So we get the impression \nthat, sorry, the kitchen is closed.\n  What has happened? We are supposed to be the most deliberative body \nin the world. We pride ourselves on that. But now we are going to rely \non the House of Representatives to do our job to be deliberative and to \nfix this legislation. I have great hopes when this process is done \nthrough conference that I can vote for a bill that will go to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  As I have said before, the Judiciary Committee markup was full and \nopen, and I have complimented Chairman Leahy many times on that point. \nIt is too bad that process couldn't have been carried out here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Whether members were pleased in committee with the vote results for \ntheir amendments, in committee the members at least had the opportunity \nto offer amendments for debate and consideration. Amendments were \ndebated. Amendments were voted on. But that hasn't been the case in the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ weeks here on the Senate floor.\n  We have tried to offer amendments to this over 1,000-page-long bill. \nThe majority is shutting us out. They have gotten the votes they need \nto pass this bill through Members getting their favorite amendments \ninto the bill, and some of these seem to me to be special interest \nprovisions and some of them tend to be like the cornhusker kickback \nsweeteners of ObamaCare fame. Now we are getting the door to the shop \nclosed.\n  It is important for the public to know we have tried to make this \nbill better by trying to offer amendments. We have given the other side \na list, and I think it has been flatly refused. It is not too much to \nask for this number of amendments to be considered. That list had 34 \namendments--that is 34 amendments out of 550 filed. Senators want to \nsee a lot more amendments considered and voted on, but we have limited \nthe number to 34.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of \namendments we asked the majority to consider before final passage.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       1. Grassley 1570--gangs\n       2. Vitter-#1577 or 1578--moves trigger in Corker-Hoeven \n     before RPI\n       3. Vitter--Strike Amnesty (#1474)\n       4. Vitter--Voter Integrity Protection Act (#1290)\n       5. Vitter--Child Tax Credit (#1289)\n       6. Vitter-1473--no RPI status for convicted drunk drivers\n       7. Vitter-1445--WIRE Act\n       8. Vitter--Sanctuary Cities 1291\n       9. Vitter--VAWA 1330\n       10. Inhofe-1560--Zadvydas, detention for longer than six \n     months\n       11.

Johnson--1 year application period\n       34. Johnson--EITC\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I also wanted to mention even though I oppose the bill, I \ndo think they have done a good job of trying to get some amendments \nout, particularly Senator Grassley and Senator McCain, who offered the \nopportunity to have my amendment. It was a good amendment. It was so \ngood that the ACLU is scoring against it. Hopefully, we will get a \nchance to get those in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Senator Mo Cowan\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was here on the floor when Senator Mo \nCowan gave his farewell remarks. He came to the Senate as an appointee \nto fill the spot John Kerry left vacant when he left to the Secretary \nof State's position. I can't think of a person who came to the Senate \nwho has been so warmly received so quickly.\n  Senator Harry Reid made the comment that it is rare for a new \nMember--just 6 months of seniority--to get a standing ovation at his \ncaucus lunch. Mo Cowan got two yesterday, which I think is a tribute to \nthe fact that we enjoyed his service and value his friendship, and will \nremember him for his fine representation of the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts.\n  Mo Udall, a wise and witty longtime member of this Senate, famously \nsaid that once politics gets in your blood, the only cure is embalming \nfluid.\n  There is a lot of evidence to support that idea. But another Mo--\nSenator Mo Cowan--is an exception to the rule.\n  When he was appointed 5 months ago to fill the seat vacated by \nSecretary of State John Kerry, Senator Cowan said he was happy to serve \nhis State--but only a new Senator could be elected to finish Secretary \nKerry's term in this Senate.\n  Well, yesterday Massachusetts voters went to the polls to choose that \nnew Senator. I look forward to Senator Ed Markey joining this body very \nsoon.\n  For now, I want to take a moment to thank Mo Cowan for his service to \nhis State, this Senate and our Nation.\n  Senator Cowan has served with wisdom, courage and civility. He has \nmade\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\nfriends and allies on both sides of the aisle--no easy feat.\n  I have to confess, I was probably pre-disposed to like Senator Cowan \nbecause of his sartorial style. The last Senator to wear a bow-tie so \nregularly was my dear friend and political mentor, Paul Simon.\n  More admirable than Senator Cowan's sense of style, however, is his \nsense of fairness and decency and courage.\n  He has co-sponsored important bills including the Paycheck Fairness \nAct, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, the Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act, and the Safe Chemical Act.\n  In the wake of the terrible murders of 20 little children and their \nteachers in Newtown, CT, Senator Cowan voted for sensible regulations \nto help keep weapons of war out of the hands of criminals and those \nwith serious mental illness.\n  He voted for a budget resolution that would enable us to continue \nreducing the Federal deficit while still, meeting our obligations today \nand investing in a secure future.\n  I am particularly grateful to Senator Cowan for co-sponsoring a bill \nSenator Enzi and I have worked on for several years and which this \nSenate passed. The Marketplace Fairness Act will give States--if they \nwish to use it--a way to collect sales and use taxes in Internet \npurchases--taxes that are already owed but rarely collected. \nMassachusetts lost $268 million last year because of the inability to \ncollect these taxes.\n  He flew on Air Force One with President Obama and travelled to the \nMiddle East with a bipartisan group of Senators to investigate the \nSyrian civil war.\n  Senator Cowan has also been a diligent defender of the people of \nMassachusetts. He and Senator Warren have worked especially hard to \nprotect their State's struggling fishing industry.\n  His service here was short, but his record is impressive. It is \nespecially impressive considering the fact that before he was sworn in \nas a Senator, Mo Cowan had never held a single elective position in his \nlife.\n  William Maurice ``Mo'' Cowan was born in a small rural town in North \nCarolina that he sometimes likens to the old TV town of Mayberry. His \nfather died when Mo was 16 years old. His widowed mother raised Mo and \nhis sisters on the money she earned as a seamstress, the equivalent of \nabout minimum wage.\n  Mo Cowan graduated from Duke University--the first person in his \nfamily to graduate from a 4-year college. He earned a law degree from \nNortheastern School of Law in Boston.\n  He earned a reputation as a very good lawyer and a mentor to other \nyoung lawyers in the Boston area, especially young lawyers of color.\n  Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick convinced Senator Cowan to join \nhis administration as his chief counsel and later promoted him to chief \nof staff.\n  When Governor Patrick approached Senator Cowan about serving as \nMassachusetts' junior Senator until yesterday's special election could \nbe held, Senator Cowan tried to persuade the Governor to choose someone \nelse. Thank goodness he lost that debate.\n  Mo Cowan is a young man--especially by Senate standards--just 44 \nyears old. He was born on April 4, 1969. He came into this world 1 year \nto the day after Dr. Martin Luther King died.\n  With his appointment to the Senate, Senator Cowan became the eighth \nAfrican American ever to serve in this body. He and Senator Scott made \nhistory--the first time that two African Americans had ever served in \nthis Senate at the same time.\n  I think Dr. King would be pleased that we have made progress, but he \nwould also remind us that we still have a long way to in achieving a \nSenate that better reflects the American people, and he would be right.\n  I might add that the Supreme Court's ruling yesterday striking down \nparts of the Voting Rights Act means we may have to work even harder to \nmake that possible. And I am committed to doing so.\n  On the day that Senator Cowan was sworn in to this body, he said: \nDays like today are what my mother spoke of when I was a kid, [and she \nsaid] that if you worked hard and did the right things and you treated \npeoples well, anything could happen.\n  Years from now, other mothers will teach that lesson to their sons \nand daughters--and they will able to point to Senator Cowan as proof.\n  In closing I want to thank Senator Cowan's wife Stacy and their young \nsons Miles and Grant for sharing so much of their husband and father \nwith this Senate.\n  To my colleague Senator Cowan: It has been a privilege to work with \nyou.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is pending before the Senate is a \npiece of history. For those who are witnessing this debate--whether in \nthe galleries or at home on C-SPAN--you are watching a debate on the \nfloor of the Senate that doesn't happen very often. We are debating the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. It is the first time in 25 years \nwe have tackled this issue.\n  If you look at the history of the United States, you know right off \nthe bat we are a Nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to \nthis country. Many of us have immigrant parents and grandparents and \ngreat-grandparents. That is who we are. We come from all over the world \nto this great Nation. But the history of immigration law will tell you \nthat immigrants aren't always well or warmly received. There have been \nperiods in history where we have excluded people from certain countries \nand excluded immigrants in general. There were other periods where we \ncouldn't wait to get the cheap labor from anyplace in the world to \nbuild this great Nation. We have had real mixed feelings when it comes \nto immigration.\n  The sad reality is for 25 years our immigration laws haven't worked \nwell. The estimate is we have about 11 million undocumented people \nliving in America. I have come to know many of them. They are not who \nyou think they are. Many of them turn out to be the mothers in a \nhousehold where the father and all the kids are American citizens. Many \nof them turn out to be the people who sat down next to you in church. \nThey are the ones who, incidentally, cleared your table at the \nrestaurant. They are making the beds in your hotel room for the next \nmorning. They are watching your kids in daycare. And they are taking \ncare of your mom at the nursing home. These are the undocumented people \nof America, many of them just asking for a chance to be part of this \nAmerican family. This bill gives them a chance.\n  But it isn't easy. They have to come forward and register with the \ngovernment, tell us who they are, where they live, where they work, and \ntell us about their families. Then they have to pay a fine of $500. \nThat is the first installment. Then any job they have, they have to pay \ntheir taxes and submit themselves to a criminal background check.\n  If that isn't enough, we tell them we are going to continue to \nmonitor them over 10 years, watching them. During that period of time \nthey have to demonstrate they are learning English. Then if they \ncomplete that 10-year period, they have a 3-year chance to become \ncitizens. It is a 13-year process. Many of them have already been here \nfor 10 years or more. But if they are ready to travel down this long \nroad--and many are--at the end of the day their dream will come true. \nThey will be citizens in America. It is no amnesty. They are going to \npay a heavy price to make it all the way through those 13 years, but it \ngives them their chance, and it makes us a safer Nation knowing who \nthey are, where they live, and where they work.\n  We are going to tighten our system so people applying for jobs in the \nfuture have to prove who they are--no more phony Social Security \nnumbers, no more phony IDs. There is going to have to be real proof \nbefore you get a job in America.\n  Approximately 40 percent came here on a visitor's visa and \noverstayed. If you came here on that visa, we are going to track you \ninto America and out of America. The system is going to be tough.\n  And when it comes to the border, there is a difference of opinion \nbetween the Democratic side and the Republican side of the aisle about \nhow much\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\nto do. Well, we have made a dramatic investment in border security \nbetween the United States and Mexico. In the last 10 years we have \nincreased the Border Patrol between the two countries from 10,000 to \n20,000. In many sectors we now have 97-percent effectiveness stopping \nthose who try to cross the border. We are going to invest 20,000 more \nworkers on that border--40,000 Border Patrol people.\n  People who have come to the floor critical of this bill say it isn't \nenough. I will have to tell you, for some of these folks it will never \nbe enough. We are going to put billions of dollars into making that \nborder safe and reducing, if not eliminating, illegal immigration. That \nis part of our promise in this bipartisan agreement that was reached.\n  I have been fortunate to serve with the so-called Gang of 8, four \nDemocrats and four Republicans. We have sat across the table for 5 \nmonths now, 30 different sessions, working out all the details, and we \nhave come up with an agreement--a good bipartisan agreement that is \nfinally going to move us forward.\n  I might add one footnote. Twelve years ago, I introduced a bill \ncalled the DREAM Act, and said children brought to this country deserve \na special chance to become citizens. They didn't do anything wrong. \nThey didn't break any laws. They were 2 and 5 and 10 years old. They \nwere brought here by their parents. They deserve a chance. This bill is \nthe strongest bill ever brought to the floor of the Senate when it \ncomes to the DREAMers. I am proud of that. I am happy these young \npeople will finally get the chance to prove themselves, as I am sure \nthey will, when it comes to the future of this country.\n  There are lots of other provisions. Never take for granted that the \nfruits and vegetables on your table appear magically. They are picked, \nand many of them are picked by foreign workers, migrant workers. We \nhave an agriculture worker section here, which is important for the \nfuture of our agricultural economy. We have a section when it comes to \nthe talented people we want to keep in the United States once educated \nhere, and those we can bring in to help create jobs in our country. But \nthe first rule in this bill, and the one I insisted on: Every job has \nto be offered to an American first. With our unemployment, that is the \nstarting point, and it is included in this bill and it should be.\n  There are parts of this bill I don't applaud or necessarily endorse, \nbut it is the product of a compromise. We are not only proving to this \nNation that we can address the biggest issue in our heritage, we are \ntrying to prove to this Nation this Chamber--this Senate--can go to \nwork, roll up its sleeves, and get something done on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  There will be some ``no'' votes, but the test votes we have had so \nfar show a strong bipartisan majority to move forward. If we get it \ndone--and I hope to God we do during the course of this week--I pray \nthat my colleagues over in the House will accept their responsibility \nto this Nation to accept the need for comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see Senator King from Maine here. I \nwill only talk for a minute. I will share some thoughts later about \nwhere I see the difficulties with the immigration bill.\n  I would say that for the vast majority of the people who will be \nlegalized or who will be coming into the country, businesses will be \nunder no requirement to hire Americans first. That is not accurate, and \nit is a cause of concern for me.\n\n\n                            Farewell Remarks\n\n  I wish to share some brief remarks. I know we have a lot to do, but I \nwas here to hear Senator Cowan's farewell remarks to us. They were \ndelivered eloquently and effectively, with integrity and graciousness \nand a sense of purpose that I found impressive. I think all of us have \nfound him impressive, getting to know him. I heard him share his \nbackground recently, how he came to this position. He does so with a \nconstancy of purpose and clear vision for what he believes is right. He \nhas been raised right, and he reflects those values and has done so in \nthe Senate.\n  It is a pleasure for me to have had the opportunity to get to know \nhim. I would just say it must be a special thrill for him to be able \nto, all of a sudden, find himself, as he said so nicely, in the U.S. \nSenate without having to campaign, raise money, or otherwise be in that \nposition.\n  He served his State with skill and dedication. It is a pleasure to \nhave served with him. I wish him Godspeed in his future endeavors.\n  I understand the Senator from Maine is going to share with us some \nvaluable history today. Maybe a connection between Maine and Alabama \nmight even be mentioned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise in morning business, and I request \nunanimous consent for 15 minutes for remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Battle of Gettysburg\n\n  Mr. KING. We all know that next Thursday, a week from tomorrow, is \nour Nation's most important anniversary--July 4, 1776, the birthday of \nthe country. But Tuesday, July 2, is also one of our most important \nanniversaries because July 1, 2, and 3 are the days the Battle of \nGettysburg occurred. That was probably the defining event in the \nhistory of this country. It is especially important this year because \nit is the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. What I would \nlike to do is share a few moments about one particular aspect of that \nbattle. It does indeed involve Maine and Alabama. It involves a man \nfrom Maine named Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who in 1862 was a \nprofessor of modern languages at Bowdoin College in Maine. He was not a \nsoldier, had no history in the military, but decided that he had a \nvision of America and he wanted to serve his country.\n  He joined a volunteer regiment organized in Maine in August of 1862 \ncalled the 20th Maine regiment. They came down the east coast, up the \nPotomac to Washington, and were immediately deployed to Antietam in \nSeptember of 1862--the bloodiest day in American history. Fortunately \nfor the 20th Maine, they were held in reserve that day. They did see \naction over the course of the fall and early winter at the Battle of \nFredericksburg. Then, along with 2 great armies, they headed north into \nthe State of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, you are going to have to bear with my cartographic \nskills. I think it would be helpful if we can see what happened. It is \neasy to draw Virginia because it is a big triangle, so this is \nVirginia. Here is the Maryland-Pennsylvania border.\n  In the early summer of 1863, two great armies snaked north out of \nVirginia. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia came up the west side of the \nfoothills of the Appalachians and into Pennsylvania, shadowed by \nMeade's Army of the Potomac, both 90,000 men. Meade was leading the way \ninto Pennsylvania without a particular destination but a desire to \nengage the Federal Army in one climactic battle which he thought \ncorrectly could have ended the Civil War.\n  Nobody knows exactly why on July 1 of 1863 those two armies collided \nin the little town of Gettysburg. There is a rumor that there was a \nshoe factory there and that the southern Army was going to go and \nrequisition those shoes. For whatever reason, the two armies met in \nthis little town of Gettysburg, PA. One of the interesting things about \nthe battle was that Lee's army had already gotten almost to Harrisburg \nand came down into Gettysburg. The Union Army was coming up the \nTaneytown Road from Washington and from the south, and they came in in \nthis direction. So at the Battle of Gettysburg, the southern army came \nin from the north, and the northern army came in from the south.\n  On the first day of the battle, there was a standoff. They met almost \nby accident in this town. There was fierce fighting in the streets of \nGettysburg, in the south of the town, and it was essentially a draw.\n  At the end of the day on July 1--and the word flashed back to both \narmies that this was it. This was the confrontation, and reinforcements \ncame in from both lines of march to meet at this little town.\n  What happened on the second day was that on the morning of the second \nday the Union troops--again, if this is\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\nthe town up here, the Union troops ended up on a hill called Culp's \nHill and then in a long line to the south, along an area that was an \nold place where they buried people. Of course, that is Cemetery Ridge.\n  On the other side, the Confederates--and interestingly enough, \nthroughout American history red markers represent the Confederates and \nblue the Federals--the Confederates ended up on a long ridge that ended \nup down this way, with about a mile apart, and over here was a place \nwhere they trained people to be preachers. That, of course, is Seminary \nRidge. So generations of sixth graders have been--Seminary Ridge over \nhere, Cemetery Ridge over here--generations of sixth graders have been \nconfused by this, but it is ``Cemetery'' where the Union was and \n``Seminary'' where the Confederate troops were.\n\n  About the second day of the battle, a Union general noticed there was \na small hill down at the bottom of the entire line of Union troops that \nwas unoccupied by either side. He also immediately realized this could \nbe the most important piece of property in the entire battlefield \nbecause it had an elevation that looked up the entire Federal line and \nit anchored the Federal line.\n  The Union general grabbed the nearest officer near him and said: We \nhave to occupy that hill immediately. The fellow's name was Strong \nVincent, was the officer from New York. Vincent grabbed two other \nregiments, New York and Pennsylvania, and then Maine, the 20th Maine \nRegiment, and they went to the top of this hill.\n  Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain had only been the colonel of the 20th \nMaine for about a month. He was in charge of 358 men. Vincent took him \nto the extreme left flank of the Union Army, of this little hill, which \nis called Little Round Top.\n  We had Pennsylvania, New York, and Maine. Vincent took Joshua \nLawrence Chamberlain to this point, and here were his orders:\n\n       This is the extreme left flank of the entire Union Army. \n     You are to hold this ground at all hazards.\n\n  ``At all hazards''--that means to the death.\n  Almost immediately upon getting to the top of the hill, up came the \n15th Alabama--one of the crack regiments in Lee's army--up the hill to \ntry to dislodge the 20th Maine. If you have not been to Gettysburg, \nLittle Round Top--if God were going to build a fortress, it would look \nlike Little Round Top. It is steep, rocky, with lots of places to be \nbehind, and indeed Chamberlain took maximum advantage of that. As the \ncharge came, they were able to repel it.\n  A half hour later or so, the Alabamians came again. They were pushed \nback. They came again and were pushed back. Each time they got closer \nand closer to the top of the hill because of the nature of guns in the \nCivil War. A good shooter in the Civil War, a good handler of a rifle, \ncould get off four shots a minute.\n  I want you to think of yourself, Mr. President, at the top of that \nhill with the 15th Alabama coming up. You take aim with your rifle and \nshoot--bang. You are now prepared to shoot a second time. That period \nuntil that sound--it felt like an eternity--was 15 seconds. That is how \nlong it would take to reload and get another shot. That is why in this \nsituation the charge came closer and closer.\n  By the third and fourth charge, it became hand-to-hand combat.\n  I should say, by the way, as I mentioned, that Joshua Lawrence \nChamberlain was not a soldier by trade; he was a professor at a little \ncollege. He spoke 10 languages in 1856. But he had a deep vision for \nthe meaning of America, and he had a deep concern about the issue of \nslavery.\n  When he was a student at Bowdoin in the early 1850s, a young \nprofessor's wife was writing a book, and he sat in the living room of \nthis professor and listened to her read excerpts from this book, and \nthe book turned out to be probably the most influential book ever \npublished in America. It was called ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' It described \nfor people in the country the evils of slavery. Indeed, when Abraham \nLincoln met Harriet Beecher Stowe and shook her hand, he said, ``I am \nshaking the hand that started the Civil War'' because it lit the fuse \nthat led to the pressure that ultimately led to the abolition of \nslavery.\n  In any case, four and then five charges, and each time, the 15th \nAlabama was repelled. But then they were gathering at the bottom of the \nhill for the final assault late in the day, a hot afternoon, July 2, \n1863. The problem was, for Chamberlain, his men were out of ammunition. \nThey each had been issued 60 cartridges at the beginning of the battle. \nThey had all been fired during those five assaults. He then had a \nchoice to make as a leader. He had three options:\n  One was to retreat--which is a perfectly honorable thing to do in a \nmilitary situation, but his orders were to hold the ground ``at all \nhazards'' because if he had not, if the Confederates had gotten around \nLittle Round Top, the entire rear of the Union Army would have been \nexposed.\n  His other option was to stand and fight until overwhelmed. That would \nnot have worked very well because it would have only delayed them for a \nfew minutes.\n  Instead, he chose an extraordinary option that was very unusual even \nat the time. He uttered one word, and the word was ``bayonets.'' There \nis a dispute in history whether he also said ``charge'' and what his \nactual order was, but everybody agrees he uttered the word \n``bayonets,'' and his soldiers knew what that meant, and down the hill \ninto the face of the final Confederate charge came 200 crazy guys from \nMaine. The 15th Alabama for the first and only time in the Civil War \nwas so shocked by this technique that they turned and ran, and the 200 \nboys from Maine--and I say 200 but at the beginning of this action \nthere were over 300; they lost 100 to casualties and death--captured \n400 or 500 Confederates with no bullets in their guns.\n  Chamberlain tried to call his men back. They said, ``Hell no, \nGeneral, we are on our way to Richmond.''\n  I tell this story because it is a story of extraordinary bravery. By \nthe way, Chamberlain received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his \nbravery and creativity that afternoon on that little hill in \nPennsylvania. But I tell the story because it is a story of our country \nand it is a story of how a single person's actions and bravery can have \nenormous impact. Historians argue about whether this was really the key \nturning point, was there something else, was it some other regiment at \nanother place, but an argument can be made that this college professor \nfrom Maine saved the United States. The defining moment for our country \nwas that hot afternoon in Pennsylvania, July 2, 1863.\n  I believe it is one of the great stories of American history. In \nfact, the story of Chamberlain and Little Round Top is taught in Army \nmanuals to this day as a story of leadership, creativity, perseverance, \ncourage, and devotion to God and country.\n  I hope all Americans will think about these moments, and thousands \nmore like them, as we celebrate not only the birth of our country next \nweek, but also the rebirth of our country in the 3 days prior to July \n4th.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk this week \nabout the big push by President Obama and his allies to promote the \nhealth care law. We are less than 100 days out from the implementation \nof that law. People in Wyoming are already feeling the effects of the \nDemocrats' health care law.\n  The law says employers with more than 50 full-time employees have to \nprovide expensive, one-size-fits-all health insurance. Employers all \nacross the country are cutting full-time workers back to part-time \nstatus and cutting their shifts to less than 30 hours a week. Thirty \nhours a week is the cutoff point to be considered a full-time worker \nunder the Democrats' health care law.\n  As a result of the Democrats' health care law, we are starting to get \nstories like the one from the Rocket-Miner newspaper in Rock Springs, \nWY, that came out yesterday.\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\n  The subheadline is ``School district looks at coverage, worker \noptions,'' and that is under the headline of ``Health Care Reform.''\n  Here is what the article says:\n\n       More than 500 employees working for Sweetwater County \n     School District No. 1 could see a reduction in their \n     paychecks for the upcoming school year.\n       The district may reduce hours for part-time employees to \n     exempt it from covering them on its insurance plan under \n     President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act.\n\n  This is the Rocket-Miner newspaper in Rock Springs, WY, Tuesday, June \n25.\n  The article goes on to explain that the school district has more than \n500 employees who are working between 30 and 34 hours a week. Those are \nthe people that the health care law is threatening the most. The \narticle goes on to say these workers ``are likely to see their hours \ndecreased by up to five hours.'' So they will be cutting the hours of \nworkers from 34 hours and getting them down to 29 hours.\n  It quotes the school board chairman saying that the huge chunk of \nmoney it would need to provide Washington-approved insurance for \neveryone would have to come out of classrooms and other essentials. \nTaking money out of classrooms and other essentials, he says: ``We are \ntalking about hundreds of thousands of dollars.''\n  Well, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars isn't a very impressive \namount to Washington Democrats, but for a small school district in \nWyoming, that is a big hit to their budget. It is a lot of pain that \nthe law is inflicting on those teachers and on those students. So for \nthe employees who are going to see their hours cut from 35 hours to \nfewer than 30 hours, the Democrats' health care law is hitting their \npaychecks, and hitting it hard.\n  Well, that was yesterday. Today in the Gillette News Record, Kathy \nBrown wrote: ``School trustees consider changes with ObamaCare.'' Here \nis what they say in Campbell County:\n\n       About 200 part-time positions could be affected. It does \n     mean the district must track the hours of employees much more \n     closely, and consider what to do with 320 substitute \n     teachers, 27 substitute bus drivers, 23 coaches, eight \n     temporary and four summer-only employees.\n       Before the July 17 meeting, school officials will try to \n     provide information to trustees on hours and possible costs.\n\n  ``This is a paperwork nightmare,'' says one of the trustees.\n\n       She wondered if the district would have to hire more \n     employees just to do the paperwork and tracking.\n\n  There are nearly 8 million people in this country who are working \npart time because they cannot find full-time work. These are not just \nnumbers in a monthly unemployment report, these are people all across \nthe country in towns such as Rock Springs and Gillette, WY. They want \nto work and provide for their families, but they are suffering from the \nbad economic recovery which has been caused by the failed policies of \nWashington Democrats. Then they get hit a second time with this \nterrible health care law. This health care law cuts back their hours \nand cuts their paychecks even more.\n  I want to make one more point about the health care law. This \nheadline is from the front page of this morning's Investor's Business \nDaily, June 26, 2013. It says: ``Privacy Falls Victim To ObamaCare \nHub.''\n  The hub they are talking about is the database of information about \npeople that was created by this health care law. It was created so \nWashington could figure out who has health insurance and who might \nqualify for subsidies under the law. With this data hub Washington \nbureaucrats are going to have access to a huge amount of personal \ninformation about people all across the country.\n  Here is what the article says:\n\n       The ObamaCare hub will ``interact'' with seven other \n     federal agencies: Social Security Administration, IRS, \n     Department of Homeland Security, Veterans Administration, \n     Office of Personnel Management, Defense Department and--\n     believe it or not--the Peace Corps. It also will plug into \n     state Medicaid databases.\n\n  So what does the hub want to include in all of this? Well, the \narticle goes on to say that the hub will store ``names, birth dates, \nSocial Security numbers, taxpayer status, gender, ethnicity, e-mail \naddresses, phone numbers on millions of people expected to apply for \ncoverage via ObamaCare exchanges.''\n  That is just part of it. They are also going to have ``tax return \ninformation from the IRS, income information from Social Security \nAdministration, and financial information from other third-party \nsources.''\n  The article says Washington ``will also store data from businesses \nbuying coverage via an exchange, including a `list of qualified \nemployees and their tax ID numbers,' and keep it all on file for 10 \nyears.''\n  In addition, the article goes on to say:\n\n       The Federal Government also can disclose this information--\n\n  We are talking about citizens' private information turned over to the \ngovernment, and the government ``can disclose this information `without \nthe consent of the individual.' '' They ``can disclose this information \n`without the consent of the individual' to a wide range of people, \nincluding `agency contractors, consultants, or grantees' who `need to \nhave access to the records' to help run ObamaCare.''\n  So all of this personal, private information is collected in one \nplace, held for 10 years, and made available to bureaucrats, \ncontractors, and consultants.\n  This is just another terrible effect of the Democrats' health care \nlaw. This is a law that American people are just starting to learn more \nabout, and a law that many of those who voted for it didn't even know \nwhat was in it. The more people learn, the more worried they become \nabout how this law will affect their care, their jobs, their paychecks, \nand their privacy.\n  When Democrats in Washington pushed their health care law through \nCongress, they were not honest with the American people about any of \nthese negative effects. The American people deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on the bill \nthat is before us, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill. No matter \nwhat side of the aisle you are on, we can all agree that our current \nsystem is not working, and it is in need of reboot and reform. I \nbelieve that the bipartisan approach taken in this bill gives us an \nopportunity to address this issue in a thoughtful manner. I thank the \ndrafters of this bill for their hard work and tireless advocacy; I also \nthank Chairman Leahy and the Majority Leader for the open and \ntransparent process that this bill has undergone.\n  I have three principles on immigration reform: we must protect our \nborders, protect American jobs, and reward those who play by the rules. \nAnd I believe that this carefully drafted and negotiated bill meets all \nof these metrics. In addition to an accountable path to citizenship for \nthe undocumented population currently in the U.S., the bill also \nincludes new resources to secure our border and puts forth a rational \napproach to future legal immigration to the U.S. While I do not agree \nwith every part of this bill, I believe that the compromises that were \nmade are fair. In passing this bill, we do what is right for our \neconomy, and we do what is right for our society.\n  This bill makes important reforms across the board, but I want to \nfocus on a few that are of particular importance to Maryland. The \nseafood industry is the lifeblood of Maryland's Eastern Shore. It is \nalso a traditional industry that is adapting in today's world. They \nrely on H-2B workers to keep their businesses running when American \nworkers are unavailable. I have consistently fought for an approach to \nthe H-2B program that recognizes that one size does not fit all, \nprotects the wages and jobs of all workers, and provides the certainty \nthat small businesses need to survive. This bill includes important, \ntailored provisions that ensure the availability of the H-2B program. \nThe inclusion of the returning worker exemption, a provision that I \nsponsored for many years, simply allows workers who entered during this \nfiscal year not to be counted toward the H-2B cap through 2018. This is \na fix that aids the small, seasonal businesses that rely on these \nworkers year after year, such as the crab-pickers on Maryland's \nHooper's Island.\n  The bill also includes language that protects the wages of American \nworkers while striking a balance with the needs of employers. It adds \ncrucial\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\nworker protections by providing for transportation costs for H-2B \nworkers, mandating that employers are responsible for fees, and \nrequiring that American workers not be displaced. The H-2B program is \nfar from perfect--and it could benefit from improvements--but its \navailability is vital to many businesses. It is our job to make sure \nthat it works for all.\n  Tourism is vital to Maryland's economy, and programs like the Visa \nWaiver Program ensure our friends and allies around the world are able \nto visit our State. Each year, the Visa Waiver Program allows 16 \nmillion tourists to visit the United States and spend more than $51 \nbillion, while supporting half a million jobs. This bill includes \nimportant provisions to expand the Visa Waiver Program that I have long \nfought for. These provisions give discretion to the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to include countries that meet strict security \nrequirements, while also protecting our borders and creating jobs in \nthe tourism industry. New national security requirements mean stronger \npassport controls, border security, and cooperation with American law \nenforcement.\n  The current system punishes our allies--and that is what is happening \nwith our close friend Poland. Poland has been a longtime friend to the \nU.S. and has stood with us in Iraq and Afghanistan, fighting and dying \nalongside Americans. But Polish citizens cannot visit the U.S. without \na visa. Expanding the Visa Waiver Program to Poland alone could mean \n$181 million in new spending and could support 1,500 new jobs. The \nexpansion of the Visa Waiver Program is good for national security and \neconomic development and helps our most trusted allies.\n  Now is the time for comprehensive immigration reform. Immigrants are \npart of the fabric of our country, and we all benefit from an approach \nthat recognizes these contributions while ensuring that our laws are \nfollowed and respected. This bill does that, and I look forward to \nsupporting its passage here in the Senate.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the special procedures \nfor certain nonimmigrant agricultural workers included in the \nunderlying immigration bill. I have thoughts about the overall \nimmigration bill which I will share later, but at this time I want to \nfocus on a specific provision in the underlying substitute amendment.\n  Many farmers and ranchers in this country will tell you that they \nneed reliable, dedicated, and experienced employees to make their \noperation successful. This could mean contracting with seasonal workers \nto help a farmer harvest row crops or for my colleague, Chairman Leahy, \nit could mean finding employees to milk and move cows on dairy farms in \nVermont. Agricultural labor in this country comes from a variety of \nplaces, and an important source is from temporary and seasonal foreign \nworkers.\n  Currently, the H-2A program assists employers and foreign workers \nwith visas to perform temporary and seasonal agricultural labor. The \nmost common form of agricultural visa is for seasonal work in \nharvesting, planting, or maintaining crops. Workers usually get visas \nto the United States to perform work for several months and then return \nto their home nations. However, Congress and the administration for \ndecades have recognized a special segment of temporary agricultural \nworkers which are distinct from the others, particularly those \nindustries within agriculture which require workers for longer periods \nbecause of the unique work they perform. Under the existing H-2A \nprogram, these occupations are recognized by special procedures which \nallow employees to meet the needs of the specialized industries they \nserve. Occupations which serve the livestock industry are examples of \nagricultural jobs that require temporary work for longer periods of \ntime. Herding and managing livestock is an inherently different type of \nwork than that which is performed by other temporary agricultural \nworkers. In many cases, those working as temporary foreign workers in \nlivestock related occupations often have rich cultural histories and \nfamily ties to herding which allow them to bring their unique \nexperience to the United States and make significant contributions to \nour livestock industry.\n  This inherent challenge is evident in the special procedures which \nmanage nonimmigrant sheepherders in the existing H-2A program. For over \n50 years, temporary nonimmigrant agricultural workers have been coming \nto the United States to work as herders in the sheep and goat industry. \nOver all these decades, Congress has recognized the special nature of \nthe sheepherding program in immigration law. At this time, I ask \nunanimous consent that the following letters dated July 28, 1987, from \nU.S. Senator Al Simpson and the response from Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS, Commissioner Alan Nelson dated November 4, \n1987 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  In this exchange, Senator Simpson, serving as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and a primary author of the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, wrote the administration \nexpressing the continued intent of Congress that the agency and its \nrules reflect the historical arrangement that sheepherders had within \nthe H-2A program. Senator Simpson highlighted specifically the fact \nthat sheepherders should not be subject to the same return requirements \nas other nonimmigrant temporary agricultural worker programs. In its \nresponse, the Immigration and Naturalization Service recognized the \nuniqueness of the sheepherder program, its effectiveness operating \nunder these special procedures, and sheepherders should not be subject \nto the same return requirements as other nonimmigrant agricultural \nworkers.\n  As a result, the H-2A sheepherder program has operated successfully \nwith little change from when it first started. Currently, the special \nprocedures fall under the authority of the U.S. Department of Labor and \nhave continued to largely reflect the unique needs of sheepherders and \nother special procedure occupations.\n  That is why I am pleased this immigration bill includes language \nwhich authorizes special procedures for these very agricultural \noccupations. Section 2232 of the legislation creates the new \nnonimmigrant agricultural worker program. Within that section 218(A)(i) \nauthorizes ``special nonimmigrant visa processing and wage \ndetermination procedures for certain agricultural occupations''. Those \noccupations include (A) sheepherding and goat herding; (B) itinerant \ncommercial beekeeping and pollination; (C) open range production of \nlivestock; (D) itinerant animal shearing; and, (E) custom combining \nindustries. This is an important step forward in making sure that the \nnonimmigrant sheepherders and workers in other special occupations can \ncontinue to enter our country and work in these unique temporary \nagricultural jobs.\n  Particularly important is that the bill provides these special \noccupations with unique rules on work locations, and housing. This is \nbecause unlike the typical temporary nonimmigrant agricultural jobs \nperformed in the United States, the special procedure occupations \noperate in unique conditions. For example, sheepherders may work alone \nor in teams monitoring animals graze in remote areas where mobile \nhousing is required. For sheepherders, mobile sheep wagons serve as \nboth a historical symbol and functional shelter from the elements of \nthe range where teams of sheepherders prepare meals, bunk, and keep \nsupplies for livestock. By including the housing language in this \nsection, Congress clearly intends that traditional uses of these \nhousing units continue for special procedure occupations.\n  I have expressed concerned in recent years about efforts by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor to avoid consulting stakeholders when drafting new \npolicies for special procedure occupations. Bypassing stakeholders has \nconfused employers and employees and led to a number of inconsistent \nenforcement actions by agency personnel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I sent to the Department of \nLabor on November 14, 2011, as the ranking member of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions, HELP, Committee as well as the response \nI received on February 2, 2012, from Department of Labor Assistant \nSecretary Jane Oates be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. You will note that previous practice afforded the Secretary \nsome discretion in how it\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\nconsults with special procedure stakeholders--specifically, that the \n``administrator may consult with affected employer and worker \nrepresentatives.'' I am pleased that this bill includes text which \nrequires that agencies ``shall'' consult with employer and employee \nrepresentatives and publish for notice and comment regulations relating \nto the implementation of the special procedures. This is an important \nstep in ensuring that both employers and employees are heard in the \nrulemaking process and their concerns are reflected in agency guidance. \nThis consultation will help avoid future confusion amongst the parties, \nensure that policies practically serve the program, and that there can \nbe an end to inconsistent enforcement actions.\n  Mr. President, the occupations represented by these special \nprocedures may affect only a few specific industries but play an \nimportant role in protecting the future of American agriculture. I am \npleased the immigration bill allows occupations such as sheepherding to \noperate under the new program as it has operated for the past 50 years. \nIn addition, I am pleased that the legislation recognizes a specific \nneed to address the unique wage, housing, and operational components of \nthe special procedure programs. Finally, it is vital that rulemaking \nrequires agency consultation with stakeholders when drafting policies \nfor the special procedure program. I thank the sponsors of this bill \nfor their work on this section.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1987.\n     Hon. Alan Nelson,\n     Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Al: I am writing to comment on the Immigration \n     Service's interim final regulations regarding the H-2A \n     program, as they would affect the sheepherding program.\n       Congress clearly intended that the sheepherding program be \n     allowed to continue in its present form and under its present \n     conditions. This was actually explicitly stated in previous \n     Senate versions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. I \n     am now concerned that the proposed regulations might not \n     fulfill congressional intent in this area.\n       I understand that the interim final INS regulations require \n     all H-2A workers to return home for a minimum of 6 months \n     after residing in the U.S. for a period equal to three labor \n     certifications. Under present practice, there is no such \n     requirement in the H-2 sheepherding program. While I \n     understand the reason for a ``six month return'' rule in \n     other occupations, present practice allows a much briefer \n     time outside of the U.S. after three labor certifications for \n     sheepherders. I suggest that current practice be continued in \n     this area.\n       Thank you for your attention and assistance. With best \n     personal regards,\n           Most Sincerely,\n                                                  Alan K. Simpson,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        U.S. Department of Justice\n\n\n                       Immigration and Naturalization Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1987.\n     Hon. Alan K. Simpson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simpson: This is in response to your letter of \n     July 28, 1987 concerning the interim H-2A rule that requires \n     that a person who holds H-2A status for three years must \n     remain abroad for six months before he can again obtain H-2A \n     status. You indicated this would be detrimental to the sheep \n     industry, and that in promulgating the H-2A program Congress \n     intended that the sheepherder program continue under the \n     prior conditions.\n       Persons admitted as H-2 nonimmigrants have traditionally \n     been limited to stays of no more than three years. The \n     interim rule to which you referred, found in 8 CFR \n     214.2(h)(3)(viii)(C), was an attempt to strengthen this \n     limitation to ensure that persons who hold H-2A status are \n     nonimmigrants, and are not using the status as quasi-\n     permanent residence. Our concern was the practice of \n     employing an individual as an H-2A for three years, sending \n     him abroad solely for the purpose of obtaining a new visa, \n     and then bringing him back to the United States. Such actions \n     do not constitute a meaningful interruption in employment in \n     the United States, and turns H-2A nonimmigrant status into \n     quasi-permanent residence, while leaving control over the \n     alien's immigrant status with the employer.\n       We recognize that the prior H-2 sheepherder program worked \n     effectively for the sheep industry. The administration has \n     already recognized the uniqueness of this program through \n     special provisions in the Department of Labor temporary \n     agricultural labor certification process. Based on your \n     statement regarding the intent of Congress regarding this \n     program, in the final H-2A petition rule we will include a \n     similar provision, and not require a six month absence after \n     a sheepherder has been in the United States for three years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan C. Nelson,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2011.\n     Re Changes in the Special Procedures for the H-2A Program\n\n     Hon. Hilda L. Solis,\n     Secretary of Labor, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Solis: I write to respectfully request the \n     Department of Labor reconsider several of the recent changes \n     it made to Special Procedures for the H-2A Program. Although \n     there are some positive changes, which are well intentioned, \n     there are several that will have serious adverse impacts on \n     H-2A employers. Specifically, I am concerned that the \n     Department of Labor continues to make these changes with \n     little or no input from stakeholders and offers little \n     clarification as to how the guidance will be enforced.\n       Several Training and Employment Guidance letters (TEGLs) \n     were issued June 14, 2011 and published in the Federal \n     Register on August 4, 2011 in accordance with 20 CFR 655.102. \n     Special procedures under this section are designed to provide \n     the Secretary of Labor with a limited degree of flexibility \n     in carrying out the responsibilities of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (INA). However, the guidance issued under \n     these TEGLs in 2011 deviates significantly from past \n     interpretations of employment guidelines, was written devoid \n     of stakeholder input and causes several significant \n     challenges for the employers in the open range livestock \n     industry.\n       Although several of the changes create significant \n     challenges, those concerning sleeping units and variances are \n     creating the one of the most alarming negative impacts on \n     livestock producers. Guidelines concerning the use of mobile \n     housing for open range occupations have remained unchanged \n     for 22 years. A separate sleeping unit has been understood to \n     be a bedroll/sleeping bag, bed, cot, or bunk. However, the \n     latest TEGL references the term ``housed'' in regards to \n     sleeping unit and adds a three day consecutive limitation for \n     employees sharing a mobile housing unit on the range, such as \n     a sheep wagon. This seems to imply that a separate sleeping \n     unit is to include a separate ``housing unit.'' Not only is \n     the guideline inconsistent with previous standards but when \n     interpreted strictly proves impractical for many employers. \n     The resources necessary to move and secure multiple housing \n     units in remote areas of range would not only hinder herding \n     operations but could also prove to be dangerous in adverse \n     weather conditions or during the shorter hours of daylight \n     associated with the winter months.\n       H-2A employers engaged in sheep herding activities want to \n     provide safe workplace conditions for their employees. \n     However, when Department guidelines are vague, inconsistent \n     or made without stakeholder input--challenges are due to \n     arise that could adversely impact the industry and its \n     employees. There is also ongoing concern about enforcement \n     activities by the Department. Instances of inconsistent \n     interpretations of guidance have been reported that concerns \n     both long-standing policies and guidance resulting from the \n     2011 TEGLs. In the case of guidance that pre-dates the 2011 \n     TEGLs, there have been instances in which employers are \n     challenged for practices that are consistent with state \n     standards for their occupation and in areas where the \n     Department is to provide deference to state workforce and \n     employment requirements.\n       Additionally, there has been a great deal of confusion over \n     the revision of the requirements for variances by the 2011 \n     TEGLs. In the past, operators were able to file a variance \n     once with their appropriate state department of workforce and \n     employment with no need to file additional variances for \n     herding activities. However, the new guidance requires \n     variances to be filed every year and can be applied to only \n     extremely limited situations. This change limits flexibility \n     for employers to best serve the needs of their employees and \n     creates impractical consequences for a number of range \n     operations. I encourage the Department to consider returning \n     its policies to allow for variances to be filed once for \n     activities recognized by the special procedures and to remove \n     the time limit that has been imposed on variances.\n       Thank you for considering this request and these comments \n     regarding the Special Procedures for the H-2A Program. Again, \n     I encourage the Department to allow greater stakeholder \n     participation in future changes to the special procedures. I \n     look forward to the Department's response on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Mike Enzi,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of Labor,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, Feb. 2, 2012\n     Hon. Michael Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Thank you for your letter to Secretary \n     of Labor Hilda L. Solis requesting that the Department of \n     Labor (Department) reconsider the recent changes made to \n     Special Procedures for the H-2A Program through the Training \n     and Employment Guidance Letters (TEGL) published in\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\n     the Federal Register on August 4, 2011. The TEGLs updated \n     special procedures previously established under the H-2A \n     Temporary Agricultural Program for occupations such as sheep \n     and goat herding to reflect organizational changes as well as \n     new regulatory provisions contained in the Temporary \n     Agricultural Employment of H-2A Foreign Workers in the United \n     States (H-2A Final Rule) published by the Department on \n     February 12, 2010. Your letter has been referred to my office \n     for response. The Employment and Training Administration is \n     responsible for administering foreign labor certification \n     program through the Office of Foreign Labor Certification \n     (OFLC).\n       In your letter you state that even though there were some \n     positive changes set forth in the TEGLs, the Department \n     continues to make changes with little or no input from \n     stakeholders and offers little clarification as to how the \n     guidance will be enforced. Of particular importance, you cite \n     changes pertaining to sleeping units made available to \n     workers and to the variance procedure previously required of \n     employers when petitioning for more than one worker to be \n     housed in mobile units used in the open range. Your letter \n     states that the above change in guidance limits flexibility \n     for employers to best serve the needs of their employees and \n     creates impractical consequences for a number of range \n     operations.\n       To provide for a limited degree of flexibility in carrying \n     out the Secretary's responsibilities under the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (INA), while not deviating from statutory \n     requirements, the H-2A Final Rule provides the Administrator \n     of OFLC with the authority to establish, continue, revise, or \n     revoke special procedures for processing certain H-2A \n     applications. The special procedures for sheep and goat \n     herding, for example, have been recognized for many years and \n     draw upon the historically unique nature of the agricultural \n     work that cannot be completely addressed within the \n     regulatory framework generally applied to other H-2A \n     employers. Such procedures recognize the peculiarities of the \n     industry or agricultural activity, and establish a reasonable \n     and tailored means for such employers to meet underlying \n     program requirements while not deviating from statutory \n     requirements. Prior to making determinations regarding the \n     use of special procedures, the H-2A Final Rule states that \n     the ``OFLC Administrator may consult with affected employer \n     and worker representatives''. The Department published these \n     revised special procedures in June 2011 with a delayed \n     effective date of October 1, 2011, to provide affected \n     employers time to understand and adapt to any changes. The \n     Department then published each TEGL as a notice in the \n     Federal Register on August 4, 2011.\n       The special procedures published by the Department covering \n     occupations involved in the open range production of \n     livestock do not change the longstanding requirement that \n     employers must provide housing and sleeping facilities to \n     workers under the H-2A Program. Due to the unique nature of \n     the work performed on the open range, employers in this \n     industry are allowed to self-certify that housing is \n     available, sufficient to accommodate the number of workers \n     being requested, and meets all applicable standards. Within \n     the housing unit, workers must be afforded a separate \n     sleeping unit such as a comfortable bed, cot, or bunk with a \n     clean mattress. Therefore, it would be possible for the \n     employer to continue to have one camp with more than one \n     worker so long as each worker had his or her own bed. Because \n     employers participating in the H-2A Program must make \n     arrangements for housing workers several months in advance of \n     the start date of work, the Department believes employers \n     likewise have sufficient time to plan and arrange for the \n     provision of sleeping units for its workers. Where it is \n     temporarily impractical to set up a separate sleeping unit \n     which would result in more than one worker having to share a \n     bed, cot or bunk, the revised special procedures defined \n     ``temporary'' as no more than three consecutive days to \n     ensure workers promptly receive the housing benefits they are \n     entitled to under the H-2A Program.\n       In your letter you also state that the new guidance departs \n     from the previous practice of allowing employers to file a \n     housing variance request only one time with the appropriate \n     State Workforce Agency. Though the new guidance continues the \n     practice of allowing employers to submit a written request \n     for a housing variance, the Department's requirement has \n     remained consistent by stipulating that ``When filing an \n     application for certification, the employer may request a \n     variance from the separate sleeping unit(s) requirement to \n     allow for a second herder to temporarily join the herding \n     operation.'' Each open range production of livestock \n     application is adjudicated on a case-by-case basis and \n     conform to housing safety and health standards.\n       If you have any additional questions, please contact Mr. \n     Tony Zaffirini, Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental \n     Affairs, at (202)-693-4600.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jane Oates,\n                                              Assistant Secretary.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support \nof S. 744, the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill before \nthe Senate.\n  Through the process of negotiation and compromise, including 212 \namendments that were considered during the course of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee markup last month and now much discussion on the \nSenate floor, a workable, tough--but fair--bill sits before us, ripe \nfor us to take action on a problem that has gone unresolved for far too \nlong.\n  Colleagues, this is our last, best chance to achieve immigration \nreform.\n  The bill before the Senate provides long-sought-after solutions that \nwill help fix our broken immigration system. It takes into \nconsideration our country's modern-day national security, economic, and \nlabor needs, as well as our country's age-old tradition of preserving \nfamily unity and promoting humanitarian policies.\n  It would also bring approximately 11 million undocumented individuals \nnow living in the United States out of the shadows and on a path where \nthey could proudly and openly contribute to this great nation.\n  The first fundamental principle of the bill is that we must control \nour Nation's borders and protect our national security.\n  Before a single undocumented person in the United Staes can earn a \ngreen card, several important ``triggers'' must be met, showing that \nthe Federal Government has effectively secured the border and is \nenforcing current immigration laws. These triggers include the \nfollowing:\n\n       No. 1, an unprecedented increase of 20,000 new full-time \n     Border Patrol agents stationed along the southern border.\n       No. 2, the full deployment of the comprehensive southern \n     border security strategy, which requires the Department of \n     Homeland Security to conduct surveillance of 100 percent of \n     the southern border region.\n       No. 3, DHS completion of the southern border fencing \n     strategy, which includes at least 700 miles of pedestrian \n     fencing along the southern border.\n       No. 4, implementation of a mandatory employment \n     verification system for all employers, known as E-Verify, \n     which will prevent unauthorized workers from obtaining \n     employment.\n       No. 5, implementation of an electronic exit system at air \n     and sea ports of entry that operates by collecting machine-\n     readable visa or passport information from passengers of air \n     and vessel carriers.\n\n  These enforcement improvements build upon the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's substantial progress in securing and managing our borders.\n  Over the past several years, DHS has deployed unprecedented amounts \nof manpower, resources, and technology to secure the Nation's borders, \nand these efforts have not only led to enhanced border security but \nhave also expedited legitimate trade and travel.\n  The second fundamental principle included in the bill is the creation \nof a path to citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are living \nand working in the United States without proper immigration \ndocumentation.\n  While some have insisted that all 11 million undocumented immigrants \nshould be deported, such a solution is not reasonable.\n  A majority of these individuals and families have become integrated \ninto the fabric of their communities, and deportation would be a severe \noutcome. Many work and pay taxes, but they and their families live in \nthe shadows and face the possibility of being picked up and deported, \ndaily.\n  The State of California has the largest number of undocumented \nimmigrants, estimated to be 2.6 million people or nearly one-fourth of \nall unauthorized immigrants currently living in the United States. \nThese individuals have become an essential part of the California \nworkforce. Many work in hotels, restaurants, agriculture, and the \nhousing and construction industries.\n  A recent study of immigrants in California that was completed by Dr. \nRaul Hinojosa-Ojeda and Marshall Fitz of the Center for American \nProgress concluded that, ``if all unauthorized immigrants were removed \nfrom California, the state would lose $301.6 billion in economic \nactivity, decrease total employment by 17.4%, and eliminate 3.6 million \njobs.'' The study further showed that, ``if unauthorized immigrants in \nCalifornia were legalized, it would add 633,000 jobs to the economy, \nincrease labor income by $26.9 billion, and increase tax revenues by \n$5.3 billion.''\n  This bill establishes a process to bring these individuals out of the \nshadows.\n  The need to provide a stable, legal, and sustainable workforce \nthrough immigration reform is critical in the agricultural sector.\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\n  According to government estimates, there are about 1.8 million people \nwho perform hired farm work in the United States. Approximately 1.2 \nmillion of these individuals--fully two-thirds of those who help bring \npistachios, almonds, wine, and other things we enjoy, to our tables--\nare not authorized to work here.\n  Some may ask, why don't farmers hire Americans to do the work? The \nanswer is, they have tried and tried, but there are not many Americans \nwho are willing to take a job in the fields. It is hard, stooped labor, \nrequiring long and unpredictable hours, often in the hot Sun and high \ntemperatures. That is why the labor shortage persists even in these \nchallenging economic times.\n  The United Farm Workers initiated the ``Take Our Jobs'' campaign in \nwhich they invited citizens and legal residents to apply for jobs on \nfarms across the country, but only seven people accepted jobs and \ntrained for agriculture positions.\n  A 2012 California Farm Bureau survey found that 71 percent of the \ntree fruit growers and nearly 80 percent of raisin and berry growers \nwere unable to find adequate labor to prune trees and vines or pick \ncrops.\n  This problem also impacts year-round industries such as dairy. A 2012 \nTexas A study found that farms using an immigrant workforce produce \nmore than 60 percent of the milk in our country. Without these \nimmigrant dairy employees, economic output would decline by $22 billion \nand 133,000 workers would lose their jobs.\n  All over the Nation, growers are closing their farms because they \nlack a stable, legal workforce. And American farmers who remain are \nsuffering economic losses because of the lack of immigration reform.\n  And when farmers suffer, there is a ripple effect felt throughout the \neconomy--in farm equipment manufacturing, packaging, processing, \ntransportation, marketing, lending, and insurance.\n  The reality is that if there are not enough farm workers to harvest \nthe crops in the United States, we will end up relying on foreign \ncountries to provide our food supply. This is not good for our economy \nor for ensuring that Americans are receiving safe and healthy foods.\n  Right now, the H-2A visa, or temporary agricultural guest worker \nvisa, is the only program that is available for growers to hire foreign \nworkers. Unfortunately, this program has not worked for the vast \nmajority of agricultural employers.\n  A 2011 National Council of Agricultural Employers survey found that \nadministrative H-2A delays prevented almost three-fourths of surveyed \nemployers from timely receiving workers, which caused economic loss of \nnearly $320 million for farms in 2010.\n  Katie Jackson from Jackson Family Wines in Santa Rosa, CA, wrote me \nabout the challenges she currently faces in navigating the H-2A visa \nprogram and identifying a sufficient number of skilled workers. She \nwrote that because, ``very few of the unemployed in this Nation will \nopt to work in agriculture, and even fewer have the necessary skills to \ndo so,'' Jackson Family Wines turned to increased automation and use of \nthe H-2A program. However, Ms. Jackson noted that ``the H-2A program is \ncumbersome and from our perspective merely provides a temporary fix.''\n  In previous Congresses, Senators Craig, Kennedy, and I repeatedly \ntried to pass bipartisan legislation to address this, known as AgJOBS, \nwithout success.\n  This year, I collaborated with Senators Rubio, Bennet, and Hatch to \nnegotiate and develop a new proposal that is balanced and fair to \naddress the ag labor crisis. I am very grateful to Senator Schumer and \nthe other Members of the Gang of 8 that they incorporated this proposal \ninto this bill; it is now subtitle B of Title II, the ``Agricultural \nWorker Program.''\n  All of the elements of this program were negotiated between farm \nworker representatives and a large coalition of grower organizations. \nThese negotiated provisions protect both farmers who are forced to rely \non foreign farm labor and the farm workers by allowing the current \nundocumented farm workers to continue to work in agriculture to earn a \nblue card and eventually a green card.\n  Under the bill, agricultural workers who can document U.S. \nagricultural employment for a minimum of 100 work days or 575 hours in \nthe 2 years prior to date of enactment are eligible to adjust to blue \ncard status. Blue card applicants must not have a felony or violent \nmisdemeanor conviction and must pay a $100 fine for being in the United \nStates without immigration status.\n  Agricultural workers are eligible for a green card when they pay all \ntaxes, have no felony or violent misdemeanor convictions, and pay \nanother fine--of $400. The worker must also document that they \nperformed at least 5 years of agricultural employment for at least 100 \nwork days per year during the 8-year period beginning on the date of \nenactment or performed at least 3 years of agricultural employment for \nat least 150 work days per year during the 5-year period beginning on \nthe date of enactment.\n  To replace the problematic H-2A program, the bill will also address \nthe long-term workforce needs of farmers going forward, including \ndairies and other year-round ag industries, by creating a streamlined \nsystem to bring in temporary guest workers through a new agricultural \nvisa program called the W-Visa program.\n  This two-part new farm worker visa program provides a temporary \nworker two options, which are at-will employment or contract-based \nemployment.\n  No. 1 at-will employees have the freedom to move from employer to \nemployer without any contractual commitment.\n  No. 2 contract employees must commit to work for an employer for a \nfixed period of time, which can provide increased stability for both \nemployees and employers. After fulfilling this commitment, they are \nthen free to work for other U.S. agricultural employers.\n  The bill includes specific negotiated wage rates that replace the \n``adverse effect wage rate'' standard that exists under the current H-\n2A program, which has proven to be very controversial, and which many \nfarmers say is one of the reasons that the H-2A program is unworkable.\n  The number of agricultural guest workers who can enter the country in \nany given year is subject to a carefully negotiated cap to reflect \nanticipated labor market demands.\n  For the first 5 years, the visa program is capped at 112,333 per \nyear. With a 3-year visa, this would result in 336,999 temporary \nworkers who can be in the country at one time.\n  To ensure that a given year's visa allocation is not used up by \nregions of the country that harvest earlier than others, the bill \nrequires that the visas be evenly distributed on a quarterly basis in \nthe first year and that the USDA Secretary can modify the timing of the \ndisbursement of visas based on prior usage patterns thereafter. Any \nunused visas that remain at the end of a quarter can be rolled over to \nthe next quarter but not to the next year.\n  The cap may be increased if there are demonstrated labor shortages or \nreduced in response to a high unemployment rate of agricultural \nworkers. After 6 years, the number of applications for guest worker \nvisas and the number of blue card applications approved will also be \nconsidered when determining the annual caps.\n  This new, improved visa program will help American agriculture \ncontinue to be a driving force in our Nation's economy.\n  For those who are currently unauthorized to be in this country, \nDemocrats and Republicans together created a new registered provisional \nimmigrant--or RPI--program to provide such immigrants with lawful \nimmigration status.\n  RPIs would be authorized to work in the United States and to travel \nabroad. Only if they meet stringent criteria may they renew their RPI \nstatus for another 6 years and ultimately adjust from RPI status to \nthat of a lawful permanent resident--or green card holder.\n  Let me be clear, this is not amnesty. Amnesty is automatically giving \nthose who broke the law a clean slate, no questions asked. This bill \ndoes not do that. Instead, the bill imposes rigorous requirements in \norder for each individual to attain legal status, apply for a green \ncard, and eventually become a citizen.\n  The time has come for those who are already here, doing jobs across \nthe\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\nspectrum--such as caring for our aging population, working in \nrestaurants and hotels, and creating successful small businesses. It is \nrealistic for us to secure a sufficient legal workforce, while \nimportantly protecting our U.S. workers, to meet the labor needs of \nthis country.\n  This bill would also finally pave the way for DREAMers who were \nbrought to the United States by their parents and grew up here; they \nconsider the United States their home and want to give back.\n  Approximately 65,000 DREAMers graduate from our high schools each \nyear. They are hard-working and are dedicated to their education or to \nserving in the Nation's military. Some are valedictorians and honor \nroll students; some are community leaders and have an unwavering \ncommitment to serving the United States.\n  Through no fault of their own, these young individuals lack the \nimmigration status they need to realize their full potential. This bill \nwill provide an opportunity for these students to fulfill the American \ndream and it is only prudent for us to give them that chance.\n  While still prioritizing the American workers who are seeking jobs by \nestablishing a strict screening requirements, this bill aims to meet \nthe needs of businesses so that our economy can succeed not only in the \nfields but in medical, technological, and research labs across the \ncountry.\n  This bill reforms the H-1B visa program for high-skilled workers by \ndoubling and potentially tripling it depending on the country's labor \nneeds. Ensuring that this country stays ahead of the curve in \ntechnology, it facilitates advances in science, technology, math, and \nengineering by stapling a green card to certain STEM graduates' \npassports. It creates a W visa program for low-skilled workers and \nencourages ideas through entrepreneurship, enabling the creation of the \nlikes of the next eBay, Google, PayPal, and Yahoo, all which were \nfounded by immigrants.\n  I want to commend the members of the Gang of Eight Senators--Schumer, \nMcCain, Durbin, Graham, Menendez, Rubio, Bennet, and Flake,--for \nproviding a foundation that strikes the right balance and reflects the \nbest thinking on how to accommodate all the various concerns and \ninterests.\n  I also want to recognize those who paved the path forward for them, \nincluding former Senators Kennedy, Specter, Salazar, Kyl, and Martinez. \nTheir hard work in tackling this difficult issue has finally brought us \nto this crucial stage.\n  This is not a perfect bill, but it is a necessary bill. If we do not \nseize this opportunity, I fear that the chance of comprehensive reform \nwill be gone for another generation--something I believe would be a \nterrible mistake for our country.\n  It realistically and pragmatically updates our current immigration \nsystem in a way that enhances our national security, ensures our labor \nneeds are met in a fair way that does not compromise U.S. workers, \nfacilitates timely family unification, and is humane. I hope you will \njoin me in passing this bill in the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we look forward to bringing our debate \non comprehensive immigration reform to a close, I especially want to \nrecognize the work of one Senator who made a major contribution to this \nlegislation. Provisions contained in this legislation will rewrite our \nentire agricultural visa program, and they will do so for the better. \nFor the first time, America's dairy farmers will have access to \ntemporary foreign workers, and the population of undocumented farm \nworkers will have the chance to come out of the shadows and into the \nlawful immigration system, where they will have rights and the \nprotection of the law. I am grateful for the work she has done, and I \nam proud to support her important contributions to this legislation.\n  The work of the senior Senator from California on this legislation \nshould be recognized and commended. She worked long and hard to bring \nagricultural workers and employers together to find consensus.\n  She spent many hours keeping these negotiations going, and she did \nnot give up until a fair agreement was reached. And just this week I \nknow that Senator Feinstein stood up for farmers in the Northeastern \npart of the United States and resisted last-minute efforts related to \nthis bill to create a divide between farmers in different parts of the \ncountry. For this, I thank her.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post published an article about Senator \nFeinstein's distinguished service in the Senate, her leadership, her \nincredible work ethic, and her tenacity. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 2013]\n\n  Feinstein, NSA's Top Congressional Defender, Has Built Respect Over \n                           Decades of Service\n\n                            (By Emily Heil)\n\n       She stands before television cameras just hours after the \n     news breaks that the U.S. government has been conducting a \n     massive survillance program, compiling a database of \n     Americans' phone records and monitoring foreign terrorism \n     suspects' Internet traffic.\n       Her hands form fists.\n       ``It's called protecting America,'' says Dianne Feinstein.\n       A five-term California Democrat who chairs the Senate \n     intelligence committee, Feinstein hardly needs to flex her \n     muscles these days to command deference. On Sunday talk shows \n     and from podiums around the Capitol, she's playing the role \n     of chief congressional defender of the surveillance program \n     to skeptical colleagues and critics who say it's Big Brother \n     run amok. She is also one of the most senior members of the \n     powerful Judiciary and Appropriations panels.\n       Just as she is playing such high-profile roles, Feinstein, \n     who turned 80 on Saturday, is blazing a new political trail \n     as a symbol--an unwilling one--of the changing workplace.\n       ``It's a non-role as far as I'm concerned,'' Feinstein \n     says. ``I've always had the belief that age is just \n     chronology. I know people who are 50 who are older than I \n     am.''\n       With the death of Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) this \n     month, Feinstein became the Senate's oldest member, a \n     distinction never before held by a woman. In fact, there's \n     only been one other female senator over 80: Rebecca L. \n     Felton, an 87-year-old, lace-collared white-supremacist \n     suffragette who was appointed to a vacant seat from Georgia \n     and served for less than two months in 1922.\n       Feinstein's age is in most ways incidental to her success; \n     in others, it's key. She's benefiting from the privileges \n     that seniority brings in the Senate and from a work ethic \n     forged in an era where women had to work twice as hard as \n     their male counterparts to succeed.\n       There are now a record 20 female senators, many of whom \n     have taken on high-ranking roles such as chairmanships of key \n     committees that can help ensure long political life spans. \n     They may soon be as likely as men to grow old in elected \n     office--or in any office.\n       Women over 60 make up the fastest-growing segment of the \n     workforce, notes Elizabeth Fideler, a fellow at the Sloan \n     Center on Aging and Work at Boston College and the author of \n     ``Women Still at Work: Professionals Over 60 and on the \n     Job.'' And the sight of older woman at the office--even when \n     that office is the Capitol--is becoming more familiar. \n     ``Obviously, politics is a bit harsher an arena, but people \n     are willing to accept an older person so long as they remain \n     effective,'' she says.\n       Age is a sensitive topic for anyone. For politicians, even \n     more so. When Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) at 72 launched his \n     presidential campaign in 1995, Time magazine's cover asked, \n     ``Is Dole Too Old for the Job?'' And recall Sen. John \n     McCain's (R-Ariz.) anger at a question about his age during \n     the 2008 presidential campaign. (McCain was 70, and called \n     the questioner a ``little jerk.'')\n       If the politician in question happens to be a woman, she's \n     even more likely to get The Question or be the target of \n     late-night vitriol.\n       In 2007, at the age of 67, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) became \n     speaker of the House--the highest-ranking woman in the \n     history of the republic--and a feast for comedians' Botox \n     jokes.\n       ``Nancy Pelosi said today we've waited 200 years for \n     this,'' Jay Leno cracked after Pelosi was sworn in. ``Two \n     hundred years? How many face-lifts has this woman had?''\n       Former congresswoman Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) predicts that \n     even as women remain in office into old age, the public will \n     never tolerate ``a female Strom Thurmond,'' a reference to \n     the late South Carolina Republican senator who left office at \n     the age of 100, his final years spent with staffers and \n     colleagues overlooking (and compensating for) his diminished \n     mental and physical powers.\n       ``The public would turn on her,'' Schroeder says. ``Not \n     like they did with Strom, who everyone thought was funny--\n     this kind of character.''\n       Tall and unstooped, Feinstein is often seen striding down \n     the Capitol's marble halls.\n       Even her political adversaries say she remains more engaged \n     in the minutiae of her job than many of her younger \n     counterparts.\n       ``I always think if I'm half as prepared and energetic as \n     Senator Feinstein, I'm doing okay,'' says Sen. Claire \n     McCaskill. The Missouri Democrat calls Feinstein ``the ideal \n     of what a senator should be.''\n       ``Role model'' is the one part of her new status that \n     Feinstein embraces. ``That is the biggest compliment,'' she \n     says.\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\n       Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright says the \n     scrutiny that female politicians will draw in their older \n     years will be just a continuation of what they have faced at \n     other points in their careers. ``They'll talk about \n     [Feinstein's] hair--but that's what happens now anyway,'' she \n     says.\n       It did, at least, early in Feinstein's career, when media \n     reports swooned over her looks and her impeccable ensembles. \n     ``Charm Is Only Half Her Story,'' was the headline of a Time \n     magazine 1990 story, which described her as ``a casting \n     director's idea of a Bryn Mawr president who must be bodily \n     restrained from adding gloves--or perhaps even a pillbox \n     hat--to her already ultra-conservative banker-blue suits and \n     fitted red blazers and pearls.''\n       Ask friends and colleagues to describe Feinstein and \n     something surprising happens.\n       ``She does her homework,'' says former senator Olympia \n     Snowe (R-Maine).\n       ``She does her homework,'' says Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-\n     Ga.), the vice chairman of the intelligence committee.\n       ``She just does her homework,'' says Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-\n     Calif.)\n       At home, as in the office, Feinstein works constantly. That \n     includes spending her days off poring over thick briefing \n     books and, always, the ``weeklies,'' a stack of the memos she \n     requires every member of her staff to submit each Friday.\n       In the memo, each employee--from top policy advisers to \n     mailroom clerks--describes what he or she has done that week: \n     meetings they attended, people they met with, legislation \n     they worked on, or what kind of letters have been coming in \n     from constituents. Feinstein scours them, and then asks \n     pointed questions at mandatory Monday-morning staff meetings \n     in her Washington office.\n       This interrogative style has led some former staffers to \n     grouse that she is a tough boss, prone to calling out \n     underlings, even in group settings where such queries can \n     come off as insults. Mark Kadesh, a lobbyist who was her \n     longtime chief of staff, says that the rigors of working for \n     her weren't for everyone. ``The thing is that she's no more \n     demanding of herself than she is of her staff,'' he says. \n     ``If you couldn't keep up, it was tough. If you accepted that \n     challenge, it was a great experience.''\n       Yet colleagues--even Republicans--find her approachable. \n     ``You knew that she always came to her conclusions based on \n     real knowledge and understanding, not in a partisan way,'' \n     Snowe says.\n       Chambliss credits her with helping to smooth over the once-\n     strained relationship between the Senate and House \n     intelligence committees. The bipartisan leaders now meet \n     regularly to talk about how to speak with one voice on tricky \n     issues--a change from the past. ``We couldn't afford that--\n     the world has become too dangerous a place on intelligence \n     issues,'' he says.\n       Feinstein's always-be-prepared ethos seems, in part, a \n     holdover from an earlier time. When she first entered public \n     office as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors \n     in 1969, few women held elected offices. Those who did faced \n     far more scrutiny than their male counterparts.\n       Feinstein recalls being the top vote-getter in her first \n     election to the board, which by law, meant she would be its \n     president. But some, citing her inexperience, called on her \n     to cede that position to the second-place man. She politely \n     declined. Her ascent from supervisor to mayor was accompanied \n     by tests. ``You would get pressed,'' she says. ``And so you \n     learn to know your stuff.''\n       To this day, Feinstein enters no forum--be it a hearing \n     with top military brass or a one-on-one with a low-level \n     staffer--without excruciatingly detailed preparation.\n       ``On the NSA issue, none of the members had gone to these \n     briefings, and yet they're all talking about them--whereas if \n     Dianne hadn't gone to them, known everything about them, \n     she'd have the grace not to say something,'' Schroeder says. \n     ``My jaw always drops when I see someone who'd rather be at \n     the gym or running to the airport who wants to stand up and \n     criticize something they don't know anything about.''\n       While she's surely come a long way from those board \n     meetings in San Francisco, the tests still come.\n       In March, Feinstein had a YouTube-able moment when she \n     spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her \n     proposal to ban assault weapons. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican \n     freshman from Texas and a tea party favorite, prefaced a \n     question to her with a discourse on the Constitution, in \n     which he informed Feinstein (who has served on Judiciary for \n     20 years and was the panel's first female member), that the \n     Second Amendment gives people the right to bear arms.\n       ``I am not a sixth grader,'' she replied, calmly, but with \n     a rare edge to her voice that indicated that she was just a \n     bit peeved with the gentleman from Texas. ``It's fine you \n     want to lecture me on the Constitution. I appreciate it. Just \n     know I've been here for a long time.''\n       And may be longer still. Feinstein, who won reelection in \n     2012, will be 85 when her term ends. Will she run again? \n     ``Ask me in three years,'' she says.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been working to come up with a list \nof amendments. Without any editorializing, this is the list we have \nbeen able to come up with. The staff has worked on this for long hours.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a managers' package of amendments \nconsisting of Boxer-Landrieu-Murray No. 1240 (pending); Brown No. 1597; \nCarper-McCain-Udall No. 1558, as modified; Carper No. 1590; Coats No. \n1288; Coats No. 1373; Coburn No. 1509; Coons No. 1715; Flake No. 1472; \nHeinrich-Udall of New Mexico No. 1342; Heinrich-Udall of New Mexico No. \n1417; Heinrich-Udall of New Mexico-Gillibrand No. 1559; Heitkamp-Levin-\nTester-Baucus No. 1593; Klobuchar-Landrieu-Coats-Blunt-Barrasso-Enzi \nNo. 1261; Klobuchar-Coats-Landrieu-Blunt No. 1526; Landrieu-Coats-\nShaheen-Franken No. 1338; Landrieu-Cochran No. 1383; Leahy No. 1454; \nLeahy No. 1455; Murray-Crapo No. 1368; Nelson-Wicker No. 1253; Reed No. \n1223; Reed No. 1608; Schatz-Kirk No. 1416; Shaheen-Ayotte No. 1272; \nStabenow-Collins No. 1405; Toomey No. 1236; Udall of New Mexico-\nHeinrich No. 1241; and Udall of New Mexico-Heinrich-Gillibrand No. 1242 \nbe in order and considered en bloc; that the Senate proceed to vote on \nadoption of the amendments in this package en bloc; that upon \ndisposition of the managers' package, the following amendments be in \norder to be called up and the clerks be authorized to modify the \ninstruction lines to fit the committee-reported amendment, as amended, \nwhere necessary: Sessions No. 1334; Hirono No. 1718; Fischer No. 1594; \nBlumenthal No. 1636; Vitter No. 1445; Brown No. 1311; Toomey No. 1599; \nHagan No. 1386; Coats No. 1563; McCaskill No. 1457; Johnson of \nWisconsin No. 1380; Boxer No. 1260; Cruz No. 1580; Feinstein No. 1250; \nLee No. 1214; Udall of New Mexico No. 1218; Vitter No. 1577; Tester No. \n1459; Vitter No. 1474; Heitkamp No. 1593; Lee No. 1207; Whitehouse No. \n1419; Cruz No. 1579; Udall of New Mexico No. 1691; Cruz No. 1583; \nHeinrich No. 1342; Cruz No. 1585; Reed of Rhode Island No. 1608; Cruz \nNo. 1586; Nelson-Wicker No. 1253; McCain-Cardin No. 1469; and Portman-\nTester No. 1634; that at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning, June 27, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed; that \nthe amendments be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote; and all after \nthe first vote be 10-minute votes; that upon disposition of the \nPortman-Tester amendment No. 1634, the pending amendments to the \nunderlying bill be withdrawn; the majority leader then be recognized \nfor the purpose of raising points of order against the remaining \npending amendments to the substitute amendment; that after the \namendments fall, the substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; \nthe cloture motion with respect to S. 744 be withdrawn; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object, and I ask for the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my colleagues--I \nbetter say on behalf of myself and some of my colleagues--I have to \nobject. The majority party has offered an agreement from our point of \nview that is insufficient and clearly not serious, even though I know \nthey consider it a serious offer.\n  Last night, our side offered a list of amendments that could be voted \nupon. We asked for votes on 34 amendments and those 34 amendments are \nless than 10 percent of all of the amendments that are filed, right now \nabout 550. But now the majority wants to limit the number of amendments \nand, in a sense, limit our rights, because each Senator ought to have \nan opportunity to put down the amendments they want to offer. It \ndoesn't preclude the majority party from offering any amount of their \namendments they want to offer.\n  It seems to me the majority wants to pick and choose the amendments \nthey like. They don't want to take tough votes so they have chosen just \na few of\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\nour amendments to make it look as though it is very accommodating.\n  I have to say I feel a bit used and abused in this process. For 2\\1/\n2\\ weeks we have been pushing to get votes on our amendments. We have \nhad a measly 10 votes on amendments. I will remind my colleagues that \nthere were 550 filed. That is pretty embarrassing for the majority \nafter they promised a fair and open debate.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues about fair and open debate. One \nRepublican Member of the Group of 8 said:\n\n       I am confident that an open and transparent process, one \n     that engages every Senator and the American people, will make \n     it even better. I believe that this kind of open debate is \n     critical in helping the American people understand what is in \n     the bill, what it means for you, and what it means for our \n     future.\n\n  That same Senator also wrote to Chairman Leahy on March 30 before the \nbill was brought up in committee:\n\n       I wish to express my strong belief that the success of any \n     major legislation depends on the acceptance and support of \n     the American people. That support can only be earned through \n     a full and careful consideration of legislative language and \n     an open process of amendments.\n\n  In a letter to me on April 5, that same Senator wrote:\n\n       If the majority does not follow regular order, you can \n     expect that I will continue to defend the rights of every \n     Senator, myself included, to conduct this process in an open \n     and detailed manner.\n\n  When the bill was introduced, the senior Senator from New York said:\n\n       One of the things we all agree with is that there ought to \n     be an open process so that people who don't agree can offer \n     their amendments.\n\n  So it is very clear the Gang of 8, the authors of the legislation, \ncalled for a robust floor debate. They said they supported regular \norder.\n  So I ask now: Do they think that having only a few amendments \nconsidered, and this list that has just been put before us, is that a \nrobust and open process? Do they think the majority party has used \nregular order?\n  After spinning our wheels for a couple of weeks, we had an important \nvote a couple of days ago. The proponents have been bragging for weeks \nthat they were going to get over 70 votes for their legislation and \nsomehow force the House to take up their bill. Of course, that won't \nhappen if they don't get 70 votes. But I saw the shock of some that \nthey had on their faces when their vote count fell short here a couple \nof days ago.\n  So now what are they doing? They need to pick up some votes and they \nneed to make it look as though we have had a more fair process. So \nafter less than the expected vote yesterday, the proponents came to me \nwanting to strike a deal that would give us votes on amendments. The \nproblem is they still want to limit our amendments, but they want to \nmake sure we include amendments that will help them pick up some votes.\n  Well, I happen to be a farmer and I am proud to be a farmer, but I \nwant them to know I haven't just fallen off of the hay wagon. It is \npretty clear what is going on around here. Regardless of the reasons \nfor the majority now trying to look as though they are accommodating \nus, I am still willing to negotiate votes, but it needs to be a lot of \nvotes.\n  Some on my side may be less charitable than I am since they also \nunderstand what is going on around here. So in the end, we may very \nwell not be having any more votes on amendments. It is too bad the \nmajority led us down this road and is aiming for the ditch. In other \nwords, we have not had the fair and open process we were promised as we \nhad in committee--a fair and very open process there, but it ended up \ncompletely contrary to what the Gang of 8 told us we were going to have \nwhen we got to the floor.\n  In the end they have only themselves to blame. In the end I think the \nend is right now. We are going to have votes on cloture. We are going \nto have a vote on final passage. I am telling people on my side of the \naisle that if you are going to be against this bill, there is no sense \nin debating it anymore; we might as well carry our story to the other \nbody because that is where this bill is going to be perfected, if it \ncan be perfected, in a way that is going to be sent to the President \nand to solve the problems we have and not make the same mistakes we \nmade in 1986.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak at this \ntime, followed by the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am disappointed the Senator from Iowa \ndidn't accept the proposal of the majority leader and let us continue \nmaking improvements to this bill. But I have watched this debate and I \nwish to add my voice to those who came out and complimented the good \nwork, the bipartisan work the Gang of 8 has performed in their efforts \nto forge a bipartisan compromise on an issue that is of remarkable \nimportance to this nation--to our economic growth, to our security and, \nquite honestly, to who we are as a country.\n  I look forward to voting in favor of this legislation. I will not \nrecap all of the components and the path of how we got here. Suffice it \nto say this piece of legislation includes protections for American \nworkers, improves border enforcement, puts in a place a more effective \nidentity verification process, improves our entry exit system, as well \nprovides a reasonable earned pathway to citizenship for the 11 million \nundocumented immigrants who already live and work in America. \nAdditionally, the Congressional Budget Office has indicated that \nimmigration reform will also help decrease the deficit.\n  As well, it includes key priorities I have championed in the Senate, \nincluding sensible and necessary reforms to our high skill and \nemployment based visa programs. It makes sure that as we continue to \ntrain and educate the world's best and brightest--STEM and PhDs from \nBrazil or the Czech Republic or India--they can stay here in America. \nUnfortunately, because what happens now is that when they get their \ndegree, we send them home to compete against us. Canada, the U.K., and \nAustralia have changed their laws, so now these high skill individuals \ndon't go home, they simply move across the border to Canada and take \nthose high-paying jobs and support jobs with them.\n  This legislation will also makes important strides to ensure \nDREAMers--those young people who were brought to this country at a \nyoung age, through no fault or choice of her own, who are caught in \nthis limbo at this point, where many jurisdictions, including \nunfortunately, my State, sometimes don't allow them to finish their \neducation--have the opportunity to contribute to the only country they \nknow.\n  As a matter of fact, during this year's State of the Union Address I \nwas proud to invite Ambar Pinto. Ambar is a 19-year-old incredible \nyoung woman who was born in Bolivia, has grown up most of her life here \nin Virginia, and I was proud to invite her to be my guest at the State \nof the Union Address. I know Ambar will be able to contribute to her \ncommunity, to Virginia, and to the United States, and this legislation \nwill make sure she gets the same kind of fair shot in this country that \nI had and other Americans have had.\n  Let me also say--I know there are other Senators who wish to speak--\nthis legislation is about the character of our country. Senator \nAlexander from Tennessee said something the other day I have quoted him \non a number of times. In this immigration debate, we discuss the \ncharacter of our country. If I move to China tomorrow, I will never be \nChinese. If I move to India tomorrow, I will never be Indian. If I move \nto France, I will never become French. It is only in America that \nsomeone from anywhere around the world, if they play by the rules, \naccept our democratic principles and our free enterprise system, can \ncome here and get the fair shot and not only can they become Americans, \nbut their children will be Americans for generations to come. Our \ncountry is at its best when it welcomes hardworking immigrants into the \nnational fold. That American tradition is reflected in the tenants of \nthis legislation.\n\n  This path has been circuitous. We are long overdue. The last \nimmigration reform was more than 20 years ago. Our current system is \nfundamentally flawed and broken. It is time to pass this legislation \nwith an overwhelming majority, get it to the other body, get\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nit out, and get this bill to the desk of the President for his \nsignature.\n  I am proud of the work that has been done by Members from both \nparties on this important legislation. I look forward to its successful \nconclusion, I hope, tomorrow, and I look forward to the fact that the \nAmbar Pintos and so many others who have lived in the shadows for so \nlong, will be able to pursue the American dream.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the underlying \nimmigration bill, but, more importantly, to talk about an important \namendment that I hope can be brought up. I have spoken on the Senate \nfloor about this before and have provided great detail as to why it \nworks to ensure that we have employment verification at the workplace, \nwhy it is so important, really, the critical element, I believe, in \nterms of immigration reform.\n  I believe strongly if we do not have a stronger employee verification \nsystem at the workplace, the rest of this legislation is not going to \nwork. We are not going to have the people come out of the shadows that \nthose who are proponents of this legislation would like to see, and I \nwould like to see. Significantly, we are not going to be able to \ncurtail future flows of illegal immigration.\n  People come here to work, and it is that magnet of employment that \nover the years has drawn people to this great country. If we are just \ngoing to put up more fences and have more Border Patrol, which I \nsupport, we are not going to get at the problem. First, when people \nwant to get here badly enough, they figure out a way to go over or \nunder those fences. They figure out a way to go around them. That has \nbeen the story of our country. Every time we have increased \nenforcement, including some sectors of the border now where there are \ndouble fences, people still manage to find their way across in order to \nfind work.\n  Second, 40 percent of those who are here illegally in this country, \nwe are told, came here legally. They did not come across the border \nillegally. They overstayed their visas. The only way to get at that \nproblem is to ensure that we have strong workplace verification. \nFrankly, the underlying bill must be strengthened in order for the \nlegislation to work the way it is promised.\n  I believe this amendment I am prepared to offer with Senator Tester, \nmy colleague from Montana, is not just bipartisan, it is not just one \nthat has been worked through with the Gang of 8, with the White House, \nwith the chamber of commerce, with the AFL-CIO, with all the groups--we \nplayed by the rules over the last month or so to put together a good \namendment--but it is one that will actually ensure to the American \npeople that we can have an enforcement in place both at the border and \nin the interior at the workplace that will enable the rest of the \nlegislation to work.\n  I have made it very clear over the last several weeks that I cannot \nsupport the underlying bill unless it has those enforcement guarantees \nbecause I cannot go to my constituents, look them in the eye, and say \nthis is going to work.\n  So I agree, our immigration system is broken. The legal system is \nbroken. The illegal immigration system, obviously, is broken. But we \nhave to do the right things to fix it or else the promises we make are \nsimply empty promises.\n  They say everybody wants to go to Heaven, but not everybody is \nwilling to do the hard things to get there. This is an example of that. \nIt is a hard thing. A lot of people do not want to see a tightening at \nthe workplace. But it has to happen, and I think we all acknowledge \nthat.\n  I was part of the 1986 immigration reform. That dates me, I know. But \nI was on the commission that helped come up with that. We proposed \nemployer sanctions--it was called at the time--both in terms of the \nlegislation and how it was implemented. Those employer sanctions were \nnever put in place. That is one, although 3 million people were \nlegalized, millions more came--up to 12 million now.\n  This is the critical part of this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's have a vote on it. If we \ndo not have a vote on it, we will not send the necessary message to the \nHouse of Representatives of the importance of this piece of the puzzle.\n  People said: Well, why didn't you include it in the Corker-Hoeven \namendment, which was about a border surge? Because it needs to be and \ndeserves to be drawn out as a separate issue, a separate debate, which \nwe have had on the Senate floor. I have spoken on it before, Senator \nTester has spoken on it, and we need to be sure that we can show \nthrough a bipartisan vote that, yes, we are willing to do the hard \nthings to get to ``Heaven,'' the hard things to make sure this \nlegislation actually works; and that is dealing with this at the \nworkplace, which is the magnet, which is the reason people come to this \ncountry.\n  So I would ask any colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please, let \nus have a vote. There have only been 10 votes out of the over 500 \namendments, apparently, that have been filed. There have been only 10 \nvotes on this floor. Let us have a vote. We will be able to do it in a \nbipartisan way. We will be able to show the American people, as \nRepublicans and Democrats, we can come together to solve big problems--\nand this is a big one. If it is not solved, I will tell you, it is not \ngoing to work.\n  The pilot program for the kind of E-Verify that is in the underlying \nbill has been tested. Do you know what the recent report says on it? \nFifty-four percent of those who are illegal got through the system and \ngot a job--more than half. Why? Because the verification does not work. \nOur legislation strengthens it in a half dozen ways.\n  Again, I have gone into great detail on this on the Senate floor, and \nit is all in the Record, and I have shared this with all my colleagues \nwho are interested.\n  Again, we have done the right thing in terms of working with both \nsides of the aisle, playing by the rules in terms of being sure the \nGang of 8 signs off on it. It is not perfect, it is not exactly the \namendment I initially drafted, nor is the underlying legislation \nperfect. But it does put in place real enforcement to ensure that the \nlegalization will not occur in the absence of enforcement, which would \nlead not only to fewer people coming out of the shadows, but more \nillegal immigration coming, as happened in 1986.\n  The 1986 bill casts a long shadow in this place, and we have to be \nsure we do not repeat those mistakes. This will ensure we do that.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues, including the ranking member who has \nbeen terrific in this process trying to work with us, to accept a \nreasonable list and to accept some time limits that are reasonable.\n  I will say, last July 4th, a year ago, we were kept in session in \nthis place. I was kept in session, as was every Member. I was happy to \ndo it. But, frankly, it was regarding legislation that was more \npolitical than it was real. It never went anywhere because it was \nviewed as kind of a political exercise. I think both sides of the aisle \nwould agree with that. We stayed on Saturday. As I recall, we stayed \nthat weekend.\n  Here we have a historic bill before us on immigration and we cannot \nstay for a couple days to be sure we get through some of these \namendments? That makes no sense.\n  Members in this body know me. I am not a partisan. I am not a guy who \nnormally gets up here and rails against the other party about process. \nBut I would say both parties need to figure out a way to come together \nand to come up with a list of amendments that make sense to ensure that \nthis legislation we are considering is one that not only goes over to \nthe House with over 60 votes but goes over to the House with the kind \nof substantive provisions that are going to make the legislation work \nso we can tell the American people and, frankly, tell our colleagues in \nthe House this is something they ought to take up because our \nimmigration system is broken.\n  I see my colleague from Montana is here. I would yield to him to see \nif he has any comments to make.\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio.\n  I just want to say this: I am not going to speak a lot about the \namendment. I think Senator Portman has laid it out very well. I just \nwant to say that we have immigration problems in this country that need \nto be fixed, and they have needed to be fixed for some time.\n  I think the Gang of 8 has done a great job coming forth with a good-\nfaith effort, with a good bill that heads us in that direction. I think \nthis amendment makes a good bill even a better bill.\n  I thank Senator Portman for his work in a bipartisan way to put forth \nan amendment that makes the bill better, that makes the bill work \nbetter.\n  I will tell you, at some point in time there will be a unanimous \nconsent request offered on this amendment to get a vote on it, and I \nwill hope that both sides agree that we can get a vote on this \namendment. I will tell you why. It makes the bill better, and it will \npass. That is what we are here to do.\n  So I thank my friend from Ohio, and I will encourage, as he did, both \nsides to come together to make a good bill an even better bill so we \ncan pass it through Congress and get it to the President's desk.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana. I \nthank him for his willingness to work on this together. This was not an \neasy process. Let's be honest, a lot of people would like not to \ntighten up the workplace requirements. There are people on all sides of \nthis issue. The business community sometimes does not want to. Labor \nunions sometimes do not want to. Other groups are concerned about this. \nBut the reality is, unless we have strong workplace verification \nprovisions in place, the rest of the legislation does not work. It is a \ncritical piece of the puzzle.\n  I urge my colleagues to give us a vote. Give us a chance. Let's show \nwe can, on a bipartisan basis, do something that will actually create \nthe enforcement that is needed to have the rest of this legislation \nwork.\n  Again, I am urging both sides of the aisle to work on this together \nand to come up with a reasonable list of amendments. I am not \nsuggesting anybody else's amendment should not be offered, but I am \nsaying there is a way to get there. If we have to stay in, I hope \nMembers would be willing to do this on an issue this important to the \nAmerican people and this important to the future of our country.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for his good work on his piece of \nlegislation. I will talk about that in a minute.\n  I want to just talk in general about where we are. Obviously, this \nhas been a long hard road, and we are on the edge of passing one of the \nmost significant pieces of legislation that this body will have passed \nin a very long time.\n  The good news is we are going to pass it with just about every \nDemocrat voting for it and a very significant number of Republicans \nvoting for it. The reason for that is the vast majority of Members in \nthis body realize that the immigration system is broken and needs \nfixing, absolutely. We have a dumb system right now. We turn away \npeople who create jobs, and we let people cross the border who take \naway jobs from Americans.\n  America is crying out that we fix the system. We have 11 million \npeople in the shadows. They are working for substandard wages, many of \nthem under desperate conditions, and they bring down the wage rates for \neverybody else, through no fault of their own. We want to bring those \npeople to an earned path to citizenship.\n  We want to take our immigration system and admit people who are going \nto create jobs. We have shortages. Google Maps is now in Vancouver, \nCanada. It is an American company. It is an American idea. But they are \nin Vancouver, Canada, because they cannot get the employees they need \nhere. They are willing to pay whatever, but Canada's immigration system \nis much better than ours and they can get the people from all around \nthe globe who are needed to run that part of the company.\n  We are fair to agriculture, growers. The farm workers have come \ntogether on this bill. It is a large improvement over the present \nsystem.\n  Now, I have heard my good friend from Ohio--and I like his amendment. \nIn fact, my staff worked on it with him. But let's make no mistake \nabout it. This is a vast bill, and E-Verify--permanent E-Verify--is in \nthe bill. Maybe it can be improved a little bit, but it is 0.01 percent \nof the bill. It does not deal with border security. It does not deal \nwith entry-exit. It does not deal with the 11 million. It does not deal \nwith future flow. So I would urge my colleague to reconsider.\n  Of course, we want this amendment offered, and many of us will \nsupport it. But to say that is the only reason--if it does not get in \nthe bill it is not worth voting for--I would have to respectfully and \ncompletely disagree with my colleague.\n  Let's face it, there are Members on his own side of the aisle who \nwill block him from offering it. So that says it all, doesn't it? Why \ndo they do that? Because they do not want a bill to pass. That has been \nthe strategy.\n  I heard my good friend from Iowa talk about we are not approving \nenough amendments. Well, I will tell you, the folks on the other side \nhave had a great plan: block votes for 2 weeks and then, in the final \nhours, complain we have not had enough votes. That is what they have \ndone.\n  The first week we wanted to move amendments. The able chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee did. Oh, no. We had to change the rules and change \nthe number of votes it takes to pass a bill around here. Week 2, we \nproposed many amendments be offered and the pace was painstakingly \nslow.\n  That is the plan: Block votes for 2 weeks and then complain.\n  Finally, last night, we got a list of 35, 36 amendments from the \nother side. Of course, we have many amendments. That would be 72 \namendments because our side would want a one-for-one. That is only \nlogical and fair. Then we heard it was not sufficient, that they wanted \nmore amendments than that.\n  Furthermore, the Republican steering committee, my own colleagues \nhave told me, sent out word: Get more amendments out there because we \nwant to make sure there are so many amendments that we could never \nfinish this bill.\n  In fact, even in that list of 36, the majority--not the majority but \nthose who asked for the most amendments--were professed opponents of \nthe bill. They were not interested in improving the bill. The strategy \nwas, at the last hour, create dilatory tactics so the bill could never \nbe approved.\n  Again, look at the list. One Member--I will not mention his name--\noffered seven; another offered six. They are two of the five leading \nopponents of the bill. They are not interested in improving it. Many of \nthe amendments on that list of 35 were debated in committee and \ndefeated by bipartisan votes. The committee was an open process that \nshows our bona fides. There were 301 committee amendments, more than \n130 votes, 49 Republican amendments added into the bill.\n  Leader Reid has just made a reasonable offer. He took 17 amendments \nfrom that list of 36. Every one of them was a Republican request. He \ndid not make them up. He did not spin them out of whole cloth. He added \n15 Democratic amendments. We have a lot of people on this side who \ngenuinely want to improve the bill. Of course, the other side objected.\n  So the idea--the idea that we are not allowing amendments. Please. \nTake the leader's offer. That is half of the amendments you submitted \nlast night.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My understanding is that there were 17 amendments that \nwere just proposed by the majority leader, and it was opposed by the \nSenator from Iowa because we were not allowing votes. Did I hear \ncorrectly that after a unanimous consent request for 17 Republican \namendments--1 of them very critical to the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Ohio because of E-Verify, which is something which is a \nfundamental key to making\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\nsure that those 40 percent of the people who are in this country \nillegally, who did not cross our border but came on visas and \noverstayed--and then it is my understanding that after those 17 votes, \nwith 10 minutes allowed for each side, if I understand the unanimous \nconsent request by the majority leader, then we would do 17 more and \neven 17 more, if necessary. Yet the Senator from Iowa says we are not \nallowing amendments.\n  I have to say, I think in honesty, if I would ask the Senator from \nNew York this, there was a delay of a couple days there that was \nunnecessary, which frankly was from the other side. But to somehow \nallege that the rights on this side of the aisle are being abridged, \nwhen there is a unanimous consent request to have 17 votes right now \nwith 10 minutes in between--perhaps the Senator from New York can \nexplain to me that logic.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is very hard to explain. It is sort of twisted logic \na little bit, it is sort of pretzel-like logic. It is also pretzel-like \nlogic to delay votes for so many weeks and then say all at once we need \nhundreds and hundreds of amendments. Not right, not fair, particularly, \nas my good friend from Arizona knows, when so many of those amendments \ncome from sworn opponents of the bill, when so many of those amendments \nwere disposed of in committee. So he is right.\n  One other point I would make while my good friend from Arizona is \nhere, one of my fellow so-called gang members. We have a lot of \ndisputes in this body because one side is against the other side. One \nside says one thing and the other side bands together and says no. We \nget gridlock. We need 60 votes. Neither side has it.\n  That is not the case here. Every major vote has been bipartisan, with \na very significant number from the other side supporting the bill. More \nthan that, the whole process has been bipartisan. The Gang of 8 was \nfour and four. We sat in that room and haggled. We had as many disputes \non the Democratic side, which did not want to accept what the \nRepublicans wanted, as disputes on the Republican side, which did not \nwant to accept what Democrats wanted.\n  But we all met in the middle because we believed in this bill. The \nsad fact is that while the vast majority of Americans support this \nproposal--by every poll that is seen, a majority of Republicans support \nthis proposal, a majority of conservative Republicans support this \nproposal--there is a group in the country and reflected in the Senate \nthat is so opposed to this bill they will go to any length to stop it. \nBut the good news is, when you have a bipartisan majority, that cannot \nhappen. So we get the kind of logic that my good friend from Arizona \nhas pointed out. We get the kind of thing--it is sort of like Houdini. \nRemember, he tied himself in a straitjacket and then complained he \ncould not get out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield? The Senator from Iowa may allege \nthat the amendments he wants considered are not in that package. I \nwould ask the Senator from New York, and perhaps the majority leader, \nwould we then agree to have votes on the amendments the Senator from \nIowa wants? This is a beginning and something we could continue to vote \non as long as it takes.\n  When we were doing the budget, we stayed up all night. That was \nanother great moment in the history of the Senate. Again, I am not \nsaying all amendments are not equal. But I think it is pretty clear \nthat the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Ohio Mr. Portman \nhave a very important amendment that has to do with E-Verify, a \nfundamental of this legislation.\n  We can assure the American people that the magnet disappears because \nof the certainty of penalties for employers, which is embodied in E-\nVerify, which the Senator from Ohio has spent weeks on. Only a nerd \nsuch as the Senator from Ohio could come up with the absolute detailed \nand absolute complete and comprehensive approach to E-Verify, a man I \nadmire enormously.\n  Anybody who could be the Director of the budget has to be a nerd, as \nwe know. But I admire the work of the Senator from Ohio, along with the \nSenator from Montana. Is there anyone who would disagree that what the \nSenator from Ohio and the Senator from Montana are proposing would not \nimprove the bill enormously and the confidence of the American people \nthat we can verify whether someone is in this country illegally and \napplying for a job?\n  I guess my other question is, if the Senator from Iowa does not like \nthe list that the majority leader read from, why do we not do some of \nthe other amendments or are we not going to do any amendments? Finally, \nmay I say to my friend from Ohio, I have the greatest respect for his \nintellect and his capabilities. I know he knows I was just joking with \nmy comments.\n  As a personal aside, when I was practicing for a failed run for the \nPresidency, the Senator from Ohio played my opponent, and I began to \ndislike the Senator from Ohio enormously. He did a great job, as he did \nin the last election.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. Reclaiming my time, I would say, \nwhen we get a nerd from Ohio and a farmer from Big Sandy, MT, together, \nof course we are going to get a very good amendment.\n  The bottom line, though, is simple. That amendment is in the list \nthat the leader suggested. Every one of the 17 Republican amendments \nwas part of that list of 36. So the bottom line is--and now many more \namendments have been filed--just talking about the amendment. Look, E-\nVerify is in the bill. I would not quite agree with my colleague from \nArizona.\n  E-Verify will work very well without the amendment. I think it will \nwork somewhat better with the amendment. It is a good amendment. I am \nsupportive of the amendment. My staff helped work on the amendment. But \nlet's not say this bill will have no internal enforcement without the \namendment. It has very strong internal enforcement. In fact, it has \nmandatory E-Verify.\n  My good friend from Alabama has been railing for years that we need \nmandatory E-Verify in the country. As we work through the process, if \nthe House in its wisdom moves the bill, we can improve things. This is \nnot the last train out of the station. But I say this: If we do not \nhave a bill, we will have no E-Verify, improved, not improved.\n  So many of the things that many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle wanted will not be in the bill. Again, to me, having worked \nin a bipartisan way--and I have taken as many criticisms from my side \nof the aisle as from the other to get this done, what is happening \nhere--not the Senator from Ohio. He is sincerely eager to improve the \nbill and I support that improvement. But for many others who are \nvehemently opposed to the bill, there is a view to delay and delay and \ndelay in hopes--I would say forlorn hopes--that they cannot move the \nbill.\n  We have not been on this bill for 1 day. We have been on the bill for \n3 weeks. Again, most of the objections, not all but the vast majority, \ncame from the other side when we wanted to move forward. So I would \nurge that we adopt the leader's motion, 32 amendments, a reasonable \namount of time to debate them, 17 from the Republican list, 15 from the \nDemocratic list, and go forward.\n  I do not think there will be a single objection from our side, I will \ntell you that much. If you say we want these 32 and then untold more, \nthat is a different story. That is a different story. But, again, let \nme conclude on a happy note.\n  We have our differences. But it has been truly amazing to work with \nthe two Senators from Arizona and the Senator from South Carolina and \nthe Senator from Florida and the Senator from Colorado and the Senator \nfrom Illinois and the Senator from New Jersey. It has been an amazing \njourney. On one of the most difficult issues that faces America, we \nhave crafted a proposal that has broad support and strong momentum, \nmomentum that increased with today's vote and will increase further \nwith tomorrow's vote.\n  Please, one of the things our citizenry objects to is there is always \nnaysaying. It is always easier to say no than to say yes. But as has \nbeen pointed out, when you say no, you are keeping the 11 million here \nunder what many have called unstated amnesty. You are keeping a broken \nsystem that kicks out of the country people who create jobs and lets \ninto the country people who take away American jobs.\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\nYou are preventing the change in our immigration system to make America \ngrow.\n  CBO said: Wow, because of this bill, GDP would grow by 3 percent this \ndecade and 5 percent next decade. It is obvious. That is the energy of \nimmigrants--poor immigrants, unskilled immigrants, rich immigrants, \neducated immigrants. Our ancestors, such as James Madison Flake, who my \ncolleague from Arizona once told me about, but all our ancestors, \nwhatever part of the globe they came from, worked so hard and are part \nof the secret to American success.\n  This bill restores that energy and that vitality. Again, this bill is \nnot perfect. We never claimed it would be. But I would urge my \ncolleague, my good friend, sincere friend from Ohio, who is very \nsmart--that is what my friend from Arizona said--but has many other \ngreat attributes as well, and everyone else in this body, to not say, \nif I did not get exactly the change I wanted, this bill is no good; I \ncannot vote for it.\n  That is what has paralyzed this Nation in the last decade. This is an \nattempt not only to fix our immigration system but to overcome it. I \npray to God we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, because there were some comments made \nabout the amendment that Senator Tester and I have offered, let me be \nvery clear. This is about making the underlying bill work.\n  I do not believe it will work if we do not have strong workplace \nverification, simply, both because as the Senator from Arizona said, 40 \npercent of the people who are here illegally did not come across the \nborder, they came because they overstayed their visas and they are here \nillegally now, and because when folks want to come here badly enough to \nget work, they will go over, under, and around whatever barriers we put \non the border.\n  I am for more border security. It is a good part of the bill. It does \nnot solve the problem. Fifty-four percent--remember that. That is the \npilot program for E-Verify. Over half of the people who are illegal who \nattempt to get work are getting through.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I don't think it is going to affect anybody in this \nChamber. I don't think the bill will work. I am not going to vote for \nit if it doesn't have strong enforcement, because I don't think they \nare going to come out of the shadows in the way they want to have them, \nincluding me. I don't think you are going to be able to stop people \nfrom coming in the future. The flows of illegal immigration, as we saw \nin 1986, cannot be curtailed unless there is strong enforcement at the \nworkplace.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I yield to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding the Senator from Ohio, it is true, \nworked for weeks, literally consulting industry, consulting labor, the \nbest high-tech people in America, and has come up with these fixes \nwhich all of us, no matter how we are on this issue, agree would \ndramatically improve our capability to make sure if anyone is in this \ncountry illegally before they obtain a job.\n  Maybe it might be helpful to our colleagues if the Senator could \ndescribe for a couple of minutes, if he would, what he has been through \nin this process of coming up with this product to make sure this is a \nsystem that can work. I am not sure people are aware of that.\n  Again, I say only someone with his background, knowledge, and \nexpertise, in my view, could have come up with this amendment, along \nwith the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague. I have explained this on the floor \nin some detail as to what is in the legislation and why it is so \nimportant, including speeding up the time for E-Verify to apply, \nincluding a real trigger that is comprehensive, including having the \nability to verify somebody's identity--which is the problem now with E-\nVerify--by photo match, by doubling the amount that goes to the States \nfor them to provide the data.\n  It also has privacy protections. It also ensures we don't create a \nnew national database that could have potential negative consequences \nfor all of us as citizens who care about civil liberties. It is a great \nbalance.\n  We have worked with the chamber, we have worked with the AFL-CIO, we \nhave worked with the White House, we have worked with Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. We have worked with people in the Gang of 8. It is not \nexactly the amendment we initially drafted. Ours was even tougher, I \nwill say, in some respects, but it is an amendment I believe in my \nheart if we could get passed would create an E-Verify system that would \nbe strong enough to create a deterrent, and right now the incentive to \nwork is so strong that we can't solve this at the border. Plus, as my \ncolleague from Arizona indicated, folks are coming over and overstaying \ntheir visas.\n  Let me say one more thing more if I could, please.\n  The Senator from Iowa has 34 amendments he wishes to have offered. I \ndon't know if all 34 of those would actually be offered. Some of them, \nas my colleague from New York said, are being offered by the same \nSenator. I imagine there will be some voice votes in there. I know, as \nI said earlier, there has to be a time agreement that has to be \nreasonable. I know there has to be a limit. It seems to me there is a \nway for us to get there. This is, again, to show the American people \nthat on a bill this historic we don't just have 10 amendments on the \nfloor, to show we have the ability to hear not just from our amendment, \nSenator Tester and myself--which is critical to me to having this bill \nsucceed--but also other Members, who as Members of the Senate have the \nright to be heard.\n  I would hope we could come together. I misspoke earlier and said it \nwas last 4th of July. It was 2 years ago on the 4th of July. I remember \nmissing the 4th of July events back home because we were here voting. \nWhy? Because we wanted to spend some time on the Buffett rule, and that \nwas fine. We all came back and did it. It didn't go anywhere.\n  I would only suggest this is even more important. If we have to stay \nthrough the weekend, if we have to ensure that we stay up late tonight \nand tomorrow tonight to get this done, I hope we will do it to provide \nan ability to find a way forward where we have these amendments. \nSignificantly, we would offer an amendment like this one that enables \nthis bill to work, and it enables us to have even more support as this \nbill goes to the House of Representatives.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I have been very patient today, and I have just about had \nit on this, all of this pontificating on this amendment, all right?\n  The Senator from Ohio had an offer to put this in the bill. He turned \nit down. We are spending all of this time because he has been aggrieved \nin some way? He had the opportunity to put this amendment in the bill \nas it is offered.\n  I wanted to be quiet all day, but this is enough. This is enough. The \nAmerican people need to know he had the right to put it in the bill. \nThey agreed on it. He said no. I assume this is because he wants a big \nshow out here to have a separate vote. I don't know what it is. That is \nenough. I have had enough. I know he is a smart man. He has been head \nof OMB and a lot of good things. I know nothing bad about him, but that \nis enough of this, enough of this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about \namendment No. 1634 very quickly. The good Senator from Ohio has talked \nabout it and explained it very well, but I wish to talk about a few \nthings.\n  This amendment substantially improves privacy protections in the E-\nVerify Program. That is a good thing. It ensures no Federal database \nwill be created using the Photo tool or other data from a State DMV \ndatabase. That is a good thing.\n  It ensures no other Federal Government agency can access information \nmade available under E-Verify. That is a good thing.\n  It increases privacy protections using established techniques, such \nas requiring an individual to be notified when\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\ntheir Social Security number is used for purposes of employment \nverification in a manner that is potentially fraudulent. That is a good \nthing.\n  It requires new regular reporting of suspected fraudulent use of the \nE-Verify process.\n  This is a good amendment. It will make a good bill better.\n  For that reason I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1634 be in \norder for the purpose of a vote on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I reserve the right to object, and I will object.\n  I want the Members of this body to know that I very much am \ninterested in E-Verify, because I have legislation in for mandatory E-\nVerify. I was involved with several Senators in 2007 as we tried to get \nan amendment put together in those negotiations. It is a case of \nsomething very important. I happen to support this amendment, but it is \none of 34 others we sent over to the majority to give us votes on. Our \nside isn't going to let the other side pick our amendments and choose \nour amendments that are going to be adopted any more than they would \nlet us decide what Democratic amendments are going to be offered. That \napplies to the Portman amendment as well and the amendment of which \nSenator Tester is a cosponsor.\n\n  We had this set up where we were asked to put together amendments. It \nhappens to be that a Republican Senator, somebody who just spoke and \nwas involved in this colloquy, asked me to put together some \namendments. I worked hard with a lot of dissenting Republicans about \nhow we should do this process, put together 34 amendments and gave them \nto that Senator. He was going to negotiate with the leader or the \nmajority.\n  It seems to me I ended up giving my amendments to an errand boy, \ndidn't do much negotiation. We are here where we are.\n  Also for that Senator, I wish to tell him that he said we could do 15 \nvote amendments now, then maybe 15 more, and then maybe 15 more.\n  The unanimous consent request said after we do those amendments we \nwere asked to do, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed \nto vote on final passage of the bill. There wouldn't have been a \ntranche of so many and then another tranche.\n  Here we are, even though I think it is a pretty good amendment. We \nwere promised a free and open process of amendments, and the Group of 8 \npromised that from day one that they put their bill down, that this \nbill can be approved.\n  We have had a chance to improve it by a dozen votes, and that is it. \nI am sorry for Mr. Portman and for Mr. Tester that I have to object to \ntheir amendment, but I do object.\n  I think if we had 2\\1/2\\ weeks, we could have been doing a lot of \nthese other things we are going to have to rely on the other body to do \nto get a decent bill to go to the President of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator from Montana yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. TESTER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think of myself as one of the calmest \npeople around here, but a lot of facts and numbers have been tossed \naround here. Let's get a few in perspective.\n  When this bill was before the Judiciary Committee, there were 301 \namendments filed. We put them online. Every single person saw a week \nand a half in advance what the amendments were. We then brought them \nup. I would bring up one from one party and then one from another. We \ndid this day after day after day into the night until people said we \nhave no more amendments we want to bring up.\n  We adopted 136 of those amendments, all but 3 of them with Republican \nand Democratic votes. To say nobody has had a chance to amend this--we \nhad nearly 140 amendments, including amendments from the Senator from \nIowa, others, and myself. All but 3 of these 136 were by bipartisan \nvotes.\n  I well remember the last night of that markup, late in the evening. I \nsaid, does any Senator, Republican or Democratic, have another \namendment they want? No. There were not any more amendments, and we \nvoted out the bill.\n  We have offered to have rollcall votes on 15 Democratic amendments, \n17 Republican amendments, and then another 29 amendments that everybody \nagrees should be passed and do them en bloc in the managers' package.\n  Now I know some--not the Senator from Iowa because he has been here a \nlong time, but I know some Senators are new to this body. I have been \nhere 38 years. I have seen great legislators in the Republican Party \nand great legislators in the Democratic Party. We always talk about the \nhundreds of amendments we know we are going to get down to a finite \nnumber. Then you agree to vote on those, and you usually have a \nmanagers' package where both Republicans and Democrats agree these can \nbe done en bloc. This is what we have done. There are several \namendments here on the floor. We have offered 15 Democratic, 17 \nRepublican, and another 29 en bloc.\n  The objection did not come from the Democratic side. It came from the \nRepublican side, including some who said they would never vote for any \nimmigration bill whatsoever.\n  The distinguished majority leader has more patience than the Senator \nfrom Vermont. I applaud him for his patience.\n  I have not spoken on this point, and I apologize for taking the time, \nbut it is frustrating to me to hear these numbers when so much work has \nbeen done by both Republicans and Democrats on this bill to get to the \npoint we are.\n  I respect my friend Senator Portman, but he was offered the \nopportunity to put his amendment in the package which was agreed to. I \nhad amendments. I would love to have the glory of saying: Here is the \nLeahy amendment passed on the floor. I said: No, I am more interested \nin getting it passed. I will put it in the package and let it go \nthrough. I don't need to have my name on it. I just want to get it to \nthe floor.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has the floor.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator. I want to get back to the amendment \nfor a second here since it was objected to.\n  We wonder why we have a single-digit approval rating in Congress. The \npeople out here that I represent aren't Democrats first, they are not \nRepublicans first, they are Americans first.\n  This amendment was objected to by somebody who actually agrees with \nthe amendment. If you are home watching this on TV, you are saying what \nis going on in Washington, DC? We have an amendment that people agree \nis going to make this bill better, but yet it is objected to. Why? Is \nit because there will be one or two more votes for this bill in the \nend? Is that why? If it is, that is not a good reason.\n  Look, we all live in this country. We all want this country to work. \nWe all want it to continue to be a leader in the world. This amendment \nmakes a good bill better.\n  I want to kick it to the Senator from Ohio for his closing comments \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from Montana. There was some \ndiscussion, both by Senator Leahy--who actually was complimented \nearlier in his absence about the way he handled this bill in committee, \nby Senator Grassley, because of the amendments he did offer and allowed \nRepublicans and Democrats to offer.\n  To my friend, the majority leader, and to the Senator from Vermont, \nyes, we were offered, Senator Tester and I were offered the opportunity \nto put the legislation into the Hoeven-Corker amendment.\n  By the way, the idea there was that we had to cosponsor that \namendment sight unseen, which ended up being about 1,200 pages. We \nchose not to do that, Senator Tester and I, for a very simple reason, \nwhich is we wanted to have a debate and a vote on this issue.\n  I have discussed this on the floor now three times, and I will \ndiscuss it once more. Apparently the Senator from Nevada wasn't there \nto hear it.\n  We believe--and I am passionate about this, as you can tell--that if \nwe don't fix the workplace we cannot have\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nan immigration system that works. It is as simple as that. And to not \nhave a separate debate and a separate vote on this amendment, on this \nissue, does not give us the possibility of sending this over to the \nHouse with a strong message and maximizing the chance the House of \nRepresentatives will see that strong bipartisan vote on this important \nissue of workplace enforcement to ensure it is part of the final \npackage. It is that simple.\n\n  If it had been part of the so-called border surge amendments, \nrightfully so, Members from the other body and others observing this \nprocess would have said it wasn't about E-Verify, it wasn't about the \nworkplace, it was about the border and about the 20,000 new Border \nPatrol agents, and they would have been right. Let's be honest.\n  We asked for something simple: Give us an opportunity to have a \ndebate. It is not about us, it is not about politics, it is about the \nsubstance of the legislation, to make sure that coming out of the \nshadows will actually happen because folks will find it more difficult \nto find jobs if they are illegal, to ensure that we don't have a future \nflow of illegal immigration because we have, again, an employment \nverification system that works, and to show that there is bipartisan \nsupport for that.\n  Look, it is, frankly, not a very popular part of the legislation, and \nover the years it hasn't been. In 1986 it wasn't. That is why it was \nnever implemented, because there is sort of an unholy alliance among \nemployers, among those representing labor union members, among those \nrepresenting certain constituent groups who feel there might be some \ndiscrimination or other issues. That is why we have carefully drafted \nthis amendment to address those concerns, and we wanted to be sure we \nhad a separate debate and vote.\n  By the way, we are talking about a 5-minute debate, and we still hope \nwe will get it because it makes too much sense. We could not believe--\nSenator Tester and I could not believe that couldn't be possible in \nthis body, that the world's greatest deliberative body couldn't spend \n10 minutes debating this crucial issue to show, on a bipartisan basis, \nwhat kind of support there is for not just dealing with the border but \nalso dealing with the workplace, which, in my view, is the critical \nelement here.\n  We made a mistake in 1986 by not writing the legislation properly and \nnot implementing what we had in terms of employer sanctions. That is \none reason. Although 3 million people were given legal status and \namnesty, millions more came, to the point where now 12 million people \nare living in this country in the shadows. We have to be sure that \nproblem is addressed, and that is why legitimately we thought it would \nbe appropriate for this body to take up that issue and have a vote on \nit.\n  I stand by that. I think we made the right decision, although I am \nvery, very discouraged by the fact that it now appears there might be \nsome sort of a roadblock here. Let's get a reasonable list, let's get \nreasonable time limits, and let's work through these amendments. We \ncould be doing them right now. We could have done them yesterday. We \ncould do them tomorrow. We could be here over the weekend.\n  Two years ago we stayed in over the July 4th recess to talk about the \nBuffet rule, which never went anywhere. This is not substantive \nlegislation that we actually hope will become the law of the land and \nhave a major impact on all of us as American citizens and the future of \nour country, a nation of both immigrants and laws?\n  I ask again, Mr. President, that Republicans be reasonable, Democrats \nbe reasonable, and let's come together with a list that makes sense, \nand let's vote on these amendments. Let's start doing our work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair for allowing me to have the floor.\n  Look, we were moving--Senator Grassley had a list of 16, 18 \namendments Wednesday night. He was prepared to begin the voting on \nthose Thursday, Friday, Saturday if need be, as Senator Reid had said \nwe could work on Saturday. Monday, what happened? They had the super-\namendment, they had the Corker-Hoeven amendment, and the majority \ndecided to sit on that and not allow any amendments to occur Thursday, \nnot allow any amendments to occur Friday, and only have a cloture vote \non Monday. And that vote--I don't think our Members understood fully--\ngave complete power to the majority to dominate this process, to end \nthe idea that we would have an open, fair process. It ended with the \ncloture vote Monday.\n  We were in the process to vote on a series of amendments. Senator \nGrassley worked and worked, and he got 35 amendments that he said we \nwould agree to, out of the hundreds that were out there, to have votes \non. Yet now they come back and say 15 or 17, and now we are going to do \nthis, and we want this amendment and that amendment.\n  The process, I hate to say--it is pretty obvious to me--on Monday \nafternoon was altered. We had gone from an open debate process, as \nSenator Leahy conducted in the Judiciary Committee--at the end of it, \nhe did say: Anybody else have anything else they want to offer? And \nthere was nothing else to offer, and he voted.\n  The committee was not a normal committee. We had four of the Gang of \n8 on it. So the vote after vote after vote, including two votes on E-\nVerify that would have strengthened the bill, was voted down. Votes on \nthe earned-income tax credit--fixing and honoring the promise not to \nprovide that welfare payment--were voted down.\n  So I just want to say that everybody knows what happened. The \nRepublican Members of the Gang of 8 said we would have an open process. \nRight after the vote Monday afternoon, they told me they were going to \nwork for a process, but I knew then that the deal had been cooked and \nthat this wouldn't result in something that would work and be fair.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to yield to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Senator from Alabama for yielding, and I want \nto echo these concerns. I, for one, have been filing amendments and \ntrying to get votes on important amendments for weeks, since the very \nbeginning of this process. I started the first day of this debate, and \nI haven't let up.\n  The Senator from Alabama is exactly correct. A slow, halting \namendment process at the beginning was completely shut down by the \nproponents of this bill as soon as they identified a path to pass the \nbill. As soon as they put together the major elements of the Corker-\nHoeven amendment, then the amendment process was shut down. Now they \nare trying to resurrect a little bitsy piece of it at the tail end of \nthe entire debate. For what reason? For the purely cynical reason that \nthey can get a few amendments they want up to try to grow and maximize \ntheir vote. Well, that is a purely cynical, one-sided process, and I, \nfor one, won't stand for it.\n  I have been here urging my amendments from the beginning and \nconsistently. The Senator from New York was on the floor a few minutes \nago saying this was some last-minute plea. It hasn't been last-minute \non my part. I started on day one, and I continued on day two and \ncontinued on day three, all through the process. I was ready with my \namendments early on. Friday, I organized a letter expressing this very \nconcern about the shutdown of the amendment process and organized \nsignatures and sent that letter on Monday to the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  So my plea for votes on significant amendments didn't start today. It \ndidn't start yesterday. It has been part of the entire floor process, \nbut that process has been completely controlled and manipulated in a \none-sided way by the proponents of this bill, and now they just want a \nfew amendments at the end. Why? No. 1, so they are not embarrassed by \nthe complete shutdown they have orchestrated; and No. 2, so they can \ntry to buy a few more votes for the bill on cloture. Well, that is not \nan open process, that is not a fair process, nor is it fair to be \npicking and choosing what amendment votes I get. All of the amendments \nby myself and others are germane.\n  This is not reasonable in any way. So I proudly join the Senator from \nIowa in objecting to that offer, which was completely cynical and one-\nsided.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his comments, \nand I thank Senator Portman for providing some good language to improve \nour situation.\n  I truly believe what happened Monday afternoon heralded deep trouble. \nThere was deep trouble the week before when a dramatic reversal of \nenforcement ideas came about to throw money at this problem come \nFriday. That is what happened, and the process has been shut down \nessentially since then.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate \nthe Senator from Alabama yielding the floor.\n  I came down first of all to express my gratitude to Senator Grassley \nfor fighting for amendments, and I wish to comment on and really affirm \nwhat Senator Vitter was talking about--the Senator from Louisiana--\nabout how these amendments were chosen by the other side.\n  I have not been an abuser of the amendment process in my time in the \nSenate. I try to pick the amendments and I try to write the amendments \nI think really have a positive impact on any piece of legislation.\n  In this case, on the immigration bill, I want to solve the problem. I \nwas looking for a reason to vote for the bill. What prevents me from \nvoting for this bill is the huge cost we are having to pay for it.\n  Listen, I don't want to divide families. I don't want to deport \nchildren's fathers. I don't want to deport husbands and wives. But I \nalso agree with the American people that we cannot--we are already \nbankrupt in this country. We cannot provide benefits to those people \ncoming here whom we want to welcome into our country, to contribute to \nour country, but we can't be paying benefits.\n  So I offered two amendments--first of all, to not allow the Secretary \nto extend the registration period another 18 months, so we can get this \nbehind us. My other amendment, which I think is more significant and \nwould help me vote for the bill, would be to prevent immigrants from \nobtaining the earned-income tax credit. The American people by a 77-\npercent margin do not believe we should be paying benefits, as we are \nbankrupting this nation, to people who are not citizens.\n  The amendment, the one I really asked for, if it was going to be \nnarrowed down from two to one, I asked for a vote on the amendment to \nprevent the earned-income tax credit--a welfare benefit paid through \nthe Tax Code--from being offered to immigrants. That is the one I \nwanted, but in this package, negotiated apparently by the majority \nleader, they were going to offer the other amendment. Why? Because I \ndon't believe they want to expose their Members to that vote, basically \nproviding benefits to non-U.S. citizens that they know full well the \nAmerican people do not support.\n  So, once again, I appreciate Senator Grassley's efforts. I also fully \nsupport Senator Portman's amendment as well. He is exactly right. The \nway we stop illegal immigration is by reducing the demand for illegal \nborder crossings. We do that by shutting down the demand for that \nlabor.\n  Again, we want to welcome legal immigrants through a legal process, \nbut we cannot tolerate this lawlessness and this illegal immigration, \nand we simply cannot afford to pay noncitizens that benefit level. The \ncost of the bill is $262 billion, which just makes it very difficult \nfor me to support it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one more thing. First, I agree with \nSenator Johnson. I offered an amendment on the earned-income tax credit \nin committee--and four of the Gang of 8 Members are on the committee--\nand they all voted that down, as I recall, even though they promised \nthere would be no welfare benefit for those in the country illegally \nwho would be given provisional status under this legislation. So that \nwas a breach of one of the key promises they made when the bill was \nmoved forward.\n  As a result, we know the earned-income tax credit is not a tax \ndeduction; it is a direct check from the U.S. Treasury to people based \non a lower income. It is a welfare-type payment. It is not a tax \ndeduction-type situation. So that was a disappointment in committee, \nthat the group's promises were violated, and they have been blocked \nagain on the floor.\n  There is one more thing I want to say. I don't appreciate the idea \nexpressed that no matter what would happen, Members on this side would \nnot vote for the bill. That is not true. We need, and need badly, an \nimmigration bill that would improve the immigration system of America, \nput us on a sound course for the future, would provide compassionate \nstatus for people who are here illegally and put them in a situation \nwhere they do not have to be deported. And I would support that and \nhave said that for years, actually, and have said that through this \nprocess.\n  But let me tell you what the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices Association wrote to the Senate just 2 days ago, June 24:\n\n       The . . . immigration bill, if passed, will exacerbate \n     USCIS concerns about threats to national security and public \n     safety.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       It will further expose the USCIS agency as inept with an \n     already proposed massive increase in case flow that the \n     agency is ill prepared to handle.\n\n  They go on to say this about the bill:\n\n       It was deliberately designed to undermine the integrity of \n     our lawful immigration system.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This bill should be opposed and reforms should be offered \n     based on consultation with the USCIS adjudicators who \n     actually have to implement it.\n\n  Nobody asked them. They met in secret with the special interests, big \nbusiness interests, the La Raza interests, the agriculture interests, \nthe Immigration Lawyers Association, but they didn't have any of the \nofficers there. I wrote and asked them to meet with them. They still \nrefused to meet with them because they didn't want to hear that.\n  On June 24, 2013, ICE's union association wrote us and said:\n\n       I urge you to vote no as this bill fails to address the \n     problems which have led to the nation's broken immigration \n     system and in fact will only serve to worsen current \n     immigration problems.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Instead of empowering ICE agents to enforce the law, this \n     legislation empowers political appointees to further violate \n     the law and unilaterally stop law enforcement. This at a time \n     like no other in our nation's history, in which political \n     appointees throughout the federal government have proven to \n     Congress their propensity for the lawless abuse of authority. \n     There is no doubt that, if passed, public safety will be \n     endangered and massive amounts of future illegal \n     immigration--especially visa overstays--is ensured.\n\n  So all this talk about the greatest bill ever, it is not so. This \nbill is much weaker than the bill that was voted down in 2007. It was \non the way to defeat last week, until they had a desperate claim to \nthrow 20,000 agents at the border and spend a bunch of money without \nany thought about how it would work.\n  I am concerned about this. I think a lot is at stake. We know how the \nsituation got here. We know what happened. They voted cloture Monday \nand the majority leader filled the tree. He, therefore, has complete \ncontrol over any amendments. The last time in 2007, there were 47 \namendments voted on. This time, nine have been voted on. Even with the \n35 Senator Grassley proposed, that would be less than last time.\n  We know what has happened. The Corker-Hoeven amendment was able to \nrescue a bill that was in deep trouble, and now it looks like we are \nmoving on to final vote, without the ability to have amendments, \nbecause the majority will not agree to allow an open process, as was \npromised, and allow a number of amendments that were offered.\n  Senator Leahy said a lot of amendments were offered in committee. Why \ncouldn't they have been offered on the floor? Why couldn't we have \nvoted for amendments on the floor? The majority doesn't get to pick and \nchoose what amendments they are going to allow to come up. We are \neither going to have an open amendment process or we are not, and it \nlooks like we are not.\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and would yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on immigration \nreform, I would like to acknowledge the diligence and leadership of my \ncolleague from Alabama Senator Sessions, who has spent a lot of hours \non this floor and in the committee before this on the issue of \nimmigration. I commend his relentless efforts to bring to light many of \nthe problems and questions surrounding the legislation before us, some \nhe has been talking about in the past few minutes.\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives in 1986, I opposed the \nSimpson-Mazzoli Act, which granted amnesty to nearly 3 million illegal \nimmigrants. Supporters of that law then promised that it constituted a \none-time fix to our Nation's broken immigration system. Instead, the \npromise itself was broken. At least four times as many illegal \nimmigrants now reside in the United States some 27 years later.\n  Despite this failure, the Senate now tonight is considering \nlegislation that repeats the mistakes of Simpson-Mazzoli. The \nprovisions are different, but I believe the results will be the same. \nStill, supporters of this legislation before us promise border security \nin return for amnesty, just as proponents of Simpson-Mazzoli did.\n  In light of these facts, here is a more credible promise: I believe \nthe child of Simpson-Mazzoli will become the mother of all amnesties. \nYou can call it what you want.\n  Compounding the mistakes made a generation ago will ensure that the \nproblem of illegal immigration revisits generations to come on a much \ngrander scale. Therefore, I rise to urge my colleagues to reject this \ndeeply flawed legislation.\n  The subject of border security has been talked about in the Senate. \nDuring consideration of the Simpson-Mazzoli Act in 1986 in the Senate, \nmy former Senate colleague and coauthor of that legislation stated the \nfollowing: ``The American people, in my mind, will never accept a \nlegalization program unless they can be assured this is a one-shot \ndeal.''\n  The assurances to which he referred were border security and tough \nenforcement of immigration laws. Specifically, Simpson-Mazzoli called \nfor 50 percent more Border Patrol personnel for 2 years and new \npenalties for employers who hired illegal immigrants. Unfortunately, as \nwe know, the former proved insufficient and the latter was hollow. But \nit was too late. Nearly 3 million illegal immigrants had already been \ngranted amnesty by the time most lawmakers figured out that the \nassurances were basically a sham.\n  Despite the drastic increase in illegal immigration in the \nintervening years, supporters of the bill now before the Senate make \nsimilar assurances of border security in return for a form of amnesty. \nThey say there will be a surge in Border Patrol and a fence along the \nsouthern border. We have heard it before, but they claim two main \ndistinctions between their promise and the one we heard in 1986.\n  First, the supporters of this bill say this bill does not contain \namnesty but a tough path to citizenship. Second, they say this bill \nwill secure the border before legalization occurs. But will it? I \nbelieve neither claim holds water.\n  Under this legislation, once the Secretary of Homeland Security \nnotifies Congress that the Department has begun to implement a so-\ncalled comprehensive southern border security strategy and a southern \nborder fencing strategy, she can commence processing applications for \nregistered provisional immigrant status. In addition, the Secretary \nmust begin implementing these plans within 180 days of enactment of \nthis legislation.\n  I will clarify the legal talk: No later than 6 months after this bill \nbecomes law, those who came here illegally will be allowed to stay \nlegally.\n  I will clarify that further: That is amnesty.\n  The sequence is also noteworthy. No fence must be built before \namnesty is granted. No surge in Border Patrol must occur either. Those \nthings come after, not before.\n  So I return to the fundamental question: Will these measures as \nstructured stop illegal immigration? The Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO, says no. Instead, CBO provides only a vague and uninspiring \nassessment that the legislation will slow illegal immigration by some \namount greater than 25 percent--if, and only if, the dubious promises \nof this legislation are fulfilled.\n  Perhaps that is the more salient point: We don't know what the impact \nof this will be. We don't know what we are doing. We only know that \neven the best outcome will not be nearly enough.\n  I believe we should know what we are doing. We should know the border \nis secure before any discussion of legalization begins in the Senate.\n  But there are economic consequences to all of this too that people \nneed to think of. What we do know is that the economic consequences of \nthis massive amnesty will make struggling Americans struggle even \nharder. By some estimates, this legislation will produce a surge of \nmore than 30 million immigrants in just the first decade after \nenactment. Some people believe more.\n  CBO projects that passing this legislation brings grim news about \nwhat this will mean for working Americans as well as those looking for \nwork.\n  For example, the unemployment rate, according to CBO, will accelerate \nover the next 6 years; average wages for Americans will drop over the \nnext 10 years; meanwhile, average wages will rise for those granted \namnesty or legalization; economic output per capita will decrease over \nthe next 10 years; and the on-budget deficit will increase by more than \n$14 billion over the next 10 years.\n  In short, this legislation is projected to increase Americans' \ndifficulty in finding a job and then reduce their paycheck when they \nget one. In my judgment, that is reason enough to oppose any \nlegislation like this.\n  I understand that supporters of this legislation point to better \neconomic projections in the so-called outyears. However, even if those \nprojections prove accurate--which we don't know--we should never put \nthe economic well-being of Americans on hold.\n  Finally, I am deeply concerned that this legislation will further \nstrain our overcommitted entitlement and welfare programs. Our Nation, \nas we all know, is over $17 trillion in debt. We should be working on a \nlong-term plan to put our Nation back on sound fiscal footing, not \nadding to the burden.\n  There is also the issue of competitiveness. Long-term thinking would \nalso aggressively promote American competitiveness. Real immigration \nreform presents a golden opportunity to advance that cause. \nUnfortunately, this legislation misses the mark.\n  By some estimates, China and India together graduate nearly 1 million \nengineers each year from their universities. The United States, by \ncomparison, graduates approximately 120,000 engineers. In addition, the \nManhattan Institute estimates that 51 percent of engineering Ph.D.s and \n41 percent of physical sciences Ph.D.s who are foreign born are forced \nto leave the United States once they get their degree.\n  I believe if we care about immigration reform, if we want to continue \nto lead the world, we must attract and retain the best and the \nbrightest minds. Yet this legislation would cause a tectonic population \nand labor market shift in the opposite direction.\n  Specifically, CBO projects that among the tens of millions of \nimmigrants who will come to America under this legislation, there will \nbe seven low-skilled workers for each high-skilled worker. It is little \nwonder then that CBO projects that Americans' wages will fall.\n  Two provisions in the legislation will effect this change. First, the \ncurrent cap on family-based visas will be removed. This will create an \nunlimited influx of low-skilled workers. Second, the cap on visas for \nhigh-skilled workers will be increased, though not nearly enough to \nmeet the demand.\n  The legislation will also impose onerous new restrictions on \nemployers seeking to hire such workers. The authors of this legislation \nclaimed that it contains a merit-based approach, which will ensure that \nmore high-skilled immigrants receive visas. They emphasize that their \npoint system emphasizes higher education, consistent employment, and \nEnglish proficiency. Yet closer examination of the details reveals that \npoints would also be awarded on the basis of nonmerit factors,\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\nsuch as family ties and civic involvement. In effect, this dilutes not \nonly the point system but also claims of a merit-based approach that \nwill promote American competitiveness.\n  I think we have some of the best universities in the world. They \nattract a lot of the most gifted individuals from around the globe, \ndeepening our country's vast pool of talent. This, in turn, attracts \ncompanies here and abroad, seeking the brightest minds in math, \nscience, and engineering. Graduates will go onto attain high-paying \njobs or even create jobs themselves if they are allowed to stay here.\n  I believe we must do more to allow such talent to stay, especially in \nlight of an increasingly global and competitive economy.\n  In closing, I would quote Mark Twain, who once cleverly observed: \n``History does not repeat itself but it does rhyme.''\n  In the context of immigration reform, the promises we hear today \nsound a lot like those we heard in 1986, but this time the amnesty will \nbe much bigger. I believe the consequences will be many: undermining \nthe rule of law, failing to secure the border, increasing economic \ndifficulties for American workers and job seekers, eroding our Nation's \nfinances, and weakening our competitive position internationally.\n  I believe one of our fundamental responsibilities as lawmakers is to \nsupport policies that foster the conditions for job creation and \neconomic prosperity in America. I believe we must remain a welcoming \nnation, but we must always put Americans first.\n  In my judgment this legislation fails in many corners, and it fails \nmost tests. Accordingly, I will respectfully but firmly oppose it, and \nI urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to speak to the underlying \nlegislation that we are debating in the Senate today. I want to \nacknowledge that, like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I am a \ndescendant of immigrants. Only one generation separates me from a \ngrandfather who was born in Norway but came to America with his brother \nin hopes of making a better life. My grandfather and great-uncle, when \nthey came through Ellis Island, their given name was not the name I \nhave today. It was Gjelsvik, and when they got to Ellis Island the \nimmigration officials there asked them to change their name because \nthey thought it would be difficult to spell and pronounce for people in \nthis country. So they picked the name of the farm near where they \nworked near Bergen, Norway, which was the Thune farm. So Nicolai \nGjelsvik became Nick Thune, my grandfather.\n  When they got here they worked on the railroad, saved up enough money \nto buy a merchandizing store, which eventually became a hardware store, \nand there is to this day on the streets of Mitchell, SD, a Thune \nHardware. The family is not associated with it anymore, but that is an \nexample, like so many other cases, of people in this Chamber as well as \nthose all across the country who came here in search of the American \ndream, in search of a better life for their children and grandchildren.\n  My grandfather raised three sons in the middle of the Great \nDepression. The middle son, my father Harold, became an accomplished \nbasketball player, went on to star at the University of Minnesota, and \nwhen World War II broke out he defended his country in combat. He \nbecame a naval aviator, flew off the aircraft carrier Intrepid during \nWorld War II. When he returned to South Dakota he started raising his \nfamily in the small town of Murdo, which is where I grew up.\n  This country was built by immigrants like my grandfather, and our \nfuture both economically and as a continued example of freedom \nthroughout the world will be maintained by future generations of \nimmigrants who come here with the respect for the rule of law and hopes \nof starting a better life.\n  A lot has changed in the world since my grandfather came to the \nUnited States. We face new threats from abroad that attempt to use our \nporous borders to harm this Nation and to destroy our way of life. In \naddition to these new national security challenges, we depend on a more \ndynamic system of commerce, trade, transportation, and communication. \nOur government is also larger and now offers a broad social safety net \nto a growing and aging population. To maintain our system of \ngovernment, while encouraging future generations of immigrants to come \nhere, our immigration policy must provide a clear path for those who \nwish to come legally while enforcing the rule of law. As lawmakers, we \nhave to look at each piece of legislation that comes to the Senate \nfloor based on its own merits and the impacts that it will have on our \nNation.\n  The immigration bill before the Senate has many aspects of it that I \ncan support, but there are elements of this legislation that cause me \nconcern. I appreciate the effort of those who have worked in drafting \nthis bill to find a way to address the 12 million undocumented workers \nwho are currently living in this country. However, if we are going to \nfix the problem, we need to do so in a way that doesn't result in the \nSenate having the same discussion again and again in years to come.\n  The solution to the problem of illegal immigration is not Congress \npassing new laws every few years that provide for legalization without \nsecuring our borders. That sends the wrong message to natural-born \ncitizens and those waiting outside of our country to enter legally.\n  What legalization before enforcement communicates is if they want to \ncome to America, don't play by the rules; it takes too long. Instead, \nfind a way to sneak in and wait for the next round of amnesty.\n  Before we get to the point of talking about what a path to \nlegalization might look like, as a country we first need to be at the \nplace where we can, No. 1, confirm our borders are secure; No. 2, know \nwhen people have overstayed their visas; and, No. 3, have a system in \nplace where employment is limited to those who have played by the \nrules.\n  Once we have these tools in place, then we can look at a path to \nlegalization. The bill before us today is legalization first and \nenforcement second. That is a promise the American people have heard \nbefore.\n  Last week I spoke several times on an amendment that I had offered to \nthis legislation for a border fence which, at the time, was voted down \nby a majority in the Senate. I would prefer if we lived in a world \nwhere a border fence was not necessary, but, unfortunately, we do not. \nWhen I introduced that amendment I was surprised to learn from some of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle that in their view it was a \nwaste of money and unnecessary. In fact, one of my colleagues even \ncalled it a dumb fence. Yet the substitute amendment agreed to this \nweek now calls for 700 miles of fencing along the southern border.\n  With this new compromise, instead of the fence being a bad idea, now \nall of a sudden--and I guess it is not unlike some of the evolutions \nthat occur around here--it is a good idea. I appreciate that some of my \ncolleagues appreciate that good fencing is a key component of border \nsecurity.\n  I would like to make clear that this 700 miles of fencing is not a \ntrigger that is a precursor to legalization. The amendment agreed to in \nthe Senate is still legalization first and the promise of border \nsecurity down the road.\n  What the amendment I offered called for was 350 miles of fence to be \ncompleted prior to RPI status being granted. That would have meant \nborder security first, then legalization. Additionally, I had proposed \na double-layered fence to prohibit pedestrian traffic, which is \ndifferent than the single-layered fence in the current legislation.\n  It would be insincere to claim we want to discourage illegal \nimmigration and yet have a border that anyone can walk across, in some \nplaces without even knowing that a border has been crossed. No border \nfence will ever be 100 percent effective, we know that. But a physical \nbarrier along with increased use of technology will stem the flow of \npedestrian traffic. On the few sections of our border where a double-\nlayered fence is already in place, this is verifiably the case.\n  Another provision being touted as part of the compromise version of \nthis legislation is the inclusion of 20,000 additional Border Patrol \nagents to secure\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nour southern border. Prior to this compromise, our colleague from Texas \nSenator Cornyn was criticized for proposing 10,000 new agents. I would \nhear people coming down on the floor saying: We can't have that. How \nare we going to pay for it? We don't have the money to pay for this in \nthe bill.\n  Now the increase of 20,000--double the number proposed by the Senator \nfrom Texas--is being defended and even celebrated by my colleagues who \nwere criticizing the increase only a week ago. I am still not sure how \nthese additional Border Patrol agents will be paid for, nor am I sure \nhow Customs and Border Patrol will be able to double in size in a short \nperiod of time.\n  I want to point out that those who are proposing this--and, again, \nwhen this was originally proposed, the underlying bill had about $8.3 \nbillion in it for infrastructure and other things that were called for \nin the bill. But adding 20,000 Border Patrol agents now, with all the \nother spending in the bill, has driven the cost of this up from about \n$8.3 billion, which was going to be paid for in the form of fees, to \nnow about $50 billion in costs. The argument is, that is OK because it \nis going to be paid for. The CBO has said this is going to generate a \nsurplus over the next 20 years.\n  How is that surplus? How did they come up with that estimate? Of \ncourse, first of all, it is a payroll tax number. They are assuming \nthat people who come here are going to start paying payroll taxes into \nthe Social Security trust fund and into the Medicare trust fund--all \nprobably fair assumptions. The only thing about that is when those \npayroll taxes come into those trust funds, at some point their \nassumption is they are going to be paid out in the form of benefits. So \nthey took payroll tax surpluses and counted those as the way in which \nthey would pay for the spending in the bill.\n  However, if we actually look at what the CBO said, if we take out \nthose Social Security and Medicare trust fund surpluses, the general \nfund--or I guess you would say excluding the FICA payroll tax surpluses \namount on this--is a $70 billion deficit. If you back out Medicare, it \nis only a $14 billion on-budget deficit, but it is still a deficit \nunder the bill.\n  To suggest this is all going to be paid for by savings that are going \nto occur because of additional payroll taxes misses the point that \nthose are payroll taxes that go into those trust funds on the \nassumption they are going to pay benefits at some point in the future. \nThese are temporary savings; these are not savings we can count. In \nfact, when we do the on-budget analysis, we come up, again, with a \ndeficit of $14 billion. If we take out the Medicare surplus, payroll \ntax surplus, we end up with a $70 billion deficit.\n  While I appreciate, again, the work of my colleagues to improve the \nbill, the final product is still legalization first and promises of \nborder security down the road. The drafters of the legislation could \npoint to many specifics that they hope to see in place, but these \npromises of additional fencing, E-Verify, electronic entry-exit, and \nmore Border Patrol agents could be years away--if they ever happen at \nall. There are virtually no border security or interior enforcement \nborder security measures in place prior to the initial legalization of \n12 million undocumented workers.\n  I would like to see a border security package that brings real border \nsecurity prior to legalization. Unfortunately, this bill is not it.\n  We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It \nis important that these laws are respected and enforced in accordance \nwith the Constitution and with respect to our immigrant heritage. We \nmust have an immigration system that rewards those who play by the \nrules and come to the United States through legal means. In considering \nchanges to our laws, we need to promote and reward lawful behavior \nrather than providing incentives that would encourage even more illegal \nimmigration.\n  In 1986 Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act \noffering amnesty to roughly 3 million people. Today the population of \nillegal immigrants in the United States is estimated to be around 12 \nmillion.\n  Did the 1986 amnesty legislation solve the problem? No, it did not. \nYet today here we are again proposing a very similar package which \nrepeats the same mistakes made in the past. Lawful immigration makes \nour communities, our economy and our country stronger. Our current \nimmigration system needs to be fixed in a manner that continues \nAmerica's great heritage as a nation of immigrants. Unfortunately, as \nthis bill currently stands it will not solve the problem. Unless we see \nchanges that emphasize border security and the rule of law before \nlegalization, I will not be able to support this bill. And that is not \nbecause I oppose immigration reform. It is because this is not a piece \nof legislation that will help our country in the long run. This \nlegislation will provide instant legalization, leaving in place many of \nthe same problems which led to the situation, while exacerbating other \nproblems.\n\n  I filed an amendment that would take many of the triggers being \ntouted as part of this latest substitute amendment and make them \nprelegalization. If this amendment were to be accepted, the bill would \nbecome enforcement first and legalization later. We may not get to the \npoint in the Senate where that type of change is going to be \nconsidered.\n  As we wind up this debate and move to the finish line in terms of \nfinal passage, it sounds as though additional amendments are probably \nunlikely to be considered, which is unfortunate. We have a lot of \ncolleagues, as was talked about earlier, who have lots of good ideas \nthat would improve and strengthen this bill. We will not have an \nopportunity to debate or vote on those amendments.\n  I am hopeful that as this bill moves out of the Senate sometime \ntomorrow and gets to the House of Representatives it will be \nstrengthened in ways I can support. It is time we keep our promises to \nthe American people by securing our borders as we seek to reform our \nimmigration system. I hope before this is all said and done and this \nprocess reaches the final finish line, which would be the President's \ndesk, it has the right types of enforcement that put border security \nfirst and addresses what I think are the broken promises that have been \nmade to the American people too many times in the past.\n  The American people need to be assured once and for all that we are \nserious about the issue of enforcement and the issue of border \nsecurity, and that the past promises and assurances which have been \ngiven in the past are not all empty rhetoric and hollow talk and mean \nsomething. We can do that, but unfortunately this bill fails to get the \njob done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues are very \ntalented attorneys. I am reminded of the adage that when you are a \nlawyer, if you have the law on your side, you argue the law. If you \nhave the facts on your side, you argue the facts. But if you have \nneither the law nor the facts on your side, you bang on the table and \ncreate a diversion.\n  What I have heard a lot about here today is clearly a diversion \nbecause it is not either the law we are promoting or the facts, which \nseem to be pretty stubborn, but sometimes for people in this Chamber I \nguess the facts are not an impediment toward their arguments.\n  I will try to get to what this law is and what the facts are. My \ncolleague from Alabama Senator Sessions likes to whip out the phrase \n``welfare benefits.'' Let's make it clear to the American people we \nhave not permitted welfare benefits for anyone under existing law who \nis undocumented in this country. We extend that and actually to some \ndegree enlarge it in this law we are promoting. So to throw that out \ncarelessly and suggest: Oh, there are welfare benefits--there are no \nwelfare benefits. The existing law stops welfare benefits for anyone \nwho is undocumented in the country, and we extend it in this law.\n  I must say I am chagrined when I hear my colleagues speak about \ncertain Americans who are part of civil society, part of our civic \nfabric, part of national organizations such as La Raza and somehow are \nspoken of as if they are second-class citizens and that I should bend \nat the altar of some others who Senator Sessions believes are somehow \nsuperior. They have every right, as a U.S. citizen, to voice their \nopinions about what our government\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\nshould do in this question of immigration reform. I don't care for the \ncategorization of people who are engaged as ordinary citizens of this \ncountry to be treated as if they were some second-class citizen.\n  Only in Washington could we hear an argument that somehow public \nsafety will be ``endangered'' as a result of this legislation. There \nare 20,000 additional border agents and more resources are going to \nimmigration enforcement than all other Federal criminal enforcement \nagencies, and somehow that creates greater endangerment of the public \nsafety? So 20,000 more Border Patrol agents will somehow make the \nNation less secure? Only in Washington could some of the detractors of \nthis legislation suggest that 20,000 additional border agents and \ndoubling the Border Patrol makes us less secure. Only in Washington \ncould 700 miles of fencing make the Nation less secure. Only in \nWashington could the suggestion be made that an entrance-exit visa \nprogram to check who is coming in and making sure they leave or else \nthey can be pursued is making us less secure. Only in Washington could \nwe think about a mandatory universal E-Verify Program that has been \nenhanced under this legislation and somehow that makes the public less \nsecure.\n  This comes from some of the very voices that for so long have said, \nwe need more Border Patrol agents and more fencing. When they finally \nget the Border Patrol agents, fencing, and E-Verify system nationally \nmandated so everybody who gets a job or seeks to get a job is going to \nhave to go through the system, as well as an entrance-exit visa program \nthat is going to be implemented, and they still say: Oh, no, it is \neither not what we wanted or it is not enough.\n  And triggers--my God. Personally, from my perspective, we are trigger \nhappy in this bill. We have more triggers in this bill than I have seen \nin virtually any other legislation. I believe we have up to five \ntriggers. We have five triggers that have to be pulled, which means \nthey have to be achieved before they can move forward to citizenship. \nThat is a pretty significant period of time.\n  Now to the suggestion about costs. Well, this is one of the elements \nof where facts are a stubborn thing to overcome. Truth crushed to the \nground still springs back. So what does it say? Well, let's start off \nwith what it says about the deficit. This isn't me saying it as a \nproponent of the bill, as the Gang of 8. The Congressional Budget \nOffice--the nonpartisan entity of the Congress that both Democrats and \nRepublicans rely on for an analysis of whether a piece of legislation \nwill cost money, what sort of economic impact it will have, and what \nthe consequences will be--came to their own independent conclusion.\n  They said the gross domestic product would ultimately grow by 3.3 \npercent in the first 10 years after enactment. What does that mean? \nThat means from all the output of this Nation, gross domestic product \nwould grow dramatically. When we see growth at that additional rate, it \nmeans every American prospers as a result of it.\n  Then it went on to say an additional 5.4 percent of gross domestic \nproduct increase would exist in the second 10 years. That means even \ngreater growth, which means greater opportunities for all Americans \nhere at home. It also means the bipartisan immigration reform we have \nbeen debating in the Senate will actually grow our economy, not harm \nit, as some of the most ardent opponents have tried to argue. I have \nbeen saying that, as well as many others, all along.\n\n  What else did the Congressional Budget Office tell us? It told us we \nare going to reduce the deficit. We are going to reduce the deficit \nby--I think I have the wrong chart. Let me look. This is actually taxes \npaid. We had a chart, but basically what it says is that it is going to \nreduce the deficit by $197 billion over the first 10 years, and an \nadditional $700 billion over the second 10 years. That is $900 billion \nof deficit reduction.\n  We will have nearly $1 trillion of deficit reduction as a result of \nthis legislation. That deficit reduction is critical for the Nation's \neconomic growth, prosperity, and to make sure the next generation \ndoesn't bear that burden. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthat is what we are going to get from achieving passage of this \nlegislation and ultimately moving it into law.\n  The report went on to say revenue will come in a whole host of ways, \nsuch as payroll taxes, income taxes, fees, and fines estimated to be \nabout $459 billion in the first 10 years and $1.5 trillion in the \nsecond 10 years. It also found there were fewer unauthorized \nindividuals coming into the United States under the bill.\n  One of the things the CBO said was: Well, there will be those whom we \nare concerned will overstay future visas. Two things on that score, and \none point my colleagues have used consistently: No. 1, which visas are \nthey talking about? Are they talking about the visas our Republican \ncolleagues have largely championed for businesses in this country they \nwant to see grow? Some have amendments to grow it even more. Those are \nthe visas CBO talked about ultimately having the concern that people \nmay overstay. That is why the entrance-exit visa program is so \nimportant to ensure that doesn't happen.\n  It is ironic, again, how they can argue all sides here. Because if we \nlook at what CBO said, they said the potential for overstay of those \nnew visas would be the issue. That is why this employment verification \nsystem and the entrance-exit visa program is so important.\n  The bottom line of the Congressional Budget Office report is pretty \nclear. It tells us the 11 million people who are living in fear in the \nshadows are not, as some would have us believe, part of America's \nproblem, but by bringing them out of the shadows will be part of our \nsolution. It is the key to economic growth.\n  Also, immigration reform, according to their views, will also save \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds. In so many ways these are so \nincredibly important.\n  I heard that somehow this will create challenges on the question of \nwages. Well, as I listened to some of my colleagues make their remarks \nabout the CBO's reports on wages, I don't think the numbers say what \nthey believe they say. They were talking about how American families' \nwages would go down. The report explicitly says that is not the case. \nIn fact, Ezra Klein wrote in the Washington Post that the idea that \nimmigration would lower wages of already-working Americans is \n``actually a bit misleading.''\n  As for folks who are already here, the Congressional Budget Office is \ncareful to note that their estimates ``do not necessarily imply the \ncurrent U.S. resident would be worse off in the first 10 years.'' And \nin the second 10 years they estimate the average American wages will \nactually rise as a result of immigration reform to the tune of about \n$470 billion, an average annual increase in jobs of 121,000 per year \nfor 10 years. That is 1.2 million additional jobs to the United States. \nIt is $470 billion in increased wages of all Americans.\n  The truth is stubborn. Crush it to the ground and it springs back.\n  In addition to that, I have to remind my colleagues as they come \ncloser to having to cast a vote--and I hear some voices who say: Oh, I \nwould be open to vote for the bill if this or that. Immigrants \nconstituted 12 percent of the population in the year 2000, but they \naccounted for 26 percent of the Nobel Prize winners based in the United \nStates. Twelve percent of the population, immigrants; 26 percent Nobel \nPrize winners. They made up 25 percent of public venture-backed \ncompanies that started between 1990 and 2005. The fact is immigrants \nreceive patents in our country at twice the rate of native-born \npopulations.\n\n  So the bill's overall effect on the overall economy is unambiguously \npositive. One can try to distort it any way one wants, but that is \nsimply the case.\n  Those are the economic benefits refuting some of the things I have \nheard here. Wages go up for all Americans, jobs get increased, GDP \ngrowth takes place, the deficit is reduced. How many things will we do \nin the Senate that can bring all of those elements together? Maybe some \npieces of legislation might be about job growth. Maybe some pieces of \nlegislation might be about GDP growth. Maybe some pieces of legislation \nmight be about how to reduce our deficit. But what singular piece of \nlegislation, according to the\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office, brings all of those elements together? I \nwould suggest not one that I have seen in the last 7 years.\n  I know there is a lot of thrashing and gnashing and banging on the \ntable because when a person doesn't have the law on their side and when \na person doesn't have the facts on their side, they create a diversion. \nThere have been a lot of crocodile tears related to the request for \namendments.\n  Let me just say, first of all, this whole process began with a \nbipartisan group of Senators who had input from their colleagues. They \ndid not, in and of themselves, the Gang of 8, just say this is my view \nof what needs to be done. They went back to their caucuses. They asked: \nWhat are the foundations, what are the principles we need? There was a \nlot of input during that whole period of time. I constantly heard from \nmy four Republican colleagues of the Gang of 8 how they had spoken to X \nor Y Senator and how they believed this was necessary, what were some \nof the essential elements, and those got incorporated through the \nprocess. They got incorporated through the process in which the \nlegislation was ultimately devised and put forth. They got \nincorporated, unlike the 2007 bill referred to by several of my \ncolleagues. The 2007 bill on immigration did not go through the process \nof the Judiciary Committee. It didn't go through the Judiciary \nCommittee process. This bill did. It went through that regular order. \nOver 212 amendments--212 amendments--were considered. Over 136 changes, \namendments, were accepted; 43 Republican amendments were adopted, and \nall but 3 of those 212 votes, from what I understand, were bipartisan \nvotes.\n  So we had 136 changes to the law that the Gang of 8 proposed. Then we \ncame to the floor. What happened on the floor? This bill, which has \nbeen on the floor for 20 days--this didn't just pop up. It has been on \nthe floor for 20 days, which is nearly 3 weeks of Senate floor time. \nWhat happened at the beginning is that every time there was an effort \nto offer unanimous consent requests on the question of amendments, \nthere were objections by the other side. There were objections against \namendments offered by their own Members because those who oppose this \nlegislation, no matter what, did not want to give Members an \nopportunity for a vote on their side, because they believed if their \namendments were adopted, the Member would agree to vote for the bill \nbecause they had made the improvement they sought to the underlying \nbill they otherwise could support but with the change they were \noffering.\n  So, strategically, they decided not to allow their Members to \nultimately have amendments because they were afraid they would join in \nthe growing cadre of Members who were supporting the bill. It wasn't \nabout who gets to pick or choose amendments; it was a strategic \ndecision and that took the better part of the first 2 weeks.\n  We did have nine amendments; overwhelmingly, they were Republican. \nThen we had the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which of course had the most \ndramatic, significant impact on border security. But there were an \nadditional nine amendments that were included in Corker-Hoeven. All of \nthem, I understand, were Republican. We would have had a 10th amendment \nbecause, I understand, as has been said here--and I was asked as part \nof the Gang of 8, can you accept this. The Portman amendment on E-\nVerify would have been part of that package, and we wouldn't be \ndebating about whether that is here; it would have been part of that \npackage.\n  Then we had an offer by the majority leader of 17 additional \nRepublican amendments and that was rejected. A whole host of those \namendments were from some of the most ardent opponents of this \nlegislation.\n  So this thrashing and gnashing about process--look, I understand if \none doesn't want to get to a final judgment and they want to do \neverything possible not to get there; they want to do everything \npossible not to see the legislation move forward because they \nfundamentally disagree. Let's be honest. Let me make my final point. \nThere is a universe of our colleagues in which no pathway to \ncitizenship would ever be accepted. That is the unseen elephant in the \nroom, but there is a universe of our colleagues--as a matter of fact, \nsome of them are more overt about it. They show it by virtue of even \nsome of the amendments they wanted to offer in which there would be no \npathway for citizenship whatsoever--trigger, no trigger, any set of \ncircumstances. We have seen the consequences of that in Europe. The \nconsequence of that is that we create unrest in the community.\n  It is not OK to exploit 10 or 11 million people and not let them have \nthe chance to make themselves right and earn their way into citizenship \nin the United States. It is not OK to say there can never be a pathway \nto citizenship when they are the ones who are bending their backs over, \npicking up the crops my colleagues and I get to eat every day for \ndinner or for breakfast. It is not OK to have that immigrant who is \ntaking care of a loved one with a tender heart and warm hand, helping \nwith their daily necessities, and say they can never get a pathway to \ncitizenship. It is not OK to have had chicken for dinner tonight and \nnot understand that this is from the cut-up hands of an immigrant \nworker. It is not OK to say the country is somehow less secure by \nvirtue of what we are doing.\n\n  I have said it many times: I don't know who is here to pursue the \nAmerican dream versus who might be here to do it harm unless I bring \npeople out of the shadows and into the light. They go through a \ncriminal background check which they have to pass, and if they don't, \nthey get deported right away. If they do, then they have an opportunity \nto earn their way after a decade in this country toward permanent \nresidency and then later on to U.S. citizenship.\n  So let's say it as it is. If you don't want a pathway to citizenship, \nthen stand in the Chamber and make a case, if a Member doesn't want a \npathway to citizenship under any circumstances. My colleagues have the \nright to have that opinion. I would strongly disagree but don't hide \nbehind procedures and amendments. Tell me what legislation has come \nbefore the floor grows GDP in our country, grows jobs in our country, \nincreases wages of all Americans, and reduces the debt by nearly $1 \ntrillion. I haven't seen it.\n  That is what the opportunity is before the Senate. That is why no \ndiversion will ultimately sell with the American people. In poll after \npoll after poll across the landscape of this country, Americans have \nsaid across the political spectrum--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--they want to see our broken system fixed. When the \nelements of this legislation--all of its elements--have been tested, \nthey have overwhelmingly won support.\n  That is why I am proud of our colleagues, both Democratic and \nRepublican, who have chosen to finally tackle a tough challenge and \nactually do something to fix this problem and to show America this \ninstitution can actually work. That is the other side benefit of \neverything I have just talked about in terms of economics, of security, \nof promoting our future, of creating greater jobs, of creating growth \nand prosperity, of having the best and the brightest in the world be \nable to help us continue to be a global economic leader, which is that \nthe Senate can actually function.\n  That is the opportunity before us: fixing our broken immigration \nsystem, showing this institution can function in a bipartisan process, \nand ultimately preserving our legacy as a nation of immigrants.\n  I always say that the greatest experiment in the history of mankind \nis the United States, the greatest country on the face of the Earth. A \npart of American exceptionalism is that experiment we have had, to \nbring from different lands different people who have contributed \nenormously to this country.\n  Tomorrow, I hope to show a series of Americans whom we have proudly \nheld up as examples of greatness, who, in fact, would not be here today \nbut for the opportunities--sometimes under a legal immigration system \nand sometimes not through a legal immigration system--who have served \nthis country greatly, whom we admire and, at the end of the day, we \nshow as examples to our children of what a person can do for one's \ncountry, what a person can achieve for one's Nation, and models to hold \nup to the world. I can't wait to share that with the rest of my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich).

ROSS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nhonorable Kentuckian and decorated World War II veteran, Mr. Wilburn K. \nRoss of Strunk, KY. Ross, who turned 91 in May, celebrated his birthday \nby making a trip to Kentucky from his current home in Dupont, WA. Ross \nhas not only served his country but continues to serve his childhood \nhome by coming back each year to spend time with his family and fellow \nveterans of McCreary County.\n  Ross, who is also known as ``Wib,'' was raised in Strunk, KY, and \njoined the U.S. Army here to begin his extraordinary service to our \ncountry. Every year for his birthday, Ross makes the visit back to \nKentucky. ``Everybody here treats me well,'' Ross said. ``I like coming \nback here because\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\nI was raised here.'' Ross's son Greg is the eldest of his six children \nand travels with his father.\n  On October 30, 1944, Ross served as a private in Company G, 30th \nInfantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. This day Ross fought \ncourageously, and 6 months later he received the highest decoration in \nthe U.S. military, the Medal of Honor. After 55 out of the 88 men were \nlost in his company, Ross manned a machine gun alone holding off six \nGerman attacks.\n  Mr. Ross's bravery and courage while in service to his Nation is an \ninspiration to his fellow Kentuckians. His story is one that is told \nagain and again to remind McCreary County residents of his dedication \nand liberty to our country. A local newspaper published an article on \nMay 23, 2013, to celebrate 91 years of life for Mr. Ross and to retell \nhis story while in uniform. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             [From the McCreary County Voice, May 23, 2013]\n\n                           Courage Under Fire\n\n\n    Story of Native Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient Is Worth \n                               Repeating\n\n                           (By Eugenia Jones)\n\n       As he does each year on his birthday, Wilburn K. ``Wib'' \n     Ross makes the journey back from his current home in Dupont, \n     Washington to the Bear Creek community in Strunk, Kentucky, \n     to visit his birthplace and childhood home and to celebrate \n     and reminisce with family and friends.\n       This year, with Ross turning 91 on May 12, was no \n     exception. Arriving in McCreary County on the day prior to \n     his birthday, the spry 91-year-old clearly was not weary from \n     his cross-country travels. After spending the remainder of \n     his McCreary County arrival day visiting with his brothers \n     and other family members, ``Wib'' found time to visit the \n     American Legion Post 115 for a night filled with jokes and \n     conversation with fellow veterans.\n       On the following day, ``Wib'' once again visited the \n     American Legion, where he was honored at a special luncheon \n     with an American flag birthday cake.\n       The story of Congressional Medal of Honor recipient and \n     McCreary County native Wilburn K. Ross, who was a member of \n     the 2nd Battalion, 30th Infantry Division, and his bravery \n     under fire during World War II has been told many times, yet \n     it remains a story that is worth repeating, not only to \n     remind us of the individual courage and bravery needed to \n     protect the freedom we cherish but also to share, with our \n     young people, the historical legacy surrounding a McCreary \n     Countian's inclusion into the elite group of Congressional \n     Medal of Honor recipients.\n       It is from McCreary County that Ross, as a young man, \n     entered the U.S. Army during World War II. His service led \n     him to be cited for ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity \n     at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty near St. \n     Jacques, France'' and to be awarded the Congressional Medal \n     of Honor.\n       According to the ``U.S. Army Center of Military History,'' \n     Ross's extraordinary feat of courage began at 11:30 a.m. on \n     October 30, 1944, after his company had lost 55 of 88 men in \n     an attack on elite German mountain troops.\n       Risking his own safety in order to absorb the beginning \n     impact of the enemy counterattack, Private Ross placed his \n     machine gun 10 yards in front of his leading support \n     riflemen. With machine gun and small-arms fire whizzing \n     around him, Ross fired with deadly accuracy and managed to \n     fend off the enemy force.\n       Surrounded by automatic fire and exploding rifle grenades, \n     Private Ross, by himself, continued to man his machine gun \n     and bravely held off six more German attacks. By the eighth \n     attack, most of Ross's supporting riflemen were out of \n     ammunition. As the American riflemen took positions \n     supporting Ross from behind, they crawled, during battle, to \n     Private Ross in order to slip a few rounds of ammunition from \n     his belt. Throughout it all, Ross continued to fight on with \n     basically no help, successfully pushing the enemy back \n     despite the fact that enemy grenadiers crawled to within four \n     yards of his position in attempts to kill him with hand \n     grenades.\n       Finally, having used his last rounds of ammunition, Private \n     Ross was directed to withdraw to the command post with the \n     eight surviving riflemen. Instead, Ross, anticipating more \n     ammunition, stood his ground. The Germans, realizing that \n     Ross and his machine gun were all that stood between them and \n     a major breakthrough, embarked on their last attack, bringing \n     their fire and wrath together on Private Ross in an effort to \n     destroy him. Just as the enemy was about to rush over Ross's \n     position, he received fresh ammunition, allowing him to open \n     fire on the enemy, killing 40 and wounding 10 of the \n     attacking force.\n       Single-handedly breaking the attack, Ross killed or wounded \n     at least 58 Germans in more than five hours of continuous \n     combat, saving the last members of his company from \n     devastation.\n       ``I didn't really get tired,'' Ross commented when asked \n     about the battle. ``But they got awfully close to killing \n     me.''\n       Remaining on his post that night and the following day for \n     a total of 36 hours, Ross proved that his upbringing in \n     McCreary County, Kentucky, had served him well in preparing \n     him to exhibit extraordinary courage and fortitude in \n     protecting his comrades and his country under fire.\n       Six months later, on April 14, 1945, Ross proved that the \n     same McCreary County upbringing had prepared him to receive \n     the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest military \n     decoration given by the United States government to a member \n     of the armed forces.\n       Years later, that same McCreary County man, who as a young \n     adult worked in the local coal mines at Stearns, received \n     congratulations from and shook the hand of President John F. \n     Kennedy, just a few months prior to Kennedy's assassination.\n       In continuing his career with the Army, Ross reached the \n     rank of Master Sergeant and received the Purple Heart, Bronze \n     Star, Oak Leaf Clusters, Combat Infantry Badge, Good Conduct \n     Medal, and the French Croix De Guerre. He was wounded four \n     times and also served in Korea.\n       Today, at 91 years old, Ross will quickly tell everyone how \n     much he enjoys his birthday visits home to McCreary County.\n       ``Everybody here treats me well,'' Ross smiled. ``They've \n     named the highway [Private Wilburn K. Ross Highway] after me. \n     I like coming back her because I was raised here.''\n       Ross's son Greg, the eldest of six children, travels with \n     his father and truly admires his father. ``He's been a super \n     man all his life,'' Greg commented as he smiled at his \n     father. ``He's always been helpful to everybody. It's fun to \n     travel with him.''\n       ``Wib'' says his life is ``pretty good'' now. With his son \n     close by, Ross still lives by himself in Dupont and mows his \n     own grass. He enjoys going out for his weekly visit to a \n     local gathering spot to listen to music and sings along when \n     the lyrics, ``Put your sweet lips a little closer to the \n     phone,'' ring out from the stage.\n       The Congressional Medal of Honor recipient is \n     straightforward and direct when asked for his advice to the \n     younger generation.\n       ``I think the best thing is to always do what you think is \n     right,'' Ross declared. ``If you do that, you'll have nothing \n     to worry about.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5259-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5259-S5260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLUMBIA FALLS, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to wish the Town \nof Columbia Falls a very happy 150th birthday. Throughout this year, \nColumbia Falls will celebrate the generations of hard-working and \ncaring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, \nand raise families.\n  While this sesquicentennial marks Columbia Falls' incorporation, the \nyear 1863 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. It is a \njourney that began eons earlier, when the receding glaciers carved out \nthe river known to Native Americans as the Wescogus and to those who \ncame later as the Pleasant. In the decades before America won its \nfreedom, the Pleasant River provided the wildlife that sustained the \nfirst settlers. In the years that followed, it became a great avenue of \ncommerce in products from field and forest and a great shipbuilding \nindustry thrived along its banks.\n  Natural resources are only the background for Columbia Falls' story. \nSuch names as Judge Thomas Ruggles, Daniel Carleton, Elijah Hamlin, \nHenry Bucknam, and Mary Ruggles Chandler remind us of the \ndetermination, ingenuity, and hard work that built the town. The \nimpressive representation of Columbia Falls landmarks on the National \nRegistry of Historic Places and the town's ongoing effort to restore \nUnion Hall demonstrate the high regard the residents of today have for \nthose who came before.\n  In the year of Columbia Falls' incorporation, America was engaged in \nthe Civil War. Many brave patriots from this community stepped forward \nto preserve our Nation and to secure the blessing of freedom for all, \nand they were remembered at the Columbia Falls Civil War Ball in April \nthat launched this 150th anniversary celebration. Through their \nlongstanding commitment to the inspiring Wreaths Across America \nProject, the people of Columbia Falls honor the heroes who have served \nour country throughout our history and bring distinction to our State.\n  This celebration is not just about something that is measured in \ncalendar years. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the \npeople who for more than a century and a half have pulled together, \ncared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to those who \ncame before, Columbia Falls has a wonderful history. Thanks\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\nto those who are here today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5260-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING WESTVIEW ORCHARDS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Westview \nOrchards of Romeo, MI on its 200th anniversary.\n  Since its founding in 1813, the orchard has been a part of Michigan's \nway of life. It is where families go to pick their own peaches and \nstrawberries in the summer, and where they go to pick apples, take \nwagon rides and enjoy the cider mill in the fall. It has been a source \nof fresh food since the War of 1812 was being waged from Michigan to \nNew England to New Orleans.\n  Michigan was a prime battleground during the War of 1812, and the \nBritish were winning every major engagement. The Union Jack flew over \nsettlements in Michigan from Mackinac Island to Detroit. By the summer \nof 1813, it seemed likely that when the war ended, the Michigan \nTerritory would belong to the British Empire.\n  That all changed with the Battle of Lake Erie, when American forces \ndefeated the British Navy and changed the tide of the war. One of the \nheroes of the battle was Michael Bowerman, who had come from New York \nto fight for his country. In gratitude for his service, the United \nStates offered him a plot of land in Michigan.\n  And so it was that Michael Bowerman packed up his belongings and set \nout to start a new life for himself and an enduring legacy for his \nfamily. In his pockets, he carried a few peach pits from his father's \nfarm in New York. He found his homestead in present-day Romeo, built a \ncabin and founded the farm that is today known as Westview Orchards.\n  It started with a small garden and orchard, with the family \ntransporting the fruit by horse and wagon to Port Huron to sell at the \nfarmers market. He later expanded the farm to include livestock and \nfield crops. When a bear attacked one of his pigs, he came to the \nrescue and fought off the bear, earning him the nickname ``Fearless \nMike.'' As the years passed, his farm and his family grew, and in 1880, \nhis son, Byron, planted 10 acres of peach trees that laid the \nfoundation for Romeo's famous peach festival that is held every Labor \nDay Weekend.\n  For the last 200 years, the descendants of ``Fearless Mike'' have \ncarried on his legacy. His sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, \ngreat-grandsons, great-granddaughters and more--have worked tirelessly \nto build the wonderful orchard that serves thousands of families in \nMichigan every year.\n  One great-grandson in particular made critical innovations on the \nfarm. Harvey Bowerman took over the farm from his father, Byron, and \nhis brother, George. Harvey modernized the farm and built the \nfoundation on which it stands today. He built the white clapboard house \nthat the family still calls home. He and his son, Armand, transitioned \nthe farm from using workhorses to using tractors. Harvey sold the hog \nand dairy operations, focusing the business on growing fruits and \nvegetables. He also added a grading room and built a custom peach \ngrader and de-fuzzer machine to improve efficiency. His greatest \ninnovation, though, was forced upon him in August of 1930.\n  It was a typical August day in an unusually good harvest year, and \nHarvey was loading his truck full of peaches from his record harvest to \nsell at Detroit's Eastern Market 40 miles to the south. Harvey was not \nthe only grower having a record year, though. As he was preparing to \nleave, he received a call from Eastern Market that said, ``Don't come \ndown, Harvey. The market is flooded with so many peaches we can't sell \n`em all.''\n  As every farmer knows, once you harvest your crops you have to get \nthem to the market quickly before they spoil. In desperation, Harvey \ntried something different: knowing that the Detroit Urban Railroad \ntrolley had a stop just down the street, he turned his truck around so \nthe back was facing the road in front of the farmhouse. His success \nselling the peaches to passengers forever changed the way he and his \ndescendants marketed their fruit.\n  Harvey passed the farm to his son, Armand, and when Armand suddenly \npassed away in 1981, Westview's fifth and sixth generations took over. \nToday, the family farm is in the hands of Katherine Bowerman Roy, her \ndaughters Katrina Roy Schumacher and Abigail Jacobson, and Abigail's \nhusband, Bill.\n  Westview Orchards is the oldest farm in Macomb County. It is a place \nwhere families from across the county and beyond visit to pick their \nown fruit, take wagon rides around the farm, and enjoy the corn maze, \nice cream shop, cider mill and farmers market.\n  Westview Orchards is a true Michigan success story, born of hard \nwork, dedication and a commitment to innovation. I congratulate the \nentire family--from ``Fearless Mike'' Bowerman to Katherine, Katrina, \nAbigail and Bill--on 200 wonderful years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5260-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE 90TH MISSILE WING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Known to their fellow airmen as the ``Mighty Ninety,'' this \nwing, with its five groups, displays excellence and commitment to the \nmission.\n  On July 1, 1963, the 90th Strategic Wing came into existence amid \ngrowing tensions with the Soviet Union. Protecting our national \nsecurity throughout the Cold War and into present day, the 90th Missile \nWing provides our Nation's best, most reliable, most accurate strategic \ndeterrent. Tasked with deterring an attack, the missile wing has worked \nextensively with the Minuteman I and Minuteman III systems, as well as \nencompassing the full lifecycle of the Peacekeeper Missile. Today, \nthese men and women maintain and protect our Minuteman III resources 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year--truly placing service to \nour country above all else.\n  The 90th Missile Wing has been named the best Intercontinental \nBallistic Missile Wing the past 2 years, earning the Blanchard Trophy \nin 2011 from U.S. Strategic Command and the Williams Trophy in 2010 and \n2012 from Air Force Global Strike Command. The men and women who serve \nin the Mighty Ninety are second to none. Airmen from the 90th have gone \non to serve our Nation in the Pentagon and international conflict \nzones. Additionally, just this month, the wing was turned over to its \nfirst female commander, Col. Tracey Hayes. Colonel Hayes has committed \nto continuing the standard of excellence.\n  At this very moment, there are crewmen out in the missile fields, \nsecurity teams on patrol, and support personnel of the 90th Missile \nWing standing watch, ready to execute. They focus exclusively on their \nmission to ``provide preeminent combat capability across the spectrum \nof conflict.'' The Mighty Ninety continue to be an integral part of \nAmerica's national defense.\n  Congratulations and a profound thank you to the members of the 90th \nMissile Wing and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5260-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5260-S5261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DOMNELIA ``NELLEN'' BUDD\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

As a working mother, Nellen \nbalanced home, social, church and career responsibilities with finesse \nand gained an excellent reputation as an esteemed professional.\n  For 25 years, Nellen greeted the people of Anchorage and kept city \nhall\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\nrunning smoothly while working in the mayor's office. Between 2003 and \n2009, during my tenure as mayor, Nellen was there for me every day. \nAfter I was elected to the Senate, Nellen moved across downtown \nAnchorage from city hall to the Senate. She managed my Anchorage \nregional office, and she continued to be a dedicated public servant and \nvaluable part of my staff.\n  Nellen is known as ``Lola'' to her grandchildren and to a few others \nwho are lucky enough to know her well. For years she has served as an \narticulate emcee and featured dancer at Maharlika, an annual cultural \ncelebration of the Filipino community of Anchorage.\n  Nellen Budd is kind, considerate and gracious. She has a keen fashion \nsense and has modeled professional decorum for many interns and young \nstaffers. Nellen is the example of courtesy, style and conduct and has \nmentored many people including, I am certain, a few future executives \nand legislators.\n  While Nellen is retiring from official public service, I know she \nwill stay busy as a volunteer and grandmother. I encourage her to relax \nand enjoy Alaska and all of her friends and family--and to not work too \nhard. Nellen is a bright shining star in our community, and my wife \nDeborah and I thank her for all of her years of hard work and \ndedication. Salamat, Nellen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5261-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        WOODSTOCK, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Woodstock, \nNH--a town in Grafton County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary \nof its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State \nin recognizing this special milestone.\n  The land that would become Woodstock was granted in a charter by \nGovernor Benning Wentworth on September 23, 1763, and was subsequently \nnamed after the English town of Peeling. Governor Wentworth's nephew, \nJohn Wentworth, would later rename the town Fairfield, after Fairfield, \nCT. In 1840, the town would receive a final name change to Woodstock, \nfor Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, England.\n  The population has grown to include over 1,300 residents. The \npatriotism and commitment of the people of Woodstock is reflected in \npart by their record of service in defense of our Nation.\n  Frank Merrill, a notable summer resident of Woodstock, was the \ncommander of the special World War II unit known as Merrill's \nMarauders. General Merrill commanded the 5307th Composite Unit during \ncombat operations in Burma throughout the spring of 1944. He later \nserved as the New Hampshire commissioner of highways.\n  Woodstock remains largely forested and is home to the world renowned \nHubbard Brook Experimental Forest, where in the 1960s acid rain was \nfirst discovered. Also within Woodstock is the famous Lost River \nReservation, a portion of the White Mountain National Forest, and a \nsegment of the Appalachian Trail.\n  The abundant timber and access to the power of the Pemigewasset River \nestablished logging as the principal early industry in Woodstock. The \nentrance of the railroad in the 19th century opened the wilderness to \ndevelopment and expansion. This expansion attracted tourists to the \ntown, and tourism remains a vital part of Woodstock's economy--with \nvisitors from near and far traveling to savor the peace and solitude of \nthis special part of New Hampshire.\n  Woodstock is a place that has contributed much to the life and spirit \nof the State of the Granite State. I am pleased to extend my warm \nregards to the people of Woodstock as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5261-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5261-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5261-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1092.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to empower the \nStates to set the maximum annual percentage rates applicable to \nconsumer credit transactions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined on the \nfloor of the Senate by Senator Warren to introduce legislation we have \nbeen working on since 2008.\n  Astute observers of this body will recognize that was before Senator \nWarren was even Senator Warren. She has been, for years, a renowned \nexpert in consumer law and a leading advocate of reforms to protect \nfamilies from predatory lending. It has been a pleasure working with \nher on this bill, and I am delighted to be working with her as Senate \ncolleagues now.\n  A little history. During President Obama's first 2 years in office \nand before the Republicans took control of the House in 2011, Democrats \npassed two significant landmark bills to protect ordinary consumers \nfrom credit card company abuses.\n  The Credit CARD Act of 2009 outlawed some of the worst tricks and \ntraps that lenders used to squeeze money out of their customers. After \nthat law, big banks can no longer hike interest rates on preexisting \nbalances just because they feel like it, and they can no longer declare \nthat the day ends at lunchtime in order to impose late fees on payments \nthat arrive in the afternoon. As absurd as it sounds, credit card \ncompanies routinely engage in those sort of shenanigans, but the Credit \nCARD Act of 2009 put an end to a lot of it.\n  A second bill, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, established the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, an essential agency first \nproposed by Senator Warren when she was a law professor. That body will \nbe for mortgages and credit cards what the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission is\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\nfor toasters and swimming pools. In an age when the fine print in a \nfinancial agreement can be the door to a family bankruptcy, this new \nagency is long overdue.\n  While the Consumer Financial Protection Board is working to protect \nAmerican families from many types of unfair and deceptive financial \npractices, including ones that involve credit card fees, the Board is \nbarred from regulating credit card interest rates. In the final \nnegotiations on Dodd-Frank, the allies of the big credit card companies \nkept interest rates beyond the reach of this consumer agency.\n  That is a shame, because unfair interest rates are a big problem for \nfamilies in Rhode Island and across the Nation. I have heard from so \nmany constituents enticed to sign up for a credit card with an \nattractive teaser rate of 0 or 1 percent, and eventually the teaser \nperiod ends and the rate goes up to 12 or 15 percent, and if the \ncardholder slips up and misses a couple of payments, the rate can jump \nto 30 percent or higher.\n  I think when most of us in this body were growing up, a 30-percent \ninterest rate was a matter you could usually take to the police because \nit violated State law. A rate at 30 percent would have been illegal \nunder the laws of most, if not all, of the 50 States. But the Supreme \nCourt in 1978 ruled the Civil War-era National Bank Act only required a \nlender, the credit card issuer, to abide by the law of the State that \nis their home State and allowed them to ignore the law of the State \ntheir customer called their home State. Well, it didn't take too long \nfor the big credit card companies to see the loophole. This meant if \nthey moved their legal home to States with no interest rate limits, \nwith lousy consumer protections, even dealing with those States to \nreduce consumer protections as a consequence of moving there, well, \nfrom these new havens they could lend to people in all 50 States at any \ninterest rate they wanted.\n  Since that Supreme Court decision, which is called the Marquette \nruling, high interest rate credit cards have mushroomed and consumer \ndebt has soared. According to the Federal Reserve, in the year before \nthe Marquette decision, 1977, only 38 percent of families had a bank-\nissued credit card. By 2010, over 65 percent had credit cards, with \nabout one-third of all families holding four or more credit cards. And \nthe debt numbers coming off those credit cards are even worse. \nRevolving consumer debt, which is mainly credit card debt, has exploded \nover twentyfold in the 35 years since the Marquette decision. This \nlittle bull's-eye represents the debt beforehand, the giant red circle \nthe debt afterward.\n  The credit card companies are taking full advantage. Interest rates, \nas we know, are generally low right now. Banks are lending to one \nanother at less than one-quarter of 1 percent, and 30-year fixed \nmortgage rates are near 4 percent. Savings bonds pay a paltry 1 \npercent. The Stafford loans we are discussing will move from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent if we don't act. But credit cards? According to \nbankrate.com, which tracks lending statistics, the average variable \nrate credit card now charges over 15 percent, and many consumers pay \nmuch higher rates.\n  At 15-percent interest, it would take a family, paying the monthly \nminimum, which is often equal to 1 percent of the balance plus the \naccrued interest, more than 22 years to pay off a $5,000 balance. An \nemergency comes to your family, and you need to go to your credit card \nto pay for it, so you have to run up $5,000. It will take you 22 years \nto dig out from that at a 15-percent rate. Over those 20 years, the \ntotal you would pay would be almost $11,000, meaning interest rate \ncharges would be more than the actual balance you owe. That is bad \nenough, but imagine a family paying 30 percent. For them, it is much \nworse. It would take 25 years to pay off a $5,000 balance making \nminimum payments, and the total payments the family would have to make \nwould add up to $17,000, more than the original $5,000 that was \nborrowed.\n  Families may turn to credit cards in times of emergency, and then, \nwhen they get back on their feet, find the next quarter of a century \ndedicated to paying off that debt. We should act to ensure that \nfamilies don't suffer lost decades to unnecessarily--and what would \nonce have been illegally--high interest rates.\n  The bill we introduce today, the Restoring States' Rights to Protect \nConsumers Act, would not set a Federal interest rate cap but it would \nrestore to our sovereign 50 States their historic right--a right that \ndated back to their status as colonies before the Revolution--to \ndetermine what interest rate limits should apply and protect their own \ncitizens. This bill is 2 pages long. It is simple. It is a States \nrights bill. It received bipartisan support when I offered it as an \namendment to the Dodd-Frank bill, and I hope Senators of both parties \nwill consider supporting it now.\n  I will now yield the floor to my lead cosponsor, Senator Warren of \nMassachusetts, with my thanks to her for her leadership in protecting \nAmerican consumers and for her help in drafting this measure. It is a \nprivilege to serve with Senator Warren in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I want to start by commending Senator \nWhitehouse for his extraordinary leadership. For 5 years he has worked \non this issue. He proved from the very beginning that he was open to \nconsumer groups that came to talk to him about a problem, and he has \nbeen committed to helping working families and that has been his \ncentral goal. It is a great honor to stand this afternoon with Senator \nWhitehouse and to talk about a bill that can advance that goal--helping \nworking families.\n  For more than two centuries a State could pass a usury law and \nenforce it against anyone who was lending money in the State. Congress \nand Federal agencies played a central role in our banking policies, but \nour system allowed States to play an important role too. The States \ndecided locally what were the highest interest rates they wanted their \ncitizens to be charged. We honored the traditions of federalism, and \nthings worked pretty well. The States protected their citizens. \nConsumer financial products, such as credit cards, were easy to \nunderstand and they were safe for consumers. They were not loaded with \ntricks and traps.\n  That changed starting in 1978, when the Supreme Court issued its \ndecision in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha \nService Corp. In that decision, the Court interpreted a banking law \nthat Congress had passed back in 1863, and they decided the statute \nmeant the States could not keep an out-of-State lender from charging \nhigh rates within the State.\n  That all sounds pretty technical, but the result was that credit card \ncompanies flocked to move their headquarters to States that had little \nconsumer protection. Then other States raced to the bottom, repealing \ntheir consumer protection laws, hoping to attract more business to \ntheir State. The basic idea that States could protect their citizens \nfrom whatever tricks or traps the banks wanted to try simply \ndisappeared.\n  So I rise today to join my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator \nWhitehouse, to introduce the Empowering States' Rights to Protect \nConsumers Act. This bill will restore the ability of States to enforce \ntheir own rules against all lenders that do business within the State. \nIt does not tell States what rules to put in place, it lets States \ndecide for themselves.\n  The Credit CARD Act, enacted in 2009, and the new Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank act in 2010, were critical \nsteps in the right direction, and they are doing a good deal to help \nprotect consumers. But we need to recognize the value of State \npartnerships by empowering our States to play a role too and by \nrestoring their ability to serve as a laboratory of democracy. If and \nwhen credit card companies develop the next generation of tricks and \ntraps, buried in fine print and legalese, States ought to be able to \nrespond with their own rules and protections if they deem it necessary.\n  I ask my colleagues to carefully consider this bill.\n  I again thank Senator Whitehouse for his extraordinary leadership on \nthis. It is a great honor to stand today and cosponsor this bill with \nhim.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1230. A bill to reduce oil consumption and improve energy \nsecurity, and\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Stabenow and I are \nintroducing legislation designed to reduce our dependence on oil in the \ntransportation sector by replacing it with cleaner, domestic sources of \nenergy to power our cars, trucks, buses, tractors, and ships. Until \nvery recently, our nation was dependent upon foreign, often unstable \ngovernments for its energy supply--particularly for the oil that fuels \nour transport--70 percent of which was imported from overseas. Now, \nrecent advances in drilling technologies have uncovered abundant \ndomestic energy resources and it is predicted that the U.S. will be a \nnet oil and gas exporter in the near future. Today, we are introducing \nlegislation that builds on our introduction of a similar bill last \nCongress which was approved by Committee, our continual work with a \nbroad array of stakeholders and the feedback received during the series \nof natural gas forums held by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. Those forums served as a reminder of the great opportunity \nno one imagined we'd have even a few years ago, of being able to chart \nour own energy future rather than relying on other countries or single \ntechnologies to drive our economy forward.\n  While the natural gas forums served as a reminder, it is crucial that \nwe don't just supplant reliance on oil for reliance on another single \nresource or technology. At the end of the day, different fuels are \ngoing to work better in different types of vehicles and in different \nparts of the country. For that reason, our bill does not pick \ntechnology winners and losers. It is ``technology neutral,'' \n``geography neutral'' and ``market neutral.'' An alternative fuel that \nis readily available in one part of the country may not be readily \navailable in every part of the country, or it may not work as well in \nan 18 wheel tractor-trailer as in the family car. Our bill does not \nchoose which fuel is used where, or for what kinds of vehicles. We \nleave that up to the free market so that fuel providers and vehicle \nmanufacturers can compete for what works best for their customers. This \nbill brings us closer to the day when conventional gas stations give \nway to the ``Fueling Station of the Future'' where consumers will have \nthe option to choose between whichever fuel serves their needs.\n  Energy legislation, including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007, have instituted a number \nof programs at the Department of Energy and the Environmental \nProtection Agency to address the need to strengthen our energy security \nby replacing a significant portion of the oil Americans use for \ntransportation with alternative fuels such as electricity, natural gas, \npropane, biofuels, and hydrogen. However, these programs currently fail \nto provide workable solutions for many of the obstacles alternative \nfuels suppliers and alternative fuel vehicles manufacturers face when \nattempting to get their technologies to market.\n  Modifying these existing programs--and bolstering them with cohesive \npolicies enshrined in law to make them more useful for potential \napplicants--will help our nation exploit our newfound abundant energy \nresources, target climate change by incentivizing more widespread use \nof cleaner transportation fuels, and create jobs by catalyzing new \nbusinesses in the diverse alternative fuel and alternative fuel \nvehicles sector.\n  Our bottom line goal is to help American businesses, which build \nvehicles and supply fuel, provide genuine alternatives to conventional \nfuels and engine technologies so that Americans can reduce our \ndependence on oil as a transportation fuel. The bill does this by \nproviding a set of tools to promote the deployment of these \ntechnologies. In several instances, the bill modifies existing \nprograms, rather than creating new ones.\n  First, the bill takes the existing advanced vehicle manufacturing \nsupport program at the Department of Energy, which is now focused on \nproviding financial support to major manufacturers of light duty \nvehicles, and opens it up to alternative fuel technologies. It also \nexpands the program to component manufacturers further down the supply \nchain and to the production of medium and heavy trucks, buses, and \ntransit vehicles and lifts the cap on the amount of loans that can be \nmade to American manufacturers and their suppliers.\n  Alternative fuel vehicles need alternative fuel. So the next major \ninitiative in the bill is to provide financial support for the \nproduction and distribution of those alternative fuels. Again, instead \nof creating a whole new program to support this alternative fuel \ninfrastructure, the bill modifies the existing clean energy Department \nof Energy loan guarantee program created in section 1703 of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. This loan program was aimed at financing new, \ninnovative low-carbon electricity generation technologies. That is all \nwell and good, but those investments do not address the very real \nenergy security challenge facing our country from oil imports, \nespecially since so little electricity in the U.S. is actually \ngenerated using oil. Our bill would allow this already existing program \nto be used for alternative fuel infrastructure.\n  The bill includes additional measures to provide technical assistance \nto States, local and tribal governments, public-private partnerships, \nand utility companies and utility commissions to help overcome barriers \nto the deployment of these alternative fuel vehicles. The bill further \nprovides worker training provisions to ensure our nation has a skilled \nworkforce capable of making the goals of this bill a reality. Taken \naltogether, these provisions are designed to provide the tools for \nmanufacturers, parts suppliers, fuel providers, transportation \nplanners, utility regulators, and State, local, and tribal officials to \ndeploy alternative fuel vehicles, and the fuels to power them, in \nnumbers that make a difference and truly reduce our dependence on \nimported oil.\n  Our bill has broad support from industry groups and has been endorsed \nby the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, Natural Gas Vehicles for \nAmerica, Global Automakers, the American Public Gas Association, Drive \nOregon, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and the \nElectric Drive Transportation Association. We ask our colleagues to \nstand with us in support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nprotect and restore the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Great Lakes are a magnificent resource \nand unique in the world. These water bodies, formed during the last ten \nthousand years, are the largest source of surface freshwater on the \nplanet. The lakes shaped how people settled and secured resources for \ntheir survival. Native Americans, French explorers, early European \nsettlers, immigrants flocking to new industrial cities, along with the \ncurrent populations of today all rely on the lakes for their survival--\nproviding food and drinking water, transportation, power, recreation, \nand magnificent beauty. However, the vast resources the Great Lakes \nprovide must not be taken for granted. We must do all we can to protect \nthese waters and clean up the areas that have been harmed by toxic \ncontaminants, polluted runoff, untreated wastewater, and destructive \ninvasive species. That is why as co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes \nTask Force, Senator Kirk and I, along with several of our colleagues, \nare introducing today the Great Lakes Ecological and Economic \nProtection Act of 2013, or GLEEPA.\n  This bill builds upon the work of a multitude of stakeholders--\nenvironmental organizations, business associations, tribal governments, \ncommunity leaders, and Federal, State and local officials--who worked \ntogether to craft the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, a \n2005 plan to guide restoration and protection for the Great Lakes. The \nlegislation we are introducing today would formally authorize the Great \nLakes Restoration Initiative, GLRI, an inter-agency program designed to \nimplement the plan articulated in the Collaboration Strategy. The GLRI \nis an action-oriented, results-driven initiative targeting the most \nsignificant problems in the Great Lakes, including aquatic invasive \nspecies, toxics and contaminated sediment, nonpoint source pollution, \nand habitat and wildlife protection and restoration. While broadly \nauthorized under the Clean Water Act, the GLRI should be specifically \nauthorized in law to clarify its purpose and objectives and to \ndemonstrate support from Congress. Since the GLRI was launched in \nfiscal year 2010 with $475 million in funding, real progress has been \nmade to restore the health of the Great Lakes: More than a million \ncubic yards of contaminated sediments have been cleaned up. More than \n20,000 acres of wetland, coastal, upland and island habitat have been \nrestored or enhanced. New technologies are being developed to combat \nthe sea lamprey. Asian carp have been prevented from establishing a \nsustaining population in the Great Lakes. Hundreds of river miles have \nbeen restored to enable free fish passage from the Great Lakes to their \nspawning grounds. Reduction of nutrient loading from agriculture runoff \nhas lessened occurrences of harmful algal blooms.\n  In addition to authorization of the GLRI, this legislation would \nreauthorize two existing programs: the Great Lakes Legacy program, \nwhich supports the removal of contaminated sediments at more than \nthirty Areas of Concern, AOCs, across the Great Lakes; and the Great \nLakes National Program Office, which handles Great Lakes matters for \nthe EPA.\n  The health and vitality of the Great Lakes not only provide immense \npublic health and environmental benefits, but they are also critical to \nthe economic health of the region. For example, in Muskegon Lake, which \nis directly connected to Lake Michigan, cleanup of 430,000 cubic yards \nof sediment contaminated with mercury and polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons, or PAHs, also provided jobs to barge and dredge \noperators, truck drivers, biologists, chemists, toxicologists, and \ngeneral laborers. The cleanup will help lift fish consumption \nadvisories and restore fish habitat, which is vital to this area that \nis a popular fishing and boating destination. Reports find a two to \nthree dollar return for every dollar invested in cleanup and \nrestoration activity. And preventing future damage to the lakes--from \naquatic invasive species for example--could easily save the public \nhundreds of millions of dollars in future expenditures. With a $7 \nbillion fishery, $16 billion in annual expenditures related to \nrecreational boating, and about 37 million hunters, anglers and bird \nwatchers enjoying the Great Lakes each year, we cannot afford to not \nprotect and restore this precious resource.\n  The legislation we are introducing today includes important \nsafeguards to ensure that tax dollars are wisely spent on activities \nthat actually achieve results. Projects are directed to be selected so \nthat they achieve strategic and measurable outcomes and which can be \npromptly implemented through leveraging additional non-Federal \nresources. The bill would also authorize an inter-agency task force to \ncoordinate Federal resources in a way that most efficiently uses \ntaxpayer funds, focusing on measurable outcomes such as cleaner water, \nimproved public health, and sustainable fisheries in the Great Lakes.\n  Finally, State and local officials, tribal governments, business \norganizations, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders need \nan avenue to communicate on matters pertaining to Great Lakes \nrestoration. Recently, the EPA created a board that advises the EPA and \nother Federal agencies on Great Lakes cleanup and protection \nactivities. This bill would make the advisory board permanent to ensure \nthat the many voices across the Great Lakes region can have a direct \nconduit to the Federal Government.\n  The Great Lakes are home to more than 3,500 species of plants and \nanimals and support 1.5 million direct jobs, $62 billion in wages and a \n$7 billion fishery. This legislation is needed to address\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\nthe threat of invasive species such as Asian carp, polluted runoff that \ncan harm aquatic and public health, toxic sediments, and harmful algal \nblooms that kill fish, foul coastlines, and threaten public health. The \nlegislation will also help the United States implement its commitment \nto the bi-national 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. We hope \nthe Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will promptly act \non this important legislation, as it did in 2010 when it approved \nsimilar legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cowan, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Heinrich, \n        Ms. Hirono, Mr. Kaine, Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Levin, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. \n        Udall of New Mexico, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 1236. A bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure \nrespect for State regulation of marriage; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nRespect for Marriage Act.\n  Today is an historic day. The Supreme Court issued two decisions that \nare major victories for the cause of equality for same-sex couples in \nthis nation.\n  In United States v. Windsor, the Court struck down Section 3 of the \nDefense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which denies the federal benefits and \nobligations of marriage to legally married same-sex couples. I was one \nof 14 members of this body to vote against DOMA in 1996, and I am \npleased a major part of the law has been declared unconstitutional.\n  In Hollingsworth v. Perry, the Court left in place a trial court \ninjunction finding Proposition 8 unconstitutional--which will bring \nmarriage equality back to my home State of California.\n  I am thrilled by these decisions, which will mean a great deal for \nsame-sex couples in California and across the Nation.\n  Our work, however, is not done. It remains critical that Congress act \nto fully repeal DOMA. That is what the Respect for Marriage Act will \ndo.\n  This legislation is cosponsored by 40 members of the Senate--Senators \nBaldwin, Baucus, Bennet, Blumenthal, Boxer, Brown, Cantwell, Cardin, \nCarper, Casey, Coons, Cowan, Durbin, Franken, Gillibrand, Harkin, \nHeinrich, Hirono, Kaine, King, Klobuchar, Leahy, Levin, McCaskill, \nMenendez, Merkley, Mikulski, Murphy, Murray, Reed, Sanders, Schatz, \nSchumer, Shaheen, Stabenow, Mark Udall, Tom Udall, Warren, Whitehouse, \nand Wyden.\n  I want to thank them for their strong support of this legislation. I \nwould also like to thank Representative Jerry Nadler for his staunch \nleadership on this issue in the House of Representatives.\n  Today, 12 States: Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, \nVermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia allow same-sex \ncouples to marry.\n  Because of today's decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, which left, in \neffect, a trial court order finding Proposition 8 unconstitutional, my \nhome State of California will soon once again recognize the freedom to \nmarry for same-sex couples. I am thrilled about that result.\n  According to the 2010 Census, there are over 131,000 same-sex married \ncouples in this Nation--a number that is sure to grow.\n  I think most Americans have come to recognize that same-sex couples \nlive their lives like other married couples. They raise children \ntogether. They care for each other in good times and in bad. They take \nthe same vows and make the same commitments as straight couples.\n  Simply put, they are families. Like other families, they reap life's \njoys and bear the brunt of life's hardships together.\n  Until the Supreme Court's decision today in United States v. Windsor, \nDOMA turned these families into second-class families.\n  Under over 1,100 Federal laws, DOMA prohibited the Federal Government \nfrom recognizing the equal dignity and commitment of legally married \nsame-sex couples.\n  These couples were barred from filing joint tax returns, forced to \npay much higher taxes on employer-provided health benefits, and \nstripped of protections for married couples from the estate tax.\n  They could not receive Social Security survivor benefits, which \nprotect a surviving spouse from becoming destitute when the other \nspouse passes away.\n  Critical protections and benefits for service members and veterans \nwere also denied. According to the Servicemembers Legal Defense \nNetwork, well over 100 statutory protections granted by Congress to \nservicemembers turn on marital status.\n  Today's decision in United States v. Windsor is a major victory for \nequality. It says that Section 3 of DOMA--which denies Federal \nrecognition to legally married same-sex couples--is unconstitutional \nbecause it is a denial of equal protection.\n  The Windsor case had to do with two women--Edie Windsor and Thea \nSpyer--who met in 1963 and were together for over 40 years. They \nmarried in 2007. Yet when Thea died in 2009, Edie was forced to pay \nover $360,000 in estate taxes because of DOMA. Had her spouse been a \nman, Edie would not have had to pay those taxes.\n  Even after the Court decision, which hinged on a bare 5-4 majority, \nthe Respect for Marriage Act remains critically important legislation, \nfor several reasons.\n  First, DOMA is a discriminatory law--all of it should be fully \nstricken from the books. It was wrong when it was passed, and it should \nbe repealed.\n  Second, even after the Windsor decision, there will remain \ninconsistencies in how certain Federal programs are administered.\n  For example, the Social Security Act provides Survivors' Benefits--\nwhich are critical for families after a spouse dies--based on the law \nof the state where the deceased spouse was domiciled at the time of \ndeath.\n  So, a married couple could live together for 40 years, contribute \nequally to the system, and then be stripped of what they have earned--\njust because they moved to another state for medical reasons before one \nspouse passed. That's just not right.\n  Veterans benefits are based on the law of the state where the parties \nresided at the time of the marriage, or when the right to benefits \naccrued.\n  So, different veterans benefits might be granted or denied, depending \non where a couple lived at different times, without any rhyme or \nreason. That is not fair to former servicemembers who may have moved \naround as part of their military service.\n  This bill is simple. It would strike all of DOMA, a discriminatory \nlaw, from the U.S. Code.\n  It would provide a clear rule that the Federal Government would \nrecognize a marriage if that marriage is valid in the State where it \nwas entered into.\n  This rule will provide clarity and predictability for legally married \nsame-sex couples, and it will be easy to administer for federal \nagencies tasked with ending DOMA in the programs they administer.\n  The bill would not require any state to issue a marriage license it \ndoes not wish to issue, nor would it require any religious institution \nto perform any marriage.\n  In 2011, after I first introduced this bill, I gave a press \nconference about it at the National Press Club. I said I was not faint-\nhearted about this, and that I was in it for the long march.\n  Today, I remain committed to that cause and determined to see it \nthrough. Our work is not finished until DOMA is fully off the books, \nwhich is what this bill will do.\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5274-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 187--CONGRATULATING THE CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS ON WINNING \n                          THE 2013 STANLEY CUP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Eisenhower's grand \n     initiative for a national highway system to connect every \n     person in the United States; and\n       Whereas the Lincoln Highway, more affectionately known as \n     ``America's Main Street'', will continue to be a symbol of \n     Americana and the sense of freedom that comes from driving on \n     the open road: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes June 30, 2013, as the centennial of the \n     Lincoln Highway;\n       (2) commemorates the important role that the Lincoln \n     Highway has played in significant historical and cultural \n     events in the United States; and\n       (3) recognizes the economic growth, modernization in \n     infrastructure, and rural development that resulted from the \n     Lincoln Highway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5274-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5274-S5275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 189--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE WILLIAM \n   DODD HATHAWAY, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF MAINE\n\n  Mr. KING (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reid, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \nAlexander, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Brown, Mr. Burr, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, \nMr. Chambliss, Mr. Chiesa, Mr. Coats, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nCoons, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Cowan, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cruz, Mr. \nDonnelly, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. \nFlake, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. \nHagan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Heller, \nMs. Hirono, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \nJohnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Kirk, \nMs. Klobuchar, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nManchin, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Moran, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nNelson, Mr. Paul, Mr. Portman, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Risch, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Scott, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. \nUdall of New Mexico, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Ms. Warren, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I made a point of not raising this issue \nwhen Senator Cowan was in the chair the other day, but I wanted to come \nto the floor and say a few words about the Chicago Blackhawks.\n  For the fifth time since 1926 and the second time in four seasons, \nthe Chicago Blackhawks are the Stanley Cup champions. On Monday night, \nthe Blackhawks scored 2 goals in 17 seconds in the third period to win \nthe Stanley Cup finals and to bring Lord Stanley's Cup back home to the \ncity of Chicago.\n  I want to congratulate team owner Rocky Wirtz, team president John \nMcDonough, general manager Stan Bowman, and head coach Joel \nQuenneville. I will tell you that Joel Quenneville, a great hockey \nplayer in his own right, has been an extraordinary coach and one who \nhas taken a great group of players and brought them to the pinnacle of \nsuccess when it comes to the National Hockey League.\n  It was a shortened season, but the Blackhawks made the most of it. \nThey didn't lose a game in regulation in the first 24 games. By the end \nof the season they had won the President's Trophy, which is awarded to \nthe team with the most points in the NHL.\n  That doesn't always mean you are successful. Before this season, only \nseven winners of the President's Trophy won the Stanley Cup. But the \nHawks were up to it.\n  First, they faced the Minnesota Wild--and I heard a lot from Senators \nKlobuchar and Franken about that contest. We prevailed. Then they went \non to face the Detroit Red Wings. They had to win three games in a row \nand score a goal in an overtime thriller to beat the Red Wings, then \nfaced last year's Stanley Cup champs, the Los Angeles Kings, and they \nfinally earned the right to play the Boston Bruins in the finals. It \nwas a hard-fought contest by two excellent, great teams, and they kept \nus up late at night. Down 2 to 1, with just over 1 minute to play, the \nBlackhawks scored two goals to win their second Stanley Cup in the last \nfour seasons.\n  This year's championship was truly a team effort. The Blackhawks won \nwith contributions up and down the lineup.\n  MVP Patrick Kane topped the Hawks with 19 points.\n  Bryan Bickell had 17 points, while Patrick Sharp led all Hawks with \n10 goals.\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\n  Corey Crawford was tremendous in the net, and the Hawks penalty \nkillers--led by Michael Frolik and Marcus Kruger--were great, only \nallowing seven goals in 23 games while scoring a pair of shorthanded \ngoals.\n  The Hawks would also tell you that they couldn't have done it without \nthe support of their fans.\n  The ``Madhouse on Madison'' was rocking from the very first note of \nthe Star-Spangled Banner and proved to be a difficult environment for \nopponents with Chicago taking 11 of their 13 home games in the \nplayoffs.\n  The Blackhawks gave fans several memorable moments throughout their \nStanley Cup run, including Brent Seabrook's overtime goal in Game 7 to \neliminate the Red Wings, Kane's double-overtime goal to complete a hat \ntrick and eliminate the Kings, Andrew Shaw's triple-overtime goal to \nwin Game 1 of the series against Boston, and now the late-game heroics \nof Bickell and Dave Bolland to clinch the championship for Chicago.\n  The Stanley Cup has come home to Chicago and Hawks fans can't wait to \ncelebrate with Captain Jonathan Toews, his teammates, and the 35-pound \nsilver guest of honor.\n  At 4 a.m. Tuesday morning, hundreds of Hawks fans greeted the team \nplane at O'Hare, ready to celebrate another NHL championship.\n  I will tell you that I have witnessed, representing the city of \nChicago, some extraordinary fan loyalty. What I have seen from the \nChicago Blackhawks over the last 8 weeks has been amazing. You can't \nwalk down Michigan Avenue, State Street, or any neighborhood without \nrunning into Blackhawks gear. People are so proud of their team, and \nnow as they parade the Stanley Cup around Chicago it is the front page \nof every newspaper.\n  A few years ago when they were the Stanley Cup champions last, the \nStanley Cup itself came to the Senate here and I was honored to have it \nin my office with a parade of visitors coming by to see this \nmagnificent trophy.\n  Let me say to the Chicago Blackhawks, we are proud of you, proud of \nthe great fans who stood behind you, and looking forward to celebrating \nthis Friday with a great victory parade.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Lincoln \nHighway resolution, which celebrates the centennial of the Nation's \nfirst transcontinental highway.\n  In America, our highways are a part of our heritage. They connect \npeople, transport goods, promote tourism, and support economies.\n  I developed an appreciation for our highway heritage at an early age \nfrom my father, Jerry Strobel. After returning from service in World \nWar II, he dedicated his career to serving Nebraskans at the State \nDepartment of Roads. As a civil servant for 45 years, he worked many \nyears as a deputy state engineer and went on to serve as director and \nState engineer for the Nebraska Department of Roads from 1987 to 1991. \nHe was a member of the Road and Transportation Builders Association and \nthe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.\n  Just as I have my father to thank for developing my appreciation of \nroads and bridges, our vital infrastructure, we as a country have Carl \nFisher of Indiana to thank for developing our Nation's first \ntranscontinental highway. A century ago, he conceived and promoted the \nidea of a highway that would ``stimulate as nothing else could the \nbuilding of enduring highways everywhere that will not only be a credit \nto the American people but that will also mean much to American \nagriculture and American commerce.''\n  Carl Fisher was an early automobile enthusiast who believed ``the \nautomobile won't get anywhere until it has good roads to run on.'' He \nwas zealous in his pursuit of his dream of a coast-to-coast highway, \nurging many of his friends in the auto industry to help promote the \nproject.\n  The highway was named for one of Fisher's heroes, President Abraham \nLincoln. The first highway to connect our country became the first \nnational memorial to the leader whose courage kept our country \nconnected.\n  The Lincoln Highway route was dedicated in 1913. Spanning from Times \nSquare in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco, the Lincoln \nHighway--affectionately known as America's Main Street--originally \nspanned 3,466 miles through 13 States, including the great State of \nNebraska.\n  The Lincoln Highway brought economic development, tourism, and \nadventure to every community it touched and served as one of the \ninspirations for the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of \n1956.\n  The Lincoln Highway Association will host the official Lincoln \nHighway 100th Anniversary Tours and Celebration. Two tours will start \nsimultaneously in New York City and San Francisco and meet in Kearney, \nNE, which is 1,733 miles from both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\n  I am proud the Senate can help commemorate the important role that \nthe Lincoln Highway has played in developing our country's highway \nheritage by celebrating the centennial of our first transcontinental \nhighway.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the bill \nbefore the Senate and more extensively on a section of this bill I have \nbeen working on diligently to improve.\n  First of all, I wish to commend the authors of this bill. I have been \nthrough complex legislation before and this is a very complex issue. I \nknow how hard the so-called Gang of 8 has worked. We can't please \neverybody with any complex piece of legislation, but I think they have \ndone a very credible job of putting together a piece of legislation \nthat at least we could get to the floor for debate.\n  I think having this bill on the floor is causing us to have a very \nimportant debate that is long overdue. We all know our immigration \nsystem is broken and we need to fix it. However, I am disappointed we \nhave not been able to have a full and open debate on potential \nsolutions to fix the system. I have stated publicly that I have serious \nconcerns with several provisions in the bill, including some related to \nborder security triggers, interior enforcement, and the program \ndesigned to address our agricultural labor workforce. That last topic--\nagricultural labor--is what I wish to spend the majority of my time \ndiscussing tonight.\n  But before I focus on the ag piece of this bill, I just have to say \nthat I am terribly disappointed and frustrated at the way this bill has \nplayed out. I am about to talk for several minutes or so on \nstraightforward, commonsense amendments to the agriculture portion of \nthe bill.\n  I have been working on ag immigration reform for nearly all of my \ntime in Congress, both in the House and in the Senate. That is a total \nof going on 19 years. This is an issue I care deeply about because I \ncome from the heart of ag country in south Georgia. But guess what. I \nam not going to have a chance to vote on any of my amendments, not \nbecause they are poison pill amendments--they are not--not because many \nof my colleagues do not agree with the changes I am suggesting--many \nactually do. It is because the sanctity of a deal has been given \nprecedence over sound policy. Let me say that again: The sanctity of a \ndeal is being given higher priority over sound policy.\n  Now, I am not on the Judiciary Committee, and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee was down here a little earlier talking about \neverybody had the opportunity in committee to file amendments. They had \nover 300 or so. That is well and good, and I am glad this bill went \nthrough regular order. I wish every bill that came to the floor of this \nSenate would go through that same regular order. But I am also not a \nMember of the Gang of 8, so I have not had the opportunity to have \ninput on this bill. Nevertheless, I reached out in a constructive way \nto various folks to try to make some changes to the bill.\n  I particularly want to thank my colleagues, Senator Graham, Senator \nRubio, Senator Bennet, and Senator Schumer and their staffs for working \ntirelessly and in good faith with me to try to make some improvements \nto the bill.\n  I thought we were making progress, and I think actually we did. But \nnow I understand that one or two Members want to prevent this bill from \nhappening, and so I am not going to be given the opportunity to have my \namendments called up.\n  What I can do, and what I will do, is highlight to my colleagues here \nand to my friends in the House of Representatives who may or may not \ntake up this issue the problems I see with the ag portion of this bill.\n  The agricultural portion of this bill has not been discussed \nextensively on the Senate floor, but it is vitally important to all \nAmericans. Farmers and ranchers in the United States produce the \nhighest quality food and fiber in the world. The continued safety of \nthe agricultural goods produced in the United States is an issue not \njust of convenience but of national security. Due to the importance of \nfood safety, it is critical to know who is handling our Nation's food \nsupply and who is working on our Nation's farms and ranches. \nAdditionally, if our farmers and ranchers cannot access a stable and \nlegal workforce, they will be forced to downsize or eliminate their \nU.S. operations, and that is happening today. This leads to more of the \nfood we eat being imported from other countries. I want to make sure we \ndo everything we can from a policy standpoint to keep that food and \nfiber production right here in the United States.\n  Today the majority of immigrant agricultural workers are \nundocumented. We need both secure borders and put in place an \nimmigration system that allows those who seek to come to the United \nStates to work in the diverse sectors of the agricultural industry to \ndo so legally. H-2A is the current ag guest worker program in force in \nthe United States today.\n  I have been working on H-2A reform since I came to Congress not only \nbecause Georgia's farmers are among the largest users of the program, \nbut because it is clear to me that the current program is cumbersome \nand difficult to use, as well as expensive.\n  My colleagues who drafted this bill have included many reforms to the \nagricultural guest worker program, and several of these reforms do take \na needed step in the right direction. However, there are several areas \nthat remain troublesome to me, and so I am proposing amendments to \naddress some specific areas.\n  Mr. President, I know the section of this bill focused on agriculture \nrepresents a delicate political balance, but we have a responsibility \nto enact smart policy, and we also have a rare opportunity to replace \nthe cumbersome and largely unworkable H-2A program with something that \nwill truly address the needs of those in agriculture all across the \ncountry while ensuring that no American workers are displaced. We also \nneed to ensure that we do not give those undocumented aliens working in \none sector of our economy a vast preference over the rest of the \nillegal population in terms of the pathway to citizenship.\n  Before I talk about my amendments, I want to give Members of the \nSenate an understanding of how the agriculture piece of this bill is \nset up. The ag portion of this bill puts in place a blue card program \nto transition illegal aliens who have worked in agriculture to lawful \npermanent resident status.\n  It also creates a new agriculture guest worker program to replace the \ncurrent H-2A Program. The blue card program is open to anyone who has \nworked in agriculture for 575 hours or 100 workdays over the 2-year \nperiod of 2010 to 2012.\n  Let me say that again. If you worked for 575 hours or 100 workdays \nout of the 730-day period of 2010 to 2012, you qualify for a blue card \nprovided you had that work in agriculture. Frankly, to me, that is a \nvery low threshold.\n  The general undocumented population covered by our RPI program which \nis in the base bill has to prove they meet the requirements to gain RPI \nstatus by a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. However, \nfor the blue card program, that undocumented alien only has to prove\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nthey worked that very minimal amount in agriculture by the standard of \nproof called just and reasonable inference. There is no interview \nrequired, and no way to verify the person applying for the blue card \nstatus actually worked in agriculture. Someone who lives in an area \nwhere agricultural work is performed and has evidence of their \nresidence in that area could get a blue card by showing proof of \nresidence and saying they were paid in cash in their agricultural job.\n  I am afraid the lax standards set out by the bill to qualify for the \nblue card program will lead to an influx of illegal aliens who worked a \nminimal amount in agriculture or never even worked in agriculture, to \nqualify for the program, sending more folks than we need in the \nagriculture sector to those jobs.\n  You might say, Why in the world would anyone choose to qualify for \nthe blue card program, since agricultural work is widely viewed as some \nof the toughest work around and the most demanding work? Well, the \nanswer is pretty simple. It is because the blue card program is a \nfaster, cheaper, easier way to a green card than the RPI program for \nother undocumented aliens in the base bill.\n  While the RPI program doesn't allow illegal aliens to get a green \ncard for at least 10 years, under the blue card program, if you are an \nagricultural worker, you can get a green card in 5 years.\n  While the RPI program doesn't allow green cards to be issued until \ncertain border triggers are met, the blue card program doesn't require \nthose aliens to wait on that border security piece.\n  Thirdly, while the RPI program costs a $2,000 fine in addition to \nprocessing fees, the blue card program has a cost of $500. The theory \nbehind the blue card program is to incentivize this undocumented \npopulation to work in agriculture because it is a critical industry \nthat traditionally has not attracted many American workers. However, \nthe way the bill is written, there are very minimal agricultural work \nrequirements.\n  You have to keep in mind that once an alien gets a blue card, they \nare authorized to work in any job in the United States. They have to \nmeet the minimum work requirements in an agricultural occupation, but \notherwise they are free to take any other job in America and are \ntreated as a U.S. worker for hiring purposes.\n  So what are these work requirements to go through the blue card \nprogram and to get a green card? Well, there are two tracks: The \nillegal alien can work at least 100 days a year in an agricultural \noperation for 5 years or the alien can work 150 days per year for 3 \nyears. Either way, the alien gets that green card in 5 years. Even the \naccelerated track requires the alien to work less than half the year in \nagriculture.\n  While the alien can work in any other job in the United States, he or \nshe doesn't have to. So, in theory, a blue card holder could work 100 \ndays per year for 5 years in agriculture and be totally unemployed the \nremainder of the year, and still get a green card in 5 years and still \nhave legal residence inside the United States.\n  Likewise, the alien could work 150 days per year for 3 years and be \ntotally unemployed the remainder of the time and still get a green card \nin 5 years. That doesn't seem right--especially when the RPI population \nis not allowed to be without a job for more than 60 consecutive days. \nClearly, the agricultural worker is getting a vast preference over the \nRPI undocumented workers.\n  Because of the way the blue card program is set up, I am afraid we \nare providing too strong an incentive for people who did very minimal \nor even no work in agriculture to access the program, and that we will \nend up with more agriculture workers than we need. Then because the \nwork requirements are so low, once folks get the blue card, they will \nperform the minimal amount of work required and move on to a different \njob and we will leave those farmers and ranchers in the lurch with an \nunstable workforce--because, remember, these blue card folks are \ntreated as U.S. citizens for hiring purposes.\n  The other aspect of this that concerns me--and we know this to be a \nfact because we saw it happen after the 1986 amnesty program under \nRonald Reagan. That is, once these individuals who are working in \nagriculture get that green card, which allows them to permanently stay \nin the United States, they are out of agriculture. They are going to \nleave the farm, and they are going to go to work in construction or \nsome other industry someplace in America where the working conditions \nare better and maybe even the pay is better. It is going to happen, \nbecause history tells us it is going to happen.\n  Some of my amendments are aimed at tightening the blue card program \nto ensure that only those folks who truly work in agriculture are using \nthe program. The fact is I want those experienced agricultural workers \nto stay in agriculture, and I am also providing them some incentives to \ndo so. The base bill here went way too far in the other direction.\n  The first amendment I will discuss tightens requirements to obtain \nthe blue card. It raises a standard of proof to verify that you \nactually worked those very minimal qualifying hours in agriculture \nto qualify for the blue card program to what it is for the RPI \npopulation, i.e., a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n  As I mentioned before, the standard in the base bill is just and \nreasonable inference. Someone has to be able to prove by a just and \nreasonable inference that they performed over 2 months of agricultural \nwork over a 2-year period of time in order to get into the blue card \nprogram. I think that standard leaves the program susceptible to all \nkinds of fraud.\n  However, I understand there are concerns by some that due to the \nnature of undocumented work in agriculture, it will be difficult for \nthem to garner the necessary evidence of work history to access the \nprogram even though the bill protects employers from liability for \nhaving employed illegal workers.\n  At any rate, because there is that concern, my amendment provides \nthat for those who truly worked in agriculture but cannot meet that \nstandard, because of the nature of an undocumented workforce, they \ndon't have that evidence, those folks have the opportunity to sit down \nand do an interview with the appropriate agency officials and prove to \nthem face to face that they did work in agriculture as a matter of just \nand reasonable inference. If they can do that through the interview \nprocess, then they can get into the blue card program.\n  This amendment will eliminate most of the potential for fraud for the \nblue card program and is simply a very commonsense amendment.\n  The second amendment I will mention tightens the work requirements to \nmaintain the blue card and eventually transition to a green card. \nInstead of allowing 100 workdays for 5 years or 150 workdays for 3 \nyears to get a green card, my amendment says you must work 180 days for \neach of the 5 years in order to qualify for the green card.\n  If you are going to be put on this preferential pathway to a green \ncard, I think you ought to be able to work at least half the year in \nagriculture. I don't think that is too onerous--6 months of work per \nyear for 5 years.\n  Some will argue that some agricultural work is only a few weeks per \nyear, and so 6 months of work per year is too much to require. To that \nI would say if a worker is only performing 3 or 4 weeks of agricultural \nwork per year, then maybe this blue card path is not the best path for \nthem. Perhaps they are better off seeking the RPI pathway to \ncitizenship. We are talking about a preferential pathway to citizenship \nfor a half a year of agricultural work per year under my amendment, \nwith no other work requirement. I don't think this is too much to ask, \nand I think many people will still be able to maintain their blue card \nstatus with no problem.\n  The third amendment I filed has to do with how preferential that \npathway to citizenship is for the blue card workers. The current bill \nsays regardless of any border security triggers being met, an unlimited \nnumber of blue card workers will be issued green cards in 5 years. \nThose folks who qualify under the RPI section of the bill can't start \nthe green card process until 10 years after enactment and certain \nborder triggers are met. I think stretching that timeline for the blue \ncard workers--who, remember, are authorized to work in any job in the \nUnited States--to 7 years rather than 5 years is more than reasonable \nand is still a preferential pathway to citizenship.\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\n  The fourth amendment dealing with the blue card program deals with \nthe fines for the blue card program. Again, this goes to how much more \nattractive the blue card program is as compared to the RPI program.\n  The bill, as written, requires folks on the RPI program to pay fines \ntotaling $2,000 in order to get a pathway to citizenship. However, \nthose on the blue card program are only required to pay fines totaling \n$500--just $500 for this faster and easier pathway to citizenship. That \nis not right.\n  I understand these agricultural workers don't have a lot of money, \nand so I am not asking to raise it to the same level as the RPI group. \nHowever, I think the fine should be significant. My amendment would \nincrease that total blue card fine to $1,000, which is double what it \nis in the underlying bill but still half of what it costs the RPI \nfolks.\n  The final amendment I have filed relative to the blue card program \nshould be totally noncontroversial. It has to do with previous H-2A \nworkers who want to participate in the blue card program.\n  There is a provision in the underlying bill which I agree with that \nallows those former H-2A workers who meet the blue card work \nrequirements to apply for a blue card and participate in the blue card \nprogram even if they are not currently in the country. I think this is \nthe right policy, because many H-2A employers have been using the same \nworkers for many years through this legal guest worker program, and I \ndon't think we should punish them for having done the right thing in \nthe past.\n  What this amendment does is simply add language that clarifies that \nthe agencies involved in administering the blue card program need to \npromulgate regulations that will allow those former H-2A workers to \nmake their application from outside the country.\n  In summary, I have five amendments to this bill relative to the blue \ncard program and several of these are smell-test amendments, because \nwithout them I think it is difficult for this blue card program to pass \nthe smell test.\n  I also have a series of amendments aimed at improving the new \nagricultural guest worker program set up by this bill, which is called \nthe W-2/W-3 program.\n  It is imperative that we as policymakers get this program right. If \nhistory is any indication, we make reforms to our immigration laws once \nevery 20 to 30 years. We have to make sure the guest worker program put \nin place by this bill is practical in its implementation and can be \nused by our farmers and ranchers, because as these blue card workers \nleave agriculture--and we know they will--we have to make sure there is \na stable and legal workforce available in those instances when U.S. \nworkers cannot be found.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again, that I think this new \nguest worker program takes a step in the right direction. But I do have \na few amendments to improve it that I will talk about now briefly.\n  The first amendment has to do with wages. The underlying bill sets a \nnational minimum wage for each of six different agricultural job \ncategories for the years 2014 to 2016. The wages for each category will \nautomatically increase anywhere from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent each \nyear forever.\n  I have several issues with this wage section, such as the fact that a \nnational wage does not reflect very real regional differences in cost \nof living or the fact that the wages do not seem to be based on any \nsurvey data. But I know how hot an issue this wage section is, so in an \neffort to be abundantly reasonable in how I propose to alter the bill, \nthe main fix I am looking to make is to the number of wage categories.\n  I think we can all agree some agricultural jobs require a more \nskilled or experienced worker than others, and my amendment protects \nthat fact. What I am trying to avoid is the bookkeeping nightmare \ncreated by these six wage categories.\n  Under the categories presented in the base bill, a worker in a \npacking shed is in a different category than a field worker and is paid \nat a different rate; and a worker driving a tractor is in a different \ncategory and paid at a different rate from the field worker and the \npacking shed worker. But all of my friends familiar with the day-to-day \noperation of a farm will agree, the reality is that on any given day on \na diversified crop farm, workers will be doing any combination of those \nthree jobs. So my amendment collapses those six wage categories into \ntwo: a skilled wage and an unskilled wage. To get to those numbers, I \nsimply averaged the wage data the Gang of 8 proposed in the underlying \nbill and used the same job categories the Gang proposed in the bill. My \naim is to prevent an employer from having to determine how many hours a \nguest worker spent in the field versus the packing shed each day, as he \nwould have to do under the current bill.\n\n  The second amendment deals with the issue of liability. If you ask my \nH-2A users in Georgia what their biggest complaint is with the H-2A \nprogram, I will guarantee that all of them will tell you it is \nliability.\n  Let me be clear upfront. I do not want to take away any protections \nthat exist for workers. They need that. They deserve it. Nor do I want \nto prevent a worker with a legitimate grievance to be allowed to pursue \nthat grievance. What I do want to protect against, though, is frivolous \nlawsuits that can cost a lot of money and waste a lot of time. There \nare several areas in the bill that I think can be tightened as they \nrelate to liability.\n  The first area of liability that I think needs to be dealt with and \nis addressed in my amendment has to do with mediation. The bill rightly \nsets up alternative dispute resolution to try to keep some of the \ncomplaints outside the Federal courtroom. However, the mediation setup \nunder the bill is not binding. What is the point of providing this \nalternative dispute resolution if you do not want to make it binding? \nMy amendment would do just that.\n  The second area of liability that is addressed by my amendment has to \ndo with the Legal Services Corporation. Current law provides that Legal \nServices cannot represent an undocumented alien who is not present \ninside the United States at the time representation occurs. I think \nthat is a good law. The underlying bill, however, eliminates that law \nand specifically says that Legal Services can represent a W-2 or W-3 ag \nguest worker, even if they reside outside the United States.\n  We are not talking about U.S. citizens. We are not even talking about \nblue card workers. We are talking about future guest workers. I think \nit leaves open the possibility of frivolous lawsuits being filed from a \nforeign country, and I simply do not think that is sound policy.\n  There is a final area of liability I am concerned about that has to \ndo with housing. The bill treats those agricultural employers who \nprovide housing under the W-2/W-3 program, as they are required to do \nif they cannot or do not provide a housing allowance, as housing \nproviders under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection \nAct, MSPA, as it is referred to.\n  Let me tell you what that means. It means that any guest worker who \nalleges a housing violation such as a broken screen door or a \nnonworking microwave will be allowed to pursue that grievance through a \nlawsuit filed in Federal court, and believe you me it happens today.\n  That doesn't make sense to me. There should be a right to cure a \ndefect before they have that right to file suit in Federal court. There \nshould be a right for the employer to fix any minor or incidental \nissues with housing, but that is not allowed under the base bill. \nInitially, my amendment had language to address this, but at the \nrequest of the bill's sponsors who told me that was too controversial, \nI eliminated that piece of my liability amendment. It is strange to me \nthis would be controversial, but to some it is, so that is a problem in \nthe bill I am not even addressing by this amendment, but I do want to \nhighlight it for my colleagues because I am telling you, this is going \nto be a real issue if that provision in this bill ever becomes law. I \nam hopeful that as this process moves forward there may be another \nopportunity to do something to address this in a reasonable way.\n  The third amendment to the guest worker program has to do with the \nallocation of visas. The current bill allocates the 112,000 W-2 and W-3 \nvisas among the four quarters of the year. I understand the intent of \nthe drafters.\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\nThey didn't want all of the visas to get used by all of those who seek \nvisas early in the calendar year and not have any visas available for \nthose who do not need workers until later in the year. However, I think \na more efficient distribution of visas would be to issue them to all \nallotments; one on January 1 to accommodate year-round users such as \ndairy and those with a spring crop and then one on July 1 to \naccommodate the fall crop. My amendment does just that and it weights \nthe January 1 allotment to have 70 percent of the visas because there \nare those year-round users such as poultry processors who will be \nneeding those visas early on.\n  Any unused visas from the January 1 allotment will roll over to the \nJuly 1 allotment. The fact is crop seasons do not fit squarely into \ncalendar quarters, and I think by changing the timing of the visa \nallotments it simply makes more sense.\n  The fourth amendment to the guest worker program I have filed has to \ndo with the wages of former H-2A workers. I can commend the drafters \nfor recognizing that we do not need to punish those employers who, to \ntheir economic disadvantage, have been using the current H-2A program \nto ensure they have a legal workforce. They did this by saying that \neven though blue card workers are treated as U.S. workers under the \nbill, and therefore have to be hired before any guest worker, if you \nhave used a H-2A worker for 3 out of the past 4 years and want that H-\n2A worker to continue to work for you under the new guest worker \nprogram, you can. That former H-2A worker will not be displaced by a \nblue card worker.\n  However--and this is where I have the problem--if you hire that \nformer H-2A worker under the new guest worker program, you do not pay \nthat worker the wage rate established under the W-2/W-3 program. The \nbill requires that you pay that former H-2A worker a separate and \nhigher wage rate called the AEWR. This is the wage rate that exists \nunder the current H-2A program and it is part of the reason that law is \nso flawed. This just doesn't make sense. It seems to, once again, \npunish those who have been playing by the rules and the punishment is \nexacerbated because there is a provision in the bill that says you \ncannot give any preference to guest workers.\n  On its face that makes sense. But what it actually means is that you \nhave to pay all the workers you hire that AEWR rate and that is just \nnot right. This is a fairly technical concept, so let me give an \nexample.\n  Say you have farmer Joe who has been using the H-2A programs even \nthough his neighbors have not and they have hired undocumented illegal \naliens and paid a much lower rate. This means all these years Farmer \nJoe has been providing free housing to his workers, paying their \ntransportation costs to his farm, and paying the higher AEWR wage rate, \nwhich in Georgia this year is $9.78; meanwhile, those who use a \nquestionably legal workforce have not had to provide housing, have not \nhad to provide transportation, and have only paid minimum wage to their \nworkers. If Farmer Joe uses 100 H-2A workers every year and has 10 \ncritical workers he wants to make sure he rehired under the new W-2/W-3 \nprogram, he can do that. He can hire these 10 guys before he hires any \nblue card workers. He still has to hire Americans first, but after that \nhe can hire those 10 workers.\n\n  The rest of his workforce, in all likelihood, will be filled with \nblue card workers because there will be so many of them legalized and \nneeding to meet a work requirement. So Farmer Joe will have 10 former \nH-2A workers and 90 blue card workers. However, under this bill, he \nwill be forced to pay those former H-2A workers the higher wage rate of \nthe AEWR, rather than the wage rate set up by the W-2/W-3 program in \nthe underlying bill. Because he can't treat guest workers any better \nthan U.S. workers and because blue card workers are considered U.S. \nworkers, he will also have to pay all 90 of the blue card workers the \nAEWR rate.\n  So my amendment would simply strike that provision so Farmer Joe will \npay the wage rate set up by the W-2/W-3 program. He will still have to \npay all the blue card workers at the W program wage rate but not the \nAEWR rate.\n  The final amendment I will discuss is very straightforward. It simply \nextends the H-2A program for 3 years. The current bill extends H-2A for \n1 year, but my amendment would add 3 years to that. While the H-2A \nprogram is far from perfect, it does allow employers who need legal \nworkers to get them in a timely manner. Standing up a new program and \nmoving it to a new agency and issuing new regulations to govern the \nprogram is a big undertaking, and it is all mandated to be done within \nthis 1 year--within 1 year in the bill. I think H-2A can serve as a \nsafety net in the off chance there is a bump in the road in getting \nthese new programs propped up.\n  As I said earlier, I will not have the opportunity to have any of \nthese amendments voted on or even accepted by unanimous consent. I \ncannot tell you how much that disappoints me. Any of these changes will \ntake this bill in the right direction, from my perspective. The ag \nportion of this bill is a critical piece of the legislation, and I am \nafraid it has been overshadowed by some of the other issues. But we are \ndoing a great disservice to our agriculture community and to all \nAmericans who put food on their tables every night if we do not get \nthis right--and we are not getting it right in this underlying bill.\n  There is going to be fraud and abuse like we have never seen in the \nag guest worker program. We are going to have folks getting green cards \nahead of those who have been standing in line and doing the right thing \nfor years and years and years and all of a sudden these workers who now \nhold a blue card and say: Yes, I worked in agriculture for 3 months out \nof the year for Farmer Mack over here--and there is nobody to dispute \nthat--and he says: I worked a definitive period of time for 3 years, \nall of a sudden at the end of a total of 5 years he is going to get a \ngreen card and an automatic pathway to citizenship. That is just not \nright.\n  I came to my colleagues in good faith to try to make positive changes \nto this bill. I come to the floor now to talk about some of those \nchanges. Ultimately, I want what is best for American agriculture. I \nwant to be a constructive part of this debate and, unfortunately, a \nrelatively few of my colleagues are preventing that from happening and \nnone of these amendments are ever going to see the light of day.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nto Senator Chambliss. This is one of the least-discussed but more \nimportant parts of our bill, ag provisions. He has delineated weakness \nafter weakness in this process. The idea is he had to strengthen the \nbill. I hope the people who have heard it would draw a number of \nconclusions. First, there are great weaknesses in the bill. Second, \nSenator Chambliss fully understands, though he has worked on this--I \nknow last time we had a bill here--at great length and contributed in \ngreat detail to it. I think the third thing we ought to understand is \nthis is a complex regime we are trying to set up. I am not sure the \ngovernment can ever accomplish a setup of as complex a regime as the \neffort that has been made to create in this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Chambliss for his positive contributions, for his \nwork. I know he has been a constructive advocate with Members on the \nother side, trying to improve the legislation. I thank him for sharing \nin depth the difficult and confusing parts of this law.\n  There are a lot of things we need to understand before we move to \nfinal cloture vote on this legislation. It is late. I hope people will \npay attention. We need to understand accurately what is happening. I \nhave been an advocate. I am sure in the times we are here, sometimes we \nhave to respond at a moment's notice and we make a statement that is \nnot entirely accurate. But I do believe the sponsors of the bill who \ncame to us and claimed they had the toughest bill in history and that \nit was going to solve our problems had an obligation to be more \naccurate than they have been.\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\n  Sometimes they make mistakes. Some of the disagreements make a \ndifference in whether the legislation is good legislation or whether it \nis bad legislation. It is just important. I would like to point out a \nfew things that have been talked about a lot today.\n  One was recently one of our Gang of 8, Senator Menendez, made \nreference to the border security and the officers who have written a \nletter complaining about this legislation and suggested, somehow, that \nmaybe it was before the border enforcement had been improved--promised \nto be improved, at least. But I think it evidences a misunderstanding \nof how our system works.\n  This is a letter from the National Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. These are not the Border Patrol agents, these are not the ICE \nagents, these are the people who process the claims for citizenship and \nthey try every day to do the right thing and treat people fairly and \nequally and ensure that people wait in line and wait their turn. They \nare not supportive of this legislation. They represent 12,000 USCIS \nemployees, adjudication officers, and staff. This is the statement they \nissued:\n\n       The amended 1,200 page Corker-Hoeven immigration bill--\n\n  Not something previously, but the last bill we moved forward today--\n\n     if passed, will exacerbate USCIS concerns about threats to \n     national and public safety.\n\n  These officers try every day to review these applications for visas \nand entry permits. They try to identify terrorists and not let them \ncome in. They turn down people who don't qualify. They said this bill \nwill exacerbate threats to national security and public safety.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       It will further expose the USCIS agency as inept with an \n     already proposed massive increase in case flow that the \n     agency is ill prepared to handle.\n\n  In other words, they are not able to handle the flow they have now \nand this is going to provoke a disastrous flow that will make them all \nlook inept. They are correctly afraid people will say they let \nterrorists and criminals in the country, and they had no way possible \nto process these matters.\n  They go on to make a strong statement. These are people who serve our \ncountry and who are not allowed to participate in drafting the \nlegislation.\n\n       The proposal goes out of its way to provide legalization \n     for criminal offenders while making it more difficult for \n     Adjudications Officers to identify threats to the nation's \n     security in our ongoing war against terrorism. It was \n     deliberately designed to undermine the integrity of our \n     lawful immigration system.\n\n  I don't think our people deliberately wanted to have the system fail, \nbut the people who have been writing this, if they wanted to make it \ntougher and tighter, would have written it a lot differently than it is \nnow. It leaves these officers exposed and unable to fulfill their \nrequirements to identify and block people who should not be admitted to \nthe United States, and that was a very strong statement. It represents \ndeep feelings by those officers.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This bill should be opposed and the reforms should be \n     offered based on consultation with USCIS adjudicators who \n     actually have to implement it. Hopefully, lawmakers will read \n     the bill before their votes. I say put a cork in it.\n\n  That is what they say to us, and that was on Monday.\n  Here is another statement from the ICE officers, these officers, \nheaded by Chris Crane, their association union president. Chris Crane \nis a former marine. He is so articulate and concerned about this \nlegislation. He has raised it time and again.\n  The ICE officers have filed a lawsuit against Secretary Napolitano \nbecause they say she has blocked their ability to do their duty and \nplaced them in a position where the supervisory directions to not \nenforce the law deny them the right to fulfill their oath to enforce \nthe law. They filed a lawsuit in Federal court attacking this. I have \nnever heard of this.\n  This whole association, which consists of thousands of officers, \nfiled a lawsuit against Secretary Napolitano and their supervisor. They \nvoted no confidence in John Morton, their supervisor, 2 years ago, and \nhe just retired a few days ago. An independent survey of government \nmorale factors found that ICE virtually had the lowest morale rating \nout of 179 government agencies.\n  Two years ago I asked Secretary Napolitano: Would you meet with these \nofficers? She refused to say so. I asked her again earlier this year. \nShe has not met with them. Nobody wants to listen to the people who are \nrequired to enforce the law.\n  Who are the ICE officers? The ICE officers are the people who deal \nwith interior enforcement and deportations. They identify people who \nare here illegally, and they deport them and go through the mechanism. \nThey have relationships with prisons where they go by the prison and \npick up somebody who is illegally in the country and who has committed \na crime. They are the ones who get them deported. They arrest people--\nor at least supposedly they used to when they had jobs. They interfaced \nwith local police.\n  They have been undermined in every way by this administration and \nkept from doing their job. That is a fact. That is why the morale is \ndown, and that is why they have sued the government. That is why they \noppose this bill. They were never listened to.\n  It cannot be the policy of the United States of America that if \nsomeone gets past the border of the United States, they are never going \nto be deported. It cannot be the policy that the only thing that counts \nis having a Border Patrol, but if they can get through, they are home \nfree. There are not that many. I think there are 12,000 of these \nofficers. There are not nearly enough to do the job already. They are \ngetting no strength or support at all in this legislation.\n  I would note further that under the Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis of this bill, which comports with what I have been saying for \nmonths, we are going to have a big increase in the amount of visa \noverstays. They are not going to be caught at the border. They are \ngoing to come in on a visa and never return. If we don't have ICE \nofficers engaged in the effort, we will never be able to deport them.\n  We say, well, we are going to give legal status to everybody who is \nhere. Let's say we give legal status to everybody who is here. What \nabout the future? The people who are given legal status here will be \ngiven a Social Security card. They will be given a legal document that \nallows them to be in the country. ICE is not going to deport them. But \nwhat about those who come in the future? We are going to have no \nmechanism so they can be deported? That is one of the biggest flaws in \nthis legislation.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor. I know about law enforcement. I did it \nfor 15 years. If we don't help and have them engaged and utilize their \nability, and treat them like second-class officers or citizens, we are \nnot going to get the kind of legality the legislation promises--nowhere \nclose. It is flawed. It should not pass. These officers tell us that \ncorrectly.\n  So the ICE officers are right. They said to us on June 24:\n\n       I urge you to vote no as this bill fails to address the \n     problems which have led to the nation's broken immigration \n     system and in fact will only serve to worsen current \n     immigration problems.\n\n  It will worsen current immigration problems. That is their word. They \ngo on to say:\n\n       Instead of empowering ICE agents to enforce the law, this \n     legislation empowers political appointees to further violate \n     the law and unilaterally stop enforcement. This at a time \n     like no other in our nation's history, in which political \n     appointees throughout the federal government have proven to \n     Congress their propensity for the lawless abuse of authority. \n     There is no doubt that, if passed, public safety will be \n     endangered and massive amounts of future illegal \n     immigration--especially visa overstays--is ensured.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Abuses by political appointees, who currently pick and \n     choose laws enacted by Congress will or will not be enforced, \n     will escalate with their increased discretion and authority \n     provided by this bill.\n\n  They say:\n\n       A vote against this bill is not a vote against immigration \n     reform which we all seek, it's a vote against bad legislation \n     and the special interests that wrote it; it's a vote to start \n     this process anew and create reforms that truly fix the \n     nation's broken immigration system.\n\n  How much clearer can it be? They are correct about this. Chris Crane \nis an\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\nAmerican patriot and his team is courageous. They have had to stand in \nthere against an administration that issued this directive that \nbasically required them not to follow plain law. What does this bill \ndo? He indicated it right there. He said it gives even more discretion \nto the Secretary so she can issue even more directives undermining the \nlaw.\n  In fact, basically what the bill does is give more legal authority to \nthe Secretary to do what she has been doing now, which is \nfundamentally, in many ways, contrary to law.\n  The Federal judge who is hearing this lawsuit the ICE officers filed \nexplicitly stated at one of the hearings that the Secretary is not \nabove the law, and that is certainly correct. She has been acting above \nthe law by directing them not to comply with the law.\n  We are not saying we want the ICE officers to go out and round up \neverybody. Remember, if this bill passes, everybody will be given legal \nstatus--the ones who are supposed to be given legal status--and others \nwill need to be identified. If they are not legally here, they will \nneed to be deported. In the future, people who come in violation of the \nlaw will need to be deported also.\n  The Gang of 8 proposal adds four times more guest workers to our \neconomy than a 2007 plan offered. It offers four times more guest \nworkers than were offered by the 2007 bill that failed here--that \ncomprehensive plan. This is at a time when 21 million Americans cannot \nfind full-time employment. Imagine that. We have a much higher \nunemployment rate today than we had in 2007 before the bubble burst and \nwe had the recession. We had virtually full employment in those days. \nNow we have high unemployment, which is a deep problem with employment \nin America today, and I don't think it is going to rapidly get better. \nFor the last quarter of last year, growth of GDP was only .4 percent. \nThe first quarter of this year has been revised down dramatically today \nto 1.8 percent. That means over half a year our growth is only 1.1 \npercent. That will not create jobs. It is not creating jobs. It is not \nenough to pull down unemployment in any way.\n  This bill is going to bring in huge amounts of new workers to take \nthe few jobs being created. The bill also dramatically boasts permanent \nlegal immigration. The permanent legal flow of immigration will \nincrease substantially. Overall, it is conservatively estimated that \nthe bill would legalize more than 30 million people--mostly lower \nskilled legal immigrants--over the next decade. It will be three times \nthe current rate, and that is something I said originally.\n  I asked Senator Schumer, the Gang of 8 leader, at the committee: How \nmany people will be legalized under your bill? Well, we won't say. I \nsaid again: How many? You offered a bill; you want us to vote for it. \nCan't you tell us how many people would be admitted? He refused to say. \nI said, 30 million over 10 years. The current legal flow would be 10 \nmillion over 10 years.\n  CBO came out with their report last week: 30 million in the first 10 \nyears. Who was right about that? I mean, this is a big increase. Yes, \nit includes the people who are here illegally, but the annual flow is \nat least 50 percent higher than the current 1 million, according to the \nLos Angeles Times. I think that number comports with what we are able \nto calculate. So we are talking about a 50-percent increase in the \nannual flow of immigrants into the country with more coming in under \nchain migration. All of them will be able to work. All of them will be \ncompeting for jobs in the workplace at a time we are not producing many \njobs.\n  What does the Congressional Budget Office say? I said for weeks this \nflow of labor had no other reasonable impact than to pull down wages of \nAmerican workers. What did CBO say? CBO said the same thing. Last week \nthe Congressional Budget Office in their study used this chart--I \ndidn't make this chart. This is one of the few charts CBO put in their \nreport, and it deals with the question of wages. ``The average wage \nwould be lower than under the current law over the first dozen years.''\n\n  This shows in 2025 coming back to catch up. But, still, if the bill \nhadn't passed, we would have had more increased wages, and we would \nhave had a different picture altogether. So it is going to be a serious \nimpact on working Americans.\n  Professor Borjas from Harvard talked about this. He has written \npapers about this. He has written books on the subject. He is, I am \nsure, the most authoritative person. He is an immigrant himself--not \nhis parents; he is an immigrant. He says also that wages are adversely \nimpacted, particularly in lower skilled workers.\n  So Professor Borjas basically said there is benefit to low-income \nworkers. Who gets it? The companies that hire the most low-income \nworkers because those companies will be able to hire more people at \nlower wages. Who will lose, he said, in this process? The many more \npeople who are workers. That is who is going to lose. We can't bring in \nlarge increases in labor at a time of high unemployment and not expect \nlabor rates to go down.\n  Is the free market crowd not aware of that? Are our Democratic \ncolleagues who talk about protecting the worker not aware of that? How \ncan that be denied? Professor Borjas said it.\n  The Atlanta Federal Reserve economists found a substantial reduction \nof the value of working people in the Atlanta region as a result of the \ncurrent flow of immigration. They detect a clear reduction in wages as \na result of the current flow of immigration, and this flow is much \nbigger.\n  We are talking about not only a 50-percent increase in the legal flow \nof immigration every year, meaning 15 million over 10 years as opposed \nto 10 million. In addition to that, we are talking about the 11 million \nwho would be given amnesty and legal status. Then there is an \nadditional 4.5 million people who can't come in right now because there \nis a limit of how many each year--a cap. Those are going to be \naccelerated.\n  Then we have a guest worker program. Senator Chambliss talked about \nthe agriculture industry. There are all kinds of guest worker programs. \nThe guest worker programs will double the number of workers who come \nin. They come for one reason, and that is to take a job. They will \ndouble.\n  So this is a huge impact on our wages in America. This country is not \ncreating enough jobs to sustain that.\n  That hurts the 11 million who are going to be given legal status. \nThat hurts the immigrants who come here legally and have legal status \nalready. That hurts poor people all over America, particularly because \nso many of these workers are competing for the lower wage jobs.\n  According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and Professor \nBorjas, the group who will suffer the most are African-American males. \nThis is really a matter not to be disputed.\n  One in three high school dropouts doesn't have a job. One in two \nAfrican-American teenagers is unemployed. Twenty-one million Americans \nwho want a full-time job cannot find one. In the city of Detroit, one \nin three households is on food stamps. In Washington, DC, one in three \nchildren lives in poverty.\n  Senator Menendez, I think, confuses total wage growth with average \nwage growth. Remember, more workers will increase the total wages, so \nif we bring in 1 million people, yes, more wages will be paid, but the \naverage wage would be lower.\n  If a person is a worker, what does that person want to hear? They \nwant to hear somebody say: Oh, the economy is going to have more wages. \nIsn't that great. But I am going to have less because 30 million \npeople-plus will be here added to the workforce and everybody gets less \nand I am supposed to be thankful about that. I am supposed to write my \nCongressman and say: Oh, great, thank you for passing a bill that \nincreases total wages in America.\n  Give me a break.\n  How about this: They say that GNP is up. Senator Menendez said that. \nHe said GNP will increase. We are hearing that repeatedly: GNP will \nincrease. Well, of course, just like total wages will increase when we \nhave 30 million, 40 million people added to the economy, GNP is going \nto increase some if we add large numbers of people to the economy. That \nis the total of goods and services produced in America. But what about \nthe average person and their share of the economy? Will it go up or \nwill it go down?\n  Look at this chart. It comes right out of the CBO score, right out of \ntheir book. This is 2013 and this is 2029. This\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\nis, I guess, 2032 where the lines cross. How many years? Well, over 29 \nyears or 26 years. This bill, S. 744, would reduce per capital GNP by \n0.7 percent in 2023, out here, and it stays below the line it would \nhave been on had the bill not passed. This is below what would have \nhappened if the bill had not passed. Passing the bill pulls down GNP \nper capita, making each worker in America less able to have a full \nshare of the wealth of America. That is what that means. It is not \nright.\n  We have had people just blindly coming down here for days now and \nasserting boldly, without any serious economic data to back it up--\nexcept in 2033. This is out to 2033. They have had years way out there \nwhere they try to claim improvement. We need to be worried about our \npeople now. We have people unemployed now, looking for jobs right now. \nWe should be helping them. So this is important.\n  Finally, I will show my colleagues one more chart we need to focus \non. This is one of the most stunning charts I have seen. I was shocked \nwhen my staff told me about it. It was part of the Congressional Budget \nOffice analysis and debt projections for our economy for the next 10 \nyears. They do that every year. They do updates every year. So in the \nearly part of this year, they did a projection of employment for the \nnext 10 years, and they projected what kind of job creation we would \nhave over the next 10 years. Our CBO does it every year. It is not a \nnew report, it is something they do normally. This is what they \nconcluded: For the next 5 years, 2015 through 2018, while we are coming \nout of the recovery from the recession, they project we would create \n171,000 jobs a month.\n  That is really not enough to reduce unemployment significantly. We \nought to be creating 200,000, 250,000, 300,000, to begin to pull down \nunemployment. But that is what they predicted. But look at this: This \nis the second 5 years of their 10-year window. They project only 75,000 \njobs a month. So our staff called them.\n  They said: Tell me about this.\n  CBO said: We are glad you called. We are glad you called because we \nhave given a lot of thought to this. We have studied projections and \ndata and the case for projections for slower growth in this period of \ntime for mature economies. This is what we come up with as the best \nprojection, using private sector information and other data, including \nDepartment of Labor Statistics.\n\n  Well, from 2019 through 2023, we will be bringing in 75,000 jobs a \nmonth, with this bill. How can that not increase unemployment in \nAmerica? How can that not create a glut of workers that pulls down \nwages and creates more unemployment?\n  I just don't see how we can possibly justify this large flow of \nworkers without adversely impacting the salaries of American workers. I \nam not talking about the 11 million who would be legalized. I am not \ntalking about those people because that is part of the agenda we have, \nto be a part of any long-term settlement of our immigration problem. I \nam saying in the future the annual flow, the monthly flow, will be more \nthan we will be creating jobs here. That is a pretty stunning figure.\n  Mr. Peter Kirsanow, who serves on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights \nand used to be on the Labor Relations Board, I believe, writes that \nthis bill would have ``profound and substantial costs to American \nworkers.''\n  He was participating in the hearings of the Civil Rights Commission. \nHe said every witness there said that. Professor Borjas at Harvard, the \nleading expert in this area, has found that from 1960 through 2012, \nimmigration has cost native-born workers an average of $402 billion in \nlost wages, while firms using workers such as this gained income. He \ngoes on to say the impact of increased immigration from 1980 to 2000 \nresulted in a 3-percent decrease in wages for average native workers \nand an 8-percent decrease for high school dropouts. This is 8 percent. \nThat means a lot of money.\n  He goes on to say: ``Immigration has its largest negative impact on \nthe wage of native workers who lack a high school diploma''--a group \nthat makes up, in recent decades, a shrinking share of the workforce. \nThese workers are among the poorest of Americans.\n  He goes on to say: ``The children of these workers make up a \ndisproportionate number of children in poverty.'' He concludes that, \nbased upon census data, when we have an increase of workers in a \nspecific field of 10 percent, we can have the employment rate fall. A \n10-percent increase in supplied workers from immigration levels reduced \nthe employment rate for African Americans by 5.9 percent. That is \nalready.\n  My point is I don't see how anyone can say that anything like over \nthe next decade, we are not going to see lower wages, more \nunemployment, and lower per capita GNP. Frankly, I think Borjas's \nanalysis is probably stronger on that subject than CBO's.\n  We know this: The Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta has done similar \nstudies. These studies show things such as the average worker's pay \nbeing reduced by $1,500 a year, which is $120 a month.\n  My colleagues continue to insist that their promise is correct, that \nthis bill would not provide welfare to those who are given legal \nstatus. But the facts show it is not correct. I just have to rebut \nthat. I questioned that at the beginning. We now know their promise is \nnot correct.\n  Immediate access to once legalized individuals--they will first have \nimmediate access to State and local benefits.\n  Senator Rubio even proposed an amendment to the bill that would have \neliminated that, but it was never voted on. So the bill we will be \nvoting on does not change that at all. He knew that was contrary to the \npromises made.\n  Immediate access that will be given to those who are given this RPI \nprovisional status to free earned-income tax credits is in the bill. I \noffered an amendment in committee to fix that. In other words, the \nearned-income tax credit, if a person makes below a certain salary and \nthey are working and they have a family, they get a big check, \nsometimes $2,000, $3,000, from the Federal Government. It is not a tax \ndeduction. It is not a credit against future taxes. It is a direct \npayment to that individual in the form of a subsidy and a welfare \npayment and that is the way the CBO scores it--as a direct payment, \njust like any other payment of welfare to the individual because that \nis what it is.\n\n  They will get that immediately. I offered an amendment in committee. \nI do think--I think I incorrectly said earlier that the Gang of 8 \nMembers voted against it. I do believe Senator Graham and Senator Flake \nvoted for my amendment in committee, but it failed in committee. That \namendment, to be offered tonight by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, \nhas been blocked and will not be voted on.\n  So if this bill passes, there will be welfare payments immediately to \nall 11 million who qualify, and large numbers of these individuals will \nqualify because they are low-skilled. Over half do not have a high \nschool diploma, and they will be in that wage rate that qualifies for \nthis welfare payment.\n  Also, within 5 years, 2 to 3 million illegal immigrants who are given \nlegal status will become green card holders and/or citizens and become \neligible for all Federal benefits. So a big chunk of them--2 to 3 \nmillion--will be put on a pathway to citizenship in 5 years and \ncertainly legal status in 5 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, for an \nadditional 2 minutes and I will wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy.\n  So those will get the welfare within 5 years. That is where we are.\n  I appreciate the work that a lot of people have put into this \nlegislation. People have worked hard on it. They have a vision they \nwant to accomplish. We do need to fix our broken immigration system. \nBut this legislation does not do it. It does not come close to doing \nit. It should not become law, and we should make sure it does not \nbecome law.\n  I urge my colleagues tomorrow to vote no. That does not mean we will \nnever do anything. That is, of course, silly. We need to come back with \na more realistic piece of legislation--legislation that asks seriously \nhow many workers this economy can accommodate. Do we have a system that \ndeals with visa overstays? This bill weakens dramatically the entry-\nexit visa system under current law that has never\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\nbeen implemented but should have been implemented years ago. It \nundermines the requirements in current law that would make that system \nwork. Therefore, it will not work. It is weaker than the current law. \nWe should be following current law.\n  In addition, we need to strengthen, as Senator Portman advocated, the \nE-Verify system at the workplace. That is not done. As Senator \nChambliss pointed out, there are so many complexities in these guest \nworker programs, so many loopholes and difficulties that we do not even \nknow about. We need to simplify that system.\n  A guest worker system that brings a person here to work for 3 years \nwith their family, where they can reup for another 3 years and maybe \nanother 3 years--they are then going to be asked to leave this country \nif they no longer have a job, if we hit a recession? That is not going \nto happen. That is an impractical system.\n  A good guest worker system should allow workers to come to America--\nonly those who intend to work for the season they intend to work, and \nthen they should return home. They should maintain their residence in \nthe foreign country, and then they work here as guest workers. That is \nwhat a guest worker program should be.\n  This bill allows people to come with their families, to put down \nroots and become established, and then it is impractical and unkind and \nunrealistic that we would, 10 years from now, say go home. We are going \nto have huge visa overstays, as CBO predicts, because that is the way \nit is going to work.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me an opportunity tonight to \nshare a few of my concerns, as we move to a big vote tomorrow on \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/26/senate-section/article/S5313-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
