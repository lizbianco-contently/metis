Mr. President, the life of a young woman by the name of \nRoxanna began as an immigration success story. Her parents came from \nCuba in the 1950s, and they raised their daughter to appreciate the \nfreedoms and opportunities available to her. That was because she was \nborn in the United States. Roxanna was born in the United States. She \nis an American citizen.\n  She wrote to me last month. Here is what she said:\n\n       I am proud to say that this country has always been my \n     home.\n\n  But when she met her husband Genaro, she saw a different side of the \nAmerican immigration system. He came to the United States 15 years ago, \nand he did not have proper documentation, proper paperwork.\n  He left Mexico for the same reasons Roxanna's parents left Cuba--to \ntry, to try really hard to build a better life. He worked tremendously \nlong hours when he got here, doing odd jobs for not very much--a few \ndollars a day, to be honest.\n  Then he moved to Nevada, got a job doing construction, did a little \nbetter, and there he did real well because he met Roxanna.\n  They married in 2003 and soon petitioned to have his undocumented \nstatus changed, adjusted. Although they initially received a letter \nfrom immigration officials that gave them hope, they have lived in \nlimbo now for 10 years. Because he is undocumented, he worries every \nday of being arrested and deported--every day--and he has nightmares \nevery night that he will be separated from the love of his life, his \nAmerican wife.\n  This is what she wrote to me in addition to what I have recited \nearlier:\n\n       We pay our taxes. . . . We have never caused any harm to \n     anyone or been in trouble with the law. We don't stand on \n     corners asking for money. We work very hard to make ends \n     meet. . . . We have friends and family here that we love and \n     [who] love us. Yet [we] still feel like [we're] not wanted \n     here.\n\n  Genaro is one of 11 million people living in America without proper \ndocumentation. Many of those 11 million are the parents, siblings, or \nspouses of U.S. citizens. Some of them overstayed\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\ntheir visas. Some crossed the border illegally. Others were brought \nhere by their parents when they were only children. I recited 2 days \nago one example in Las Vegas: a 7-month-old when she came here, carried \non her father's shoulders.\n  But regardless of how they got here or why they lack the proper \ndocuments, these 11 million people play a crucial role in our economy \nand a vital role in our communities.\n  That was proven last night at 5 o'clock when the Congressional Budget \nOffice--this nonpartisan arm we look to for direction of what things \ncost and do not cost here on Capitol Hill with our legislation--issued \na statement yesterday that this bill that is on the floor today \ncertainly is good for the economy. As I will say a couple times during \nmy brief remarks here, it is going to, over the next two decades--what \nis left in this one and the next decade--reduce the deficit in America \nby almost $1 trillion.\n\n  Of course, as we have said here previous to getting the report from \nCBO, this legislation is good for the economy and good for security. \nThat is a good package.\n  These 11 million people need a pathway to get right with the law. The \ncommonsense, bipartisan reform proposal before the Senate will help \nthem do just that. It will reduce illegal immigration by strengthening \nour borders, it will fix our broken legal immigration system, and it \nwill crack down on unscrupulous employers who provide an incentive to \ncome here illegally and take, in many instances, tremendous advantage \nof these people who are desperate.\n  This measure that is now on the Senate floor provides a route to \nearned citizenship--earned citizenship--for 11 million people who are \nalready here. Some have been here for a long time. The process for them \nis not easy. They do not go to the front of the line. They go to the \nback of the line. But they at least are in the line. They will have to \nwork, pay taxes, stay out of trouble, and work on English.\n  This legislation will also recognize that the alternative to earned \ncitizenship; that is, deporting 11 million people, is simply not \nsensible. We do not have the money. We cannot do it fiscally and we \ncannot do it physically, and that is for sure.\n  Detaining and deporting every unauthorized immigrant would cost more \neach year than the entire budget for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. And not only is mass deportation impractical--not to mention \ncruel--it is the wrong approach for our economy--again, a trillion-\ndollar reduction in our deficit if we pass this bill, which we will \nhere in the Senate.\n  Immigration reform that includes a roadmap to citizenship will boost \nour national economy, I repeat, and increase our security.\n  Helping 8 million immigrants who are already working--of the 11 \nmillion who are here, they are working, some, as we heard from Roxanna, \nin jobs that are not that great, but they are working. As she says, \nthey are already working. They need to get right with the law. And it \nwill mean billions of new revenue for our country. It will mean every \nU.S. resident pays his or her fair share.\n  That is one reason an overwhelming majority of Americans support the \nlegislation that is on the floor--not 51 to 49--an overwhelming number \nof Americans, Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.\n  But immigration reform is not just an economic issue. It is a moral \nissue. This bipartisan proposal will allow immigrants to stay with \nthose they love, with their U.S. citizen children in many instances, \nsiblings and spouses. It will allow Genaro to stay with his American \nwife.\n  This is Roxanna's final plea to me in this letter that she wrote:\n\n       I pray that you would open your hearts to the millions like \n     me. . . . All we ask is a chance [at] a pathway to \n     citizenship and the peace of mind to live our lives as \n     meaningful citizens of this great country.\n\n  Her country, my country, our country.\n  I urge all my Senators on this side of the aisle, as we say, and the \nRepublican Senators to keep her wish, her prayer--a prayer and a wish \nshe shares with 11 million human beings who are here in America today. \nThis prayer, this wish, should be in all of our minds and in our hearts \nthe next few days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4624-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last year President Obama was asked \nabout the lessons he has learned from his first term. Instead of \nfocusing on errors in judgment or policy, he seemed to indicate that he \nneeded to do a better job--just a better job--of telling ``a story to \nthe American people.'' In other words, the policy was just fine, and if \nAmericans did not get it, it was because they had a listening problem. \nWell, that is an attitude that has come to define this administration.\n  I would say that is why folks will be rallying on the Capitol grounds \ntoday. They, like a growing number of Americans, are losing faith in \ngovernment. They think it is working against them, not for them. And \nfor good reason.\n  Let's take ObamaCare. This law has been pretty unpopular for several \nyears now. It is not as though the American people have not been \nexposed--probably overexposed--to the arguments on both sides of the \nissue. ObamaCare must have been discussed hundreds of thousands--maybe \neven millions--of times over the past few years. That includes \npolitical debates, more speeches than any of us care to count, issue \nads both pro and con, and--guess what--Americans still do not like the \nidea of ObamaCare, not because they are unable to understand or because \nthey have not ``seen the right messenger.'' It is because most of them \nlike their health care plan and want to keep it. It is because they do \nnot want to pay more to the health insurance companies. And it is \nbecause they do not think the law is going to work as promised.\n  Yet the Washington Democrats' explanation for ObamaCare's enduring \nunpopularity still seems to be that the law is too complicated for \ntheir constituents to understand, and the Washington Democratic \nsolution seems to be not to actually change the policy but to spend \nmillions in a campaign-style PR--PR--blitz.\n  So the news flash would be this: If you still do not think Americans \nare able to understand a law you passed more than 3 years ago, then \nthere is something wrong with the law, not with the American people.\n  Instead of going around the country trying to convince Americans why \nthey are wrong, the administration could actually listen for a change. \nI think they should start over on health care and embrace the types of \ncommonsense, step-by-step reforms that would actually lower the cost. I \nam not holding my breath that is going to happen.\n  So at a minimum they need to at least do this: The President, members \nof his Cabinet, and the congressional Democrats--congressional \nDemocrats who voted for this law--need to get out and explain to \nAmericans what is headed their way. Do not feed them the sunny picture \npainted in the ObamaCare ads the President's campaign team is already \nrunning but actually explain the reality of the situation to them. For \ninstance, Americans need to know about the coming wave of premium \nhikes. We have already seen projected double-digit increases in some \nStates. They need to know we are likely to see even more Americans lose \nthe health care they want to keep, just like the thousands of \nCalifornians who will probably have to look for new plans after Aetna \npulled out of the individual market in their State, almost certainly \nbecause of ObamaCare. They need to know they could lose their jobs or \nsee their hours cut or struggle to find work in the first place. In \nfact, a recent survey showed that about 70 percent--70 percent--of \nsmall businesses say the law will make it harder for them to hire. \nAmericans need to know all of these things because they need to prepare \nfor them.\n  It is supremely unhelpful when the President claims that those who \nalready have health care will not see changes, as he did just a few \nweeks ago. He knows that is not what many experts are saying. He owes \nit to the country to be frank about that. So it is time to get off the \ncampaign trial, call\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\noff the PR spinmeisters, put down the communications plan. It is time \nto level with the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4625-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It has been over 140 days now since we settled here in \nthe Senate the issue of the Senate's rules. We settled it conclusively \nnot only this January but actually January 2 years before that. What \nhappened this January is we had an extensive bipartisan discussion \nabout what rules or standing orders we might change. In the wake of \nthat discussion, we passed two rules changes and two standing orders.\n  The majority leader said--well, this is what he said 2 years ago:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change the Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senates rules other than through the regular order.\n\n  That was in January of 2011. What he said back in 2011--and the \nreason I put that up even though that was a previous Congress--he said \neither this Congress or the next Congress, the Congress we are in now.\n  This January, I said to the majority leader:\n\n       I would confirm with the majority leader that the Senate \n     would not consider other resolutions relating to any standing \n     order or rules this Congress unless they went through the \n     regular order process?\n\n  That was this January, just a few months ago, a little over 140 days.\n  The majority leader said:\n\n       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process, \n     including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n  Now, that is not ambiguous. That is not ambiguous at all.\n  So the reason I and my colleagues have been talking about this \nrepeatedly is that this is a huge institutional issue. The naive notion \nthat somehow you can break the rules of the Senate to change the rules \nof the Senate for nominations only was laid out by Senator Alexander \nyesterday in which he suggested a hypothetical series of measures that, \nif I were in the job the majority leader is currently in a year and a \nhalf from now, would be a very appealing agenda to my side, things like \nrepealing ObamaCare, things like national right to work, things like \nopening ANWR.\n  Now, I would say to my friends on the other side, that is not \nsomething they would be very excited about, but in American politics \nthings change. There is a tendency, when you are in the majority, to be \nkind of arrogant about it and to think the rules of the Senate are \nunnecessarily inconvenient to what you are trying to achieve.\n  Well, the Senate was designed from the very beginning--George \nWashington was actually asked during the Constitutional Convention: \nWhat do you think the Senate is going to be like?\n  He said: I think it is going to be like the saucer under the tea cup. \nThe tea is going to slosh out of the cup, down to the saucer, and cool \noff.\n  In other words, they anticipated that the Senate would not be a place \nwhere things happen rapidly.\n  Written right into the Constitution is advise and consent. Advise and \nconsent. The Senate has a role to play, for example, on nominations--\nwhich seem to be the fixation of the majority at the moment even though \nthere is no evidence whatsoever that this administration has been \ntreated poorly with regard to either executive branch or judicial \nnominations, no evidence at all. This is a manufactured crisis. \nNevertheless, they seem to be focused on nominations. What do my \nfriends in the majority think ``advise and consent'' means? Apparently \nthey think it means ``sit down and shut up. Do what I say when I tell \nyou to.'' I do not think that is what the Founding Fathers had in mind.\n  So there are a number of reasons we should not go down this road:\n  No. 1, the majority leader gave his word. Your word is the currency \nof the realm in the Senate. That ought to end it right there.\n  No. 2, do not assume you could just sort of surgically break the \nrules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate for nominations \nonly.\n  No. 3, I think it would be appropriate, since the American people \nchange their minds from time to time about whom they would like to be \nin the majority of the Congress, to think about the consequences when \nthe shoe is on the other foot.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4625-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we obviously are talking about immigration \nthis week and last week and next week. I am one of those who, after \nmany years working on this subject, hopes we are successful in passing \nwhat I believe is good, credible immigration reform.\n  I have come to the conclusion, like many Americans, that the status \nquo is simply unacceptable. I have talked a little bit about some of \nthe bodies in unmarked graves that I witnessed myself in Brooks County, \nTX, where under the current broken system people come across the border \nfrom faraway lands only to die trying to get into this country and are \nburied in unmarked graves in places like Brooks County.\n  I met with a young woman who was prostituted after having been \nbrought into the United States from Central America, and she worked in \na Houston nightclub, where she was basically held as an indentured \nservant or slave because she knew she was vulnerable to deportation. So \nthe person who brought here there and put her in that situation knew \nthey had the power to keep her quiet and not disclose what was \nhappening, while she was living a horrific existence.\n  Those are just a couple of examples why I believe our system is \nbroken and neither serves our economic interests nor represents our \nAmerican values. So I want a good solution. But it is not just what \nhappens here in the Senate. That is not the end game. The end game is \nwhat happens when this bill goes to the House and once the House and \nthe Senate get together in a conference committee and reconcile the \ndifferences between those two bills to see if we can actually get a \nbill which reflects our values and which represents our economic \ninterests, things such as recruiting the best and the brightest minds \nfrom around the world to stay here in America and to create jobs here.\n  Those are some of the positives in the underlying bill that we need \nto preserve, but there are other issues we need to fix. That is what I \nwant to talk about right now.\n  Last night the Congressional Budget Office released its long-awaited \nreport on the underlying bill, the so-called Gang of 8 immigration bill \npeople have heard so much about. The report, as usual, is a blizzard of \nnumbers and estimates and projections, but here are two I want to talk \nabout in particular, which you see reflected on this chart.\n  I think this is going to be a shocking revelation to most people who \nthought this bill would actually fix our broken immigration system.\n  If you will look behind me, it says: The number of new unauthorized \nimmigrations in the United States by 2033 with the passage of the \nunderlying bill, 7.5 million; without it, 10 million.\n  So what we see reflected in the Congressional Budget Office, which is \nthe ``coin of the realm,'' the ``gold standard''--whatever you want to \ncall it--around here, love it or hate it, and we all find ourselves on \ndifferent sides depending on the issue, but the gold standard, the \nCongressional Budget Office, says this bill will not fix the underlying \nproblem.\n  In other words, despite all of the promises and perhaps I might say \nthe hopes and the dreams and the good intentions of the authors of this \nunderlying bill, this bill will have only a\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nminimal impact on illegal immigration. Does that sound like the kind of \nsolution we owe to the American people to solve this broken system? \nDoes that sound like a solution to solve our long-term problem in this \narea?\n  I want to take a moment to discuss another portion of the bill that \nhas gone largely unnoticed by most of the country, but first let me \nrespond to some remarks made by my friend from Arizona Senator McCain \nyesterday. I am going to agree, not disagree, with Senator McCain. \nStanding right here on the Senate floor, as he so often does, Senator \nMcCain said he was absolutely confident--absolutely confident--that \nU.S. authorities can obtain 100 percent situational awareness and full \noperational control of the southern border. He cited the head of the \nBorder Patrol as his authority.\n  I was glad to hear him say that because I agree with him exactly. He \nis exactly right. But I was a little confused at the same time. He \nrepeated a comment that the majority leader had made about my \namendment, which will be pending soon before the Senate and which we \nwill vote on later today or tomorrow. He called my amendment a poison \npill, suggesting that it would somehow kill the underlying bill. Well, \nif the standards in my amendment are exactly the same as those in the \nunderlying bill of 100 percent situational awareness and 90 percent \noperational control, defined as 90 percent capture of people crossing \nthe border illegally--Senator McCain thinks it is attainable, the \nBorder Patrol Chief thinks it is attainable, and I think it is \nattainable. So how could that possibly be a poison pill? I do not \nunderstand it.\n  As I have said numerous times over the last week, my amendment uses \nthe same standards and many of the same metrics as the Gang of 8 bill. \nHere is the difference: My amendment establishes a real border security \ntrigger before immigrants can transition from probationary status--\nsomething called registered provisional immigrant status--before they \ncan transition from that probationary status to legalization. Under the \nGang of 8 bill, that would occur after 10 years of probationary status. \nBut the problem is, contrary to initial advertisements back in January \nwhere Senator Durbin, among others--the distinguished majority whip--\nsaid back in January that the pathway to citizenship is contingent upon \nborder security, only to say just a few days ago, quoted in the \nNational Journal--he said: Now we have delinked the pathway to \ncitizenship from border security. Indeed, they have in the underlying \nbill, and that is what my amendment is designed to fix.\n  Here is the real tragedy. In 1986 Ronald Reagan signed an amnesty for \n3 million people. That is not the tragedy. The tragedy is, in return \nthe American people said we are going to fix our broken immigration \nsystem. We are going to enforce the law. Well, we all know what \nhappened.\n  The amnesty was granted and the enforcement never came.\n  Here is the tragedy. The underlying bill, without an amendment such \nas mine that provides a real border security trigger that realigns the \nincentives for the right, the left, Republicans, Independents, \nDemocrats, everybody to be focused like a laser on how do we actually \nimplement that operational control of the border--which Senator McCain \nbelieves is attainable, I believe is attainable, the Border Patrol \nChief believes is attainable--without realigning everybody's incentives \nto focus like a laser on obtaining that objective, this is like 1986 \nall over again.\n  All we have to do is look at the polling to tell us--and I don't \nthink we even need any polls to tell us--that there is enormous \nskepticism across the country about Washington. This bill says: Trust \nus. Trust us.\n  There is a trust deficit in Washington, DC, and on immigration. When \nso many promises have been made in the past that have not been kept, I \nthink it is unreasonable to ask the American people to just trust us. \nWe need an enforcement mechanism such as my amendment, which will \nguarantee that everybody is aligned and it is highly incentived to make \nsure that those Border Patrol measures are upheld. Then we will not \nhave what is reflected on the chart behind me, as reported by the \nCongressional Budget Office yesterday.\n  The year 1986 was when Congress passed amnesty for illegal immigrants \nwithout guaranteeing results on border security. Ever since then \nMembers of this Chamber have said we will never make that mistake \nagain. Yet the underlying bill would effectively be 1986 on steroids \nand the CBO report confirms it. That is why those of us who actually \nwould like to see a good, credible immigration bill pass--not only in \nthe Senate but also in the House--believe, as I do, that this \nlegislation is dead on arrival in the House of Representatives without \na real border security trigger.\n  It is going to be a challenge even if we put that in, but we have a \nmuch better chance of success if we deal with the problem that the \nCongressional Budget Office has identified, and if we deal with the \nexperience we have had from 1986 and other times when we made \nextravagant promises to the American people how we are going to fix the \nsystem, only to find that those promises have not been kept. That will \nbe the real poison pill to this bill, and it will also be an \nunnecessary and lamentable tragedy if somehow we can't, working \ntogether, find a solution to our broken immigration system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4626-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4626-S4628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this week President Obama and his allies \nare launching a big summer push to convince people that his health care \nlaw will not be a train wreck. We have heard in the Senate from one of \nthe authors of the health care law that he saw a train wreck coming, so \nnow what we see is the Obama administration trying to actually sell the \nbill--not that it is good or bad, just trying to sell it in any way \nthey can to make the American people think about it in ways that may \nchange their minds.\n  The American people know this is a health care law that is not really \ndoing what they want. What they are looking for is the ability to get \nthe care they need from a doctor they want at a lower cost. That is far \nfrom anything the American people are going to see.\n  What we see today in Politico is the headline: ``Selling of ObamaCare \nOfficially Begins,'' selling of the law that was passed. Not something \nthat is good, just trying to sell the law itself.\n  The Washington Post this morning, ``Push is on to promote health \nlaw.'' The push isn't on to promote better care, not more affordable \ncare; no, just to promote the law.\n  I believe it is going to be a tough sell. A new poll out earlier this \nmonth showed that only 37 percent of Americans think the health care \nlaw is a good idea. That is even fewer people than think it was a good \nidea when the law was passed 3 years ago.\n  Remember, the Democrats promised the American people that, well, the \nlaw would be actually overwhelmingly popular by now. That is nothing \nfurther from the truth because this law is more unpopular now than when \nit was passed.\n  We see the President of the United States pulling out all the stops \ntrying to sell this horribly written law. This is a law that is bad for \npatients. It is bad for providers, nurses, and doctors who take care of \nthose patients, and it is going to be bad for the American taxpayers.\n  What the President is doing is joined by a new interest group, and \nthe group is called Enroll America. This is a group, and who is running \nit? Former Obama administration officials who moved from the White \nHouse to this group to try to sell this health care law. This is the \ngroup, part of what we have known as the Sebelius shakedown, the effort \non the part of the Secretary of Health and Human Services who was \nasking health care businesses to donate to this organization. This \ngroup has started rolling out a PR campaign to try to convince people \nto sign up for insurance under the President's health care law.\n  I agree more people need insurance, but we have to make sure the \npeople not just have insurance but get good care. This is what this is \nsupposed to be all about. The President keeps talking about more \ncoverage. What we need is care for people, not just more coverage.\n  Take a look at that and say: Is it actually going to work? According \nto the\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\narticle in this morning's Washington Post, the President of this group, \nEnroll America, a former White House staffer, said yesterday in a \ntelephone interview: The group's research shows that 78 percent of \nuninsured people don't know about the changes coming in January.\n  You have to say: What kind of insurance are people going to be able \nto sign up for? What are they going to get to choose from? What choices \nwill they have? What will they find in the exchange?\n  By the way, the exchanges are running way behind time. This was a \nfront-page story in one of the national papers today.\n  First of all, for a lot of people in terms of trying to sign up on \nthe exchanges, what they are going to find is it is going to be a lot \nmore expensive than it would have been for them if this health care law \nhad never passed in the first place. Remember, the President said that \npolicies would actually be $2,500 cheaper by the end of his first term. \nNow we are seeing policies actually a lot more expensive, not just by \nwhat the President promised but even more expensive than what they \nwould have been had the law never passed in the first place.\n  Here is an editorial from the Racine, WI, Journal Times. This is how \nthey put it the other day. They wrote:\n\n       Despite assurances from Democrats that the national health \n     care plan will drive down health care costs--\n\n  The President's promise--\n\n     the evidence is increasingly telling the opposite tale.\n\n  This is Wisconsin. I mean, this is a State which has just recently \nelected a Democrat to the Senate, a State that went for the President.\n  Here is another headline that Enroll America will not be talking \nabout when they try to cite the President's health care law. This is \nfrom the McClatchy news on Tuesday. The article is titled ``Obamacare's \nbig question: What's it going to cost me?''\n  That is what people want. That is what they want to know. That is why \nfolks were interested in the health care law in the first place: they \nwere paying too much for health care and they needed and looked for \ncare that was actually more affordable for them, right for them.\n  The writer from McClatchy, under this headline, ``Obamacare's big \nquestion: What's it going to cost me?'' writes: ``Early rate proposals \naround the country,'' around the country, ``are a mix of steep hikes \nand modest increases.''\n  Either way, insurance rates are going up everywhere; it is just a \nquestion of how fast and how high. So there is no surprise that the \npeople across the country are disappointed and believe they have been \nmisled by the President when he said rates will actually go down by \n$2,500 a family.\n  When we look at the States that have been putting out their numbers \nfor next year, for a lot of people the answer to the question of what \nis going to happen to rates is they are going up very fast and very \nhigh.\n  In Ohio, the average individual market health insurance premium next \nyear will be 88 percent higher than this year. That is according to the \nState insurance department. That is the State's official numbers.\n  In California, for a typical 40-year-old man who doesn't smoke, rates \nin an insurance exchange will increase by 116 percent next year.\n  The McClatchy article also quotes one health care expert saying that \nunder the President's health care law there are winners and there are \nlosers.\n  I agree; that is absolutely right. There are winners and there are \nlosers. We will talk about some of them this morning. The problem is \nthe President and Democrats in Congress who pushed this health care act \ninto law never said, never admitted to the American people that they \nwere going to be losers.\n  Enroll America is telling everybody to sign up for health insurance, \nbut they aren't admitting that the law picked who wins and who loses. \nLet's take a look at that. It is another important point in this health \ncare law, what is going to happen and what this new insurance is going \nto look like. It is going to be loaded onto the backs of young people. \nUnder the law, many young people, many young, healthy people will have \nto pay a lot more for each older, sicker person who will pay less. For \nthe President's scheme to work, these young healthy people will have to \nbuy high-priced, government-mandated insurance they may not need, they \nmay not want, and that may not be right for them.\n  Here is another point about what Enroll America is telling people and \nwhat it is not telling people about the new Washington-mandated \ninsurance. This group put up a blog post recently talking about ways \nStates can maximize their Medicaid enrollment. This is one of the \nstrategies Enroll America is pushing: get people signed up for \nMedicaid. A Medicaid card doesn't ensure patients actually get access \nto quality medical care for themselves or their families.\n  According to one survey, one-third of physicians nationwide are \nunwilling to accept new Medicaid patients. Other studies have concluded \nthat some patients in the Medicaid system do worse in terms of health \ncare than people who have no insurance at all. The Congressional Budget \nOffice predicts that the health care law will put another 13 million \npeople into the broken and failing Medicaid Program.\n  Even with the enormous expansion of Medicaid, even after a Washington \nmandate that everybody in America must purchase health insurance, and \neven after Enroll America's big push to sign up more people, the \nCongressional Budget Office, the people who research this, who study \nthis, say the number of uninsured Americans will never fall below 31 \nmillion. It will not fall below 31 million people even over the next \ndecade.\n  In spite of all of this revamping of a health care system, \nsignificant changes--much to the detriment of the American people \nbecause the President was focused on coverage--he is still leaving 31 \nmillion people uncovered and others paying much more. There are winners \nand losers, lots of losers.\n  This law will cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade according to \nthe CBO. It still fails to help millions and millions and millions of \nAmericans.\n  Then the question is who is actually being helped by the law because, \nas I said, there are going to be winners and losers. The Wall Street \nJournal, just the other day, page B1, Monday, June 17, ``Wanted: \nHealth-Care Legal Experts.'' Legal experts. The lawyers are turning out \nto be winners under the health care law--not the patients, not the \nproviders, not the taxpayers, the lawyers. The article says:\n\n       Some companies are warning that President Barack Obama's \n     health-care overhaul will cost jobs. It won't be in their \n     legal departments.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Health-care companies racing to go comply with the \n     Affordable Care Act and other rules are calling in the \n     lawyers, sparking a mini-boom for specialist attorneys who \n     can backstop overloaded internal teams and steer clients \n     through an increasingly crowded regulatory minefield.\n\n  The point of the health care reform should be to help the American \npeople, not just to create more jobs for lawyers. The point should be \nto increase access to care for people, not just to send them Medicaid \ncards and tell them they are covered. The point of reform should be to \nhelp people get the care they need from the doctor they choose at a \nlower cost.\n  President Obama doesn't want to talk about the ways his health care \nlaw picks winners and losers. He doesn't want to talk about the many \nlosers under his plan. Enroll America doesn't want to level with the \nAmerican people to tell them the health insurance they get under the \nPresident's law might not be what is best for them.\n  If we are going to truly reform our health care system in this \ncountry, the President and his allies should start by telling the \nAmerican people how his law falls short.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment \nNo. 1208.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1208.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require fast-track congressional approval when the \nSecretary of Homeland Security notifies Congress of the implementation \nof the border security strategies and certifies that the strategies are \n                       substantially operational)\n\n       On page 856, lines 1 and 2, strike ``the Secretary has \n     submitted to Congress'' and insert ``Congress has approved, \n     using the fast-track procedures set forth in paragraph (3), \n     the contents of''.\n       On page 56, strike lines 19 through 22, and insert the \n     following: ``Congress has ratified, using the fast-track \n     procedures set forth in paragraph (3), the written \n     certification submitted by the Secretary to the President and \n     Congress, after consultation with the Comptroller of the \n     United States, that--''.\n       On page 858, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       (3) Fast-track procedures.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 30 days after receiving a \n     submission from the Secretary under paragraph (1) or (2), the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives shall vote to \n     determine whether the action taken by the Secretary meets the \n     requirements set forth in such paragraphs that are required \n     before applications may be processed by the Secretary for \n     registered provisional immigrant status or adjustment of \n     status under section 245B or 245C, respectively, of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, as added by sections 2101 \n     and 2102.\n       (B) Referral to committee.--The question described in \n     subparagraph (A) may not be referred to any congressional \n     committee.\n       (C) Amendments.--The question described in subparagraph (A) \n     may not be subject to amendment in the Senate or in the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (D) Majority vote.--The question described in subparagraph \n     (A) shall be subject to a vote threshold of a majority of all \n     members of each House duly chosen and sworn.\n       (E) Presidential signature.--The congressional approval and \n     ratification required under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not \n     be completed until after it has received the signature of the \n     President.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, amendment No. 1208 would require fast-track \ncongressional approval at the introduction of the Department of \nHomeland Security border security strategies before the award of \nregistered provisional immigrant, or RPI, status--before the \neligibility of that status begins, as well as at the certification of \nthe strategy's completion, before those receiving RPI status may become \neligible to become lawful permanent residents and eligible to receive \ngreen cards. This would be a fast-track vote, one that would have to \noccur within 30 days after the triggering event within the executive \nbranch. It would also be subject to a 51-vote threshold and would not \nbe subject to a filibuster. It is a basic function of Congress to \noversee the executive branch and to ensure that the executive branch is \nenforcing the law as enacted by Congress.\n  In the area of border security, the executive branch, in both \nRepublican and in Democratic administrations, has failed to fully \nenforce the laws passed by Congress. To give a few examples, the Secure \nFence Act, which was enacted in 2006, still has not been fully \nimplemented, and the fencing requirement--the fence segments required \nby that act--still have not been fulfilled. The US-VISIT entry-exit \nsystem, which was put into place by legislation enacted in 1996, still \nis not fully implemented. It is worth noting that 40 percent of our \ncurrent illegal immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas. \nIt is very reasonable to assume there is a significant connection \nbetween our failure to implement this entry-exit system called for by \nexisting law and the fact that a sizable chunk--several millions of our \ncurrent illegal aliens--are people who have overstayed their visas.\n  Polls overwhelmingly show Americans do not believe the border is \nsecure. They also believe we should secure our borders first before \nmoving on to certain areas of immigration reform. These are failures of \nthe Federal Government. The American people cannot hold unelected \nbureaucrats in the executive branch--people such as the Secretary of \nHomeland Security--accountable for those failures. The most direct line \nof accountability is from the American people to their Members of \nCongress. In order to ensure the voice of the American people is heard, \nCongress must be able to vote on the border security strategy and on \nthe certification of that strategy as a condition precedent to allowing \nthese RPI provisions to kick in and to allowing people to enter into \nthe pathway to citizenship and advance toward citizenship in the coming \nyears.\n  To cut out Congress cuts out the American people, and that is exactly \nwhat this bill, without an amendment such as this one, would do. So it \nis important to remember that to cut out Congress cuts out the American \npeople, and that is what we are trying to protect against.\n  Opponents of my amendment have argued they would be unwilling to rely \non a majority of Congress to approve a border security plan as a \ncondition for allowing the RPI period to open and to proceed. Has it \never occurred to them that it might be precisely because a majority of \nAmericans would not approve the border security plan or at least they \nmight not approve of it or, perhaps, it is not a good idea to move \nforward on sweeping new policies that will affect generations to come \nwithout the support of the American people? It is, after all, the \nAmerican people who have to deal with the consequences of a dangerous \nand unsecured border. They will have to deal with cross-border \nviolence. They will have to deal with the heartbreaking stories of \nhuman trafficking. They will have to deal with the drugs imported into \ntheir communities. They will have to deal with the economic effects and \nthe added costs of public services associated with an ongoing unsecure \nborder. Therefore, it is the American people who should be the ones who \nget to say whether the border is secure and not the unelected, \nunaccountable bureaucrats who have a long track record of failing to \nimplement the objectives established by Congress and embodied in law.\n  My amendment would restore the voice of the American people to this \nprocess because, again, cutting out Congress means cutting out the \nAmerican people. I strongly urge my colleagues to defend the rights of \nthe American people, to weigh in on this important issue, and to \nsupport my amendment.\n  Finally, I wish to commend the House Judiciary Committee for passing \nthe SAFE Act out of committee last night. The SAFE Act is an important \nstep forward in improving interior enforcement, securing the border, \nand strengthening our national security. It also demonstrates that we \ncan effectively pursue significant immigration reforms in a step-by-\nstep approach with individual reform measures.\n  The SAFE Act is by no means a small piece of legislation but, \nimportantly, it focuses reform on particular areas that should receive \nbipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress.\n  First, let's secure the border. Let's set up a workable entry-exit \nsystem and create reliable employment verification systems that will \nprotect immigrant citizens and businesses from bureaucratic mistakes. \nLet's also fix our legal immigration system to make sure we are letting \nin the immigrants our economy needs in numbers that make sense for our \ncountry.\n  Once these and other tasks, which are plenty big in and of \nthemselves, are completed or at least in progress to the American \npeople's satisfaction, then and only then can we address the needs of \ncurrent undocumented workers with justice, compassion, and sensitivity.\n  Since the beginning of this year, more than 40 immigration-related \nbills have been introduced in the House and in the Senate. By a rough \ncount, I can support more than half of them, eight\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nof which have Republican and Democratic cosponsors. We should not risk \nforward progress on these and other bipartisan reforms simply because \nwe are unable to iron out each of the more contentious issues.\n  So, again, with respect to this amendment No. 1208, I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment because we were elected not to \ndelegate the power to make laws to other people, we were elected to \nmake law. Identifying the precise moment at which the border is \nsufficiently secure--that it is a good time to open the pathway to \nlegalization, the pathway to citizenship, whatever we end up calling \nit--it makes a lot of sense to put that decision in the hands of the \nelected people precisely because that decision is one that is difficult \nto identify. It is difficult for us to identify exactly what standards \nwill satisfy the American people. We can make a rough approximation, \nbut we should require a vote by both Houses of Congress and an act of \nCongress submitted to the President for signature or veto before the \nRPI period is open. We were elected to make decisions such as these, \nand we should not be outsourcing those decisions to others who are not \nelected.\n  Those who are not elected who, under the text of Senate bill 744, \nwould be empowered to make these decisions, are--make no mistake--well-\neducated people and well-intentioned people, and I am not saying they \ncategorically cannot be trusted. What I am saying is that those people \nwho are well educated and well intentioned do not stand for reelection \nat regular intervals as we do. They are not elected by the people. They \ndon't stand for election at regular intervals. For the most part they \nare insulated and isolated from the electoral process which keeps all \nof us accountable to the people in whom the ultimate sovereign \nauthority lies.\n  For those reasons I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 1208.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Women's Health Care\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a couple of us are going to come down to \nthe floor and talk about an action that was taken in the House \nyesterday. With all the issues we have to confront--whether it is \ncontinuing this economic recovery and job creation; dealing with \nimmigration, as we are trying to do in the Senate; dealing with going \nto conference on the budget, which Chairman Murray has been pushing for \nday after day after day--one would think the House would take up one of \nthose matters. But instead what do they do? They take up an extreme \nanti-choice bill. Clearly, House Republicans have learned no lessons \nfrom last year, when voters resoundingly rejected their efforts to \ndefund Planned Parenthood, restrict women's access to birth control, \nand slash preventive care for women and families.\n  So the debate they had in the House yesterday echoes of last year, \nwhen Republicans talked about ``legitimate rape'' or a pregnancy from \nrape as a ``gift from God.'' In fact, the Republican sponsor of this \nbill said the incidence of pregnancy from rape was ``very low''--an \nassertion that is flatly contradicted by the facts.\n  I see my colleague Senator Murray is here, and I would just pause and \nask her through the Chair if she needs to speak first.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No. Go ahead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I will complete and turn to her. I so thank her for \norganizing us this morning.\n  In November, voters sent the message that they want us to focus on \nreal concerns--jobs, education, immigration reform. But now they are \nback. They are back in full force with an even more extreme antiwomen, \nanti-choice agenda.\n  They should know this: The women of America are watching and so are \nthe men who support them.\n  This House Republican bill that was passed by them yesterday is a \nfrontal assault on women's health. It puts women in danger of becoming \ninfertile, in danger of suffering serious complications arising from \ncancer, blood clots, kidney disease or diabetes, just to name a few of \nthese conditions. It is an attack on 40 years of settled law, and it \ncriminalizes doctors.\n  Furthermore, there is no real rape or incest exception. It just bans \nabortion by a date certain with no real rape or incest exception. Let \nme explain this.\n  The Republican sponsors of the bill claim there is an exception for \nrape and incest. As a matter of fact, it was not in there, and they \nquickly added it. But, seriously, they do not fix the problem because \nwhat they do is say: Yes, a woman can end a pregnancy if she is raped, \nbut she has to report that rape, and it is true that many women choose \nnot to report the rape for their own private and personal reasons.\n  So when you tell a woman who has been raped and who is too scared to \nreport it that she has to carry the rapist's child to term, that is not \na rape exception. That is an outrage. When you tell a victim of incest, \nwho is too scared to report it, that she has to carry that child to \nterm, that is not an incest exception. It is revictimizing someone who \nhas suffered a horrific crime.\n  Sixty-five percent of rape victims do not report these crimes. There \nis no protection at all for those women in this bill.\n  There is also no health exception. The House Republican bill has no \nhealth exception at all. It is a reckless disregard for the health of \nwomen. For example, if a woman will face serious complications, even \nlife-threatening complications, if they continue a pregnancy--where \nthey could suffer kidney failure, a worsening of breast cancer and \novarian cancer--there is no help for those women.\n  I would say listen to the women who have suffered these problems.\n  Judy Shackelford of Wisconsin. Four months into her pregnancy she \ndeveloped a pregnancy-induced blood clot in her arm. The only guarantee \nthat she would not die and leave behind her 5-year-old son was for Judy \nto end the pregnancy. She and her husband made the difficult decision \nto terminate the pregnancy, and those Congressmen playing doctor over \nthere are telling her what she should do for her family. They are not \ndoctors.\n  Listen to Christie Brooks of Virginia. Christie was pregnant with her \nsecond child. After a 20-week ultrasound, she found out her daughter \nwould be born with a severe structural birth defect and would suffocate \nat birth. She made the difficult decision of ending that pregnancy at \n22 weeks.\n  Then there is Vikki Stella. Vikki I have met. She discovered months \ninto her pregnancy that the fetus she was carrying suffered from major \nanomalies and had no chance of survival--zero. Because of Vikki's \ndiabetes, the doctor determined that induced labor and Caesarian \nsection were both riskier procedures for Vikki than an abortion.\n  That procedure not only protected Vikki from immediate medical risks, \nbut it ensured that she could have more children in the future. And \nthose Congressmen over there want to get into her life and tell her \nwhat to do and tell her family what to do.\n  This bill is so extreme it would throw doctors in jail for 5 years \nfor providing women with the care they need. And they talk about this \nbrutal doctor who is now serving two consecutive life terms for what he \ndid. Well, that is the way the system should work. If you break the \nlaw, as that doctor did, you go to jail. But do not change the law so \nif a good doctor is trying to help a good patient, he or she risks \ngoing to prison.\n  This bill is so extreme a broad array of groups oppose it. The \nAmerican Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--they represent \nthousands of OB/GYNs nationwide--said this bill is ``dangerous to \npatients' safety and health.''\n  A coalition of 15 religious groups oppose the bill. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       We believe--and Americans, including people of faith, \n     overwhelmingly agree--that the decision to end a pregnancy is \n     best left to a woman in consultation with her family, her \n     doctor, and her faith. Our laws should support and safeguard \n     a woman's health--not deny access to care.\n\n  In closing--and before we hear from my colleague--let me tell you \nthis: Speaker Boehner said last week that creating jobs is ``really our \nNo. 1 priority.'' Majority Leader Eric Cantor\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\nsaid ``House Republicans are focused on creating jobs and restoring \nfaith in our government.''\n  No, they are not. They are continuing the war on women. If this is \nwhat their agenda is, why are they doing that? Why are they attacking \n40 years of settled law?\n  President Obama has threatened to veto this bill, saying it shows \n``contempt for women's health and [their] rights.'' In the Senate, my \nfriend and I, who are here--and many others--are going to block this \ndangerous and extreme bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for coming out today to let everyone know how extreme this \nbill is and how important it is that we send the message that this bill \nis going to be what most Republicans know deep down already. The anti-\nchoice bill that they passed yesterday--a bill the New York Times \ncalled ``the most restrictive abortion bill to come to a vote in either \nchamber in a decade''--is not going anywhere--is not going anywhere.\n  The bill they passed yesterday is a nonstarter in the Senate, and it \nis a nonstarter with the overwhelming majority of American women. It is \nan attack on women's rights under the Constitution, and it is an attack \non a woman's ability to make her own health care decisions.\n  It is a bill that was motivated by politics, pure and simple, and it \namounts to little more than a charade designed to appeal to a dwindling \nbase. But it is a charade that will end in the Senate today.\n  Even more than reminding House Republicans this bill has no chance of \nmoving forward, I am here to provide a reality check because, \napparently, despite the one that millions of American women provided \nlast November, House Republicans need another one.\n  Despite the fact in States across the country voters rejected one \ncandidate after another who politicized rape and ran on restricting a \nwoman's right to choose, House Republicans are now back at it again.\n  Despite the fact they had to bring in a paid pollster to tell the \nentire Republican House caucus to stop talking about rape, apparently \nthe message has not sunk in.\n  For many Republicans it is like 2012 all over again, which is to say \nit is more like 1950 all over again--a time when an all-male House \nRepublican Judiciary panel can join together--all male--just like they \ndid last Wednesday, to pass a bill that clearly ignores Roe v. Wade; a \ntime when the same panel could reject efforts to protect the life and \nhealth of the mother or even reject efforts to make exceptions for rape \nor incest; a time when one of those panel members, a Republican \nRepresentative from Arizona, can even trot out the idea that women are \nnot likely to become pregnant if they are raped.\n  But it is not 1950, and that irresponsible and shameful claim has \nbeen debunked by doctors and experts of all stripes, time and again.\n  It has been 40 years since Roe v. Wade put the health care choices of \nwomen in the hands of women. We are not going back.\n  But just as House Republicans need a reality check that American \nwomen are not going to have the clock turned back on them, I also \nbelieve the American people need to know House Republicans--and those \non the far right targeting women's health care--are not going away \nanytime soon either.\n  In fact, I wish I could say the new restrictions on women's health \ncare choices that the House passed yesterday were a surprise or that I \nthought that after last fall, Republicans would magically see the \nlight.\n  I wish I could say I bought the rhetoric from some Republicans who \nhave criticized their own because they believe we should be focused on \njobs and the economy at such a difficult time.\n  But the truth is, attacks on women's health care have not stopped \nand, apparently, they will not stop. That is because they are a core \npart of that party's philosophy. In fact, all we have to do is look \nback at the moment that Republicans in the House took power.\n  We all remember back to 2010, after campaigning, by the way, across \nthe country on a platform of jobs and the economy, the first three \nbills they introduced were each direct attacks on women's health.\n  The very first bill they introduced, H.R. 1, would have totally \neliminated title X funding for family planning and teen pregnancy \nprevention, and it included an amendment that would have completely \ndefunded Planned Parenthood and would have cut off support for the \nmillions of women who count on that.\n  Another one of their opening rounds of bills would have permanently \ncodified the Hyde amendment and the DC abortion ban. The original \nversion of their bill did not even include an exception for the health \nof the mother.\n  Finally, they introduced a bill right away that would have rolled \nback every single one of the gains we made for women in the health care \nreform bill.\n  That Republican bill would have removed the caps on out-of-pocket \nexpenses that protect women from losing their homes or their life \nsavings if they get sick. It would have ended the ban on lifetime \nlimits on coverage. It would have allowed insurance companies to once \nagain discriminate against women by charging them higher premiums, and \nit would have rolled back the guarantee that insurance companies cover \ncontraceptives.\n  Those were just their first three bills.\n  Since that time, we have seen women targeted on everything from \ncontraception to Violence Against Women Act protections, to stripping \nthe new protections provided under the Affordable Care Act.\n  Through economic peril, budget crises, record unemployment, the \nattacks on women's health have remained constant. On Capitol Hill, in \nState houses across the country, and in courtrooms at all levels, the \nfight against women making their own decisions about their health rages \non. Republicans have shown they will go to just about any length to \nlimit access to care. They have put politics between women and their \nown health care, they have put employers between women and their health \ncare, they have even threatened to shut down the government over this \nvery issue.\n  They have shown that this is not about what is best for women and men \nand their own family planning decisions; instead, it is about political \ncalculation. It is about appeasing the far right. It is about their \ncontinued efforts to do whatever it takes to push their extreme agenda. \nBut as we have seen with this latest effort, the deck is stacked \nagainst them because the Constitution is not going anywhere. Also, \nbecause Senators such as myself and Senator Boxer are not going \nanywhere either, because women who believe Republicans should not be \nmaking their health care decisions are not going anywhere. Therefore, \nthis bill is not going anywhere.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question? I wish to engage \nmy friend in a colloquy.\n  We are very fortunate, the Senator and I, because we chair important \ncommittees here. Of course all the committees are important--the Budget \nCommittee and I the Environment and Public Works Committee. Both of us \nhave worked hard to get important bills through the Senate--Senator \nMurray, the budget of the United States of America, and for me, the \nWater Resources Development Act, which deals with making sure the \ninfrastructure around our water, our ports is sound. About 500,000 jobs \ngo along with it. The Senator's is critical because it attacks the \nissue of jobs and deficits and the rest.\n  So it seems to me--and I want to know if my friend agrees with me--\nthere is an agenda the Republican House can embrace to deal with what \nis concerning the American people, such as taking the Senator's bill, \nthe budget bill, to conference after they went out and campaigned all \nover the country saying we did not want a budget. We pass a budget, now \nthey are stopping the budget; picking up and passing the water \nresources bill, or their own version of it if they want; certainly \ndealing with comprehensive immigration reform, which is critical.\n  I was disheartened to hear Speaker Boehner say: Well, I am not that \ninterested in comprehensive immigration reform. Well, why doesn't he \ntake a look at the budgetary impact which is so positive for our Nation \ndoing this,\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\ngetting people out of the shadows, getting them to start businesses and \nwork.\n  Does my friend agree there is no shortage of important and critical \nissues facing the American people they could take up there other than \nan attack on women and women's health?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me respond this way: When I go home--and I go home \nevery weekend--my constituents talk to me about this big word called \nsequestration and its impact on their lives. Whether they have been \nfurloughed, and their paycheck is much smaller, or whether they are \nrunning a violence against women center and they are having to close \ndown a facility, or whether they are sending their kids to preschool \nand teachers have been laid off, or whether their small pizza shop in \nKitsap County is going to have to close because so many people have \nbeen furloughed and cut back because of sequestration, what they want \nus to do is to invest in our infrastructure, to invest in our \neducation, to make our country strong for the future, and to quit \ngoverning by crisis, which is why I have come to the floor, as the \nSenator from California knows, constantly to say we passed our budget; \nthe House has passed their budget; solve this and replace sequestration \nin a responsible and fair way. We need to get to conference.\n  But we are being blocked by a handful of Republicans here on the \nSenate floor. Over in the House, they are not appointing conferees. \nThey do not want to go to conference apparently, because they want to \ntake the floor time to attack women's health care. This is not what the \ncountry is telling us to do. They are telling us to do our job and get \na budget done so they have certainty. They are telling us to do our job \nand make sure we invest in the WRDA bill Senator Boxer has worked so \nhard to do; that the Corps of Engineers projects, whether it is a dam \nor whatever project they have at home that provides jobs and provides \nthe kind of economy they need is taken care of. They elected us to come \nback here and do the job of this country.\n  So, yes, it is frustrating to me to have to come to the floor one \nmore time to talk about abortion when we should be talking about the \ninvestments that need to be made, when we should be passing a budget, \nwe should be investing in our children and their future and providing \npeople with jobs and job training and research that is so important at \nuniversities across this country so we can be a good place 30 years \nfrom now in this country and be competitive.\n  I would say to my colleague, yes, it appears to me the country has an \nagenda that is vastly different than the House Republicans on the far \nright.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think it says it all here. We need to \ndo our work on the issues that matter to the people. We need to make \nsure the economic recovery gains steam. We need to make sure we look at \nthis sequester and fix it. We need to make sure we have, yes, deficit \nreduction, but investment. We need to stand strong here in the Senate. \nWe will. Hopefully our House colleagues will change their minds. \nRepublicans over there set the agenda. Get to the business of the \npeople and stop attacking women.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1240\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Ms. \n     Landrieu, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1240.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require training for National Guard and Coast Guard \n    officers and agents in training programs on border protection, \nimmigration law enforcement, and how to address vulnerable populations, \n                 such as children and victims of crime)\n\n       On page 919, line 17, insert after ``agents,'' the \n     following: ``in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, \n     National Guard personnel performing duty to assist U.S. \n     Customs and Border Protection under section 1103(c)(6) of \n     this Act, Coast Guard officers and agents assisting in \n     maritime border enforcement efforts,''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise in support of the Boxer-Landrieu-\nMurray amendment numbered 1240 which is a very simple amendment. It has \nbipartisan support as well. It would require the participation of the \nNational Guard and the Coast Guard in new Border Protection training \nprograms.\n  The underlying bill includes language authorizing specialized \ntraining for Federal law enforcement agents who have been tasked with \nsecuring the border to update them on how the law will impact their \nduties and their responsibilities. The bill specifically requires \nCustoms and Border Protection, Border Patrol, ICE officers, and \nagriculture specialists at the border to undergo training on such \nthings as identification and detection of fraudulent travel documents, \ncivil rights protections, border community concerns, environmental \nconcerns, and how agents should handle vulnerable populations such as \nchildren, victims of crime, and human trafficking.\n  But the bill leaves out two very important groups of Federal \nofficials who will be key to further securing our lands and sea \nborders. They leave out the National Guard and the Coast Guard. The \nbill provides new authorizations for the National Guard to assist \nCustoms and Border Protection agents with border enforcement duties. In \nthe case of the Coast Guard, the bill continues their large role with \nmaritime border security.\n  But the new training language excludes both the National Guard and \nthe Coast Guard. So we look at our amendment as making a pretty easy \nfix. We do not think it was intentional to leave the National Guard and \nthe Coast Guard out of the training. So we simply restore it.\n  I noted that Senator Cornyn identified the same problem during \nJudiciary Committee consideration of the bill. This piece was tucked \ninto a more controversial amendment, so it did not pass. This \nbipartisan idea needs to be taken out. It needs to stand alone. It \nneeds to pass. I am very hopeful it will.\n  In closing, I will list who is supporting us: National Task Force to \nEnd Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women; Asian Pacific Islander \nInstitute on Domestic Violence; Casa de Esperanza; National Latina \nNetwork for Healthy Families and Communities; Futures Without Violence; \nInstitute on Domestic Violence in the African American Community; \nJewish Women International; Legal Momentum; National Coalition Against \nDomestic Violence; National Congress of American Indians Task Force on \nViolence Against Women; National Council of Jewish Women; National \nNetwork to End Domestic Violence; National Organization of Sisters of \nColor Ending Sexual Assault; National Resource Center on Domestic \nViolence; and the YWCA.\n  We have a big group out there that understands these officers need \nthat training.\n  With that, I thank everybody for their indulgence for allowing me \ntime to explain the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1227\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I can call up amendment No. 1227.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Heller], for himself and Mr. \n     Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 1227.\n\n  Mr. HELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To include a representative from the Southwestern State of \n           Nevada on the Southern Border Security Commission)\n\n       On page 861, line 9, strike ``4 members, consisting of 1 \n     member'' and insert ``5 members, consisting of 1 member from \n     the Southwestern State of Nevada and 1 member''.\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, the debate we are having in this Chamber \nis incredibly important to our Nation's\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\nfuture. We simply cannot afford to waste this opportunity to bring \nmeaningful reform to America's immigration system. We have a chance to \nenact commonsense reforms that will help fix the broken system that \npunishes those who simply want to work hard and play by the rules.\n  Over the course of the next 2 weeks, we have an opportunity to \nenhance border security and to ensure that those coming to our shores \ndo so in a lawful manner. In order to do that, we need to make sure the \nunderlying immigration bill actually addresses the issues and offers \nreasonable solutions that make sense.\n  Let me be clear: In order to fix the immigration system, we must \nsecure our borders. Attempting to bring about immigration reform while \nignoring the problems at our borders makes no sense. I, like many of my \ncolleagues, have repeatedly voted this week in favor of increasing \nborder security. I think most Americans would agree any reform \nlegislation must include measures that stop unlawful entry into our \ncountry. The underlying bill recognizes the serious need for greater \nsecurity at our borders and establishes a southern border security \ncommission if State-based results are not achieved in a reasonable \ntime.\n  I for one hope we secure our borders effectively and quickly so no \nsuch commission is ever needed. The southern border security commission \nwill be established only if the Department of Homeland Security fails \nto achieve effective control of the southern border within 5 years of \nthe bill's enactment. Hopefully we never recognize that scenario. But \nif for some reason a southern border security commission is needed, and \nif we fail to change the status quo after 5 years, then the States that \nare most affected by these issues must have a central role in fixing \nthose problems.\n  Let me be clear: My amendment No. 1227 does not endorse the creation \nof the border commission. It simply ensures that should the commission \nbe required, it will be fully representative of States' concerns and \nState-based recommendations on how to achieve control of the southern \nborder.\n  The commission is primarily comprised of representatives from \nsouthern border States, including Arizona, California, Texas, and New \nMexico, and is responsible for providing concrete recommendations to \nCongress and the administration on how to achieve control of the \nsouthern border should DHS fail to do so.\n  But Nevada would not be guaranteed a voice on the commission, despite \nthe fact that Nevada shares contiguous borders with two southern border \nStates and faces many of the same immigration-related challenges as \nthese States. It is more than reasonable to argue that Nevada, which is \na short drive away from San Diego, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, should be \nincluded on a commission designed to improve border security in the \nsouthwestern region. If that commission is necessary, Nevada should \nhave a seat at that table. Including Nevada on the commission makes the \nunderlying bill more effective, enhances this particular border \nsecurity provision, and ensures that it fully addresses the issues \naffecting the southern border and southwestern States.\n  If we reject common sense during this amendment process, we are going \nto end up right back where we started in years to come. We are not \ngoing to give the American people the solution they deserve in this \nimmigration bill. It is common sense that if the Federal Government \nfails to gain control of the borders, then the States most affected by \nthe failure should be able to play a role in fixing the problem. It is \ncommon sense that States such as Nevada, which faces the same problems \nas other States in the region, should contribute to the process as \nmembers of that commission.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I come to the floor with even more \ngood news about the Gang of 8's immigration reform proposal that is \nbeing debated before the Senate. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice has confirmed that this legislation we are considering is good \nfor the American economy.\n  We in the Gang of 8 have spent months working on this bipartisan \neffort because we knew it was good for the United States. Now we have \nthe official word from the Congressional Budget Office confirming that \nit will reduce our Nation's deficit and grow our Nation's economy.\n  As you can see in this graph, the Congressional Budget Office's \nanalysis shows that our bill will increase the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct by 3.3 percent in the first 10 years after its enactment and \n5.4 percent in the second 10 years after its enactment. This means the \nbipartisan immigration reform we are debating in the Senate will \nactually grow our economy, not harm it as some of the ardent opponents \nhave tried to argue.\n  I have been saying this all along: bringing 11 million people out of \nthe shadows will increase our economic growth, and now we know by how \nmuch.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also tells us we reduce the deficit \nby $197 billion over the next decade and by another $700 billion more \nbetween 2024 and 2033 through changes in direct spending and revenues. \nWe are talking about almost $1 trillion in deficit spending that we can \nlift from the backs of the next generation by giving 11 million people \na pathway to productive citizenship.\n  I have been saying all along, bringing 11 million people out of the \nshadows and fixing our broken immigration system will increase the \ngross domestic product and decrease the deficit, and now we know by how \nmuch. The report says it will come in payroll taxes, income taxes, \nfees, and fines estimated to be about $459 billion in the first 10 \nyears and $1.5 trillion in the second 10 years. It also found that \nthere will be fewer unauthorized individuals coming into the United \nStates as a result of our bill.\n  Contrary to what my colleague from Alabama has continuously claimed \non the floor of the Senate, the CBO found ``that the border enforcement \nand security provisions of the bill, along with the implementation of \nthe mandatory employment verification system, would decrease the net \nfuture flows of unauthorized people into the United States.''\n  The bottom line of this report is clear. What the CBO numbers tell us \nis that 11 million people living in fear and in the shadows are not, as \nsome would have us believe, part of America's problem, but bringing \nthem out of the shadows is actually part of the solution and part of \nstrengthening America's economic future. They are a key to economic \ngrowth, and immigration reform will help save the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds.\n  What we realize today is that giving 11 million people a pathway, an \narduous pathway, nonetheless a tough pathway, go through a criminal--\ncome forth and register with the government, first of all, and let us \nknow who is here, go through a criminal background check; they must \npass that background check because if they don't, they are deported; \nand then ultimately they pay their taxes, learn English, and after more \nthan a decade earn their way toward citizenship; fixing that broken \nimmigration system, in effect, is an economic growth strategy and \nexactly the right thing to do.\n  Frankly, the CBO numbers negate any reasonable argument the opponents \nof this legislation have. Every argument they have made is based on one \nthing and one thing only: that ``those people'' living in the shadows, \n``those people'' trying to earn a living, ``those people'' trying to \nkeep their families together are a symptom of American decline. Our \nhistory of immigration clearly contradicts those arguments, and the CBO \nnumbers confirm it.\n  The opponents of this legislation couldn't be more wrong. Giving 11 \nmillion people a pathway to citizenship, while strengthening our \nenforcement efforts, is not a symptom of decline. On the contrary, it \nis a symbol of America's hope and a validation of American values, what \nwe stand for as a nation and who we are as a people.\n  I believe a new generation of immigrants willing to work hard and \ncontribute to the economy will help make this another century of \nAmerican exceptionalism.\n  I say to my friends on the other side, and I say to my friend from \nAlabama\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nwho appears to have only gotten the CBO score for the first 10 years \nbut not the second 10 years, even though I understand he was the one \nwho asked for the CBO to score the second 10 years, apparently the \nsecond 10 years holds an inconvenient truth for my friend. The good \nnews in this analysis actually gets better in the second 10 years. The \nCBO reports that immigration reform will reduce the deficit by $700 \nbillion, increase wages by half a percent, increase GDP by 5.4 percent, \nand increase productivity and innovation.\n  As I listen to the Senator from Alabama make his remarks about the \nCBO report on wages, I don't think the numbers say he believes what \nthey say. He was talking about how American family wages would go down, \nand the report explicitly says that is not the case.\n  In fact, Ezra Klein wrote yesterday in the Washington Post that the \nidea that immigration would lower wages of already working Americans is \n``actually a bit misleading. . . . As for folks already here, CBO is \ncareful to note that their estimates ``do not necessarily imply that \ncurrent U.S. residents would be worse off'' in the first 10 years, and \nin the second 10 years, they estimate that the average American's wages \nwill actually rise.''\n  In addition, in case my friend from Alabama missed it, the report \nalso says:\n\n       Although immigrants constituted 12 percent of the \n     population in the year 2000, they accounted for 26 percent of \n     U.S. based Nobel Prize winners, and they made up 25 percent \n     of public venture-backed companies started between 1990 and \n     2005.\n\n  The fact is, immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the \nnative-born U.S. population. The bottom line, as Ezra Klein states:\n\n       The bill's overall effect on the overall economy is \n     unambiguously positive.\n\n  This is encouraging news for the American economy and it validates \nwhat many of us have known all along. I would only say let's not take a \nreport from the Congressional Budget Office, twist it for political \npurposes, and then preach to the fears of those who would oppose this \nlegislation no matter how encouraging and positive the CBO numbers are. \nI am already beginning to hear the voices who, of course, are rejecting \nthe CBO's analysis. I find it interesting. I stand on this floor very \noften and listen to my colleagues who use the CBO numbers when it \ninures to their benefit but reject them when it doesn't. You can't do \nit. You can't have it both ways. This is a reason to move forward, not \na reason for further obstruction.\n  The Congressional Budget Office report is encouraging enough, in my \nview, to make this legislation part of an economic recovery strategy \nand a long-term competitiveness strategy. I say to the opponents of the \nlegislation: Don't stand in the way of economic growth. Don't stand in \nthe way of economic recovery. Let's say yes to immigration reform.\n  Even a voice I normally am not in concert with--Grover Norquist, the \npresident of Americans for Tax Reform, said yesterday:\n\n       Today's CBO score is more evidence that immigration is key \n     to economic growth. Immigration reform will jumpstart \n     America's economy and reduce our national debt. . . . I urge \n     Congress to fix our broken immigration system for the sake of \n     the American economy.\n\n  I don't usually agree with Grover Norquist, so the fact that we can \nactually agree on this issue means we have done something right in the \nGang of 8, something worthy of the support even of some of my most \nconservative colleagues.\n  I think my friends on the other side are out of arguments. Ezra Klein \ndoes a good job of bottom-lining the CBO analysis. He says:\n\n       This isn't just a good CBO report. It's a wildly good CBO \n     report. They're basically saying immigration reform is a free \n     lunch: It cuts the deficit by growing the economy. It makes \n     Americans better off and it makes immigrants better off. At a \n     time when the U.S. economy desperately needs a bit of help, \n     this bill, according to CBO, helps. And politically, it \n     forces opponents of the bill onto the ground they're least \n     comfortable occupying: They have to argue that immigration \n     reform is bad for cultural or ethical reasons rather than \n     economic ones.\n\n  The good news in this CBO report about the economic benefits of \nimmigration reform is exactly one of the reasons 70 percent of \nAmericans support it. It is good for the economy. Once again, we \nrealize the breadth of support for this legislation goes far beyond \npolitics, demographics, or elections. It goes to our responsibility to \nthe economy and to our country.\n  We have an obligation to pass this legislation if we want to fix our \nimmigration system and rebuild our economy.\n  To those opponents of immigration reform who tell us ``those people'' \nwill come here and use services, demand more and bankrupt the system, I \nwould point them to this graphic.\n  The sizable deficit reduction from immigration reform in the first 10 \nyears is actually dwarfed by the amount that immigrants will continue \nto contribute in reducing the national deficit in the second 10 years.\n  This clearly shows immigration reform is good for America now and in \nthe long term. People have long realized, and the CBO numbers show us, \nthat this legislation is, without a doubt, the right thing to do. It \nbenefits all of us as an issue.\n  These are people who have come here to work, contribute to our \neconomy, our economic competitiveness, pay their taxes, and be part of \nthe dream. The CBO report simply puts numbers to what that dream is all \nabout and what we have known all along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as chair of the Agriculture, Nutrition \nand Forestry Committee, I rise today to speak about the urgent need for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I too, along with the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, wish to indicate that it is very good news \nthat this is not only good in a number of ways to have a legal system \nthat is working for the economy, but we are actually going to see \ndeficit reduction. Saving money as well as providing certainty in the \neconomy for workers and businesses, a legal system that works for \npeople, for families, business workers, is extremely positive.\n  I wish to congratulate all of my colleagues and friends on both sides \nof the aisle who have worked so hard: the leader of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the leader of the Immigration Subcommittee, and all of those \non both sides of the aisle who have worked so hard to make this happen.\n  I particularly thank Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Bennet, and \nothers who have worked very hard on a portion of the bill that relates \nto agriculture.\n  In agriculture, we need comprehensive immigration reform. It is \ncritically important for farmers from Michigan, Wisconsin, Alabama, \nCalifornia, and everywhere in between.\n  As you know, we passed our farm bill with wide bipartisan support a \nweek ago. In the debate, we talked a lot about risk management and \nmaking sure that farmers have a safety net when they experience a \ndisaster, whether it be a drought, a late freeze, or other severe \nweather. But what about when the weather is good, the Sun shines, there \nis enough rain but not too much, and it falls at the right times and \nthe crops grow and ripen, and then there aren't enough people to \nharvest it, which has happened too many times in Michigan? When that \nhappens, crops unpicked, unsorted, and unsold rot in the fields. In \nCalifornia, last year peach growers saw much of their crop rot on the \ntrees because they couldn't find enough workers. One farmer outside \nMarysville, CA, said he was losing 5 percent of his peaches every day--\nevery day--because he couldn't get enough farm workers and the system \ndidn't work. And this year grapefruit growers are already behind on \npicking by 2 weeks because of the labor shortage. We need a legal \nsystem that works.\n\n  In Alabama, in 2011 thousands of farm workers fled the State as a new \nimmigration law was passed and undermined the ability to get quality \nlegal workers. Brian Cash, a tomato grower on Chandler Mountain, said \nthat one day he had 64 workers and the next day he had 11 when the new \nlaw made it a crime not to carry valid documents at all times, which \nforced police to check on anyone they suspected was here illegally. The \nway this was put together, it was not workable. So we need a system \nthat works, that is realistic, that makes sure everyone, in fact, who \nis here is documented as legally here, but\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\nit has to be done in a way that works for farmers and workers. Because \nBrian didn't have enough workers to harvest his 125 acres, he watched \nhis tomato crop rot in the field, and that loss cost him $100,000.\n  In my home State of Michigan last year, we couldn't get enough \nworkers to help harvest the crops up and down the west side of the \nState. Asparagus grower John Bakker, who runs the Michigan Asparagus \nAdvisory Board, reports that 97 percent of Michigan asparagus is \nharvested by hand and almost all of our hand-harvesting labor comes \nfrom migrant workers. That means much of our asparagus crop, \nunfortunately, was left in the field last year.\n  As you can see here, this was all left in the field. All of this is \nwhat has happened.\n  Alan Overhiser from Casco Township, MI, grows peaches and apples on \n225 acres. He typically hires 25 to 30 seasonal workers. Right now he \nonly has two. He said:\n\n       I think one thing people don't understand is that people we \n     normally hire are skilled at this work. It's not just \n     something that everyone can do. I think that's probably the \n     myth out there. The reality is that we're in the business of \n     providing safe, high-quality food that people want to buy. It \n     takes a skilled labor force. It's hard work. They just aren't \n     everywhere.\n\n  So we need to have a legal system that farmers can count on to have \nthe skilled labor they need.\n  Dianne Smith, the executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee, \nsaid that because last year's crop harvest was lost to a weather \ndisaster, many farm workers, of course, moved on to different jobs. In \nfact, she said that apple growers from Michigan to Washington are \ndesperate to get back the skilled workers they need and that growers \nare hearing that until immigration is worked out, until there is a \nlegal system they can trust and count on, workers they have worked with \nfor years aren't willing to come back to the United States.\n  Russ Costanza grows squash, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and \neggplants on his Michigan farm. In the 1960s every farm worker his \nfather hired came from nearby Benton Harbor, MI. As of 2010 not a \nsingle worker came from that city.\n  Again, there are the challenges of finding farm workers, those who \nare skilled and who want to do this kind of work.\n  Fred Leitz, who also farms near Benton Harbor, says American workers \ndon't want to work in the fields. He has reached out to find workers \nand says it is a particular kind of work that most American workers are \nnot interested in doing. In 2009 migrant workers held 200 of the 225 \njobs at his apple orchard, and he said he would be out of business \nwithout their help. He has to have a legal system that works so that he \nknows he is following the law, so that people know they are following \nthe law, they can count on it, and they can have the skilled workers \nthey need every year.\n  Today, 77 percent of our country's farm workers are foreign born. \nThese are men and women who work in extremely difficult jobs. They are \npeople who need and want to follow the law. We have to make sure the \nlaw works. We need immigration reform to make sure we have an \naccountable system.\n  For our workers who put in so much effort all year long only to watch \ntheir crops rot in the fields, we need immigration reform. We need a \nlegal system that works. If they do not have workers to pick all of \ntheir crops, then farmers are going to plant fewer acres. The effect of \na labor shortage can be just as devastating and disastrous on our food \nsupply and our families' grocery bills as a drought or a freeze.\n  So there is no two ways about it. We need to pass this bill. We need \nimmigration reform. We need a system that is accountable, that is \ncredible, that is legal, and that works. Farmers and farm worker \norganizations are strongly endorsing this bill because fixing our \nimmigration system is what the bill before us is all about.\n  I am very pleased people have come together--those representing \nworkers, those representing farmers--to find something that actually is \na good balance and works for everyone in this sector of the economy.\n  This bill first creates a way for current undocumented workers to \nobtain legal status through the blue card program if they have worked \nat least 100 work days or 575 hours from January 1, 2010, through \nDecember 31, 2012. All the blue card holders receive biometric \nidentification, and employers will be required to provide a record of \ntheir employment to the Department of Agriculture as well. To be \neligible then for a green card, the workers must have worked for at \nleast 100 days per year for 8 years prior to enactment or 150 days for \n5 years prior to enactment, and they also would have to show that they \npaid taxes on the income they earned while in blue card status and that \nthey have not been convicted of any felony or violent misdemeanor as \nwell.\n\n  Next, the bill also establishes an agriculture worker program to \nassign work visas for immigrant workers who don't wish to live in the \nUnited States but want to be able to come to the United States and work \nlegally. Workers must register with USDA and pay a registration fee, \nand the USDA will create an electronic employment monitoring system \nsimilar to our current student and exchange visitor information system \nto track temporary workers.\n  This bill ensures a review of the visa cap after 5 years so we can \nsee how the program is working for farmers and for farm workers. It \nalso gives the Secretary of Agriculture the power to increase the \nnumber of visas in an emergency, as in a situation where we don't have \nenough workers and the crops are actually rotting in the fields.\n  In addition, any workers who are unemployed for more than 60 days or \nbreach a contract with an employer will have to leave the United \nStates.\n  Furthermore, the bill provides much needed certainty for farmers and \nfor workers when it comes to wages. Under the bill farmers will know \nhow much to plan to spend on help, and workers will know how much to \nplan on earning for their work.\n  Finally, farm employers must hire eligible and qualified American \nworkers before filling any shortages of workers through the visa \nprogram. So, as always--and certainly a high priority for me--we want \nto make sure American workers have the first opportunity for these \njobs. It is only in a situation where there are not Americans applying \nand wishing to have this employment that we would then turn to those \nwho are legally here and who are foreign born.\n  We are the top agricultural export country in the world--the top. \nThat is one of the bright spots for us. As I have said so many times, \n16 million people work in this industry. We can't continue to be the \ntop export country if we leave crops in the fields or on the trees \nbecause we don't have a legal system that works and we don't have legal \nemployees who are here, workers who are here legally and who can do the \nwork. So we need to pass this bill.\n  There are many reasons to pass this bill. One is to make sure we are \nactually picking from the fruit trees and not letting things fall and \nrot on the ground--the precious food we are growing across the country. \nWe need to pass this bill because our food supply and the world's food \nsupply depend on being able to get the crops out of the fields.\n  We have done a great job working together to produce a 5-year farm \nbill that addresses everything from research and support for farmers \nwhen they have disasters to conservation practices, trade, local food \nsystems, rural development, and on and on. The one piece we can do now \nthat will really give American agriculture a positive one-two punch is \nto pass this bill.\n  This bill is a balance. It has been worked out among all those \ninvolved in the agricultural economy, both from a business standpoint \nand a worker standpoint. Everyone is very clear: The system is broken. \nIt doesn't work. It doesn't work for anybody right now. So we need a \nsystem that works, that is accountable, that has the right kind of \nbalance, and that, of course, puts American workers first but allows \nour farmers to have the legal workers they need as well in that \nprocess.\n  This bill makes sense, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, central to any debate over immigration is \nthe need to secure our borders. The American people are overwhelmingly \nunified on that proposition. We must secure our borders. Unfortunately, \nthe bill before this body--the Gang of 8 immigration bill--does not \nsecure our borders.\n  Right now our borders are anything but secure. In fiscal year 2012 \nthere were 364,768 apprehensions along the southwest border. Forty-nine \npercent of those apprehensions were in Texas.\n  The Border Patrol reported in 2012 463 deaths, 549 assaults, and \n1,312 rescues. And this is just a tiny fraction of those actually \nharmed crossing the border illegally. In fiscal year 2012 there were \n2,297,662 pounds of marijuana and nearly 6,000 pounds of cocaine seized \nat the southwest border.\n  The trafficking we are seeing is not just human life, but it is also \ndrugs that are destroying the lives of countless young people and \nAmericans across our country. From April 2006 to March of 2013 over 9 \nmillion pounds of marijuana, cocaine, meth, and heroin has been seized \njust in Texas, $182 million in currency has been seized, over 4,000 \nweapons have been seized. Madam President, 392 cartel members have been \narrested in Texas since 2007, 33 cartel-related homicides in Texas just \nsince 2009, and 78 instances where shots were fired at law enforcement \nofficers in Texas.\n  The insecurity of our borders is causing human tragedies in our \ncountry, many of which are occurring in my home State of Texas. A \nbrutal example can be found in the situation faced by my constituents \nin Brooks County, TX, a county in South Texas 60 miles southwest of \nCorpus Christi, 90 miles from Laredo. Seemingly far removed and \npeaceful, Brooks County is the site of an extreme problem: hundreds of \nthousands of people coming here illegally, many of them from countries \nother than Mexico, attempting to cross the harsh terrain on foot, \ncutting across private property to avoid detection by the understaffed \nBorder Patrol.\n  According to news sources, 400 to 500 illegal immigrants cross Brooks \nCounty on foot every single night--400 to 500 a night. The Washington \nPost recently wrote a piece about Brooks County and described the \nsituation as follows:\n\n       There has been a surge in illegal migrants, mostly from \n     Central America, trying to sneak around the checkpoint by \n     cutting through the desolate ranches and labyrinths of \n     mesquite brush that parallel the highway.\n       They arrive in South Texas by riding the freight trains up \n     through southern Mexico and along the gulf coast. Smugglers \n     float them across the Rio Grande to safe houses and border \n     cities such as Brownsville and McAllen, then drive them north \n     toward Houston and San Antonio along U.S. Route 281.\n       Several miles before the Falfurrias Border Patrol \n     checkpoint, the smugglers pull over, and that's where the \n     migrants start walking.\n\n  Because they are either paid in advance or based solely on how many \npeople they successfully deliver, smugglers often leave illegal \nimmigrants in places such as the sometimes 30-mile overland hike, which \nis undertaken at a brutally fast pace, and sadly the harsh land and \nclimate lead to the death of many.\n  The Washington Post interviewed one of my constituents, Mr. Presnall \nCage, on that point. He said:\n\n       ``I don't want the bodies here anymore,'' said Presnall \n     Cage, whose family's 43,000-acre property is directly west of \n     the highway checkpoint. ``A more secure border would mean \n     fewer deaths,'' he said.\n\n  The system we have is not humane. It is cruel, and it results in \nterrible human tragedies.\n  The Washington Post went on to describe the situation Mr. Cage faces.\n\n       Some of the migrants find their way to Cage's ranch house, \n     as three groups of people had done the week before. ``I feel \n     so sorry for them,'' he said. ``They have no idea what \n     they're getting into.'' Cage has placed dozens of water \n     faucets around his property. But a sinking feeling sets in \n     whenever he sees a pair of sneakers laid across a path or a \n     shirt tied to a branch near the road, typical last-ditch \n     distress signals.\n\n  When winter arrives and quail hunters come to his ranch with dogs, \nmore bodies show up. Last year 16 bodies were found on Cage's ranch. \nSixteen men, women, and children lost their lives because of our broken \nimmigration system.\n  Sadly, the 16 found on Mr. Cage's ranch represent only a small \nfraction of the 129 bodies found in just Brooks County last year. The \ncounty spent $159,000 last year to recover and bury those who went \nunclaimed. They are buried at the Sacred Heart Burial Park. They are \nspread across three sections of the cemetery. In those three sections, \nthe graves do not have names.\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\nThe remains of a human being lie marked only by simple aluminum markers \ncarrying serial numbers or sterile descriptions: ``Unknown Female,'' \n``Bones,'' or ``Skull.''\n  No one who cares about our humanity would want to maintain a system \nwhere the border isn't secure, where vulnerable women and children \nentrust themselves to corrupt coyotes and drug dealers and are left to \ndie in the desert. This is a system that produces human tragedy, and \nthe most heartbreaking aspect of this Gang of 8 bill is that it will \nperpetuate this tragedy. It will not fix the problem. It will not \nsecure the borders.\n  Linda Vickers, who is a constituent from Brooks County, wrote me \nabout the situation she faces:\n\n       In all the years I have lived here (since 1996) I have \n     never seen or been confronted by so many illegal immigrants. \n     Since May of last year the numbers have continued to rise. . \n     . . But I have never seen it like this! Nor, have I ever felt \n     this unsafe in my own home and on my own ranch as I do right \n     now. I have had so many gang members (MS-13, Pistoleros, \n     etc.) around my house that I now feel it is not ``if'' I will \n     be assaulted, but ``when.''\n\n  Linda Vickers' husband is a veterinarian, Dr. Mike Vickers. Like many \nother ranchers in Brooks County, Mike speaks Spanish and he worked for \nMexican ranchers for years as a vet until the travel became too \ndangerous. Dr. Vickers gave the following statement of his own:\n\n       I live on a Brooks County ranch with my wife, Linda. In \n     2012, 129 bodies of deceased illegal aliens were found in our \n     County on private ranch land. Most of these bodies were found \n     within 15 minutes of our front door in any given direction! \n     We believe these bodies represent only 20-25% of the actual \n     number of illegal immigrants dying in this area. . . . In one \n     week of last July, I personally rescued 15 people (most were \n     Central Americans) that were lost and close to dying from \n     dehydration and heat exhaustion. . . . This same week I found \n     a deceased person that had been laid across a dirt road in \n     order to be found. He was a 31 year old man from El Salvador.\n\n  A system that perpetuates these human tragedies is cruel. It is the \nopposite of humane. Yet the bill before this Senate, the Gang of 8 \nbill, encourages illegal immigration now and more in the future if it \nis passed.\n  Apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley are projected to be higher in \nfiscal year 2013 than in any year since 2000, and the number of \napprehensions to date, after only 8 months, is already more than the \ntotal apprehensions in fiscal years 2002 to 2004 and 2007 to 2011.\n  This is a chart of the apprehensions of what Homeland Security refers \nto as OTMs--those who are other than Mexican--because a significant \nnumber of people coming into this country illegally are not from Mexico \nbut are from other nations.\n  The black line represents apprehensions of OTMs along the southwest \nborder, and the white line represents apprehensions in Texas. You see \ntwo clear spots--one in the mid-2000s, coming up right upon the \nconsideration of the last major amnesty bill, and we saw apprehensions \nspike dramatically as people were incentivized by that offer of amnesty \nto risk their lives coming here illegally, and we see again a second \nspike happening right now.\n\n  DHS statistics show apprehensions on the southwest border are up 13 \npercent versus the same time last year--from 170,223 in 2012 to \n192,298.\n  The Gang of 8 bill encourages illegal immigration in many ways, one \nof which is by prohibiting immigration law enforcement from detaining \nor deporting any apprehended illegal immigrant if they ``appear to be \neligible for instant legalization'' and requiring that they be allowed \nto apply for amnesty. In other words, what this bill does is it \nhandcuffs law enforcement from enforcing our immigration laws. We \nshould not be surprised that when you handcuff law enforcement, the \nresult is more and more breaking the law.\n  The Gang of 8 bill allows illegal aliens who have been previously \nremoved to, in the Secretary's discretion, be eligible for legalization \neven if they have illegally reentered the country yet again. And \nneither the Gang of 8 bill nor many of the alternative border security \nproposals that have been introduced do enough to meaningfully secure \nour borders.\n  The last time this body passed major immigration reform was 1986. In \n1986 the Federal Government made a promise to the American people. The \nFederal Government said: We will grant amnesty to some 3 million people \nwho are here illegally. In exchange, we will secure the borders. We \nwill stop illegal immigration. We will fix the problem. The American \npeople accepted that offer. What happened in 1986 was that the amnesty \nhappened, 3 million people received it, and yet the border security \nnever happened.\n  I was struck last week when the senior Senator from New York stood at \nhis desk and said: When this bill passes, illegal immigration will be a \nthing of the past. It was an echo from the debate in 1986. In 1986 that \nsame promise was made to the American people: Just grant amnesty and \nillegal immigration will be a thing of the past. Do you know what we \nhave learned? If legalization comes first, border security never \nhappens.\n  One of the major questions before this body is, Which should come \nfirst, legalization or border security? I can tell you that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans, Republicans and Democrats, want \nborder security first before any legalization. Yet the Gang of 8 bill \nand the alternatives before this body don't require even a single \nadditional Border Patrol agent prior to legalization. The Gang of 8 \nbill does not require that a single foot of fencing be built along the \nborder prior to legalization. The Gang of 8 bill does not require a \nbiometric exit-entry system prior to legalization.\n  Unlike the Gang of 8 bill, the amendment I have called up does \nprovide real border security. It does what we have been telling the \nAmerican people, but it actually follows through on it. Prior to \nlegalization, my amendment would do a number of things. No. 1, it would \ntriple the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border. Today \nthere are a little over 18,000 Border Patrol agents on the border, but \nour border is not secure. This bill triples that. This bill quadruples \nthe number of cameras, sensors, helicopters, fixed-wing assets, \ntechnology, and infrastructure on the border. This bill requires that \nwe complete all 700 miles of the fencing required by law in the Secure \nFence Act. This bill requires real-time sharing of information among \nFederal law enforcement agencies. This bill requires that we complete \nand fully implement the US-VISIT system, including biometric exist-\nentry. And this bill requires that we establish operational control \nover 100 percent of the southern border.\n  Proponents of the Gang of 8 bill suggest that we don't need \nadditional border patrol. I have to say that it is interesting seeing \nSenators who represent States that are very, very far away from the \nborder standing up with complete confidence and sharing what we need to \ndo to secure the border.\n  I can tell you, every time I have been to the border in my home State \nof Texas, the No. 1 answer that has been given from people on the \nground--how do we fix this? How do we secure the border? How do we make \nit so you are not at risk from Mexican drug cartels and from the \nconstant human tragedy of illegal immigration? The No. 1 answer you get \nover and over from law enforcement on the ground is this: More boots on \nthe ground.\n  Let me put things in perspective in terms of what exactly we are \ntalking about with boots on the ground. We need to have sufficient \nresources to secure the border. And let's take as a comparison the \nborder versus New York City. In New York City, there are 34,500 NYPD \nofficers. The area those 34,000 officers are policing is 468 square \nmiles. That is a density of about 73 officers per square mile. By \ncontrast, the border has 18,516 Border Patrol agents, but instead of \npolicing 468 square miles, they are policing approximately 200,000 \nsquare miles. That is a density of 0.1 agents per square mile.\n  Let's look at it in a different way to get a sense of the \ndifferential there is right now. In New York City, 34,500 NYPD \nofficers, as represented by this chart, are policing about 470 square \nmiles--that little dot. By comparison, roughly half this number of \nBorder Patrol agents are policing a square that large. And that is why \nlaw enforcement on the border says that whenever you spot those who are \ncoming here illegally--even if you spot them, even if you find them, \nthere is a delay in getting Border Patrol agents there to apprehend \nthem, and by the time they are there, many of them have escaped and \nfled into the interior.\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\n  Why focus on inputs? One of the reasons to focus on inputs is that \nthis administration in particular has demonstrated both a willingness \nto disregard the law and less than complete fidelity to truth. \nProponents of the Gang of 8 say there are provisions in this statute \nthat require that DHS fix the problem. I would like to point out a \ncouple of provisions of current law.\n  If you look right now at current law, current Federal law requires:\n\n       Ports of entry shall use equipment and software to allow \n     the biometric comparison and authentication of all travel \n     documents.\n\n  That was enacted in law in 2002. Has it happened? No. It is one of \nthe things in the civics classes we teach our kids: Congress passes a \nlaw, the President signs it, and suddenly it occurs. It doesn't occur \nif the Executive doesn't implement it. And the statement of the head of \nthe travel entry programs at CBP in 2011 was:\n\n       The operational costs of a biometric program at this time \n     would be inordinately expensive and the benefits not \n     commensurate with the costs.\n\n  Despite the fact that the statute, the words on the paper say we have \nto have a biometric system, we do not, and the Obama administration \nmade it perfectly clear they do not intend to change that.\n  Look at another provision of current law. Current law provides the \nDHS Secretary shall--not may, not might--``shall provide for at least 2 \nlayers of reinforced fencing'' over 700 specified miles.\n  How much of that has happened? Madam President, 36.6 miles of double-\nlayered fence is currently standing. The statute says there shall be \n700. DHS has built only 36. Words on a paper don't secure the border.\n  A third example of current law right now that the Obama \nadministration is disregarding, current law provides DHS Secretary \nJanet Napolitano must ``achieve and maintain operational control'' over \nthe entire border.\n  What does Janet Napolitano say? She says: ``Look, operational \ncontrol, it's an archaic term.''\n  DHS doesn't even measure it anymore, much less require it.\n  Why? Because when they were measuring it they found it wasn't being \nachieved, the border wasn't secure. So rather than enforce it, they \njust erased the metric that demonstrated they are not fixing the \nproblem.\n  There are two fundamental questions this body needs to consider when \nit comes to border security. No. 1, do we have real border security? Do \nwe fix the problem, stop providing empty promises? The Gang of 8 bill \nhas empty promises that will do nothing to secure the border. I think \nthe American people are tired of empty promises.\n  The amendment I have offered will put real teeth in border security: \ntriple the number of Border Patrol agents on the southwest border; \nquadruple the cameras, sensors, drones, helicopters, and other \ntechnology and infrastructure as appropriate; ensure that we fix the \nproblem.\n  No. 2, there is a fundamental question: Which comes first, \nlegalization or border security? The Gang of 8 bill says let's have \nlegalization first and then border security is a promise that will \nhappen in the future. We have been down that road. That was the exact \nsame path we took in 1986. In 1986 Congress told the American people we \nwill grant legalization now, and on Tuesday I will pay you the cost of \na hamburger. In the future, we will secure the border. Three decades \nlater it still has not happened.\n  The only way to make it happen is to require border security first, \nto put the incentives on the Federal Government. Talk is cheap. We need \nto fix the problem.\n  In closing, I ask you, Madam President, and I ask the American people \nto focus on the cost, the human tragedy of our current system. In 1986 \nthere were 3 million people here illegally. They were granted amnesty \nand the Federal Government promised the problem would be solved. Three \ndecades later the border is still not secure, and there are 11 million \npeople here illegally.\n  If this body passes the Gang of 8 bill, it will grant immediate \nlegalization and it still will not secure the border. In another 10 or \n20 years we will be back here, but it will not be 3 million or 11 \nmillion; it will be 20 million or 30 million people here illegally. If \nthat happens, there are going to be a lot more graves like this, a lot \nmore little boys, little girls, a lot more men and women who will never \nachieve the potential they could because of our system. It is a \nperverse system that encourages good people who just want a better \nlife--they want a better life for their kids--and with our system, \nbecause we do not enforce the law, they risk their lives, they entrust \nthemselves to human traffickers who assault them, who sexually violate \nthem, who leave them to die in the desert.\n  The American people are overwhelmingly unified that, No. 1, we need \nto secure the border. And, No. 2, any bill that this body passes should \nhave border security first and then legalization, not the other way \naround. There is an old saying that is popular in Texas: Fool me once, \nshame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\n  In 1986, Congress asked the American people: Trust us with \nlegalization first and border security later. We learned it never \nhappened. You know what. I don't think the American people are ready to \nbe fooled a second time. I hope this body will adopt the amendment I \nhave introduced to provide real border security and to ensure that \nborder security occurs first, before legalization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent my remarks be as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Judicial Confirmation Process\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate has so far this year confirmed \n26 judicial nominees, including six appeals court nominees. The \nmajority was right on cue, complaining about what they still insist is \nunprecedented confirmation obstruction and threatening to fundamentally \nchange the confirmation process itself.\n  The late Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once said \nthat you are entitled to your own opinion but not to your own facts. So \nlet us look at the real confirmation facts.\n  The Senate confirmed a higher percentage of President Obama's first-\nterm appeals court nominees, and did so faster, than it had for \nPresident Bush. The 111 judges confirmed in the previous Congress was \nthe highest total in more than 20 years.\n  Now we are at the beginning of President Obama's second term. The \nSenate is on a faster second-term confirmation pace than under any \nPresident in American history. And by the way, we have already \nconfirmed more judges as the Democratic majority allowed to be \nconfirmed in all of 2005, the first year of President Bush's second \nterm.\n  Or we can look specifically at nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals. \nThe six appeals court nominees already confirmed this year are more \nthan 60 percent above the average annual confirmation pace during the \nentire time I have been in the Senate. In fact, the Senate confirmed \nmore appeals court nominees by this time in only eight of those 36 \nyears.\n  Despite those confirmation facts, the majority wants the public to \nbelieve that legions of judicial nominees are piling up, waiting to be \nconfirmed, and the only thing holding back this confirmation flood is \nRepublican obstruction in general, and Republican filibusters in \nparticular.\n  Democratic Senators claim that there have been hundreds of \nfilibusters. In January 2011, they claimed that there had been 275 \nfilibusters in the previous 4 years alone. Last December, the claim had \nrisen to 391.\n  My Democratic colleagues would be no less accurate if they claimed \nthousands or even millions of filibusters. There is no other way to say \nit, Mr. President, but the majority is committing filibuster fraud.\n  Here's how they do it. The Senate must end debate on a bill or a \nnomination before we can vote on it. The process for ending debate, or \ninvoking cloture, has two steps, a cloture motion and a cloture vote.\n  A cloture motion is nothing more than a request to end debate and \nrequires only the signature of 16 Senators. The little secret behind \nthose wild claims of filibusters in the hundreds is that Democrats are \ncounting cloture motions, not filibusters. On January 1 of this year, \none Democratic Senator actually let slip what the majority is up to \nwhen he referred to ``the\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\nuse of the filibuster as measured by the number of cloture motions.''\n  Cloture motions and filibusters are two different things. In a report \ndated just last month, the Congressional Research Service said:\n\n       Senate leadership has increasingly made use of cloture . . \n     . at times when no evident filibuster has yet occurred.\n\n  The current majority leader files cloture motions left and right, \nsometimes at the same time and in virtually the same breath as when he \nbrings up a matter for consideration. That gimmick boosts the number \nthat the majority uses as false evidence of a filibuster problem, but \nit is simply filibuster fraud. So many of these cloture motions are \nunnecessary that a higher percentage is withdrawn without any cloture \nvote at all than under previous majority leaders of either party.\n  Here is one recent example. The Judiciary Committee unanimously \nreported the appeals court nomination of Sri Srinivasan on May 16, \n2013. No one opposed this nominee in the Judiciary Committee, and no \none was ever going to oppose this nominee on the floor. The majority \nleader still filed a cloture motion even though the minority leader had \nalready agreed to a confirmation vote.\n  I will not be surprised if the majority claims that this unanimously \nconfirmed nominee was somehow filibustered because a completely \nunwarranted and totally unnecessary cloture motion was filed and \npromptly withdrawn.\n  It is time to stop the gimmicks and fake numbers. It is time to stop \nthe filibuster fraud. A cloture motion is simply a request to end \ndebate while a cloture vote is an actual attempt to end debate. A \nfilibuster occurs when that attempt to end debate fails.\n  Let's look specifically at judicial filibusters. The majority should \nknow the judicial filibuster facts because, after all, they pioneered \nthe use of filibusters to defeat judicial nominees who would otherwise \nbe confirmed.\n  The Senate has taken a total of 51 cloture votes on 36 different \njudicial nominations since the first one in 1968. Remember that a vote \nagainst cloture is a vote for a filibuster. As this chart shows, 79 \npercent of all votes by Senators for judicial filibusters in American \nhistory have been cast by Democrats.\n  One reason why the majority uses fake definitions and made-up numbers \nis that the number of real judicial filibusters is much lower today \nthan in the past, especially during the previous administration.\n  At this point under President Bush, the Senate had taken 24 cloture \nvotes on judicial nominees and 20 of them had failed. In other words, \nthere had been 20 judicial filibusters. Not cloture motions, but actual \nfilibusters that prevented confirmation votes. But under President \nObama, the Senate has taken only nine cloture votes on judicial \nnominees and only four of those have failed. There have been only four \njudicial filibusters since President Obama took office.\n  It's no wonder that the majority today would rather use fake numbers \nthan talk about real filibusters. Democrats led five times as many \nfilibusters of President Bush's judicial nominees than there have been \nfilibusters of President Obama's judicial nominees. Five times as many.\n  Not only that, but the very same majority party leaders who today \nmost loudly condemn judicial filibusters the majority leader, the \nmajority whip, and the Judiciary Committee chairman each voted no less \nthan 21 times for judicial filibusters by this point under President \nBush. They voted for real filibusters then, they condemn fake \nfilibusters today.\n  Another example of filibuster fraud is the claim that the Senate \ntoday is bound by a 2006 agreement among a group of Senators who came \nto be known as the Gang of 14. Just a few months ago, the majority whip \nsaid that the Senate is supposed to use this agreement today as the \nstandard for justifying a filibuster. In the Judiciary Committee and \nhere on the floor, Senators on the other side of the aisle lecture us \nabout how we supposedly have violated that agreement.\n  That agreement was never binding on more than those 14 Senators, it \noffered a standard that was to be interpreted and applied individually, \nand it never applied to anyone after 2006.\n  Here's what happened. By the spring of 2005, Democrats had led 20 \nfilibusters that prevented confirmation votes on 10 different appeals \ncourt nominees. The majority leader threatened to prevent judicial \nfilibusters through a parliamentary ruling that could be sustained by a \nsimple majority vote. A group of seven Democrats and seven Republicans \njoined to head off that confrontation.\n  With a 55-45 Republican majority, the seven Democrats were enough to \nprevent judicial filibusters and the seven Republicans were enough to \nprevent a ban on judicial filibusters.\n  I have here the memorandum of understanding signed by those 14 \nSenators. Three things stand out.\n  First, it ``confirms an understanding among the signatories.'' The \nagreement applied only to those 14 Senators, only five of whom are \nserving today.\n  Second, it says that this agreement is ``related to pending and \nfuture nominations in the 109th Congress.'' The agreement expired more \nthan 6 years ago.\n  Third, it says that those 14 Senators will support judicial \nfilibusters only under ``extraordinary circumstances'' and that each \nSenator decides individually whether those circumstances exist. There \nnever was any objective standard that applied to the Senate as a whole, \nor to any group of Senators for that matter.\n  It could not be clearer. This was an agreement among those Senators \nto use that standard during that Congress in order to avoid that \nconfrontation over changing confirmation procedures.\n  Individual Senators may certainly use whatever standard they choose \nfor their cloture or confirmation votes, including whatever this \nextraordinary circumstances standard might mean. But it is pure fiction \nto say that this temporary agreement ever bound, let alone binds today, \nmore than those Senators who explicitly agreed to it.\n  Today we have the bizarre phenomenon of Democratic Senators who voted \nfor nearly two dozen filibusters of Bush nominees telling us that an \nexpired agreement they had never joined somehow prevents us from voting \nfor filibusters of Obama nominees today.\n  Why is the majority using such sleight of hand and trying to enforce \nnon-existent agreements? Why are they engaging in filibuster fraud?\n  One possibility is that the majority wants to cover up the fact that \nPresident Obama has consistently lagged behind his predecessors in \nmaking judicial nominations. The Senate, after all, cannot confirm \nnominations that do not exist.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts tracks pending nominees \nfor current judicial vacancies. You can see here the record based on \nthat data. The Senate had pending nominations for an average of 41 \npercent of current vacancies under President Clinton, 53 percent under \nPresident Bush, but only 35 percent under President Obama. And today it \nis even lower, at only 33 percent.\n  During his first term, President Obama was more than 30 percent \nbehind President Bush's nominations pace, but ended up only 10 percent \nbehind in total confirmations. That hardly looks like partisan \nobstruction to me.\n  Not all vacancies, of course, are created equal. Some are more \npressing than others. President Obama recently sent to the Senate \nnominees for the three remaining vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the DC Circuit and the majority is demanding swift confirmation. By \nthe Democrats' own standards, however, these nominees should not be \nconsidered.\n  In 2006, Judiciary Committee Democrats wrote then-Chairman Arlen \nSpecter to oppose considering a DC Circuit nominee. That letter, which \nI have here, said that another DC Circuit nominee ``should under no \ncircumstances be considered--much less confirmed before we first \naddress the very need for that judgeship and deal with the genuine \njudicial emergencies identified by the Judicial Conference.''\n  Madam President, I ask that both of these documents be printed in the \nRecord.\n  My Democratic colleagues had two criteria for filling a DC Circuit \nvacancy. The need for the judgeship to be filled had to be established, \nand particularly pressing vacancies elsewhere\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\nhad to be addressed. Let's apply those Democratic criteria to these new \nDC Circuit nominees.\n  The first Democratic standard is that there must clearly be a need \nfor the particular judgeship to be filled. In 2006, Democrats offered \nspecific criteria including the total number of appeals filed.\n  As you can see here, based on the most recent data from the \njudiciary's administrative office, the number of appeals filed shown \nhere in green has been below the 2006 level every year since, and far \nbelow the average of all circuits across the country shown here in red.\n  Another Democratic benchmark is the number of appeals resolved on the \nmerits per active judge. Based on the same data from the judiciary's \nadministrative office, even with a lower number of active judges, this \nbenchmark has risen a mere four percent from 2006.\n  Whether you look at new cases or completed cases, judges on the DC \nCircuit handle about 40 percent fewer cases than judges on the next \nbusiest circuit.\n  Based on these Democratic benchmarks, these DC Circuit vacancies do \nnot need to be filled.\n  The second Democratic standard for considering DC Circuit nominees is \nthat more pressing vacancies designated judicial emergencies should \nfirst be addressed. Vacancies get that label the older they are and the \nheavier a court's caseload.\n  The contrast between 2006 and today is really dramatic. When \nDemocrats in July 2006 rejected consideration of a single DC Circuit \nnominee, President Bush had made nominations for 12 of the 20 existing \njudicial emergencies. Now, when Democrats demand consideration of not \none but three DC Circuit nominees, President Obama has sent us nominees \nfor only eight of the 33 judicial emergencies that exist today.\n  So the DC Circuit's caseload is down while judicial emergencies \nwithout nominees are up. I am not accusing my colleagues in the \nmajority of flip-flopping because their party controls the White House, \nbut it seems to me that their own criteria clearly compel the \nconclusion that these new DC Circuit nominees should not be considered \nat this time.\n  The second reason for the majority's filibuster fraud is that they \nwant to manufacture some justification, even if they have to make it up \nout of thin air, for eliminating judicial filibusters. They want to do \ntoday exactly what the Gang of 14 prevented in 2006, but with far less \njustification.\n  The minority leader, Senator McConnell, has daily reminded us of the \nmajority leader's explicit promise not to pursue changing confirmation \nprocedures except through the steps provided for in our standing rules.\n  In addition, if we look at the facts rather than the fiction, there \nis no conceivable reason to pursue such a change by any means. There \nhave been far fewer judicial filibusters today--one-fifth as many--than \nduring the Bush administration. There is less justification to change \nconfirmation procedures today than there was when Democrats opposed \ndoing so in 2006.\n  Let me summarize this journey through the real world of judicial \nconfirmations. There is a very real, very serious debate about the kind \nof judges America needs on the federal bench. The process of \nconsidering President Obama's judicial nominees, however, is being \nconducted reasonably and fairly.\n  The majority apparently will do anything, even engaging in filibuster \nfraud, to avoid admitting the facts while hoping that no one will be \nthe wiser. The truth is that filibusters are down, not up, and there \nhave been far fewer judicial filibusters of Obama nominees than there \nwere of Bush nominees. The DC Circuit's caseload is down while the \nnumber of judicial emergencies without nominees is up.\n  There is a better course than provoking unnecessary confrontations by \nnominees to positions that should not even exist or by threatening to \nchange confirmation procedures that should not be changed. The majority \nshould abandon their strategy of filibuster fraud and prioritize \nfilling the most pressing vacancies.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n          Memorandum of Understanding on Judicial Nominations\n\n       We respect the diligent, conscientious efforts, to date, \n     rendered to the Senate by Majority Leader Frist and \n     Democratic Leader Reid. This memorandum confirms an \n     understanding among the signatories, based upon mutual trust \n     and confidence, related to pending and future judicial \n     nominations in the 109th Congress.\n       This memorandum is in two parts. Part I relates to the \n     currently pending judicial nominees; Part II relates to \n     subsequent individual nominations to be made by the President \n     and to be acted upon by the Senate's Judiciary Committee.\n       We have agreed to the following:\n\n\n          Part I: Commitments on Pending Judicial Nominations\n\n       A. Votes for Certain Nominees. We will vote to invoke \n     cloture on the following judicial nominees: Janice Rogers \n     Brown (D.C. Circuit), William Pryor (11th Circuit), and \n     Priscilla Owen (5th Circuit),\n       B. Status of Other Nominees. Signatories makes no \n     commitment to vote for or against cloture on the following \n     judicial nominees: William Myers (9th Circuit) and Henry Saad \n     (6th Circuit),\n\n\n              Part II: Commitments for Future Nominations\n\n       A. Future Nominations. Signatories will exercise their \n     responsibilities under the Advice and Consent Clause of the \n     United State Constitution in good faith. Nominees should only \n     be filibustered under extraordinary circumstances, and each \n     signatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in \n     determining whether such circumstances exist.\n       B. Rules Changes. In light of the spirit and continuing \n     commitments made in this agreement, we commit to oppose the \n     rules changes in the 109th Congress, which we understand to \n     be any amendment to or interpretation of the Rules of the \n     Senate that Would force a vote on a judicial nomination by \n     means other than unanimous consent or Rule XXII,\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n       We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the \n     traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators \n     seek to uphold.\n         Ben Nelson, Mike DeWine, Joe Lieberman, Susan Collins, \n           Mark Pryor, Lindsey Graham, Lincoln Chafee, John \n           McCain, John Warner, Robert Byrd, Mary Landrieu, \n           Olympia Snowe, Ken Salazar, Daniel Inouye.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2006.\n     Hon.

For the reasons set forth below, we believe that Mr. \n     Keisler should under no circumstances be considered--much \n     less confirmed--by this Committee before we first address the \n     very need for that judgeship, receive and review necessary \n     information about the nominee, and deal with the genuine \n     judicial emergencies identified by the Judicial Conference.\n       First, the Committee should, before turning to the \n     nomination itself, hold a hearing on the necessity of filling \n     the 11th seat on the D.C. Circuit, to which Mr. Keisler has \n     been nominated. There has long been concern--much of it \n     expressed by Republican Members--that the D.C. Circuit's \n     workload does not warrant more than 10 active judges. As you \n     may recall, in years past, a number of Senators, including \n     several who still sit on this Committee, have vehemently \n     opposed the filling of the 11th and 12th seats on that court:\n       Senator Sessions: ``[The eleventh] judgeship, more than any \n     other judgeship in America, is not needed.'' (1997)\n       Senator Grassley: ``I can confidently conclude that the \n     D.C. Circuit does not need 12 judges or even 11 judges.'' \n     (1997)\n       Senator Kyl: ``If . . . another vacancy occurs, thereby \n     opening up the 11th seat again, I plan to vote against \n     filling the seat--and, of course, the 12th seat--unless there \n     is a significant increase in the caseload or some other \n     extraordinary circumstance.'' (1997)\n       More recently, at a hearing on the D.C. Circuit, Senator \n     Sessions, citing the Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit, \n     reaffirmed his view that there was no need to fill the 11th \n     seat: ``I thought ten was too many . . . I will oppose going \n     above ten unless the caseload is up.'' (2002)\n       In addition, these and other Senators expressed great \n     reluctance to spend the estimated $1 million per year in \n     taxpayer funds to finance a judgeship that could not be \n     justified based on the workload. Indeed, Senator Sessions \n     even suggested that filling the 11th seat would be ``an \n     unjust burden on the taxpayers of America.''\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\n       Since these emphatic objections were raised in 1997, by \n     every relevant benchmark, the caseload for that circuit has \n     only dropped further. According to the Administrative Office \n     of the United States Courts, the Circuit's caseload, as \n     measured by written decisions per active judge, has declined \n     17 percent since 1997; as measured by number of appeals \n     resolved on the merits per active judge, it declined by 21 \n     percent; and as measured by total number of appeals filed, it \n     declined by 10 percent. Accordingly, before we rush to \n     consider Mr. Keisler's nomination, we should look closely--as \n     we did in 2002--at whether there is even a need for this seat \n     to be filled and at what expense to the taxpayer.\n       Second, given how quickly the Keisler hearing was scheduled \n     (he was nominated only 28 days ago), the American Bar \n     Association has not yet even completed its evaluation of this \n     nominee. We should not be scheduling hearings for nominees \n     before the Committee has received their ABA ratings. \n     Moreover, in connection with the most recent judicial \n     nominees who, like Mr. Keisler, served in past \n     administrations, Senators appropriately sought and received \n     publicly available documents relevant to their government \n     service. Everyone, we believe, benefited from the review of \n     that material, which assisted Senators in fulfilling their \n     responsibilities of advice and consent. Similarly, the \n     Committee should have the benefit of publicly available \n     information relevant to Mr. Keisler's tenure in the Reagan \n     Administration, some of which may take some time to procure \n     from, among other places, the Reagan Library. As Senator \n     Frist said in an interview on Tuesday, ``[T]he DC Circuit . . \n     . after the Supreme Court is the next court in terms of \n     hierarchy, in terms of responsibility, interpretation, and in \n     terms of prioritization.'' We should therefore perform our \n     due diligence before awarding a lifetime appointment to this \n     uniquely important court.\n       Finally, given the questionable need to fill the 11th seat, \n     we believe that Mr. Keisler should not jump ahead of those \n     who have been nominated for vacant seats identified as \n     judicial emergencies by the non-partisan Judicial Conference. \n     Indeed, every other Circuit Court nominee awaiting a hearing \n     in the Committee, save one, has been selected for a vacancy \n     that has been deemed a ``judicial emergency.'' We should turn \n     to those nominees first; emergency vacancies should clearly \n     take priority over a possibly superfluous one.\n       Given the singular importance of the D.C. Circuit, we \n     should not proceed hastily and without full information. Only \n     after we reassess the need to fill this seat, perform \n     reasonable due diligence on the nominee, and tend to actual \n     judicial emergencies, should we hold a hearing on Mr. \n     Keisler's nomination.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this unanimous \n     request of Democratic Senators.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, Charles Schumer, Russell Feingold, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Herb Kohl, Edward Kennedy, Richard Durbin, \n           Joe Biden.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe bill that has been before us for the last week and a half or so to \nfix our broken immigration system.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this bill has been the product of \nbipartisan work both in the so-called Gang of 8, which I have the \nprivilege to be a part of, as well as in the Judiciary Committee where \nthey ran a process that set a standard for the way this place ought to \noperate. We considered over 300 amendments in the Judiciary Committee, \naccepting 141 amendments, many of them from Republicans and Democrats \nalike. Now we are on the floor.\n  Those who want to delay immigration reform, who want to defeat \nimmigration reform, are using every tactic they can find to try to stop \nthis bill. But, fortunately, there are other people of goodwill on both \nsides of the aisle who are trying to come to an agreement.\n  We focused a lot in the last week, as we should, talking about the \nborder. I spoke about the progress we have already made in securing our \nsouthern border. There is more to do. There is progress that is \nreflected in the underlying bill, and if that can be improved in a way \nthat does not make the pathway to citizenship contingent or unreal, I \nthink there are those of us who are willing to hear what that looks \nlike.\n  What we have not spent time on is actually what people in Colorado \nhave spent their time on when it comes to the question of fixing our \nbroken immigration system, which is the way the current system defeats \nthem in their efforts to build their businesses in this economy and the \npromise that could be achieved if we actually were able to pass this \nbill as it has been written. I have heard from people from every walk \nof life across the State of Colorado who have been hurt by our outdated \nand unreasonable and unimaginative and un-American immigration laws. \nThey understand in their gut the velocity we can add to the economy by \nfixing the system, if Washington would just do its work. They include \nhigh-tech companies on the Front Range including the bioscience, \nengineering, and aerospace industries, among others. One of those \ncompanies, Newsgator, an innovative social media software company based \nin Denver, makes a compelling case. Its chairman and founding CEO J.B. \nHolston told our office:\n\n       I have been watching the immigration debate closely because \n     my company relies on high-skilled technology workers. In the \n     21st century global economy, we are in an arms race--\n\n  we are in an arms race--\n\n     for recruiting, attracting, and retaining the world's best \n     and brightest. Our current immigration system is a barrier to \n     American businesses winning that race.\n       Stalled progress on immigration also sidelines growth \n     capital for U.S. high tech companies. That's a toxic \n     combination for growth.\n       The proposed immigration overhaul bill is a great step \n     forward.\n\n  It is not only the high-tech sector feeling these pain points. \nFarmers, including peach growers on the western slope, cattle ranchers \non the eastern plains, and onion growers in the northern part of our \nState, and tourism and the ski industry across Colorado are feeling it \nas well, and DREAMers from the Denver public school system and other \nschool districts, rural and urban, struggling to go to college and work \ntoward a career because of their legal status.\n  We made a commitment when we set out as the Gang of 8, Democrats and \nRepublicans working together, that our legislation would be deficit \nneutral, that it wouldn't add one dime--not one dollar--to our deficit. \nThat was an important principle for the members of this group because, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, we face significant deficits, \nsignificant national debt.\n  Yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office not only \naffirmed the stories I am hearing from my tech community and my \nagricultural community and from businesses all across the State about \neconomic growth, it also had some incredible news with respect to our \ndeficit. CBO estimates if we pass this bill, we will reduce the deficit \nby almost $200 billion in the first decade and almost $700 billion in \nthe second decade--almost $1 trillion. Even in Washington, DC, that is \nreal money. There will be almost $1 trillion of deficit reduction over \nthe next two decades as a consequence of this bill.\n  So let's break down what the CBO is saying. This bill will increase \nemployment and jobs in the country. More workers will come here. More \npeople will build businesses here. They will consume more and invest \nmore. This will spur economic growth.\n  These are not my opinions. These are not the opinions of the Gang of \n8, although we share these opinions. These are the opinions of the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as a result of reading this \nbill.\n  Our bill also allows millions of Americans who are currently \nundocumented to step out of the shadows of a cash economy and start \ncontributing more to our economy as they earn more.\n  When you crunch the numbers, based on the Congressional Budget Office \nscore, this bill will significantly increase our gross domestic \nproduct, adjusted for inflation, and reduce deficits.\n  The CBO found that projected deficits will decline significantly over \nthe next decade as a consequence of this legislation.\n  Every year, from 2015 on, they expect deficits to go down. It is \ngoing to end up, as I said earlier, saving us $197 billion between now \nand 2023.\n  It turns out that based on this estimate, we will only begin to see \nthe benefits of this bill in the first decade. The economic benefits of \nthis bill actually accelerate in the second decade. From\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\n2024 to 2033 the bill would reduce deficits by $690 billion.\n  I realize we have gotten in the habit around this place of thinking \nin 30-day increments or 60-day increments. It is driving folks at home \ncrazy. This is a chance for us to reset for the 21st century.\n  The CBO has done the math. What that math tells you--despite what \nother people who do not want to have immigration reform for whatever \nreason have said, who claim that this is going to drive our deficits \nthrough the roof--that math tells us we have a total of $887 billion in \ndeficit reduction over the next 20 years.\n  Here is a surprising fact that is buried in the Congressional Budget \nOffice report: Those deficit-reduction estimates are actually \nconservative. CBO is only counting the most obvious savings in their \nestimate. It is not including other more indirect economic benefits--\nsuch as increased productivity--that will likely yield additional \nsavings.\n  Here is what CBO actually says in its report. This is a direct quote:\n\n       According to CBO's central estimates (within a range that \n     reflects the uncertainty about two key economic relationships \n     in CBO's analysis), the economic impacts not included in the \n     cost estimate would have no further net effect on budget \n     deficits over the 2014-2023 period and would further reduce \n     deficits (relative to the effects reported in the cost \n     estimate) by about $300 billion over the 2024-2033 period.\n\n  Let me put that another way. The CBO is saying this bill could \nactually, when you factor in the economic effects, reduce deficits by \n$300 billion more in the second decade than it actually projects in the \ncost estimates.\n  One way or another, we are either just below or just above $1 \ntrillion, and that is real money, particularly in light of the \nsequester--the law we had written to be so terrible and so ugly it \nwould never, ever go into effect, but now is the law of the land. What \na more destructive way to get $1 trillion in savings than a bunch of \nautomatic, across-the-board cuts. In fact, the prominent conservative \neconomist Doug Holtz-Eakin said a few months ago that he thought, using \na dynamic scoring model, the immigration bill could reduce deficits by \neven more--shaving as much as $2.7 trillion off our deficits.\n  So until yesterday we had not heard what this nonpartisan group, the \nCongressional Budget Office, had to say about this immigration bill. \nBut it supports what we have already heard from businesses at home, our \nindustry leaders across the country, and economists no matter what \npolitical stripe they are, that fixing our immigration system is going \nto help strengthen our economy. We know it will secure our borders. We \nknow it will reunite families. And we know it will bring people who \ncame to this country for a better life a chance to come out of the \nshadows and contribute to our democracy and contribute to our economy \nin the 21st century, as they did in the 20th century and as they did in \nthe 19th century before that.\n  What we have not heard is a convincing case to maintain the status \nquo that is holding back our economy, that is keeping unresolved the \nquestion about what to do with the 11 million people who are living in \nour shadow economy, and what we are to do to reinvite talented people \nfrom around the world to make their best contribution in America. That \nis what this bill represents. This bill is a reaffirmation of the idea \nthat we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. The Senate \nshould pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Froman Nomination\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about trade \nagreements and the impact they have on our economy. Trade agreements \naffect access to foreign markets and our level of imports and exports. \nThey also affect a wide variety of public policy issues--everything \nfrom wages, jobs, the environment, and the Internet, to monetary \npolicy, pharmaceuticals, and financial services.\n  Many people are deeply interested in tracking the trajectory of trade \nnegotiations, but if they do not have reasonable access to see the \nterms of the agreements under negotiation, then they do not have any \nreal input. Without transparency, the benefits of an open marketplace \nof ideas are reduced enormously.\n  I am deeply concerned about the transparency record of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and with one ongoing trade agreement in particular: the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership. For months, the Trade Representative, who \nnegotiates on our behalf, has been unwilling to provide any public \naccess to the composite bracketed text relating to the negotiations. \nThe composite bracketed text includes proposed language from the United \nStates and also from other countries, and it serves as the focal point \nfor negotiations. The Trade Representative has allowed Members of \nCongress to access the text, and I appreciate that, but there is no \nsubstitute for public transparency.\n  I have heard the argument that transparency would undermine the Trade \nRepresentative's policy to complete the trade agreement because public \nopposition would be significant. In other words, if people knew what \nwas going on, they would stop it. This argument is exactly backward. If \ntransparency would lead to widespread public opposition to a trade \nagreement, then that trade agreement should not be the policy of the \nUnited States.\n  I believe in transparency and democracy, and I think the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative should too. So I asked the President's nominee to be \nTrade Representative Michael Froman three questions: The first: Would \nhe commit to releasing the composite bracketed text. The second: If \nnot, would he commit to releasing a scrubbed version of the bracketed \ntext that made anonymous which country proposed which provision. And I \nwant to note that even the Bush administration put out a scrubbed \nversion during the negotiations around the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas agreement. Third, I asked Mr. Froman if he would provide more \ntransparency behind what information is made available to outside \nadvisers. Currently, there are about 600 outside advisers who have \naccess to sensitive information, and the roster includes a wide \ndiversity of industry representatives and some from labor and some from \nNGOs. But there is no transparency around who gets what information or \nwhether they are all getting the same things, and I think that is a \nreal problem.\n  Mr. Froman's response to my three questions was clear: no, no, and \nno. He will not commit to making this information public so that the \npublic can track what is going on.\n  So I am voting against Mr. Froman's nomination later today because I \nbelieve we need a new direction from the Trade Representative--a \ndirection that prioritizes transparency and public debate. The American \npeople have the right to know more about our negotiations that will \nhave a dramatic impact on our working men and women, on our \nenvironment, on our economy, on the Internet.\n  We should have a serious conversation about our trade policies \nbecause these issues matter. But it all starts with the transparency of \nthe U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to speak for a few minutes on \nthe progress we are making on the immigration bill. In speaking about \nthe progress, it also gives me a chance to say to my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle that I hope we can get an agreement to vote on \namendments this afternoon, because it is not only Democrats who want \namendments, we have got a lot of Republicans who want to put up some \namendments. If we can get this tranche of amendments out of the way, \nthen that gives us a chance to put up another tranche of 8 to 10 \namendments is what I think we have the possibility of doing.\n  We have been on this bill for 1 week. We had one vote last week. That \nwas on my own amendment. That dealt with border security. Of course, \nthat vote was not a vote up or down on the amendment, it was a vote to \ntable. We were refused by the majority to have\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nan up-or-down vote on legislation that is part of the legislation that \nis some of the most important to the people of this country, securing \nthe border before we have legalization. I quoted yesterday a CNN poll \nthat said 60 percent of the people say border security is the No. 1 \nissue as far as immigration is concerned. It is a necessary predecessor \nto legalization.\n  Yesterday we had three votes. Unfortunately, they were 60-vote \nthresholds. Obviously, most of the time you have a 60-vote threshold, \nit is set up so that any amendment under that rule would fail. \nYesterday the majority leader threatened again to keep us working all \nweekend. He stated he could file a cloture motion to cut off debate as \nearly as Friday. Of course, I hope that is not the case, because we \nneed an open and fair amendment process. We do immigration reform about \nonce every 25 years. My colleagues hear me say we made a lot of \nmistakes in 1986. That is the last time we had a major immigration bill \npass the Senate. So we need to get it right. People do not want us to \ndo it in a fast and haphazard way. People want us to be very cautious \nabout something you do once every 25 years.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I had a very good working \nrelationship in committee. We still have a good working relationship \nwith this bill out here on the floor of the Senate. But there are 98 \nother Senators involved. In committee it is a different situation than \non the Senate floor. In committee, we did not limit the ability of any \nMember to raise an amendment. We had some tough votes we were all \nforced to take in committee.\n  But now there are other Members who want their chance to improve the \nbill. Of course, I said at the beginning of my remarks if we get these \neight amendments out of the way that are in this tranche, then we can \nbring other amendments up, both Republican and Democratic amendments.\n  I realize there is a bipartisan group of Senators working on a border \nsecurity amendment. This is supposed to be some grand compromise. The \ngroup is trying to find common ground somewhere between the bill as \ndrafted, 1,075 pages in that bill as drafted, and the Cornyn \namendment--middle ground.\n  At this point I am hearing from the other side as well as the Group \nof 8 that they think the Cornyn amendment goes too far. Some would say \nthe Democrats will not negotiate in good faith because they have the \nvotes to pass the bill as is. It is no secret the Democrats wish to \nhave 70 votes at the end of the day. But even with 70 votes, in my \nview, that is not a big victory and may very well be a failure. It \nshould not take much to get 15 Republican votes. It does not guarantee \nthe House will take up the bill. In fact, this bill may be dead on \narrival in the other body since they have their own approach and they \nhave their own ideas.\n  It was reported today that this bipartisan group of Senators trying \nto find middle ground between this big bill and the Cornyn amendment on \nborder security are having trouble finding that consensus. They are \nhaving trouble because the Democrats do not want any triggers or \nroadblocks to legalization. That is clear. In other words, some people \nare not willing to learn from the mistakes we made in 1986. We thought \nin good faith we were writing a piece of legislation that would stop \npeople crossing the border without papers. We did that by making it \nillegal for the first time to hire undocumented workers. We did it by \nadding a $10,000 fine. So take away the magnet to work, the border is \nsecure, legalize 3 million people at that time.\n  We found that legalizing illegality brings yet more illegality. So \nnow there are 12 million people who either overstayed a visa or crossed \nthe border without papers. We should learn from that mistake of 25 \nyears ago, the last time an immigration bill was up. We should do \nsomething about border security. That something has to be stronger than \nwhat is in this piece of legislation. But it is apparent to me--I hear \nrumors that a lot of people on the other side of the aisle do not want \nany triggers or roadblocks to legalization. That is not saying you do \nnot want legalization, that is only saying certain preconditions ought \nto happen before there is legalization. Those ought to be meaningful \nsteps to take.\n  Yesterday the majority leader, as I said, said he was not in favor of \ntriggers. Secretary Napolitano in this administration made it clear \nlegalization should come first and triggers should not be a roadblock \nto legalization, the very same mistakes we made in 1986.\n  The group negotiating this broader amendment is trying to do the \nright thing, but I have real doubts that the other side of the aisle \nwants to do anything to secure the border. Because of this, the \nmisguided, mislabeled bill before us could be falling apart. Those of \nus who question this big government bill appear to be making headway in \nexposing the bill for what it truly is, legalization first, enforcement \nlater. Despite repeated promises, it is that, legalization first, \nborder security when? Sometime down the road. Sometime never happens.\n  Sure, the proponents can throw money and dictate how many cameras and \ndrones to buy, but that does not mean the border will be stronger or \nmore secure. We need to do more than give them the capability of \nachieving specific metrics. We need them to prove their success.\n  One more thing on the possibility of working this weekend. Since I \nhave been in the Senate, we have had a lot of weekend sessions. \nGenerally what happens is you have a lot of debate and a lot of talk \nand a lot of wasted time on Saturdays. You have one vote at 2 o'clock \non Sunday. For a guy like me, I am going to be here regardless, not \nbecause I am manager of this bill solely, but I have not missed a vote \nin the Senate since July 1993. I have cast about 6,700 votes without \nmissing a vote. If there is only one vote Sunday afternoon I am going \nto be here. But I would suggest if we are going to have a weekend \nsession, that action be taken to make sure we are actually doing \nsomething and voting, that if we are going to be in session, that there \nis not some sort of accommodation made, usually for the majority party \nand sometimes the Republican Party, but right now it is the Democratic \nParty to make a provision so people who want to fly home can do it. \nEither we are here to work on the weekend or we should not be here.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senate Democrats have come to the floor \nnow 13 times and requested unanimous consent to move to bipartisan \nbudget negotiations with the House. We are ready to get to work. We \nhave been ready for 88 days now, which is how long it has been since \nthe Senate passed a budget.\n  Back in March we assumed that once the two Chambers passed their \nbudgets, Republicans would be eager to join us in a formal budget \nconference, since they have spent years talking about the need to \nreturn to regular order. Instead, we have seen delay after delay. Now \nthat Republicans have gotten exactly what they wished for, they seem to \nbe running as quickly as they can in the other direction, and they have \noffered excuse after excuse after excuse.\n  First, they said they wanted a framework before they would start a \nconference, even though a framework is exactly what a budget is. In \nother words, they wanted to negotiate behind closed doors when we \nshould be negotiating in a conference.\n  Then they said they wouldn't allow us to go to conference unless we \nguaranteed the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations would be \nprotected from paying a penny more in taxes.\n  Then many Republicans indicated they didn't want negotiations \nhappening too early, to take away the leverage they think they have on \nthe debt ceiling.\n  Then some of them called for a do-over of the budget debate, \nincluding another 50 hours of debate and a whole new round of unlimited \namendments, even after they praised the open and thorough floor debate \nwe had on the Senate budget.\n  Now, in what seems to be the latest delaying tactic, some Republicans \nare\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\nsaying before we can work to solve short-term problems we first need to \nagree on the budget outlook 30 years down the road.\n  Enough is enough. The American people are sick and tired of the \nconstant lurching from crisis to crisis. They are looking to their \nelected officials to come together, to compromise, to find common \nground, and that is exactly what we would be doing in a conference.\n  It is not just Democrats saying so. Over the past few weeks, we have \nheard a number of Republicans step forward and agree with us that the \ntea party and Senate Republican leadership are wrong. Senator Coburn \nsaid blocking conference is ``not a good position to be in.'' Senator \nBoozman said he would ``very much like to see a conference.'' Senator \nWicker said, weeks ago now, that ``by the end of next week, we probably \nshould be ready to go to conference.'' Now, according to Politico, \n``more Republicans appear to favor heading to conference than blocking \nit.''\n  As many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said, it \nis certainly true there are big differences between the parties' budget \nvalues, and priorities, but that would give us all the more reason to \nsit down and try to find some common ground. The fact is we have a lot \nof work that needs to be done in the next few weeks. We have 11 days \nuntil the next State work period and then just 3\\1/2\\ weeks before we \nall go back to our home States again for August. Because some \nRepublicans want to continue the harmful austerity measures resulting \nfrom sequestration, we now have a $91 billion gap between the House and \nSenate spending bills for the next fiscal year.\n  If we don't reconcile those differences, we are going to find \nourselves in a very tough, bad situation come September, and a lot of \nhard-working families and communities are going to feel the \nconsequences. It does not have to be that way. I am confident, if both \nsides come together now in a conference committee and are ready to \ncompromise, we can find a way to reach a fair and bipartisan and \nresponsible agreement.\n  The American people shouldn't have to worry the government is going \nto lurch into another crisis that has been manufactured by this \nCongress. It doesn't have to happen. Instead of fighting over whether \nwe should be engaging in bipartisan talks, we should be working \ntogether to get more Americans back to work, to protect our economic \nrecovery, and lay the foundation for strong middle-class growth in the \nfuture. I think we can all agree on those important goals, and they are \nvery urgent ones. But we cannot move forward on them if we are consumed \nwith constant artificial crises.\n  I believe it is time for Senate Republican leaders to listen to the \nmany Members of their own party who prefer commonsense bipartisanship \nover delay and disorder and allow the House and Senate to begin a \nbipartisan budget conference. I am here this afternoon to ask unanimous \nconsent to do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment which is at the \ndesk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the \nSenate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, \nbe agreed to; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate; that following the authorization, two motions to instruct \nconferees be in order from each side, a motion to instruct relative to \nthe debt limit and a motion to instruct relative to taxes and revenue; \nthat there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees prior to votes in relation to the motions; further, \nthat no amendments be in order to either of the motions prior to the \nvotes; all of the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I hope \nI am not going to have to object, but I wish to suggest a very modest \nand sensible alteration to the UC request from my colleague, the chair \nof the Budget Committee, so hopefully we can get on to this because I \nwould like to see us go to conference.\n  I was very critical of the 3 years when my Democratic colleagues \nabsolutely refused to do a budget. It is progress that this year they \ndecided to do one. I am glad. I am on the Budget Committee. I think we \nought to have a budget, and I think we should go to the conference \ncommittee, despite the fact we are very far apart.\n  My Democratic friends supported and voted for a budget with at least \n$1 trillion of new tax increases, and I strongly oppose that. But I \nagree that is what ought to be discussed in conference. The budget that \nwas passed uses the big tax increase that was in the budget for \nadditional spending. I strongly disagree with that. But again, that is \nexactly the kind of thing that ought to be the subject of negotiations \nin a conference. We are very far apart. I don't know whether we can \nnarrow that gap, but we should try.\n\n  The only reason I have been objecting, and that some of my colleagues \nhave been objecting thus far, is that our Democratic friends want to \ninsist on retaining the opportunity to use the conference report on a \nbudget resolution to raise the debt ceiling, and I would point out the \ndebt ceiling issue was not even contemplated in the Senate budget \nresolution. It never came up, it wasn't discussed, there was no \namendment, there was no vote, and it is not in the document. In the \nHouse budget, the debt limit increase is not contemplated. It is not \nthere. It wasn't voted on. It is completely absent.\n  So consistent with the rules of the Senate, I would simply suggest we \ngo right ahead to conference, that we have a conference on the budget \nbut that we follow the normal procedure of the Senate, which is that \nmatters that are not in either bill, either the House or Senate bill, \nbe excluded from consideration in a conference report so we don't \nairdrop in some extraneous unrelated matter that was never contemplated \nby either body.\n  I think that is the sensible approach and necessary because the debt \nlimit is a very important issue. We have a staggering amount of debt we \nhave allowed to accumulate. It is already damaging our economy and is a \nhuge threat and we know the President and many of our Democratic \nfriends think we should just raise that debt ceiling with no strings, \nno conditions, no reforms. So we have a very real concern this \nconference committee, as contemplated by my friends on the other side, \nwould be a vehicle for the backroom deal that would allow them to \nexclude Republicans and come back and jam through a debt ceiling \nincrease with no reforms.\n  In order to avoid that, but so we can go to conference, which I think \nwe should do, I would simply ask that we modify the unanimous consent \nrequest as follows; so it would not be in order for the Senate to \nconsider a conference report that includes reconciliation instructions \nto raise the debt limit.\n  If the chair of the Budget Committee would agree to that modification \nof her unanimous consent request, then I would agree to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to point out to everyone \nthat we had hours and hours of debate, with over 100 amendments \noffered, and no one offered an amendment on the debt ceiling limit. As \npart of the agreement in order to go to conference, we have offered to \nhave a vote now on whether we should have motions to instruct. I would \nbe willing, as chair, to abide by that vote once our unanimous consent \nis agreed to.\n  But I have to say, as a matter of principle, for a chair of any \ncommittee to say, once we have gone through hundreds of hours of debate \nand a lot of amendments, that then, before we go to conference, we have \nto agree to a principle that has not been voted on or offered in the \nSenate as part of that is not how we can proceed in this body. It would \nbe the same as if I would come out and say: I am not going to allow us \nto go to conference on whatever bill because I have a small provision, \nand unless you absolutely agree it has to be in there, even though I \ndon't have the votes, we are not going to conference. We would never \nget anything done.\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\n  The unanimous consent request I have offered allows my Republican \nfriends to have a vote on this, even though they didn't ask for a vote \nin all those hours of debate and hundreds of hours we spent on this \nissue, before we move to conference. The principle is this: Our \nRepublican colleagues wish to have an open debate, they say, but we are \nnot having an open debate because of their insistence we don't go to \nconference.\n  So I object to the Senator's request and again renew my request as I \nstated before with the provision we have a motion to instruct and allow \nthose Senators who have strong feelings about this to vote on it before \nwe go to conference.\n  Finally, I would add, remember with whom I am going to conference: \nRepublicans and Democrats from our side and Republicans and Democrats \nfrom the other body, a majority of whom are on their side of the aisle, \nwith the chairman, Paul Ryan, a Republican conservative, chairing their \nside.\n  This is an issue that is going to have plenty of debate, plenty of \nopen discussion, if it should come up, and we will all have an \nopportunity to vote on it.\n  I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nwrap up quickly. I thank my colleague, the chair of the Budget \nCommittee, but as she knows--and I wish to make sure everyone is \nclear--the motion to instruct conferees the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is recommending is completely nonbinding. It is nothing more \nthan a recommendation. The fact remains she is insisting on retaining \nthe ability to do a backroom deal that would raise the debt ceiling \nwithout allowing any Republican input in this body whatsoever. This is \na very bad policy. It was not contemplated in either bill.\n  I would be delighted to go to conference with a budget resolution \nfrom the House and the Senate that does contemplate everything that is \nin those two respective agreements but not some extraneous matter that \ncould be very damaging to our economy that was never contemplated. So I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1200, as Modified\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1200, which is \ncosponsored by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Roy Blunt, with a \nmodification at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul], for himself and Mr. \n     Blunt, proposes an amendment numbered 1200, as modified.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for enhanced border security, including strong \nborder security metrics and congressional votes on border security and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n                CHAPTER __--BORDER SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS\n\n     SEC. 1__1.

ONE HUNDRED PERCENT EXIT TRACKING FOR ALL UNITED \n                   STATES VISITORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the United States will \n     continue its progress toward full biometric entry-exit \n     capture capability at land, air, and sea points of entry.\n       (2) No capability exists to fully track whether non-United \n     States persons in the United States on a temporary basis have \n     exited the country consistent with the terms of their visa, \n     whether by land, sea, or air.\n       (3) No program exists along the Southwest border to track \n     land exits from the United States into Mexico.\n       (4) Without the ability to capture the full cycle of an \n     alien's trip into and out of the United States, it is \n     possible for persons to remain in the United States \n     unlawfully for years without detection by U.S. Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement.\n       (5) Because there is no exit tracking capability, there is \n     insufficient data for an official assessment of the number of \n     persons who have overstayed a visa and that remain in the \n     United States. Studies have estimated that as many as 40 \n     percent of all persons in the United States without lawful \n     immigration status entered the country legally and did not \n     return to their country of origin or follow the terms of \n     their entry.\n       (6) Despite a legal mandate to track alien exits, more than \n     a decade without any significant capability to do so has--\n       (A) degraded the Federal Government's ability to enforce \n     immigration laws;\n       (B) placed a greater strain on law enforcement resources; \n     and\n       (C) undermined the legal immigration process in the United \n     States.\n       (b) Requirement for Outbound Travel Document Capture at \n     Land Points of Entry.--\n       (1) Outbound travel document capture at foot crossings.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory exit data system for all outbound lanes at each \n     land point of entry along the Southern border that is only \n     accessible to individuals on foot or by nonmotorized means.\n       (B) Data collection requirements.--The system established \n     under subparagraph (A) shall require the collection of data \n     from machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents for all categories of aliens who are exiting \n     the United States through an outbound lane described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Outbound travel document capture at all other land \n     points of entry.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory exit data system at all outbound lanes not subject \n     to paragraph (1) at each land point of entry along the \n     Southern border.\n       (B) Data collection requirements.--The system established \n     under subparagraph (A) shall require the collection of data \n     from machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents for all categories of aliens who are exiting \n     the United States through an outbound lane described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Information required for collection.--While collecting \n     information under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall \n     collect identity-theft resistant departure information from \n     the machine-readable visas, passports, and other travel and \n     entry documents.\n       (4) Recording of exits and correlation to entry data.--The \n     Secretary shall integrate the records collected under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) into the interoperable data system \n     established under section 3303(b) and any other database \n     necessary to correlate an alien's entry and exit data.\n       (5) Processing of records.--Before the departure of \n     outbound aliens at each point of entry, the Secretary shall \n     provide for cross-reference capability between databases \n     designated by the Secretary under paragraph (4) to determine \n     and record whether an outbound alien has been in the United \n     States without lawful immigration status.\n       (6) Records inclusion requirements.--The Secretary shall \n     maintain readily accessible entry-exit data records for \n     immigration and other law enforcement and improve immigration \n     control and enforcement by including information necessary to \n     determine whether an outbound alien without lawful presence \n     in the United States entered the country through--\n       (A) unauthorized entry between points of entry;\n       (B) visa or other temporary authorized status;\n       (C) fraudulent travel documents;\n       (D) misrepresentation of identity; or\n       (E) any other method of entry.\n       (7) Prohibition on collecting exit records for united \n     states citizens.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--While documenting the departure of \n     outbound individuals at each point of entry along the \n     Southern border, the Secretary may not--\n       (i) process travel documents of United States citizens;\n       (ii) log, store, or transfer exit data for United States \n     citizens;\n       (iii) create, maintain, operate, access, or support any \n     database containing information collected through outbound \n     processing at a point of entry under paragraph (1) or (2) \n     that contains records identifiable to an individual United \n     States citizen.\n       (B) Exception.--The prohibition set forth in subparagraph \n     (A) does not apply to the records of an individual if an \n     officer processing travel documentation in the outbound lanes \n     at a point of entry along the Southern border--\n       (i) has a strong suspicion that the individual has engaged \n     in criminal or other prohibited activities;

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my amendment, \nwhich we have entitled ``Trust But Verify.''\n  I am in full support of immigration reform, as are most Members of \nthis body and most Americans. But part of that reform must be that we \ninsist on border security.\n  Recently the authors of the current bill made clear that legalization \nwill not be made contingent on border security. Most conservatives such \nas myself believe just the opposite, that legalization or documentation \nof workers absolutely must depend on border security first. My \namendment does that. Trust But Verify makes documentation of \nundocumented workers contingent on border security.\n  I believe the American people should not rely on bureaucrats or a \ncommission to enforce border security. We have been promised security \nin the past and it never happens. My amendment is different than any \nother amendment because I want Congress to institute border security, \nnot wait for a plan from the administration.\n  With Trust But Verify Congress will vote every year for 5 years on \nwhether the border is secure. The power to enforce border security will \nbe in our hands, the people's representatives, and it is Congress that \nwill be held accountable if we fail. If Congress believes the border is \nnot secure, then the processing of the undocumented workers stops until \nthe border becomes secure.\n  To be clear, my amendment doesn't replace any triggers of the \nunderlying bill. It simply adds new conditions to build on border \nsecurity measures that are already in the bill. The only way to put \nreal pressure on the Department of Homeland Security is to have tough \ntriggers that ensure that the border is secure before immigration \nreform can proceed.\n  My amendment is entitled ``Trust But Verify.'' My amendment \nlegislates exactly how we secure the border. The current bill merely \nrequests a plan to secure the border. My amendment requires 100 percent \nborder surveillance capability, a 95-percent apprehension rate, and a \ncompletion of a double-layered fence. Instead of having a plan to build \na fence, we just tell them: Build the fence. We monitor the building of \nthe fence as it progresses, and we make these triggers transparent to \nthe public.\n  This amendment also would end the practice of releasing people who \nare caught crossing the border. Ninety-five percent of the people \ncaught are released and they never come back--they go to the interior \nof the country.\n  Legalization of undocumented workers is allowed to commence after 1 \nyear if Congress agrees that the border is secure. The resolution would \nbe simple and would simply state every year: It is the sense of \nCongress that the U.S. border is increasingly secure. And Congress will \ndetermine if the Department of Homeland Security has met the goals \nCongress has written into law.\n  My amendment mandates that 100 percent exit tracking for U.S. \nvisitors is accomplished through all portals--air, land, and water. One \nof the biggest problems our Nation is experiencing is that individuals \nhere on temporary visas tend to overstay, and some never exit the \ncountry. My amendment solves this problem.\n  My amendment also has two important national security elements. One \nprovision sets up a student visa national security registration system \nas a means to track young men and women who come to this country on \nstudent visas. Also, individuals here under asylum or refugee status \nmust register in a program providing increased screening and a means to \nmake sure the Federal Government has an idea of where people in these \nprograms reside.\n  We should remember that most of the 9/11 hijackers were here on \nstudent visas and were not being properly monitored. And I still don't \nthink that problem has been fixed.\n  This amendment is fully paid for by taking funds that would have gone \ntoward this commission. We will not need a commission because we are \nactually going to put border security in the bill, and it requires no \nadditional funding. If my amendment is implemented, there will not be a \nneed for this commission.\n  One big problem with immigration reform is the dire need to reform \nour immigration court system. My amendment empowers immigration judges \nto have the power to implement orders. Judges make decisions and then \nno one will carry out the orders. It is a completely broken system. \nBoth the left and the right agree we need to fix the immigration court \nsystem. This amendment would do it. My amendment would convert our \ncourts from administrative courts to article I courts with enhanced \njurisdiction.\n  My amendment also protects the privacy of all Americans by placing in \nlaw protections against citizens being subject to invasive biometric \nidentification cards. Most Second Amendment supporters rightly see \nuniversal background checks as a step too far in invading citizens' \npersonal business. Any national ID, biometric or otherwise, raises the \nsame constitutional concerns.\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\n  Finally, my amendment does not allow the processing of this new \ncategory called registered provisional immigrants until Congress votes \nthat the border is secure. Then we limit the number to 2 million per \nyear, and each year we vote: Is the border more secure? If the border \nis not becoming more secure, the process stops until we agree the \nborder is secure. This will allow the Department of Homeland Security \nto do an effective job of conducting background checks on the estimated \n11 to 12 million people.\n  If Congress votes that the border is not secure, the processing of \npeople into this category stops. It will not start again until \nCongress, the Representatives of the people, believe that the border is \nsecure.\n  We desperately need immigration reform. If we don't have reform, I \nthink we will have another 10 million people come over in the next \ndecade. So something should be done, but it has to be done in a way \nthat fixes the system. This amendment will fix the system.\n  I ask my colleagues to support Senate amendment No. 1200, Trust But \nVerify.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1251\n\n  (Purpose: Requiring Enforcement, Security and safety while Upgrading \nLawful Trade and travel Simultaneously (RESULTS))\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments, and to call up my amendment No. 1251.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself, Mr. \n     Crapo, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n     Isakson, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burr, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. \n     Johanns, proposes an amendment numbered 1251.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, June 12, 2013, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have been working on immigration policy \nfor all the time I have been in the Senate, about 10 years now. So I \nhave some familiarity with the issues and the arguments that have been \nmade. It is always amazing to hear a lot of the same arguments being \nrepeated now that we have heard before in 2007 and before. But one of \nthe differences is we have 43 new Senators who weren't here in 2007, \nthe last time we had a major debate on immigration reform. So I think \nthe discussions have been useful and, hopefully, they will be \nproductive.\n  There is one obstacle, in my view, to immigration reform which is \nsomething I would like to see: When it comes to securing our borders \nand making sure that the flow of illegal immigration across our borders \nstops or gets as close as we can to zero, the Federal Government has \nzero credibility. The reason is simple. We have been making promises \nsince 1986 about border security enforcement.\n  Remember, 1986 was the year that Ronald Reagan--a model to \nRepublicans and conservatives--signed an amnesty for 3 million people, \npremised on the representation and the expectation that enforcement \nwould ensue and the problem would be solved. In other words, he and the \nAmerican people said: We will have a compassionate resolution of the \ncondition of the 3 million people who are here, but we want to make \nsure that the rule of law is restored and that we will not have to do \nthis again.\n  When the Gang of 8--the four Republicans and four Democrats who \nauthored the underlying bill--announced their product, I was hopeful \nthey would produce a bill with solid mechanisms for gaining secure \nborders. Unfortunately, the bill contains no guarantees or results, no \nreal trigger, only more promises reminiscent of 1986 and many years \nsubsequent.\n  In 1996, Bill Clinton signed a law saying we were going to implement \na biometric entry-exit system. When that didn't happen, after 2011 the \n9/11 Commission said one of the things we needed and was revealed as a \nvulnerability for national security was the absence of a biometric \nentry-exit system.\n  Despite the passage of all those years and the recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission, we still have not implemented a biometric entry-exit \nsystem. An entry system, yes, but exit, no. And 40 percent of illegal \nimmigration occurs as a result of the fact that people enter the \ncountry legally and don't leave when their visa expires.\n  So, unfortunately, this bill contains more hollow promises and no \nreal trigger. By that I mean a conditioning on the transfer to either \nprobationary status or to legal permanent residency based on hitting \nthe standards that are met in the underlying bill--100 percent \nsituational awareness, 90 percent apprehensions, which is defined in \nthe bill as operational control of the border.\n  The message is, again, we don't have any enforcement mechanism here. \nWe are going to put a lot of money and a lot of resources into this but \nwe cannot control what future administrations do. We know no current \nCongress can bind future Congresses. So these promises once again--I am \nvery concerned and I think the American people should be concerned--are \npromises only and not delivering the results that I think they insist \nupon before they will accept a resolution of the 11 million people in \ncompassionate terms.\n  But I do not think promises alone are good enough. You should not \ntake my word for it. You want to see, for example, what the \nCongressional Budget Office came out with yesterday. I think people \nwould be serious about serious solutions to illegal immigration, but \nthe Congressional Budget Office which--love them or hate them, agree or \ndisagree--is the gold standard that Congress is bound by when \nevaluating legislation. What they said is the number of new \nunauthorized immigrants in the United States by the year 2033 will go \nup. It will be 7.5 million people. If we did not pass any bill at all, \nit will be 10 million. That is what the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid. Those are not my figures, those are their figures. I think it is \nincumbent upon anybody who disagrees to challenge these figures, and so \nfar we have heard no challenge forthcoming.\n  Make no mistake, border security is not an alternative to immigration \nreform, it is a necessary complement to the sensible reforms that I \nthink a large majority of this Chamber could agree on, such as allowing \nthe United States to retain more highly skilled immigrants who get \nPh.D's and master's degrees at our colleges and universities in STEM \nfields--science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and the like.\n  I know there has been a fair amount of disinformation circulated \nabout the proposals in my RESULTS amendment, so let me explain what it \nactually does once more. My amendment requires the Federal Government \nto have 100-percent situational awareness on the border. With \ntechnology the American taxpayer has already paid for and which has \nbeen deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq and is owned by the Department of \nDefense, I am absolutely convinced we can get 100-percent situational \nawareness on the border. Senator McCain yesterday said he agreed with \nthat. He cited a letter, which I am sure we will see forthwith, by the \nhead of the Border Patrol who said that is attainable.\n  Senator Bennet of Colorado and Senator Flake of Arizona, two members \nof the Gang of 8, said they agree it is attainable. I think it is \nattainable. That is one requirement.\n  Second, my amendment requires full operational control of the border. \nThat does not mean 100-percent detention of people coming across. It \nmeans we have a deterrent effect by at least 90 percent of people \ncoming across being detained.\n  I have been in and around law enforcement most of my adult life. It \nis not just how many people we detain, it is the deterrent value of the \nknowledge of people who violate our laws that if they do so they will \nbe apprehended and they will receive the appropriate punishment. So the \ndeterrence factor is very important here. It is not just how\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nmany people you catch but there has to be some metric that can be \nobjectively measured.\n  Next--and I alluded to this a moment ago--there has to be a \nnationwide biometric entry-exit system. As I said, this has been the \nlaw since 1996 when Bill Clinton signed it into law. Yet it has never \nbeen implemented. What has been implemented is that when foreign \nnationals visit the United States they do have to give a set of \nfingerprints, but there is no complementary exit system to make sure \nthose same people leave the country when their visa expires--whether \nthey are a student or a tourist or a guest worker or something of the \nlike. Forty percent of our illegal immigration is people who enter \nlegally and simply do not leave when their visa expires. This biometric \nentry-exit system would allow us to identify them and then to allow the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nto do their job.\n  Fourth, my amendment requires nationwide E-Verify; in other words, a \nmeans not to make the employers the police to sort of sift through \ndocuments to try to figure out from your utility bill whether you \nactually are a legal resident of the United States and can qualify to \nwork, but actually an electronic system. All employees of the Federal \nGovernment, all of our employees in our Senate offices have to go \nthrough that anyway to make sure this is uniformly observed, so that \nthe economic magnet that attracts so much illegal immigration is \nremoved and only people who can legally work in the country are allowed \nto do so.\n  My amendment could have taken a much tougher position and said this \ntrigger must be met before people can progress or sign up for \nprobationary status. I voted for such an amendment, but knowing that \namendment would not pass the Senate I said the trigger ought to be \nbetween the probationary status and the time when people transition \nfrom probationary status to legal permanent residency. The whole \nrationale is not to be punitive, not to create an obstacle that cannot \nbe met, but to realign the incentives for the executive branch, the \nbureaucracy, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, conservatives, \nliberals to come together and say we are going to make sure this target \nis hit: 100-percent surveillance; 90-percent apprehensions or full \noperational control of the border; an E-Verify system; and a biometric \nentry-exit system.\n  Is it realistic to believe these goals can be met in the next decade? \nMany experts, including members of the Gang of 8, which I mentioned a \nmoment ago, believe it is. Some of those experts include people such as \nRobert Bonner, the former head of Customs and Border Protection; Asa \nHutchison, the former Under Secretary for Border & Transportation \nSecurity at the Department of Homeland Security, and as I mentioned, \nseveral of the Gang of 8--Senator Bennet of Colorado, Senator Flake of \nArizona, Senator McCain of Arizona--have all said they believe this \nrequirement of 100-percent situational awareness and operational \ncontrol of our southern border is feasible and can be accomplished and \nthat it is a reasonable, attainable goal.\n  My question for them and for others is, if they believe it is \nfeasible and if they believe we are suffering from a trust deficit as a \nresult of the American people being asked to trust us and that trust \nbeing exploited and violated so many times in the past with promises \nthat are not kept, why not agree to a reasonable condition after \nprobationary status, before people transfer to legal permanent \nresidency where we know the forces will be aligned in order to make \nsure that is met. Then we can regain the American people's confidence \nand see we restored law and order and legality out of a current lawless \nand chaotic system which exploits and preys on many innocent people who \ndie, who are subjected to human slavery as a result of trafficking, and \nyou name it.\n  There is a crisis of confidence in Washington these days and the only \nway I think we are going to regain that confidence and demonstrate to \nthe American people we are serious about making this happen is a \ntrigger and a conditioning of that transition from RPI status to LPR \nstatus contained in my amendment.\n  If it is attainable and if it is something that is important in terms \nof regaining the public's confidence instead of just saying ``trust \nus,'' why not support the amendment? Why not demand real results on \nborder security, rather than repetitive promises that have not been \nkept in the past and which the American public is in deep doubt will be \nkept in the future? Without a genuine border security trigger, this \nbill, I would daresay, has zero chance of passing the House of \nRepresentatives. For those of us who wish to see an improvement in the \nstatus quo because we believe the status quos is simply unacceptable, \nfor those of us who wish to see a good immigration reform bill pass, \nwhy not pass this bill with my amendment? Why not give this bill some \nmomentum as it goes over to the House of Representatives and as we come \ntogether as a Senate and a House to reconcile those differences in the \nbill and send over a good bill, an enforceable bill--not just full of \nhollow promises but one which will actually gain results when it comes \nto security.\n  Everybody in this Chamber knows the Senate bill is dead on arrival in \nthe House. They have their own ideas. They are going to take up \nimmigration reform on a piecemeal basis, but ultimately my hope is they \nwill cobble together one or more smaller bills and then we will be able \nto get to a conference with the House to work out the differences. But \nthis is the kind of sleight of hand which I think undermines our \ncredibility and increases the skepticism of the American people that we \nare actually going to deliver as represented when it comes to \nimmigration reform.\n  You have seen this before. Senator Durbin, the distinguished majority \nwhip, said in January 2013: A pathway to citizenship needs to be \n``contingent upon securing the border.'' I agree with Senator Durbin. I \nagree that is the essential bargain the American people are willing to \naccept. There was a CNN poll yesterday that said 6 out of 10 of the \nAmerican people would accept a pathway to citizenship, perhaps \ngrudgingly, if they actually felt as though the results they demand be \nprovided on border security and enforcement are contained in this bill.\n  That is why I believe it was so important for Senator Durbin to say, \nas part of their announcement of the goals of the Gang of 8, that a \npathway to citizenship would be ``contingent upon securing the \nborder.''\n  Here is the disconnect. Unfortunately, 6 months later, June 11, 2013, \nSenator Durbin was quoted in the National Journal that the gang has now \ndecided that ``the pathway to citizenship'' and border enforcement can \nbe delinked. In other words, the way to citizenship is guaranteed and \ngood luck on the border security and the enforcement. Good luck, \npresent Congress, trying to enforce your will, present and hence, on a \nfuture Congress; good luck, President Obama, trying to dictate exactly \nwhat a future President, 10 years from now, will do.\n  The only way I believe we can credibly go back and defend our \nposition for immigration reform before our constituents, certainly my \nconstituents, is to look them in the eyes and say we have fixed the \nproblem. We have done everything humanly possible to make sure all the \nincentives are aligned so that border security, interior enforcement, \nand E-Verify are actually in place before people transition to legal \npermanent residency.\n  We have now had three decades to fix our broken promises on border \nsecurity and now is the time to demand real results and to create a \nmechanism for achieving them. It is time to make good on our promises \nto the American people by securing America's borders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 1311, \nthe Hire Americans First amendment, which I hope to call up later.\n  Nearly 8 percent of Americans are unemployed or underemployed and our \nimmigration policy obviously must be a jobs policy. Any successful \nimmigration plan must take a closer look at the H-1B Program, which \nserves an important but specific and limited purpose. The H-1B visa was \ncreated so businesses--particularly in high tech but not exclusively \nthat--so businesses could recruit foreign workers to help fill the void \ncreated a by a lack of\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nAmerican workers with those specific skills. Yet, as this bill comes to \nthe floor, something very important was excluded. The bill lacks a \nrequirement--which was in earlier versions of the bill--that employers \nhire an equally or better qualified American worker when one is \navailable, rather than a potential H-1B worker.\n  The bill lacks a requirement that employers hire a qualified, equally \nor better qualified American worker when one is available, rather than \na potential H-1B foreign worker. With this bill we are enshrining a \nprocess--without this amendment--that allows companies to pass over \nskilled Americans for foreign workers after they have been required to \nactually actively recruit those Americans.\n  The bill has provisions to recruit Americans for these jobs that \nmight have gone to an H-1B foreign worker, but it falls short. It \ndoesn't require the employer to actually--after going through that \nprocess, to actually hire the American worker who is as qualified or \nbetter qualified than the H-1B foreign worker. This approach only \nundermines support for the H-1B Program because it will be seen as a \ntool to avoid hiring American workers.\n  Understand the American public, as they start to kind of understand \nand digest the provisions of this purported new law, this legislation, \nwhen they hear that, yes, companies have to recruit and look for \nAmerican workers but in the end, even if the American worker is as \nqualified or more qualified, the company is under no obligation to \nactually hire the American. Senator Grassley has been a champion in the \nfight to end H-1B abuse. That is why I am proud to join Senator \nGrassley in our bipartisan amendment to introduce the H-1B and L-1 Visa \nFraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2013.\n\n  The H-1B program should only be used when there is no qualified \nworker available in the United States. That is clearly what the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly say they want: that the program should \nonly be used when there is no qualified worker available here. This \namendment would increase protections to workers by requiring that \nemployers only hire H-1B workers, as I said before, when there is no \nequally qualified or better qualified American.\n  This amendment would make sure a worker from Wuhan would not be hired \nat the expense of a qualified engineer or scientist from Elyria or \nSylvania, OH. It means ensuring that American companies seek out, find, \nand hire skilled American workers before seeking visas for foreign \nworkers. However, that is not included in this version of the bill that \nwe are debating on the Senate floor--the immigration bill. The bill in \nits current form simply says that companies have to look for qualified \nAmericans. It doesn't require them to actually hire the equally \nqualified or better qualified American, such as a chemist from \nCleveland or a computer scientist from Celina. The underlying bill \nincreases the number of H-1B-eligible visas, and that is fine. But it \nalso cracks down on employers who take advantage of the system. Without \nthe requirement to also hire qualified U.S. workers, the recruitment \nsteps mean standing on an escalator that leads to nowhere.\n  What this legislation now says is that companies that consider H-1B \nvisa hires need to recruit Americans, but the bill falls short of \nsaying if the American is as qualified or more qualified they need to \nhire that American. If they are qualified Americans who can do the \nwork, there is simply no need to fill the post with an H-1B worker. \nPassing the Brown-Grassley amendment--also cosponsored by Senator \nSessions, a Republican from Alabama, and Senator Manchin, a Democrat \nfrom West Virginia--the hire Americans first amendment is important in \nfixing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thought I would take a few moments to \nshare the contents of this amendment and why it is an important \naddition to the bill we are considering currently. This is related to a \nvery critical part of Oregon's economy; that is, timber and forest \njobs. Forest jobs have long been a pillar of our rural economy in my \nState. In fact, my father worked as a millwright when he first came to \nOregon. He worked as a mechanic, which was basically to keep the \nsawmill operating.\n  When the sawmill shut down, he pursued other jobs as a mechanic. We \ntraveled with the timber economy, as so many families in Oregon did. \nMany of our rural towns are mill towns--towns closely related to the \nproduction of\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nlumber from our national forests and from private forests.\n  Over the past several decades, times have been pretty tough in the \ntimber economy, and we have many forest workers who have suffered \nthrough these tough times. Their families have gone with the ups and \ndowns of the timber economy. Certainly, the recession added insult to \ninjury, and the unemployment rates in many of our timber counties \nsoared and have been stuck at over 15 percent.\n  That is why in 2009 I and others fought to get funding in the \nrecovery bill to expand thinning and wildfire prevention. The concept \nwas that we have millions of acres of overgrown second-growth forests \nwhich is not ideal for ecosystems, and it is not ideal for producing \ntimber. What it is ideal for is forest fires and disease. So thinning \nthese forests made a lot of sense, and we can put a lot of folks to \nwork.\n  We did get funding for forest health, but in 2010 we had a little \nshock. One of our newspapers in Oregon, the Bend Bulletin, started \nreporting about how the forest service contracts intended to put \nAmericans to work--and for the Oregon forests, Oregonians to work--were \ninstead awarded to contractors who were bringing in foreign workers \nunder the H-2B visa program. These contractors, using cheap labor, were \nunderbidding the local companies that were employing Oregonians from \nthese rural communities--communities deeply steeped in the tradition of \nforest jobs.\n  In 2011, we found out from a Department of Labor audit of some of \nthese contracts--more than $7 million worth--that not one Oregonian was \nhired. In fact, the audit concluded that it was likely Oregonians \ndidn't even know the jobs existed. Now, why is that? Because the \ncontractor--seeking to underbid the contractors who would hire \nAmericans--proceeded to advertise in California for jobs in Oregon. \nThey proceeded to advertise well in advance of the jobs; there was a \ndisconnect in time. They proceeded to imply in the advertisements that \na second language was required.\n  When applications were received by the few Oregonians who found out \nabout those jobs, they round-filed those applications, put them through \nthe shredder, rather than using our tax money to thin our forests to \nprevent forest fires and disease and didn't hire Americans for those \njobs.\n  The information provided to my office showed that in 2010 and 2011 in \nOregon and Washington more than one-third of the contracts being \nawarded by the Forest Service were going to companies that self-\nattested that they could not find a single American worker who wanted \nto do these jobs. Now these companies are operating in rural \ncommunities with very high unemployment rates in the middle of a \nterrible recession. We have thousands of Oregonians who have signed up \non a job seeker database saying they want to work in our forests.\n  In Oregon that list involves more than 5,000 individuals who are on a \nState list wanting to work in the woods, and the contractors said they \ncould not find anyone who wanted one of these jobs. This is exactly the \ntype of abuse that undermines the entire program. This is the type of \nabuse that must not be allowed.\n  As I go from county to county doing townhalls, as I do in each county \nevery year, folks say time and time again: We need more jobs in the \nwoods. Well, those jobs that we do have in the woods, we need to make \nsure they know about those jobs. When our taxpayer dollars are funding \nthe work, we need to make sure the money goes to create jobs where they \nare needed.\n  That is why I am proposing a narrowly tailored amendment to address \nthis problem with three simple changes to the H-2B program for forestry \njobs. First, enhanced recruitment. Employers, before submitting a \npetition to hire H-2B workers, would be required to use appropriate \nrecruitment strategies to find or notify Americans who are interested \nin these jobs. This could be advertising at job fairs, with local and \nState workforce agencies and nonprofits, or advertising on reputable \nInternet job search sites or radio. The key is they must work with the \nState workforce agency to advertise in the places where local residents \nare likely to hear about the jobs. That is exactly what did not happen \nin Oregon in 2009 and 2010.\n  The second provision of this amendment is that the Secretary of Labor \ncould grant a temporary labor certification to an employer to hire H-2B \nforest workers. In order to do that, the director of the State \nworkforce agency would have to certify that the employer has complied \nwith the recruitment requirements, and the director of the State \nworkforce agency would have to make a determination that local workers \nwere not qualified or available to fill the jobs. That way we connect \nthe contractor who is responsible to make sure that folks know about \nthese jobs with the workforce agency that has the expertise in finding \npeople who want to know about these jobs. If there is a situation where \na contractor simply says, well, we advertised, but we cannot find \nanyone, the workforce agency would know whether that was a legitimate \nand valid conclusion.\n  The third point is that if an employer seeks to be certified for a \nwork itinerary that covers multiple States, and if the work outside the \nprimary State lasts 7 days or longer, then the employer needs to \ncontact the agency in each State. That way they don't simply have \nsomeone starting work in California for a day or two and shifting to \nOregon, shifting to Washington, or shifting to Idaho--perhaps for a \nmonth in each place--but never advertising in the State where the work \nis being done. These are three simple changes to our H-2B program for \nforest workers that could make a real difference for individuals \nstruggling to find work in the woods.\n  Now, we cannot go back and fix the contracts that have already been \nissued and abused in the past, but we can fix the problems we know \nabout now so that those forest workers do get the jobs in the future--\nthose Oregonians, those Americans who want to work in the woods.\n  In places like Myrtle Creek, where I was born, or Roseburg, where I \nwent to first grade, when you are born in these timber communities, you \nare practically born with a chainsaw in your hand. Timber is the heart \nof the local economy. To have folks--who are unemployed, trying to \nsupport their families and desperate for jobs in the woods--find out \nthat our tax money that was supposed to go to put them to work has been \nput to work hiring people from outside our country is outrageous and \nunacceptable. This amendment will address it in a responsible manner.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                          Women's Health Care\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nH.R. 1797. A number of my colleagues, Senators Murray and Boxer, have \nbeen here this morning to talk about the bill that passed yesterday in \nthe House of Representatives that would prohibit all abortions beyond \n20 weeks with very, very limited exceptions.\n  This topic is critically important to the women of Connecticut and \nour country, and the bill is lamentably and regrettably yet another \nexample of legislation that feigns concern for women's health when \nactually it would endanger the lives and well-being of women across \nthis great country.\n  The bill would take decisions regarding health care away from women \nand their doctors and would force doctors to decide between incurring \ncriminal penalties and helping their patients. That choice is \nunacceptable professionally and morally.\n  The decision to end a pregnancy is a serious decision that a woman \nshould make in consultation with her doctor. When those decisions are \nmade later in a pregnancy, they are most often the result of serious \nhealth risks to the mother or the discovery that the fetus is not \nviable. They are the result of those risks or the discovery that a \nfetus is not viable. Political interference is abhorrent and \nunacceptable in these personal and private decisions, and it violates \nthe constitutional right of privacy.\n  The other scenario in which a woman may seek an abortion later in a \npregnancy is due to an inability to access such services earlier--\nwhether due to\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\nfinancial restrictions or a lack of access to health care or other \nextenuating circumstances.\n  In fact, 58 percent of abortion patients say they would have \npreferred to have an abortion earlier. Low-income women were more than \ntwice as likely as their wealthier counterparts to be delayed because \nof financial limitation and difficulty in making arrangements. As \npoliticians, we should not be placing additional restrictions on women \nin these circumstances.\n\n  The House bill blatantly ignores constitutional protections that are \nvitally necessary to protect the health of women, as decided in Roe v. \nWade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, because these kinds of \nrestrictions place limitations that interfere with constitutional \nrights and have no place in these personal and very private decisions.\n  The limited exceptions in this bill would require a woman to report a \nrape or incest to law enforcement or a specific government agency when \nshe is seeking much needed health care services. Those restrictions \nthat affect women when they have been victims of a crime or face \nserious health risks have no effect in reducing abortions, and that is \ntheir purported purpose--to reduce abortion--but that purpose will in \nno way be served by these restrictions. Victims of incest or rape may \nbe too young or too fearful of retaliation to report to a law \nenforcement agency. Why create a needless, lawless obstacle to vital \nhealth care?\n  We should be working to ensure that women have the ability to access \nsafe and affordable contraception so there are fewer unintended \npregnancies in this country. And yet supporters of this bill would also \nrestrict access to contraception, and they are the ones who have tried \nto make it more difficult to get access to the information and services \nnecessary to prevent unintended pregnancies.\n  We need to do more. Our Nation needs to do better to ensure that \nwomen have access to preventive and maternal health care so they can be \nprepared to face the responsibility of pregnancy and parenthood. This \nbill would do very little, if anything, to actually help women protect \ntheir health care and the health care of their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject any consideration of this ill-intended \nand, I hope, ill-fated measure that endangers women's health across the \ncountry, and I urge my colleagues to focus on the real priorities that \nface this Congress--job creation and economic recovery, for example--\nand stop this attack on women's health.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we are debating the immigration bill \nagain today, and as the Presiding Officer knows, I am one of those \nMembers of the Senate who believe our immigration system is broken, \nboth the legal system and the way in which we want to deal with those \nwho come here illegally.\n  I have concerns with the underlying legislation. I have spoken about \nthat on the floor. I have concerns about the workplace magnet. I think \nthe E-Verify proposals in the underlying bill are an improvement to the \ncurrent system but still not as strong as they need to be to be an \neffective deterrent to those who are unauthorized to work. I don't \nthink the system will work, frankly, unless we strengthen those \nprovisions at the workplace. Most people want to come here for economic \nreasons, and if we don't deal with the workplace we will not be able to \naffect much at the border if people really want to come here with their \nfamilies to get a job.\n  Second, we have learned now that 40 percent of those who are here \nillegally have actually overstayed their visas, meaning they came here \nlegally but then overstayed their visas and are here illegally now.\n  We also learned that under E-Verify, unfortunately, about 54 percent \nof those who are unauthorized to work are getting through the system \nnow with the pilot programs that are available. So that needs to be \nstrengthened, and I will have proposals to do that.\n  I am working with the eight Members of our body here who have put \ntogether this legislation and other Senators on both sides of the aisle \nto try to strengthen those provisions because I don't think the bill is \ngoing to hold together without real enforcement.\n  Secondly, the border enforcement needs to be strengthened and the \ntriggers need to be strengthened. I am working with Senator John Cornyn \nand others on that. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle can \nagree that along with having workplace verification that really does \ndetermine who is eligible to work and whether documentation is \nfraudulent, we also need to have a secure border moving forward.\n  Third, I have concerns about some of the benefits that will be \noffered to people who are in this interim status, so-called RPI status, \nwho would be in a legal status but still not able to obtain a green \ncard. So the question is, What benefit should they get? We want to be \nsure people are not enticed to come here for benefits but, rather, come \nhere legally to work.\n  Finally, I have concerns about some of the criteria for this status, \nwhich would be a legal status, as it relates to crimes they have \ncommitted. As a result, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support \ntwo amendments I have filed to the underlying bill. I believe these \namendments would serve to clarify what kinds of criminal acts would \nrender violent offenders inadmissible under the immigration reform bill \nwe are debating.\n  The first amendment addresses convictions for domestic violence, \nstalking, or child abuse. Under the current language, those convicted \nof these crimes would only be ineligible for admission in the event \nthey served at least 1 year in prison. My amendment would change this \nlanguage to declare inadmissible anybody convicted of such crimes who \ncould have been sentenced to no less than 1 year of imprisonment for \nthe crime at the time of conviction. I think this is really a \nclarification amendment and a simple amendment that should be accepted \nby both sides because it is in keeping with the original purpose of the \nlanguage, which is to allow a more consistent and fair application of \nthe law.\n  If my amendment is accepted, two individuals convicted of the same \ncrime under the same circumstances would be treated in the same way \nunder our Nation's immigration laws. That is not the case as the bill \nis currently written. The current language puts emphasis on the time \nserved rather than the offense committed. As we all know, the amount of \ntime a person convicted of a crime might serve in prison is related to \na whole lot of factors unrelated to the purpose of this legislation--\nfrom the disposition of the sentencing judge, to the recommendations \nmade by the prosecutors, to the overcrowding in many of our State \nprisons. So this amendment would take those extraneous considerations \nout of the picture, applying the same standard to all applicants for \ncitizenship while ensuring that the spirit of the original language \nremains--preventing violent criminals from reaping the benefits of this \nlegislation.\n  The second amendment serves a similar purpose. It would exclude \ncrimes against children involving moral turpitude--things such as child \nabuse, child neglect, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor \nthrough sexual acts. It would remove those from the discretionary \nauthority of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and \nimmigration judges with regard to removal, deportation, or \ninadmissibility of an individual. This amendment would strengthen our \nefforts to prevent and punish child abuse and would ensure that anyone \nwho endangers our children is not eligible to become a citizen of this \ncountry.\n  Nothing is more precious than American citizenship. We see that \neveryday with people coming to this country, some legal and some \nillegal. We have to ensure that this legislation does not extend that \nprivilege to those who would commit crimes against the most vulnerable \namong us.\n  These very simple, commonsense amendments would help to achieve that \ngoal. So along with E-Verify and ensuring that our border will be \nsecure,\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\nensuring that the appropriate benefits are provided to those who are \nnot citizens but here in an interim status, I urge my colleagues to \nadopt these two amendments to ensure that those who would like to \nbecome citizens of the United States are those who deserve it and are \nnot individuals who have engaged in the kinds of criminal acts that \nwould make them inappropriate to become citizens of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the time. I don't see any \ncolleagues stepping forward, so I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday we had the good fortune of \nreceiving the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate of the \nimmigration bill before the Senate, and I would like to mention two \nfindings from the CBO report.\n  It says the bill will drive down wages. For legal American workers, \nthe CBO estimates the bill would drive down their average wages.\n  Secondly, it says the bill will not stop illegal immigration. Despite \npromises of a secure border, the bill would slow future illegal \nimmigration by only 25 percent, according to the CBO. In the next \ncouple of decades, that would mean 7.5 million new undocumented \nimmigrants coming to the country.\n  Before I dive into these two findings, let me remind my colleagues \nwhat was said by the authors of the bill. They said that undocumented \nimmigrants and, hence, illegal migration would be a thing of the past. \nThey said their bill included the toughest enforcement measures in \nhistory.\n  In their framework, the Group of 8 said they would write a bill which \nwould ensure that the problem does not have to be revisited. They \nimplied that their bill--similar to the 1986 bill--would take care of \nthe problems once and for all. The obvious fact there is that the 1986 \nlegislation said it would secure the border, but it never did secure \nthe border. So we see the Group of 8 legislation before us as making \nthe same mistakes we made in 1986.\n  As to what the Group of 8 said--that they would write a bill that \nwould ensure that the problem does not have to be revisited--we find \nthe Congressional Budget Office thinks entirely differently.\n  I may not always agree with CBO. I disagree with the fact that CBO \nhas used dynamic economic effects to score this bill, when they do not \nuse it on anything else. Yet they refuse to provide the dynamic scoring \nparticularly on revenue bills. But everyone knows what the CBO says \ngoes.\n  I always say on the Senate floor, CBO is god. If they say something \nis going to cost something, and you want to dispute what they say, you \nhave to have 60 votes in this body to overturn a point of order against \nthe CBO. It is very difficult to get 60 votes in the Senate, so that is \nwhen if they say something is something, it is something, and that \nmakes them god around this town.\n  So I ask the proponents about these two key findings that I have \npointed\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nout: What do the proponents say about the fact that the influx of new \nimmigrants would have the effect of bringing down the average wage for \nAmerica's workforce?\n  This is exactly the point Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights, argued before our Judiciary Committee on \nApril 19. He said illegal immigration has a negative effect on the \nwages and employment levels of low-skilled workers, particularly \nAfrican Americans.\n  The second question to the group: Is the fact that S. 744 will drive \ndown wages acceptable to those who support the bill?\n  In the report, the ``CBO estimates that, under the bill, the net \nannual flow of unauthorized residents would decrease by about 25 \npercent relative to what would occur under current law.''\n  I wish to put in front of that 25 percent my own words: You mean if \nwe pass this legislation, according to CBO, this legislation is only \ngoing to have the effect of lowering the illegal immigration by 25 \npercent, when we are led to believe they are going to overcome the \nproblems we did not foresee in 1986, when we legalized--thought we did \nit once and for all; that would take care of it--and we find out now it \ndid not take care of it. We legalized 3 million people, and now we have \n12 million undocumented people here as well.\n  So let's just see. If the CBO is correct and the net flow of \nunauthorized residents would only decrease by about 25 percent, does \nthat not indicate we will have to revisit the immigration issue again?\n  It is obvious this bill will not ensure that we are not back in this \nsame position down the road, contrary to the promises of the Group of 8 \nthat: We are going to write this legislation in a way that we will not \nhave to revisit it. We said that very same thing in 1986, but here we \nare 25 years later with four times the number of undocumented workers \nthan we had then.\n  The CBO also reported that while ``enforcement and employment \nverification requirements in the legislation would probably reduce the \nsize of the U.S. population,'' other aspects of the bill will, in fact, \n``probably increase the number of unauthorized residents--in \nparticular, people overstaying their visas issued under the new \nprograms for temporary workers.''\n  This bill favors legalization before border security and, apparently, \nwill have no noticeable decrease in the net annual flow of unauthorized \nresidents. The CBO says the bill will not stop the flow of illegal \nimmigration.\n  If proponents are serious about stopping people from living here \nillegally--contrary to our law, a nation based upon the rule of law--\nthey need to adopt commonsense legislation that will stop this flow, \nnot merely reduce it by just 25 percent.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1200\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding regular order would \nbe my calling up Paul amendment No. 1200, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may call for regular order.\n  Mr. REID.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the matter just voted on been tabled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time until 4:25 \np.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, \nwith Senator Sessions controlling 7 minutes of the Republican time, and \nthis be for debate on the following amendments: Manchin No. 1268, Lee \nNo. 1208, as modified, with the changes at the desk, Pryor No. 1298, \nHeller No. 1227, and Merkley No. 1237, as modified.\n  We still have a number of other amendments the managers are working \non and we will get to those later, or try to at least.\n  Continuing my request: At 4:25 p.m. the Senate will proceed to votes \nin relation to the amendments in the order listed; that the amendments \nbe subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to each vote and all after the first vote be 10 \nminutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to address the leader and the managers of the \nbill, both Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy. I know there are about \n100 or so other amendments pending, and I know we have been sort of \nheld up the last couple of days, but there are amendments--and this is \nthe question I have--that don't touch the heart of the bill but that \nare important to connect to this bill that have no opposition that I \nknow of.\n  I am asking the leader, for amendments that have no opposition and \nhave bipartisan support, when could we possibly get on amendments that \ndon't have opposition.\n  Mr. REID. I would say through the Chair to my dear friend from \nLouisiana, the managers have been working through these amendments. I \nknow my friend says there is no opposition. Having said that, that \ndoesn't mean there isn't opposition.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So I should do more checking on them then.\n  Mr. REID. We have a number of people trying to get amendments on the \nlist. We will continue to work on that. It is not because the managers \nhaven't tried.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my request be modified to have the vote \nstart at 4:35 rather than 4:25; otherwise, Senator Sessions will not \nhave time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the leader's unanimous \nconsent?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by me, in consultation with Senator McConnell, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 182; that there \nbe 2 minutes for debate equally divided in the\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nusual form; that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote with no intervening action or debate on the nomination; \nthat the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be \nin order; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that \nPresident Obama be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  It is Michael Froman to be U.S. Trade Representative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unless Senator McConnell objects, we will \nhave a vote right after this batch of votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be equally charged to both \nsides.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the \nimmigration bill of the Gang of 8 confirmed in dramatic fashion our \nmost significant concerns about the bill. Indeed, I would say, through \nthe history of the movement of this bill through the Senate, this is \nthe most dramatic event yet.\n  Basically, it says these things in explicit phrases after careful \nanalysis:\n  No. 1, it will reduce the wages of American citizens.\n  No. 2, it will increase unemployment in America.\n  No. 3, it will reduce GNP per capita in America. The growth in our \neconomy will be reduced by the passage of this bill.\n  It concludes that the flow of illegal immigrants will not be stopped \nbut will only be reduced by 25 percent.\n  So we are talking about a bill that is supposed to be the toughest \never, that is going to promote economic growth in America, a bill that \nis supposed to make us economically stronger and end illegal \nimmigration in the future. It just doesn't do that.\n  I have read the bill. I have studied the bill and looked at the bill. \nI have been concluding and saying for weeks each one of those things, \nand the score confirms that.\n  So I would ask colleagues: How can we vote for a bill that pulls down \nwages of Americans, increases unemployment, and only has a modest \nreduction in the illegality that is occurring today, reduces GNP, and \nincreases the debt? How can we do that?\n  For example, the bill would increase welfare spending by $259 billion \nin the first 10 years and increase the on-budget deficits by $14 \nbillion.\n  It has been said the overall deficit when we account for the off-\nbudget items looks better. But that is a direct result of counting the \nSocial Security, Medicare, FICA withholding on people's payroll. That \nmoney, for the people who are paying in, is being set aside in trust \nfunds to pay for their Social Security and retirement when they draw it \nin the future. We can't count that money as improving the debt \nsituation of the United States. As soon as the 10-year prohibition or \nso that limits welfare is off, then the cost of the legislation is \ngoing to go up much more.\n  The bill would make no meaningful reduction in future illegal \nimmigration. CBO estimates about 350,000 illegal immigrants would be \nadded each year. As Senator Cornyn has said, 7.5 million people would \nenter illegally in the next 10 years instead of the current level of \nabout 10 million. So that is a 25-percent reduction. CBO writes:\n\n       However, other aspects of the bill would probably increase \n     the number of unauthorized residents--in particular, people \n     overstaying their visas issued under the new programs for \n     temporary workers. . . .\n\n  I have been pointing out for weeks people are going to come here with \ntheir families, supposedly to work temporarily for 3 years, with the \nability to extend for 3 years, and then who is going to be able to tell \nthem to go home? They are not going to go home in any realistic way. We \nare going to have a substantial increase in visa overstays. CBO \nconcludes that is correct. It is a guaranteed policy that will not \nwork. So the bill would result in a massive increase in the future \nlegal flow of immigration.\n  Current law estimates we will add 10 million people in 10 years, \nincluding the legalized illegal immigrants. That means 30 million \nimmigrants by 2023. That is the number I have been using. I felt that \nwas a fair, legitimate number. It is complicated.\n  I asked Senator Schumer twice in the committee: How many people will \nbe admitted in the next 10 years and given legal status? He wouldn't \nsay. The bill's sponsor would not tell us how many, but CBO now has \nsaid the figure I have used--30 million--basically is correct. That is \ntriple the number that would be admitted under the current legal flow \nof immigrants into our country. We admit 1 million a year. That would \nbe 10 million over 10 years, and this would be 30 million. So we have \nto ask those questions.\n  Finally, CBO tells us, under this bill: The average wage would be \nlower than under current law over the first 12 years.\n  Let me read that again: The average wage would be lower than under \ncurrent law over the first 12 years. They use the words ``first dozen \nyears.'' So that should be the end of the bill right there.\n  This is the chart that is included in CBO's analysis and their \nreport. It is the exact same chart they prepared, not the chart I \nprepared.\n  I know the Presiding Officer cares about this issue. This is the \nimpact on average wages. This is where we start today at the zero \nfactor, and it drops down to 2024, 10 years of lower wages than if we \ndidn't pass the bill--which only makes sense because we are flowing in \na huge flow and supply of low-skilled workers, and they are going to \npull down the wages particularly of our lower income workers. This is \ngoing to happen. Mathematics and the free markets tell us that.\n  So the country--the Nation--the Congress should try to determine what \nthe right flow of immigrant labor is and get it right so we are not \nhammering American workers today who are unemployed, who are struggling \nfor jobs, trying to get better pay. In fact, average workers' pay has \ndeclined since 1999.\n  CBO's estimate of per capita GNP--this is their chart from their \nreport--shows that through 2030, we have lower GNP per capita than if \nthe bill never passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if we have a few more minutes and no one \nelse is seeking the floor, I would note that CBO's unemployment rate `` \n. . . S. 744 would cause the unemployment rate to increase slightly \nbetween 2014 and 2020''--6 years of higher unemployment rates.\n  We have heard a lot of talk over the years about the declining wages. \nI do think that it is important for us to discuss. But that decline of \nwages--which started over a decade ago and is accelerated with this \nlegislation--how is it we are not talking about it?\n  Senator Menendez, one of the intrepid authors of the immigration bill \nbefore us made some remarks earlier this morning that I thought were \npretty remarkable. He said not to worry about these first 10 years of \nlower growth, lower wages, and higher unemployment because the analysis \nactually gets better in the next 10 years.\n  But if we look at that and how it plays out, what we would see is \nthis: We would see there is an improvement in the wages in the second \n10 years--which, let me tell you, their projections are always better \nthe first 10 years. But in the second 10 years, even if we saw some \ngrowth, the growth still does not get back to the level it would have \nbeen had the bill never been passed. We have to know that. The growth \ndoes not recover from the spot we already are.\n  Respectfully, the inconvenient truth that he referred to is that this \nRube Goldberg scheme that has been hatched will certainly help certain \nspecial economic interests and certain political interests will be \nserved for sure, but it will be devastating for American workers at a \ntime they are already hurting. I don't see how we can justify this.\n  Are we supposed to tell the American people that they are to accept \ndeclining wages for another 10 years? How can that be the policy of the \nCongress of the United States? How can we tell the American person, at \na time when\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\nunemployment is way too high, that we are going to pass a bill that \nmakes unemployment higher? How can we tell them the on-budget deficit \nis going to be increased? Am I hearing this correctly?\n  To the public I would ask: Can you, the American people, afford that? \nCan you sustain declining wages for another 10 years? Do you want your \nCongress to pass a law that will reduce your wages that would increase \nunemployment?\n  What about after that? Because of the sustained downward pressure on \nwages, American wages 20 years from now will still be lower than they \nwould have been had the legislation not passed, and, particularly, as I \nindicated, it falls on the lower wage people who are falling further \nbehind. The impact of the 1,000-page immigration legislation that is \nbefore us today, experts tell us, will fall more heavily on the poorer \npeople and cause them to fall even further behind.\n  The working people in this country are going to get hammered by this \nlegislation. We need to be passing laws that help them get jobs, help \nthem add higher wages, help them have better benefits and more full-\ntime jobs, not fewer full-time jobs.\n  I don't see how we owe loyalty to Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook \nbillionaire who is running ads telling us what we are supposed to do. \nDoes he know real people who are suffering out there? He doesn't \nimpress me. He claims there is some convention of conservatives running \nthis advertisement. I am not aware that Mr. Zuckerberg is a \nconservative. Do we all owe our loyalty to him because he brilliantly \nproduced Facebook or do we owe our loyalty to the working men and women \nwho vote for us, who fight our wars, pay our taxes, and serve our \ncountry?\n\n  I suspect that if Mr. Zuckerberg were to post job openings tonight on \nFacebook, put out his salaries, what he wants to pay, he would find \nthere might be plenty of Americans who want to take these jobs. I \nsuspect so. I would ask him to do so. Put on your website what kind of \nqualifications, what kind of salaries you will pay, and let's see if we \ndo not have more applications than you suggest exist out there.\n  We know we have college graduates in large numbers in STEM fields \nalso having a hard time finding work. We know that is a fact. We have \nsenior engineers and scientists and computer people who would like to \ngo to work too. Maybe they have been laid off. Maybe there has been \ndownsizing. They have experience. Are they not to be considered? We \nhave to bring people in through some of these work programs for a \nperiod of time to take the jobs.\n  A good immigration plan can work. We may need to bring in some \nworkers. We certainly need seasonal workers whom we can bring into \nAmerica if we do it right, and we need a guest worker program. I \nsupport that. I support the million people a year who are admitted into \nour country who work here every year. But this is a huge increase. The \nguest worker program will double under this legislation.\n  I am afraid we are not serving the legitimate interests of the \nAmerican working men and women--immigrant, native born, Black, Asian, \nWhite, Hispanic--who are here today, struggling today. Are we serving \nthem if we bring in more people than the economy can absorb? We can see \nthat will pull down their wages and make it hard for them to have a \njob.\n  An author in the National Review wrote recently--I think this is very \nwise and insightful:\n\n       We are a nation with an economy, not an economy with a \n     nation.\n\n  What that means to me is that we represent people, human beings, and \nwe have an obligation to help them make their lives better and not to \nmake their lives tougher. It seems to me we have such a pell-mell rush \nfor amnesty that we have not seen the enforcement, we have agreed to \ntoo much legal flow, and we have very little reduction in the illegal \nflow over the next 10 years, and for that reason the bill should not \nbecome law.\n  That is why the bill is in trouble. That is why we need to be \nlistening to the House. They are having serious hearings, step by step, \non this legislation. The first legislation that I have seen them to \nproduce is very good.\n  We can reform the system. We can make it better. We can have a \ngenerous immigration system for America, as we have already had. We can \nbe compassionate toward people who have been here for a long time and \nnot try to deport everybody who has been here and done well but is not \nlegally here. We can do something about that.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 1268\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1268, \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an important \namendment to S. 744, the immigration bill now before us. My amendment \nwould cap compensation for private contractors employed for border \nsecurity at $230,700 a year. That is the same cap we now have on \nnonelected civilian employees of the Federal Government.\n  I am offering this amendment because over the last couple of decades \nthe United States has increasingly relied on private contractors to do \nthe work that the men and women in our armed services used to do, and \nthey are getting exorbitant salaries to do it--in some cases, up to \n$763,000 a year. That is almost twice the salary of the President of \nthe United States, and it is almost four times the salary of the \nSecretary of Defense or Homeland Security. If we do nothing, that will \nsoon rise to $951,000 a year.\n  With the war in Afghanistan winding down, defense contractors are \nlooking for new opportunities, and border security is at the top of \ntheir list. The New York Times said that some of them will demonstrate \nmilitary-grade surveillance equipment this summer in an effort to get \nhomeland security contracts worth billions of dollars.\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\n  I urge that this amendment be adopted. It caps it at $230,000 across \nthe board for all civilian employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the subcommittee, of which I was not a \nmember, gave a lot of thought to this. Their number reduced by half the \namount that could be charged. I think it is somewhat higher than in the \namendment of Senator Manchin, but it went from--it could have been \n$900,000 a year and I believe they cut it to under $500,000 a year. The \nCommittee on Armed Services discussed it. I believe the Manchin \namendment did not pass. I supported the subcommittee's mark on that. I \nthink they have come to a reasonable number. You are asking top \nexecutives maybe to move across the country to lead an engineering \nproject, and maybe that is the right figure.\n  But I respect the interest of the Senator, and I understand the \neffort behind his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1268.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Idaho (Mr. Risch) and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nChiesa).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch) \nwould have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

Mr. President, this amendment, if enacted, would require \nfast-track congressional approval at the introduction of the Department \nof Homeland Security strategies before the award of registered \nprovisional immigrant--or RPI--status begins and at the certification \nof the strategy's completion before those receiving RPI status become \neligible for green cards.\n  The basic point of this amendment is that we have a trigger that \nneeds to signal that it is OK to open the RPI process, the process by \nwhich illegal aliens will be legalized first and then eventually made \ncitizens. Somebody needs to signal that it is OK to pull that trigger, \nthat it is OK to proceed. I think that decision needs to be made right \nhere in the U.S. Congress.\n  This would occur pursuant to a fast-track plan of no more than 30 \ndays. It would not be subject to a filibuster; it would be subject only \nto a 51-vote threshold. We should pass this amendment and we should \nmove forward.\n  For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, to preserve the right of the people to be heard. If we cut \nout Congress, we are cutting out the right of the American people to be \nheard on this issue and the right of the American people to decide when \nand under what circumstances it is OK to continue the pathway to \ncitizenship.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because it would \nsignificantly delay even the initial registration process.\n  I have said the pathway to citizenship should not be a false promise. \nWe either make the promise or we don't. It should be attainable, not \nsomething that is always over the next mountain.\n  The drafters worked long and hard to reach a bipartisan agreement. \nSimilar efforts to this were defeated on a bipartisan basis in the \nJudiciary Committee's consideration because we did not want to make the \nlegalization program inappropriately subject to partisan disputes.\n  This amendment would simply remove a real promise of citizenship. I \noppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is amendment No. 1298. It is the \nPryor-Johanns amendment. I think the good news here is we have agreed \nto a voice vote. But basically what this amendment does is it requires \nthe Department of Homeland Security, as they are doing their hiring to \nbeef up the border, to hire veterans of our Armed Services.\n  This is a win-win all the way around. Our vets have, as we know, a \nhigher unemployment rate, but also they happen\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nto be the best trained, the most disciplined. They have that can-do \nspirit. They are familiar with the equipment and they make great \nemployees, as many of us know who hire veterans. We also know our \nveterans know how to complete a mission.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I wish to yield the floor to Senator \nJohanns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank Senator Pryor for \nbringing this amendment forward.

Mr. President, as I said in my remarks this morning, I \nhope this commission is never required because if it is, it means the \nborder still is not secure 5 years down the road. If that is the case, \nthen the commission will need to be fully representative of the \nconcerns and recommendations of all the States in the southwestern \nregion that are affected by our broken immigration system.\n  Should DHS fail to gain control of the borders, and should it be \nnecessary to form a commission to ensure we achieve that objective, it \nmakes no sense to exclude Nevada's perspective and recommendations. My \nState's unique location and growing immigrant population leave it \nhighly vulnerable to our Nation's flawed immigration system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let me take you back in time to 2009 and 2010. The \nhousing market had collapsed, sawmills had shut down across our Nation, \nand thousands of loggers and sawmill workers were out of work. You can \nimagine how outraged those unemployed loggers were when they found out \nthat government contracts had been let for logging but the contracts \nwere going to go to employees from Mexico. That is the type of bypass \nthat completely disturbs the fabric of our immigration system. It \nundercut the success of thousands of rural families across this Nation.\n  This amendment has a simple fix. It says that jobs have to be \nappropriately advertised so that our loggers will know how to apply. \nThat is it. It will work for rural America. It will work for the forest \nindustry. It will work for our loggers.\n  Mr. President, I understand that we are able to dispose of this \namendment with a voice vote. I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote \naffirmative threshold be waived under the Merkley amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to everyone for not mentioning this before. We \nare very close to coming up with an agreement that the managers have \ndeveloped, along with our able staff, to have a series of amendments in \norder. As things are now contemplated, we would debate those tonight \nand in the morning and have some votes starting at 2:15. Hopefully \ntonight and in the morning we will add to what we are going to agree to \nlater so that we would have even more amendments. It is my \nunderstanding that there is already contemplation of some important \nwork in the morning.\n  In short, I don't think we will have any more votes tonight after \nthis one we are going to take on the Froman nomination. We are going to \nhave a consent agreement to put a number of amendments in order and \nstart those. There are four or five--I don't remember the exact number. \nWe will start those votes at 2:15 and continue working on this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4661-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4661-S4663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF MICHAEL FROMAN TO BE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Finance Committee reported out the \nnomination of Michael Froman to be USTR unanimously. It is rare that I \nspeak so highly of somebody. I can think of many top administration \nofficials who are very good. Michael Froman will be another. He is very \nsmart, and he is very tough. He is the right person for the job as the \nUnited States begins to negotiate trade agreements with Asia, the so-\ncalled TPP, as well as the trade agreement with the Europeans. Our \neconomic future is tied to economic growth tied to trade.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for Michael Froman. Give him a \nbig vote so that when he goes to Geneva and when he goes to other parts \nof the world to negotiate trade agreements, the world will know he has \nour strong support. Michael Froman is a great man, and I hope very much \nthat he gets that vote where everybody votes for him. He is a good man.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. I agree with Senator Baucus that trade issues are \npowerfully important to our economy. They involve public policy issues \nthat range from jobs to the Internet.\n  Many people are interested in following our trade policies, and they \nneed to have enough information to be able to offer real input into the \nprocess. I think the Trade Representative needs to be committed to \ntransparency and democracy.\n  Last week I asked Mr. Froman if he would commit to making public the \nbracketed text for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I asked him to \nprovide more information about what trade advisers were receiving what \ninformation. Each request that I made about a commitment to public \nrevealing information, he answered with a no.\n  So I rise to repeat my opposition to Mr. Froman's nomination as the \nnext U.S. Trade Representative. We need a new direction from the Trade \nRepresentative--a direction that prioritizes transparency and public \ndebate.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nMichael Froman to be the next U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Right now, there is a leadership vacuum in this country when it comes \nto international trade. That is especially true at the Office of the \nU.S. Trade Representative.\n  A recent study by the Office of Personnel Management, which survey's \nemployee satisfaction at executive branch agencies, found that USTR \nranks near the bottom among small agencies in almost every category, \nincluding effective leadership.\n  Unfortunately, this is not a new trend--the agency has been in steady \ndecline since 2009.\n  This is due both to a lack of real leadership and the fact that, with \nTrade Promotion Authority expired, our trade negotiators don't have the \ntools needed to do their job. To date, there has been no real effort by \nPresident Obama to secure TPA renewal.\n  While I was pleased that President Obama announced this week that the \nUnited States and the European Union will soon begin formal \nnegotiations on a trade agreement, I was surprised and dismayed that \nthe President did not even mention TPA once in his remarks.\n  This is incredible to me.\n  It is easy to stand up and make speeches about trade. But real \nprogress won't come by launching initiatives and talking about them. \nGetting our trade agenda right requires real leadership and the ability \nto get the agreements negotiated and approved by Congress.\n  That simply won't happen without TPA.\n  Members of Congress have fought to fix this problem.\n  We pushed for a vote on TPA renewal on the Senate floor 21 months \nago. Unfortunately, that effort failed, largely due to lack of support \nfrom our Senate Democratic colleagues.\n  To me, this shows that Presidential engagement on TPA renewal is \nvital. Without the President's active leadership and public support for \nTPA, it is hard to see how our current efforts to renew TPA can \nsucceed.\n  And we must succeed.\n  Today, 95 percent of the world's customers live outside the U.S. They \naccount for 92 percent of global economic growth and 80 percent of the \nworld's purchasing power.\n  But the U.S. is falling behind as we fight for access to these \nmarkets. We simply cannot afford to sit back while other countries \nwrite the rules of trade to the detriment of our workers and our \neconomy.\n  Throughout the process of confirming Mr. Froman, I have made it clear \nthat I expect the next U.S. Trade Representative to share my commitment \nto strong intellectual property rights protection and my passionate \nbelief in the need for the U.S. to lead in setting the rules of \ninternational trade through renewal of Trade Promotion Authority.\n  Mr. Froman was unequivocal, during both our confirmation hearing and \nin subsequent questions for the record, that he shares these goals.\n  As the ranking member of the Finance Committee, I plan to hold him to \nhis word.\n  I also hope he will use his close relationship with the President to \nconvince him that strong and vocal Presidential leadership on TPA will \nbe critical to getting it done.\n  I plan to do all I can to help support a positive, pro-growth trade \nagenda.\n  I believe a strong vote in favor of Mr. Froman to be our next U.S. \nTrade Representative will be a good first step.\n  I have seen a lot of people come and go in this position. I can say \nthis: I have every confidence this man is going to be an excellent \nleader in the position he has accepted. I hope everybody on this floor \nwill vote for him. He is for the trade promotion authority, which any \nPresident would want because it makes it easier to approve these free-\ntrade agreements and other agreements that really are in the best \ninterests our country.\n  This man is competent, and he is highly qualified. He doesn't share \nmy philosophy particularly, but I think he does with regard to this \nposition. I have every confidence in him, and I hope everybody who can \nwill vote for him.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would ask for 10 or 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would say to my good friend from Massachusetts that if \nshe will work with us, we will work with Mr. Froman to make sure he \nanswers all of our questions.\n  I plan to work with the Senator to get answers to the questions. I \nwas unaware of this problem until the Senator just mentioned it.\n  Ms. WARREN. May I be heard for 10 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. I have no doubt that Mr. Froman will be a highly \nqualified Trade Representative. There is a point of principle at stake \nhere, and that point of principle is that we should not be moving \nforward on trade agreements without making more of this information \npublic. This is what this is about. Without that, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Michael Froman to be United States Trade \nRepresentative?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER (when her name was called). Present.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Idaho (Mr. Risch) and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nChiesa).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am not going to ask unanimous consent \nto call up any amendments or to have any votes or anything, so \neverybody can relax. But I do want to speak for a minute about the \nprocess we are in.\n  We have now been considering a major piece of legislation for weeks. \nThe chairman and the ranking member of the committee did a masterful \njob. Even though there are some people still against the bill, there \nare people for the bill, we are not exactly sure how it is going to \ncome out, but I want to say Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions--but \nSenator Leahy particularly, as the chair--could not have done a better \njob getting the bill printed, printing all of the amendments, staying \nhere through the night, letting the members of the committee have a lot \nof time to debate the bill, to amend the bill. The committee did a very \ngood job.\n  I am planning to vote for the bill. I have not kept that a secret or \nsaid anything to the contrary. Of course the amendment process is \nimportant. I cannot make that commitment until we see it. If an \namendment gets on this bill that undermines some of the important \nprinciples, I might have to change my mind. I don't think that is going \nto happen.\n  But there is the problem and this is why I am going to stay on the \nfloor until, hopefully, something can be worked out. I am not on the \ncommittee. Most of the people on this floor are not on the committee. \nThe committee is representative of a minority group of Republicans and \nDemocrats. The majority of us do not serve on the Judiciary Committee. \nWhile we were interested and worked with our friends who are on the \ncommittee to suggest important changes that would improve the bill or \ncorrect the bill or fix the bill or save money, we were not on the \ncommittee to do it. That is the process. I am not complaining about \nthat.\n  What I am complaining about is when it gets to the floor, you would \nthink the process would allow amendments to be debated so Members such \nas myself--I serve as chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nCommittee. I am not a distant third party to this debate. My whole \nbudget funds this bill. This is what I spend good bit of my time on. \nThe people in my State and constituencies I represent have a lot of \ninterest in this bill. I am not a Johnny-come-lately to this issue. I \nhave things I want to say about it. I wish to have some amendments \ntalked about and voted on. If people want to vote them down, fine. If \nthey want to vote for them, fine. If they want to have 50 votes, fine. \nIf they want to have 60 votes--I just want a chance to talk about my \namendment, so I am going to do so right now.\n  I also want to say there are some amendments--I have a short list of \neight or so. Some of them are quite minor. One or two are fairly \nsignificant and might need a debate. But part of my group of amendments \nis completely, to my knowledge, unopposed by anyone. I have Senator \nCoats as a cosponsor. I have worked openly. I filed amendments, the \ntext of which have been out there for days now. Senator Coats, who is \nmy ranking member--we try to work together in a bipartisan fashion. He \nhas cosponsored several of these amendments.\n  What I am strongly suggesting is the staff and the leadership \nmanaging this bill try to identify, of the amendments that have been \nfiled, those that are noncontroversial, that everyone would agree to. I \nthink there are probably 20 or 30 such amendments. They do not change \nthe underlying agreement. They do not spend any additional money. They \nfix or modify or improve sections of the bill. That is our job. That is \nwhat we are supposed to do. That is the legislative process.\n  You know what. If it were not meant to be that way, we should have a \nrule that says the bill goes to committee and then it doesn't even come \nto the Senate floor, then it goes over to the House of Representatives, \nand their committee works on it and they send it to the President.\n  But that is not what our laws say. Our laws say we should have some \ndebate on the Senate floor.\n  I have also been here long enough to realize the leadership is trying \nits best and there are some amendments that are very controversial. I \nam not new to the Senate. Fine. But what I am talking about is when we \nget on a major bill such as this and Members work hard to build support \nand to get bipartisan support, our amendments that are noncontroversial \nshould go first and then controversial amendments could go last.\n  But that is not what happens around here. What happens around here is \nthe guys who cause all the trouble all the time on every bill--I don't \nwant to name their names because it is not appropriate--but there is a \ngroup on the other side, and a few maybe on our side, who are never \nhappy with anything so they file tons of amendments and we spend all of \nour time worrying about their amendments. Those of us who spend a lot \nof our time building bipartisan support, who offer amendments that have \nno opposition, actually never get to those amendments.\n  This is sad. I basically have had enough. I have tried to be patient \nall week. I have come every day and said: Are any of these amendments \ngoing to get in the queue? That is not the way we are working right \nnow. We are taking the worst amendments, the most controversial \namendments, the guys who cause trouble on every single bill, and give \nthem votes on their amendments. Some of them have been defeated 99 to \n1, and then everybody gets tired and aggravated and everybody says we \nare tired, we are aggravated, we are calling cloture. And do you know \nwhat happens when cloture is called. All amendments that are not \npending, even ones that no one opposes, that could actually help a \nhuman being--imagine that, an amendment that actually could help \nsomeone--crumble up on the Senate floor and everybody goes home and \nsays, well, that was a wonderful debate.\n\n  I am just venting here, but I am saying this is one Senator who is \ntired of it. More important, my constituents are tired of it. It is not \nabout me, it is about them. They look at this and they say why can't \nyou get that amendment passed? There is no opposition to it. It is \ngood. We have worked on it. It would help.\n  That is a good question, and I have to say ``I have no idea.''\n  We have voted on all kinds of amendments that are controversial, that \nare\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\nvery high-level kind of message amendments. When the authors offer them \nor sponsor them, they know they are never going to pass but they are \nlooking for a headline.\n  I am not looking for any headline. I don't care if any reporter \nwrites about these amendments. But I happen to know some things in this \nbill. As chair of the Small Business Committee, I have had some \nhearings myself--amazing, that other committees actually have hearings. \nI have had hearings and have had dozens of small business owners say to \nme as chair of the Small Business Committee: Look, Senator, we are not \ngetting any attention here because everybody is talking about all sorts \nof things such as the fence, the border, this and that. Could anybody \npay attention to the 7 million small businesses that are going to have \nto abide by this E-Verify? By the way, we like the program, we are for \nthe program, but we have some suggestions to make it better.\n  Some of that happened in the Judiciary Committee, but the Judiciary \nCommittee is not the Small Business Committee. I have excellent members \non my committee and they have a voice, and this is an amendment many of \nthem support that I do not think the Judiciary Committee--either the \nRepublicans or the Democrats--opposes. The small business community is \nfor it. I don't know what to say other than I can't even get in the \nqueue, I cannot even get on the list to be considered.\n  Then I have a small group of amendments, because--you know, I am \nhappy to do it and I do it joyfully--I am the chair of the Adoption \nCaucus. You, Mr. President, have been wonderful. Senator Klobuchar has \nbeen wonderful. Orphans do not have lobbyists. I am not sorry, they \njust don't. They don't have any money to pay lobbyists. Through all the \ngood people who volunteer to represent them, they come to my office, \nthey ask for help. I try to do my best. I don't always succeed, but I \ntry.\n  Amy Klobuchar and I, because she is a Senator who has also been \nterrific about this, with others, not just myself--we have some \namendments that have nothing to do with the English language or any \nlanguage, the fence, any money, anything, just a few technical \ncorrections that could help some American families trying to adopt.\n  I was able to get one of my adoption amendments up. I thank Senator \nLeahy. But we have four or five. I am not trying to be hoggish about \nit, but they are not controversial. I have 15 amendments that are \nnoncontroversial--maybe I am making that up, maybe there is an \nopponent--I can't get that discussed. But only people who have \ncontroversial amendments with no chance of passing them, only people \nwho want headlines in newspapers, only people who have amendments \nnobody over here is going to vote for, get to talk about it and the \nrest of us who work hard and get bipartisanship and present amendments \nthat could actually help the bill, make the country stronger--we never \nget to talk.\n  I am going to stay on the floor and object until I get an answer for \nthat question: Why is it that people who play by the rules, Senators \nwho work across the aisle, who work hard to build bipartisan support, \nwho work hard to get amendments that do not cost any money, that will \nnot really cause too much trouble--why do our amendments get the last \nconsideration?\n  I think it has ramifications for the way the Senate operates. Then it \nis like behavior: The better behaved you are, the quieter you are, the \nmore team player you are, you don't get anything. The only way you get \nsomething is to become obnoxious and to get your amendments that have \nno bipartisan support, those who have amendments that cost a gazillion \ndollars or take away a gazillion dollars. That is not encouraging good \nbehavior on the Senate floor.\n  I want to be a good team player. The people I represent want this \nbody to work. We want bipartisan solutions to real problems, and even \npeople who do not have lobbyists and even people who do not have a lot \nof money deserve time on the Senate floor. And I intend to provide it \nto orphans whom I support to try to help, and to the parents who are \nadopting kids and don't ask for much but do ask: Could the Senator from \nLouisiana please have an amendment that nobody opposes to help us and \nour kids?\n\n  I am going to stand here and support the small businesses that get \noverlooked all the time. They are not asking for much. They like the E-\nVerify Program. I thought they had a few very positive suggestions, so \nI thought I would put them in an amendment and offer it. Silly me. Then \nthis EB-5 reporting is one of the worst run programs in the government, \nand everyone acknowledges that. Everyone knows it is not working, so \nthe committee does a good job to fix it. But my staff and I worked \npretty hard.\n  We are very close with those who work on immigration, and we talked \nwith them about some perfecting amendments. But, silly me, to think we \ncould make any improvements to the underlying bill on the EB-5 program \nwhich could create millions of jobs in Louisiana, Texas, the gulf \ncoast--which is the area I pay the most attention to--California, New \nYork, Rhode Island, and other places.\n  I am going to sit here--I know other Senators may want to talk, but \nsorry. Until I get some answers about some of our amendments, not just \nmine but other amendments. There are Republican and Democratic \namendments that are not controversial and are cleared on all fronts. I \nwant those amendments to go first, and then we can say congratulations \nto the Members who worked hard to minimize opposition and to write \ntheir amendments in a way that people could be supportive. That is what \nSenators are supposed to do.\n  We have turned from a Senate to a theater, and I am tired of being \npart of a theater. If I wanted to be part of a theater, I would have \ngone to New York. Not that anybody would have put me on the stage \nbecause I can't sing or dance, but I don't want to. I want to lead, but \nit is getting very difficult in this place to do any leadership. So I \nam just going to sit here until maybe somebody who is a leader around \nhere can come talk to us about what we are going to do with amendments \non an immigration bill that is controversial, the bill itself--let me \nnot understate that.\n  There will be people who don't want to vote for this bill no matter \nwhat shape it is in. I am not one of them. I want to know the answer to \nmy question: How many amendments of the 140 pending are \nnoncontroversial that Republicans and Democrats will agree to? That is \nmy question, and I would like an answer.\n  My second question is, When could we possibly vote on those \namendments before cloture is called? Cloture is going to be called on \nthis bill, and the reason is because we cannot get a lot of \ncooperation. So what will happen is all these noncontroversial \namendments will fall by the wayside, and what a shame. I am just tired \nof it.\n  It is the same group around here that causes all the trouble, and the \nrest of us try to be supportive, try to go along, try to work in a \nbipartisan way, and we get shut out. I have had enough, and the people \nI represent have said: We are finished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. First, over the last few moments I had a chance to \nlisten to the Senator from Louisiana. I just want to applaud the \ntenacity with which she approaches her duties in this Chamber. She is a \nterrific colleague. When there is something she thinks is the right \nthing to do, she will fight very hard to get that done.\n  I am here to say a word in support of the bipartisan immigration \nlegislation we are looking at. In the months that led up to this \ndebate, I have met with people across Rhode Island to discuss our \npressing need for national immigration reform. Rhode Island, like \nConnecticut--perhaps even more than Connecticut--is a State with a \nproud tradition of immigration, and our many immigrant communities make \nour State stronger and more vibrant.\n  I have heard from leaders of our Latino communities which are the \nfastest growing share of our State's population and workforce. I have \nheard from leaders of my State's other immigrant communities, \nparticularly including members of our Liberian community, many of whom \nfled civil war in their home country but are unable to fully \nparticipate in the American\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\ndream because of the uncertainty of their immigration status. I have \nheard from leaders in Rhode Island's technology industry who often have \ntrouble recruiting talented employees they want to hire to fill a \nspecific need, but the people they are looking for cannot obtain a \ntimely green card. I met with men and women who are struggling to find \nwork after losing their jobs to temporary foreign workers.\n  From all of those stories, one message comes through loudly and \nclearly: Our immigration system is broken. There are 11 million people \nliving in the shadows. These are people who want to work to support \ntheir families and contribute to our communities. Eligible, legal \nimmigrants can wait years, even decades to gain entry to this country. \nThen we educate the best and brightest from around the world, but too \noften we tell them they cannot remain in this country after they \ngraduate.\n  The bill before us offers a bipartisan solution to these problems. It \nprovides a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants \nalready in this country, including the DREAMers, the children who were \nbrought here at an early age and who are American already in every \nmeaningful sense of the word.\n  The pathway that is created by this bill is tough, but it is fair. It \nprevents dangerous criminals from becoming citizens. It requires \nundocumented immigrants to pay a fine, to learn English, and to work. \nBut for the vast majority of undocumented immigrants in our Nation, it \noffers a way out of the shadows. That is why, as this debate continues, \nwe should reject amendments that would place further obstacles in that \npath to citizenship.\n  This bill also significantly improves the security of our southern \nborder--a border that is already more secure than at any time in our \nNation's history. Under President Obama, the number of Border Patrol \nagents has nearly doubled. Border crossings are down. This bill will \nbuild on these successes by giving the Department of Homeland Security \ntools to further strengthen border enforcement. This bill makes real \nimprovements to our legal immigration system. It will allow spouses and \nchildren of permanent residents to come to this country without \nunnecessary delay.\n  I recently heard a heartbreaking story from a woman in Cranston, RI, \nwho told me her husband might be forced to return to his native country \nwhile he waits for up to 2 years to receive a green card--leaving her \nat home alone for those 2 years to care for her disabled child.\n  This bill will also make our Nation more competitive by helping us to \nattract the best and brightest from around the world. Two years ago I \nmet with a talented young man named Love Sarin who studied for his \ndoctorate at Brown University and then founded a company in Providence \nthat developed technology to help protect communities from the harm of \nmercury exposure. But when he applied for a green card, he was denied \neven though he had been educated at one of our universities, was \ncreating jobs in our country, and was helping to protect our health and \nenvironment.\n\n  More recently, I received a letter from Charles in East Providence \nwho says this issue is ``close to [his] heart,'' and it is. His \ngirlfriend just finished her second master's degree program at Johnson \nand Wales University. But unless she finds an employer willing to \nsponsor her for a visa, she may have to return to her native China. \n``These young people want to stay here and want to succeed,'' Charles \nwrote.\n  This bill will allow more talented individuals in the sciences and \nother fields to stay here and contribute to our economy. Let me \ncompliment the eight sponsors of this legislation for their tireless \nefforts to find a reasonable middle ground. This bill is a compromise. \nNo one can say they got everything they wanted, but on balance this \nbill is our best opportunity to fix our Nation's broken immigration \nsystem. It is our best opportunity in years.\n  As we now know, this bill will reduce our deficit by nearly $900 \nbillion over the next 20 years.\n  Let me also compliment our Judiciary Chairman Senator Leahy for his \nleadership in getting us to this point. The markup of this legislation \nby Chairman Leahy's committee was thorough, fair, and transparent. The \ncommittee adopted 141 amendments--nearly all of them on a bipartisan \nbasis--and the bill is stronger and better today than when it was \nintroduced.\n  I was proud that three of my amendments were adopted, all of them \nunanimously, by the committee. My first amendment provided both \nAmerican workers and workers on H-1B visas with a way of reporting H-1B \nprogram violations. At my community dinners back home, I heard stories \nof Rhode Island workers who were replaced by foreign workers on H-1B \nvisas. One day they are at work, the next day they are gone, and a \nforeign worker is doing their job. Some were even forced to train their \nreplacements.\n  These workers had nowhere to turn. My amendment creates a Department \nof Labor toll-free hotline and a Web site for American and foreign \nworkers to report possible violations of H-1B visa rules and an \ninspector general audit.\n  My second amendment expands the bill's INVEST visa, which is issued \nto qualified foreign-born entrepreneurs so they can come and create \nbusinesses in the United States. My amendment added funding from \nstartup accelerators to the INVEST Program criteria.\n  As many of my colleagues know, startup accelerators help \nentrepreneurs get off the ground by providing training, support, and \noften initial funding. In Providence, one such accelerator called \nBetaspring has helped launch 57 different companies, creating jobs in \nour State and across the country. So they will now benefit from the \nINVEST visa.\n  I also offered an amendment to allow scientists and researchers with \nunique skills who wish to serve our country by working in our \nprestigious National Laboratories to obtain citizenship on an expedited \nbasis provided they pass the necessary rigorous background checks.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for working \nwith me to include these important provisions on a bipartisan basis. I \ndo believe further improvements can be made on the floor, and I intend \nto offer several more amendments during this debate.\n  I am working on two amendments that would leverage our immigration \nlaws to strengthen our Nation's cyber security. One amendment would set \naside some entry visas for potential witnesses in investigations and \nprosecutions of cyber crime. We allow visas to those who help our law \nenforcement agencies to bring cases against those who are hacking us \nand trying to steal our intellectual property and potentially even \nsabotaging our critical infrastructure. Another amendment would ensure \nthat enablers and beneficiaries of hackers who steal our American \nintellectual property do not benefit from our immigration system. It \nwould allow our government to designate entities and individuals who \nare associated with criminal hackers and say: Forget it. If you are \ninvolved in supporting criminal hacking of our cyber networks, you are \nnot getting a visa. Your employees are not getting visas, and your \norganizations cannot support visa applications.\n  I also intend to offer an amendment relating to the E-Verify system, \nclarifying that employers need not reverify the authorization of \nworkers retaining the same position under the new employers. As new \ncompanies take over existing service contracts, workers in certain low-\nskilled positions can find themselves working for dozens of employers \nover their careers without ever changing their job. They are not \nchanging their job, the employers are changing, and they should not \nhave to reverify every time. That is a needless burden on both the \nemployer and the employee.\n  In addition, I filed an amendment to close what is referred to as the \nterror gap. Right now, believe it or not, nothing in our laws prevents \na suspected terrorist from legally purchasing a firearm even if a \nbackground check reveals he is on the terrorist watch list. My \namendment would give the Attorney General the authority to prohibit the \ntransfer of firearms to suspected terrorists on the terrorist watch \nlist. That seems like common sense, and this amendment was based on \nlegislation introduced by our late colleague, Senator Frank \nLautenberg. I am very aware of his presence as I stand here\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nbecause with his departure, his desk moved over to the other side of \nthe aisle, and my desk moved into his space. So now I am actually \nstanding in Frank's spot.\n\n  Frank was a tireless advocate for protecting our communities from the \nscourge of gun violence. I know as Democrats and Republicans we are \ndivided on gun issues. But if there is a gun issue we ought to be able \nto come together on, it is that the people who are on the terrorist \nwatch list should not be able to buy firearms legally in this country. \nI hope we can at least agree on that.\n  Finally, Chairman Leahy has also put forward an important and worthy \namendment that would provide for the equal treatment of all families \nunder our immigration laws. I was extremely proud to stand with Rhode \nIsland's Governor Lincoln Chafee last month as he signed into law \nlegislation making Rhode Island the 10th State in the country to \nprovide for marriage equality. It is time that our immigration system \ncatches up with States such as Rhode Island, and I was pleased to vote \nfor this amendment in the committee.\n  I will say I also understand and appreciate and indeed honor the \nposition the group of Senators who put this bill together have taken, \nthat they need to vote to protect their bill and their agreement. So on \nour side, Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin, Senator Bennet, and Senator \nMenendez may have to take positions to make sure this bill goes forward \nand passes, and I wish to be on record as saying that I may vote \ndifferently than they do, but I certainly appreciate the position they \nare in, and I think it is honorable on their part to stick with the \ndeal they have agreed to and to work hard to make sure this immigration \nbill passes.\n  Chairman Leahy, the chairman of our committee, has worked for years \nto ensure that all families are treated fairly under immigration law. I \nhave been very proud to support his efforts. I see no reason why \ntreating all marriages equally should be so controversial, much less a \nreason for blocking our best hope for comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I will conclude by saying I look forward to working in earnest with \nmy colleagues toward an immigration system that is worthy of our great \nNation. It is time to come together, fix our broken immigration system, \nand make this a system of which we can be proud. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join in this important task.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know the staff is working hard to \nfigure out the best way forward, and there are lots of views about \ndifferent amendments that may be controversial, but I am going to stay \nhere and work for the next hour or two tonight to see if we can just do \none simple thing--just one simple thing: that we can look at the list \nof all amendments pending and all of those amendments that are \nnoncontroversial--no one objects to anything in the amendment--I would \nlike that list put together. It could be either voice-voted tomorrow or \nall of those amendments could just get pending and be voted on later. I \nam not even particular about when the vote would occur or under what \ncircumstances. The leadership can make all of those decisions. But what \nI would like right now is to stop this operation until we can get the \nnoncontroversial amendments out of the way.\n  There are Republican amendments that nobody over here objects to. \nThere are Democratic amendments that Republicans don't object to. I \nthink those sponsors--which I would be included in, but I am not the \nonly one--could be rewarded for their good work, for coming up with \namendments that nobody is angry about, that people think, oh, that is a \ngood idea; we should do it. Why don't we do those amendments first. \nThen all the other amendments people have filed for various reasons--\nsome in good fashion. People feel very strongly about them and want to \ndiscuss them. They want to have a vote on them. They know it might not \npass, but it is important for them to represent that position. I have \nno problem with that. I understand that.\n  What I and my constituents don't understand is why we can't take \nnoncontroversial amendments that everyone supports and get those \npassed.\n  So until I get an answer to that, I am going to just suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and spend a couple of hours trying to find the \nanswer. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in the last few minutes, we have made a \nlittle bit of progress. I am doing the best I can to work with both \nsides of the aisle to simply get a list of amendments that are not \ncontroversial. There are approximately 230 amendments pending on the \nimmigration bill. Many of them are controversial, but there are some, \npotentially as many as 20, maybe even 30 amendments that are pending \nthat are public record, that have been filed, that Members on both \nsides of the aisle have worked on very hard.\n  We have known about this debate. Some of us have been following it \nmore closely than others. But I dare to say there is not a Senator as a \nMember of this body who has not been focused on what our constituents \nwant us to do to either improve this bill or to fight against this \nbill. You have heard a lot of that debate.\n  I think this bill will probably pass. But who knows at this point, \nbecause there are 200 amendments pending. What I am suggesting as a way \nforward is to take those amendments that are noncontroversial. \nRepublicans have not come up with their list of noncontroversial yet. \nThe Democrats are very close to coming up with our list of \nnoncontroversial amendments. We think it is about 12 or 15. They can \nhave 12, 15 or 20 or 30 that are noncontroversial. No one on their side \nobjects, no one on our side objects, and they could do some good on \nthis bill in a variety of different ways.\n  I am suggesting we take those noncontroversial amendments and make \nthem pending and vote on them sometime, anytime, tonight, tomorrow. We \ncan voice vote them all as a package. We can vote them individually. I \nam not trying to be overly prescriptive. But what I am saying, and I am \nvery serious about this, is my days of working on a major piece of \nlegislation--working your heart out for weeks getting ready for the \ndebate. You are so proud of your amendments. You have worked with the \nother side. You have Republicans. You have Democrats. You have vetted \nit with all the different input and organizations. You have worked so \nhard on your amendment, and then we come to the bill. We cannot discuss \nany amendments that people have worked hard to work out the problems. \nWe can only discuss the problem amendments.\n  It is not the right way to legislate. It is not the way the Senate \nwas created. It is not the way Congress should function. It is a \ndisservice to every one of our constituents. There are lots of \narrangements and understandings and compromises that go on off this \nSenate floor. That is what Senators do all day long. I am proud to be a \nSenator. I work with my colleagues. We work throughout the day, late at \nnight, in meetings, and say, listen, I have this great idea. Oh, I \nthink that is a wonderful idea. It will improve the bill. Can we work \non it together?\n  Our staffs work very hard, spend hours and hours on the phone talking \nwith people, negotiating, only to be told those amendments that people \nhave really worked on and eliminated all opposition by being \nopenminded, thoughtful, and willing to compromise, those amendments go \nto the back of the line.\n  Only those amendments that have no chance of passing, that do not \nhave bipartisan support, get to be discussed on the Senate floor. That \nis not the Senate I signed up for. I am not whining. I am just saying, \nI am going to use my\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\npower to change the Senate. I am starting right now. I am not doing it \nanymore.\n  The people whom I represent are exhausted by it. I am getting \nexhausted by it. My staff is exhausted by it. It is rewarding very bad \nbehavior. So the worse your amendment is, the more controversial your \namendment is, the least likely to get any votes on the other side, you \nget to go first. The rest, everybody who has done it sort of the old-\nfashioned way, the way we are supposed to do it, the way we learned \nabout it in school, the way our parents taught us, the way we observe \nother great Senators, we come and cannot even get in the queue.\n  Then when you do in this new system of rewarding bad behavior, those \nof us--and it is a big group of us. It is not just me. It is a very \nlarge group and Republicans as well. We get told: All your amendments \nthat are noncontroversial that you have worked so hard to put together, \ngreat ideas that are middle of the road and could actually solve some \nproblems of someone out in America, which is why I thought we should \ncome here, to help solve problems, you all only get 1 amendment or you \nonly get 2 amendments because we have 240.\n  That is not the way it should work. I am not going an inch further, \nnot 1 inch. This is the way it should work. A bill is brought to the \nfloor and everybody files their amendments. Senators work very hard \nwith the other side to try to get amendments that both sides could \nagree to--because that is a democracy.\n  Then those amendments get identified, and those amendments go first. \nAll of the other amendments that are message amendments or \ncontroversial amendments, they should get votes. I am not saying they \nshould not. I am happy to vote on them. Some of them are tough votes. I \nhave no problem with that. What I have a problem with, and I think if \nevery Senator was honest, they have a problem with it too, are the good \namendments, the noncontroversial amendments, the ones that everybody \nworks on, never get a vote. All the bad amendments get the attention \nand votes.\n\n  I do not think that is right. We have to get back to the regular \norder--not to the regular order. We have to get back. It is not regular \norder. We have to get back to collegiality and common sense and trust. \nThat is what the Senate is best at. That has been lost. We better find \nit pretty quickly.\n  I am going to stay here. We are not going anywhere. We are not going \nto go to any unanimous consent requests until the list of \nnoncontroversial amendments is produced. The Republicans can produce \ntheir list; we produce our list of noncontroversial amendments. Then \nthe leadership can say to me: Senator Landrieu, we will voice vote \nthese and everybody will be happy or they can say: Senator Landrieu, we \nhave to vote on these individually and we will do that at the end or \nsome time certain--I am fine with that--or they can say: We are going \nto vote on them individually and they all need 60 votes, even though \nthey have 100 percent of the body. I would be fine. I am not trying to \nbe difficult, but I am trying to be a Senator.\n  I am trying to say that I, for one, am tired of the bullies on this \nfloor and the small group that thinks that on every single solitary \nbill they should get the first amendment, the biggest amendment, and we \nspend all of our time talking about them. It may be important. They are \nnot going to pass. That is OK. I do not even mind that. But what I do \nmind is, after all of us who try to work in a bipartisan fashion have \nto listen to this, bill after bill, day after day, then we cannot even \nget our amendments that are noncontroversial. That is where I draw the \nline.\n  Please, do not anybody write: Senator Landrieu is on the floor and is \npitching a fit because she cannot get her amendment. This is not about \nmy amendment. This is about the Senate. This is about the Senate and \nnoncontroversial amendments which cannot even get on any list. Why? I \ndo not know. Why? Why would that be? How is this possible?\n  No one objects. I am going to read just a few that we are talking \nabout. Some of them are mine. I know two others that are by Amy \nKlobuchar. One of mine is amendment No. 1340. It simply reiterates in \nthis bill that everything done with children and families will be done \nin the best interests of the child. ``Best interests of the child'' is \ndone in every State, in every court.\n  When we are making decisions about families, it is always in the best \ninterests of the child. It is modern child welfare practice. It will \nclarify this bill. I do not know of anyone opposing it. You know what. \nIf someone is opposing it, then take it off the list--just take it off \nthe list. I am not even opposed to that.\n  I do not think anyone is opposing it. But if they do, they just have \nto call the Democratic cloakroom and say: I do not think we should be \nmaking decisions in the best interests of the child. I will take it off \nthe list. But I am not going to lose this amendment because the Senate \ncannot function.\n  There is another amendment I have with Senator Coats. We have worked \nvery hard on this amendment. I had a hearing in my committee as chair \nof the Senate Small Business Committee. Our committee worked very hard, \nsimilar to most committees around here. My members are wonderful. I \nbelieve that when I call a meeting and they come and we spend hours \nlooking at an issue and we actually all come to an agreement, maybe \nthis is something we could do. It deserves a chance, but not in the \nsystem that we have because, again, the amendments that really work are \nnoncontroversial and never get discussed, never get in the queue--only \nthe other ones.\n\n  One that Senator Coats and I have is entitled E-Verify Early Adoption \nfor Small Employees or the EEASE Act. We even took the extra time to \ncome up with a creative name because we like legislating. We think that \nis what we are supposed to do.\n  The EEASE Act, which is a small amendment to this bill, does three \nthings. I think one of them the small businesses will love: It directs \nDHS to create a mobile app for E-Verify. Wouldn't that be convenient \nfor small businesses? Picture yourself in your pickup truck out in your \nfield or out in your garage, and someone walks up to you and wants a \njob. You have a ``For Hire'' sign posted, and the guy comes up to you. \nHe says: Here is my driver's license. Here is my paperwork. The \nemployer picks up their iPhone, hits a button, goes to the app, and it \nis E-Verify. They know the person is legal, and they hire them for a \njob. How wonderful would that be? That is one of our amendments.\n  There is enough money in this bill to do that, but the bill doesn't \nsay that now. Our amendment would say: Make a mobile app for E-Verify. \nSmall businesses don't have time to run back to the farm, try to dial \nin on the Internet in a rural area, such as the Presiding Officer's, in \nNew Mexico. Not everybody has high-speed Internet. Not everybody can go \nrun back to the farm in the middle of the day, and then when they come \nback, they are tired. Why don't they just have everybody carry a pocket \ncommunication system? That is an amendment. I don't know one single \nsolitary person on this floor who is against it, but we can't even get \na vote on it.\n  This idea came out of a roundtable with 24 representatives of very \nimportant small business groups. I tell my committee and I tell people \nin the Congress that my committee is going to be a voice for small \nbusiness. Well, that is great. They come up and they talk to me in \ncommittee. I hear them. I take what they say, write it in an amendment, \nand can't get it in the queue even when no one opposes it.\n  We have another amendment, and this one may be controversial--I don't \nknow. I would be willing, again--if somebody says: We object because it \nmesses up the compromise we have--I would maybe even withdraw this \namendment after I spoke about it because I think it is important or I \nwould be happy to get into any queue, any time, any day, to have a vote \non it.\n  This amendment provides an access lane for small business for H-1B \nvisas. It dawned on me after the bill came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee and after we had our roundtable that, yes, we were increasing \nthe number of H-1B visas, which I support and most people who support \nthe bill. It dawned on me and it became apparent to some of the small \nbusiness advocates that there was no express lane for them. The 7 \nmillion small businesses that were--many of them are high-tech \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nthat are relatively small, some of them are startups, and 40 percent of \nall the patents are held by small businesses. It kind of dawned on us \nmaybe about a week ago that maybe we should have been paying more \nattention, that the H-1B visas might all go to big businesses and maybe \nwe should have an express lane for the 7 million small businesses that \ndon't have a fleet of lawyers and a fleet of human resources people. \nThey are just trying to create jobs in America. How terrible. They are \njust the ones creating all the new jobs. Could we please maybe help \nthem? I don't think this is controversial. Do you know what. Maybe \nsomeone objects to it. Take it off the list.\n  Senator Klobuchar has two amendments, and I am sure she has been \nfighting very hard to get them up, like everyone. These amendments have \nto do with streamlining and removing obstacles for intercountry \nadoption.\n  You would have to be walking in your sleep to not understand that we \nhave a problem in intercountry adoption. Guatemala has closed, Vietnam \nhas closed, Russia has closed. Parents have gone to great expense. I \nhave seen them weeping in the halls of Congress, begging their \nCongressmen, Congresswomen, and Senators to please help them. They were \nin the process, in the middle of an adoption, they had been matched \nwith a child, and the adoption has been closed. There are sad stories \nin this world. I wish we could fix every one, but we can't.\n  This amendment actually would solve the problem for some families--\nnot all but some families who went through the international process--\nnot to help with Russia or Guatemala. I am sorry, we haven't come up \nwith a solution for that.\n  No one opposes this amendment. It could help hundreds, if not \nthousands, of families to eliminate one or two more barriers to \nintercountry adoption. Why would we want to do that? I will say why \nbecause I think it is very important and I would imagine 100 Members of \nthe Senate would think it is very important for children to be raised \nby parents. What a novel, extreme idea that children should actually be \nwith parents or with a responsible, loving adult. Why would the Senate \nof the United States not spend any time at all eliminating barriers so \nthat children could be with parents? I don't know. I kind of think that \nis important. I have two children. I am one of nine siblings. My family \nmade a big impact on me to help me to be the leader I am today, so I \nkind of think that is important.\n  Senator Klobuchar filed this bill. I am very proud of Minnesota. We \nare all proud of Minnesota. Minnesota adopts more children per capita \ninternationally than any State in the Union. Minnesota has a very \nstrong ethic when it comes to this. Do we help Minnesota? No. We punish \nMinnesota by not even allowing an amendment that is noncontroversial. \nSenator Klobuchar has people in her State who could be helped by this \namendment. I am certain there are people in Louisiana who could be \nhelped. There are people in every State from New Mexico to New York. No \none is objecting to it, but we cannot get it on the list.\n  There is an interesting problem with some of these adoptive parents. \nI spend an awful lot of time with them. I am happy to do it, and they \ndo need champions in Congress, and I am not the only one. Senator Blunt \nhas been fabulous, Senator Coats has been fabulous, Senator Boozman of \nArkansas has been fabulous, Senator Shaheen has been terrific, Senator \nGillibrand, and Senator Levin. I mean, literally, you don't hear the \nSenators talking about it as much as me because I am kind of the \nchairman. I listen to them, and I try to voice our opinions, but trust \nme, there are many Members.\n  These amendments are not controversial, and they will help orphans, \nand they will help families who are trying to adopt children. Could we \nget it on the list of noncontroversial amendments?\n  There is another amendment that I think is noncontroversial, and it \nhas to do with a program that is absolutely dysfunctional today and \neveryone knows it. It is the EB-5 program. Not only is the program \ndysfunctional and expensive, it is not being operated correctly, and \nJudiciary knows this. In their bill, in the underlying bill, they have \nmade some great modifications to the program. That is very good, and \nthat is very good legislating. If this program could operate correctly, \nefficiently, transparently, and without fraud and corruption, it could \ncreate millions of jobs. The last time I checked, there were a few \npeople in Louisiana who need them. This is not a little thing, this is \na big thing. There are people in my State who would cut off their right \narm for a good-paying job right now. That is true in many parts of this \ncountry.\n  Instead of taking up an amendment that is noncontroversial, that \nactually could pass, that creates jobs, we can't take up this amendment \nbecause we have to take up the amendments that raise the most ruckus, \nthat create the most firestorm, that satisfy the theatrical needs of \nsome Members on the floor. We can't do anything that is kind of boring, \nnoncontroversial, and bipartisan.\n  This amendment would strengthen the work the Judiciary Committee did. \nIt is amendment No. 1383. I literally do not know anyone who is \nopposing this.\n  I am going to read these numbers out because, again, I am not \nagreeing to unanimous consent for anything until both sides get a list \nof noncontroversial amendments. Some are amendments Nos. 1338, 1383, \n1340, 1261, and 1297. Potentially, there is no opposition to amendment \nNo. 1406, and I think there are some others that might not be \ncontroversial, but I haven't completely checked, so I am not going to \nput them on the list.\n  Some of these are mine, and some of these are from other Senators. \nThe Republican staff may have a list of noncontroversial amendments, \nand when we get those lists and we can get those in the queue first, \nthen I will be happy for the queue to go on. If not, we are just going \nto call cloture, and it is just not going to work.\n  I am supporting the bill. I want my leader to know, and I have to say \nthis, but I know he is going to speak, and I most certainly would give \nthe floor to him at this moment, but I wish to say something about what \na wonderful leader I think we have.\n  Senator Reid, this is no criticism of you. You are the most patient \nperson--one of the most patient people I have ever observed in my \nprofessional life or in my whole life. I honestly do not know how you \ndo your job. Even if the caucus elected me, I would have to decline. I \ndo not have the patience, as you can tell, to do the job of a leader. \nIt would not work. They would never let me, but I wouldn't accept if \nthey did.\n  Let me say I hope I am doing a favor for the Senate because what I \nwant to do is be Senator. I have been here long enough to remember when \nwe actually were Senators, when we actually could come to the floor \nwith a bill, sort among ourselves what were really tough amendments, \nwhat were kind of sort of tough amendments, and what were easy \namendments. We would do the easy amendments because that is just the \nway you legislate--go ahead and get some things done that we all know \nto do. We have all graduated from college. Some of us have master's \ndegrees and Ph.Ds. We do not sit around eating bonbons all day.\n  We are talking to our constituents. That is our job. We write \namendments based on those meetings and conversations because people \ncome to us and say: Senator, I have a problem. Can you fix it?\n  What am I going to say to them?\n  I wish to, but I can't. I can't fix any of your problems because \nthere is no way to fix them because I can't even get a simple amendment \non the floor on any bill, any day, any week, any month.\n  Mr. Leader, I have had enough. I know you have too. I want you to \nknow I am not trying to be difficult. Do you know what. I came here to \nbe a Senator, and I would like to be one again. I am sorry, but until I \nget a list of uncontroversial amendments, I don't care if they have 20 \nand we have 5. I don't care if we have 20 and they have 5. I have no \nidea. The ones that are uncontroversial I want to move forward. Then we \ncan debate all day long how to put the other ones in any kind of list, \nand we may put mine last--just trying to show how generous I am trying \nto be. We may take all of my amendments that are controversial and put \nthem last, but I want all the amendments that are not controversial to \ngo first. I am not going to yield until we do.\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I can remember when the Senator first came here 10 years \nago, approximately. There was an issue dealing with the military. Mary \nLandrieu was a new Senator. She was over here, she had her desk on the \nother side, and she went on, and, wow, it was quite an impressive \nspeech. For a long time after that, I called her Military Mary.\n  The reason that it is such a memorable time for me is her good \nfather, ``Moon'' Landrieu, was watching his daughter. I called him and \ntold him what a great job she had done. Of course, he was very proud of \nall 10 of his children but especially that night of his daughter Mary.\n  I have no problem with Mary Landrieu coming to the floor and doing \nwhat she thinks is appropriate. She is absolutely right. We have a lot \nof trouble now getting simple things done. On a bill like this, it used \nto be that we would have two managers, whip through all these \namendments. We would just accept them. I mean, I listened to Senator \nLandrieu talk about the best interests of the child. Who in the world \nwould oppose that?\n  The problem we have is that if we get a lot of amendments pending, it \nwill be hard to get rid of them. So Senator Leahy, who is a very \nexperienced legislator, Senator Grassley, their staffs, I hope what \nSenator Landrieu has done is maybe to give the impetus to do what we \nused to do routinely; that is, the amendments that couldn't be taken \ncare of on the floor would be in what was called a managers' amendment \nwhere the two managers would agree on matters most of which were \nnoncontroversial. Sometimes there was a little trading going on--this \nis a Republican amendment, this is a Democratic amendment; we don't \ntotally love this one, we don't totally love that one, but let's put it \ntogether and have that be part of the managers' package. We haven't \ndone that much anymore. We can't agree even on the simple things. She \nis right.\n\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that the night will bring the ability for \nus to move to these amendments of hers or have a managers' package. I \nam here to inform the Senate that one of my goals is to work very hard \nto try to finish as much of this bill as we can as soon as we can. I \nhave told everyone many times we are going to finish the immigration \nbill before we leave for the July 4 recess. We are going to do that. I \nhope we don't have to work this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I hope \nthat is the case, but right now we don't know. The odds right now are \nthat is where we are headed.\n  I am going to come tomorrow morning at 11:30 and be recognized, and I \nwill move to table one of the pending amendments. That will get \neverybody over here, and maybe in the light of the day, prior to noon, \npeople will be more reasonable. By that time maybe I will have a better \nidea as to how we are going to move forward.\n  As I have said in the past, we can file cloture Friday, Saturday, or \nSunday or maybe even Monday. But right now it looks like we may have to \nmove that up a day and maybe I will have to file cloture on something \ntomorrow.\n  So I have really appreciated everyone's movement on this bill today. \nI think basically there is a good feel there is an end in sight. We \nhave a number of Senators who have been working with the Gang of 8 to \ncome up with some suggestions and, hopefully, they will have an \namendment they can offer tomorrow sometime that will put forth what \nthey think they need to improve this bill.\n  The focus for the last several days has been on border security. So \nlet's see what they have to offer on border security. The one thing \neveryone has to understand is, while I am happy to look at anything \nthey think will help border security, it cannot get in the way and take \naway from this bill a pathway to citizenship, which the American people \nwant.\n  So we are going to continue working. Staff will work on it all night. \nThe managers of this bill and others interested in this bill will work \non it. There are calls being made to the White House tonight. So at \n11:30 tomorrow I will come in and see if we have a path forward to \ngetting this bill in a position where we can finish it next week \nwithout working the weekend. But if we can't, the weekend is still in \nplay.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I think that is an excellent suggestion. Again, let me \njust thank the Senator sincerely for his patience, and I appreciate the \ncompliments.\n  As he knows, there are many other Senators who feel just like I do. \nIt is time to be Senators again, and it is just time to trust one \nanother to at least move amendments that are noncontroversial, that no \none objects to. Then we can whittle the list down to those that do need \ndebate and discussion, and, as you said, a little trading may have to \ngo on. That is normal.\n  What is not normal is coming to this floor, and those of us who have \nworked so hard to get cosponsors, to tap down resistance, to modify, to \ncompromise, don't get any time at all because--I don't know. I don't \nknow who decided we don't. But I have enough power to try to change it, \nand I am going to.\n  So I just want to say in closing, I have in front of me a list of 24 \namendments--amendments by Senators Begich, Cardin, Collins, Hagan, \nHeller, Kirk, Klobuchar, Landrieu, Leahy, Hatch, Murray, Nelson, Reed, \nSchatz, Stabenow, Udall, Udall, and a few others--about 24--that the \nRepublicans and Democrats think no one objects to. I would ask the \nleader if he would review this list tonight, ask the managers of the \nbill if they would review this list tonight, and if we could just get \nthese noncontroversial amendments agreed to either by voice vote, \nindividual vote, or en bloc vote. It doesn't matter to me. It could be \nthis week or next week.\n  These amendments have been worked on by Members of both sides \ngenuinely. We don't want any headlines. We don't want any press \nreleases. We would just like our amendments passed. There is no \nopposition to them. I will provide this list to the Senator and, \nhopefully, tomorrow morning, when everybody has calmed down a little \nbit, maybe that is the way we can proceed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed for the Record \nthe list of amendments I have just referred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Noncontroversial Amendments\n\n       1.

Mr. President, to my friend from Louisiana, I reiterate \nwhat I said earlier: I understand her concern. The only thing I would \nsay in regard to her statement is, she wants to do things in the normal \nway. I am sad to report the normal way is what we have been doing the \nlast 6 or 8 months. And that is the sad commentary that this has become \nthe normal way.\n  I will be happy to review that list. I will do it looking at every \namendment. There are some people, you know, who don't want this bill to \npass. They don't want to do anything to improve the bill. No matter \nwhat side you are on, these are people who offered these amendments in \ngood faith that they believe will improve the bill. But understand some \npeople don't want the bill improved; they just want the bill to go \naway.\n  So I will work on this. I haven't talked to Senator Leahy tonight, \nbut I will. I talked to Senator Grassley earlier today. So I heard the \nSenator loudly and clearly, and I will do the best I can.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I am here today to briefly discuss an \namendment to an important provision in the immigration bill that the \nSenate is considering concerning Stateless persons. Section 3405 of the \ncomprehensive immigration bill would, for the first time, recognize and \nprovide protections to those people in the United States that have no \nnationality--they are Stateless. There are countless men, women, and \nchildren in the United States today who cannot claim any nation as \ntheir home. Many lost their nationality when their country of origin \nceased to exist as a result of political upheaval, rampant persecution, \nor violent conflict. The comprehensive immigration bill would encourage \nthese people in the United States to come forward and apply to be \nrecognized as Stateless persons. Under the proposed law, if an \nindividual is recognized as Stateless, they could seek conditional \nlawful status, provided they meet the appropriate requirements, and be \nprotected from being deported back to a State they no longer recognize \nas their home.\n  The amendment I am offering to the immigration bill would advance \nthis important effort to recognize and protect Stateless persons living \nin the United States.\n  We live in a time when political turmoil, persecution, and war are no \nlonger the only conditions creating Stateless persons. Today, rapid and \nextreme environmental change threatens to erode national boundaries and \nmake States uninhabitable to people.\n  This is not an abstract challenge. Low-lying island States and atolls \nin the Pacific and Indian Oceans today face an existential crisis due \nto inexorable sea level rise that is making them uninhabitable. In \nKiribati, for example, rising seas are contaminating local water tables \nwith salt water, denuding fertile land and decimating island crops. The \nthreat of higher seas also makes Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and \nother island States more vulnerable to extreme weather that will \ninundate these countries with swells of storm surge and leave whole \ncommunities literally underwater. And in a short time, these island \nStates will disappear beneath the waves.\n  Sea level rise is just one of the dramatic challenges the world faces \nas a result of climate change. Other environmental stressors are \nmanifesting in States around the world that carry similar consequences \nas well. In North Africa, for instance, countries such as Morocco, \nTunisia, and Libya lose hundreds of square miles of fertile land each \nyear to desertification, driving away farming communities that are \naccustomed to living off the land. In Southeast Asia, salt water \nintrusion from sea level rise is destroying aquaculture ponds that \ncommunities rely on for economic development and food, uprooting \nfamilies from their homes and driving them inland in search of new ways \nto support their livelihoods. And rapidly receding glaciers in the \nHimalayan Plateau threaten to make the headwaters of the region's major \nrivers run dry, with consequences for downstream communities that may \neventually be forced from their homes in search of new water sources.\n  Scientists expect that climate change will exacerbate these \nenvironmental stressors, including drought, glacial melt, and heat \nwaves, transforming once fertile landscape into barren and \nuninhabitable land. Besides these slow onset challenges, there are more \npeople at risk today of being made permanently homeless by extreme \nweather events like typhoons, hurricanes, and other storms that \nthreaten to decimate communities. And, unfortunately, the populations \nmost at risk also happen to be the world's poorest people who too often \nhave no other choice but to abandon their homes once disaster strikes.\n  By the end of the century, climate change will eclipse war as the \ngreatest driver of homelessness around the world. We can and must \nprotect those people who are in the United States from being deported \nto a country that is no longer inhabitable due to sea level rise or \nother environmental changes that leave the state uninhabitable to \npeople.\n  The amendment I am proposing is quite simple. If enacted, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, may designate individuals or a group of individuals displaced \npermanently by climate change as Stateless persons.\n  Again, let me be clear about what this amendment does. It simply \nrecognizes that climate change, like war, is one of the most \nsignificant contributors to homelessness in the world. And like with \nStates torn apart and made uninhabitable by war, we have an obligation \nnot to deport people back to a country made uninhabitable by sea level \nrise and other extreme environmental changes that render these states \ndesolate. It does not grant any individual or group of individuals \noutside the United States with any new status or avenue for seeking \nasylum in the United States.\n  Finally, the amendment also recognizes that the climate challenges \nthat other States face are not unique to people beyond U.S. borders. \nIndeed, Hawai'i, Alaska and other States are and will continue to \nexperience increased environmental pressures, with sea level rise, \ndrought, wild fires and extreme weather driving Americans from their \nhomes.\n  As such, the amendment would require the Government Accountability \nOffice to conduct a study assessing the impact of climate change on \ninternal migration in the United States and U.S. territories. The GAO \nreport will assess the impacts and costs on existing Federal, State, \nand local services of various regions resulting from climate change-\ninduced migration of U.S. citizens. This important study will help the \nUnited States chart a path forward for responding to internal persons \ndisplaced by environmental change and extreme weather events, and \nidentify what resources the Federal, State, and local governments need \nto invest in to adequately respond to climate-induced migration.\n  Climate change is one of the greatest challenges the United States \nwill confront this century. But with the kinds of forward-thinking and \npragmatic policies I am proposing today, we can put the United States \non a path to respond to the challenges the country will face, and help \nprotect those communities most at risk. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to advance this important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4670-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4670-S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a speech I delivered on June 1, 2013 in New Orleans, LA \nto commemorate the commissioning of the Coast Guard Fast Response \nCutter Margaret Norvell.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I would like to thank Vice Admiral Parker, commander of the \n     Atlantic Area for the Coast Guard, Rear Admiral Baumgartner, \n     commander of the 7th District who's accepting delivery of \n     this cutter and 17 others, Rear Admiral Cook, our new \n     District 8 commander which is headquartered here in New \n     Orleans, Boysie and Chris Bollinger and Nickie Candies for \n     inviting me to today's ceremony and all the work they do to \n     make Louisiana proud, the men and women of the Coast Guard \n     who serve with incredible bravery and distinction, the \n     workforce of Bollinger Shipyards that does work everyday \n     building strong, reliable boats to keep our Nation safe and \n     secure, and I would like to extend a special welcome to the \n     family members of Margaret Norvell, who are with us here \n     today, as they were for the Fleet Dedication ceremony last \n     March in Lockport, the Heroes dinner at the World War II \n     Museum, and the opening of the New Canal Lighthouse Museum \n     and Education Center in April. I'm pleased to share the stage \n     with two of Margaret's great-grandchildren, Barbara Norvell \n     Perrone, the ship's sponsor, and Maj. Michael Norvell, who is \n     following his family's proud military tradition and currently \n     serves as a commissioned officer in the Louisiana Air \n     National Guard. I'd also like to acknowledge Councilwoman \n     Clarkson for being here today and for her continued support \n     of the Coast Guard.\n       I'm very honored to be here to commission the Coast Guard \n     Cutter Margaret Norvell. It is the 5th Sentinel Class Cutter \n     in a planned fleet of 58 ships that Bollinger will build for \n     the Coast Guard, continuing Louisiana's proud tradition of \n     building ships for our Nation's military. Whether they're \n     engaged in a dangerous rescue, pursuing and interdicting drug \n     smugglers, or responding to a severe hurricane, these ships \n     and their crews will play an integral role in the security of \n     our Nation.\n       Bollinger Shipyards is an ideal place to construct these \n     ships. Since 1946, Bollinger has been a family owned and \n     operated Louisiana business with a well-earned reputation for \n     superior quality, value, and service. Chris, I want to thank \n     you and particularly the hard working men and women from \n     Bollinger Shipyards for the Margaret Norvell. I am certain \n     she will make us all proud during the course of her service \n     in the Coast Guard, just as her namesake did. I also want to \n     thank all of you for the Cutter Paul Clark, which was \n     delivered on May 18, marking Bollinger's sixth FRC delivery \n     to the Coast Guard, every one of which has been on-time and \n     on-budget.\n       These Sentinel Class Cutters are replacing the 110-foot \n     Island Class Patrol Boats that were also built at Bollinger \n     between 1984 and 1992. Bollinger's design for the Fast \n     Response Cutter beat out 26 other competitors. The company's \n     longstanding relationship with the Coast Guard is a win-win \n     for Louisiana workers as well as the Nation's security, and \n     I'm proud to be in a position to advocate for continued \n     funding for the construction and acquisition of these highly \n     capable boats.\n       This ship we are commissioning here today is a fitting \n     testament to Margaret Norvell's 41 years in the U.S. \n     Lighthouse Service from 1891 to 1932. She was one of only 141 \n     women who served as lighthouse keepers, and she assumed her \n     position just as so many other women did, after her husband \n     Louis, the original keeper of the Head of Passes Light at the \n     mouth of the Mississippi River, tragically drowned and left \n     her with two children, ages 1 and 3.\n       Margaret assumed the post for 5 years before her \n     appointment as keeper of the Port of Pontchartrain Light in \n     1896. She distinguished herself there in 1903 after a \n     hurricane battered the town of Buras in Plaquemines Parish \n     and left 200 residents without refuge. Margaret took every \n     single one of them in and provided them with shelter. In \n     1924, she was transferred to the New Canal Light Station. Two \n     years later in 1926, using her small rowboat, she battled a \n     merciless squall for 2 hours on Lake Pontchartrain and \n     successfully rescued a downed naval aviator from the wreckage \n     of his airplane in the water. Margaret retired in 1932 and \n     passed away two years later.\n       The lighthouse from which she performed her heroic rescue \n     dated back to 1839, but it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina \n     4 years after the Coast Guard decommissioned it from service. \n     With support from the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, \n     the New Canal Lighthouse was rebuilt and reopened in April as \n     a museum and educational center to commemorate the role of \n     the Lighthouse Service and the brave men and women like \n     Margaret who served in it. Margaret once remarked, ``There \n     isn't anything unusual in a woman keeping a light in her \n     window to guide men folks home. I just happen to keep a \n     bigger light than most women because I have got to see that \n     so many men get safely home.''\n       She is the first enlisted woman from the Coast Guard to be \n     honored with a ship in her name. She was also a New Orleans \n     native who distinguished herself through heroic rescues that \n     took place right here in Louisiana. For all these reasons, \n     I'm very grateful for the opportunity to join Margaret's \n     family in honoring her service to Louisiana and our Nation, \n     as well as the leadership and courage that she and 140 other \n     women demonstrated in the history of the U.S. Lighthouse \n     Service along with more than 8,000 women who are on active \n     and reserve duty in the Coast Guard today. Margaret helped to \n     blaze the trail, and our nation is safer and stronger today \n     because of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4671-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CARA GROSETH\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, as a part of National Small Business \nWeek it is important for us to recognize companies who have a history \nof continually pushing the bounds of improvement and expansion. America \ndepends on small businesses to propel the country into future \ninnovation and that is why I would like to honor Dome Technology from \nIdaho Falls, ID as the Idaho Small Business of the Week.\n  Dome Technology builds thin shell monolithic domes which can be used \nfor industrial bulk storage or for practical architectural facilities \nsuch as churches or gymnasiums. Though dome architecture has been used \nin the past, the specific technique used by Dome Technology was \npatented in Idaho in 1977 by three brothers, Barry, David, and Randy \nSouth. They began experimenting with dome technology in 1975 by \nspraying foam and concrete to the inside of a pressurized, dome-shaped \nfabric air form.\n  Dome Technology has built some 500 monolithic domes in the past 30-\nplus years all over the United States, Canada, Latvia, Estonia, Russia, \nArgentina, Germany, Jordan, Lithuania and multiple other countries. In \naddition to providing durable and multi-purpose structures, Dome \nTechnology continues to work to create domes which can withstand \nenvironmental extremes such as hurricanes and earthquakes.\n  In 2007, Dome Technology built the largest monolithic dome in the \nworld. Currently, 75 percent of all concrete domes worldwide have been \nbuilt by Dome Technology.\n  But things haven't always been easy for this Idaho company. Dome \nTechnology is an example of how a small business can overcome \ndifficulty and rebound from economic hurdles. Prior to 2002, Dome \nTechnology had been building on average 20 domes per year and employed \n135 people. But after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the \ncompany shrunk to 35 employees while demand and prices decreased.\n  Dome Technology then borrowed around $1 million and diversified their \nproducts. Pivoting from large scale storage, the company began focusing \non marketing their domes for architectural purposes such as churches, \ngymnasiums and community centers. Dome Technology has seen growth in \nthe demand for schools built with dome technology and in 2007 built the \nfirst indoor water park in a dome.\n  In addition to expanding the uses of architectural domes, Dome \nTechnology began focusing on exporting their product internationally to \ncountries such as Canada, Poland, Latvia, Morocco, Romania and \nBulgaria. The company has now rebounded back to 120 employees and \ndemand is steadily growing.\n  Through experimentation and a devotion to quality, Dome Technology \nhas proven itself to be a company which delivers a unique, quality \nproduct year after year. What strikes me the most about Dome Technology \nis their ability, as a specialized company with a\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nniche product, to make the most of what could have been a depressed \nperiod of business and to use that as an impetus for improving their \nbusiness model. Idaho is proud of small businesses like Dome Technology \nand I am especially proud to recognize them today in honor of National \nSmall Business Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4672-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 475.

Res. 177\n\n       Whereas 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of National Small \n     Business Week;\n       Whereas the approximately 27,900,000 small business \n     concerns in the United States are the driving force behind \n     the Nation's economy, creating nearly 2 out of every 3 new \n     jobs and generating close to 50 percent of the Nation's non-\n     farm gross domestic product;\n       Whereas small businesses are the driving force behind the \n     economic recovery of the United States;\n       Whereas small businesses represent 99.7 percent of employer \n     firms in the United States;\n       Whereas small business concerns are the Nation's \n     innovators, serving to advance technology and productivity;\n       Whereas small business concerns represent 98 percent of all \n     exporters and produce 31 percent of exported goods;\n       Whereas Congress established the Small Business \n     Administration in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect \n     the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve \n     free and competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total Federal Government purchases, \n     contracts, and subcontracts for property and services are \n     placed with small business concerns, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total sales of government property are made \n     to small business concerns, and to maintain and strengthen \n     the overall economy of the United States;\n       Whereas, every year since 1963, the President has \n     designated a ``National Small Business Week'' to recognize \n     the contributions of small businesses to the economic well-\n     being of the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2013, National Small Business Week will honor \n     the estimated 27,900,000 small businesses in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small \n     business concerns by providing access to critical lending \n     opportunities, protecting small business concerns from \n     excessive Federal regulatory enforcement, helping to ensure \n     full and open competition for government contracts, and \n     improving the economic environment in which small business \n     concerns compete;\n       Whereas, for more than 50 years, the Small Business \n     Administration has helped millions of entrepreneurs achieve \n     the American dream of owning a small business, and has played \n     a key role in fostering economic growth; and\n       Whereas the President has designated the week beginning \n     June 17, 2013, as ``National Small Business Week'':\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the entrepreneurial spirit of small business \n     concerns in the United States during National Small Business \n     Week, which begins on June 17, 2013;\n       (2) applauds the efforts and achievements of the owners and \n     employees of small business concerns, whose hard work and \n     commitment to excellence have made small business concerns a \n     key part of the economic vitality of the United States;\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\n       (3) recognizes the work of the Small Business \n     Administration and its resource partners in providing \n     assistance to entrepreneurs and small business concerns; and\n       (4) recognizes the importance of ensuring that--\n       (A) guaranteed loans, including microloans and microloan \n     technical assistance, for start-up and growing small business \n     concerns, and venture capital, are made available to all \n     qualified small business concerns;\n       (B) the management assistance programs delivered by \n     resource partners on behalf of the Small Business \n     Administration, such as Small Business Development Centers, \n     Women's Business Centers, and the Service Corps of Retired \n     Executives, are recognized for providing invaluable \n     counseling services to entrepreneurs in the United States;\n       (C) the Small Business Administration continues to provide \n     timely and efficient disaster assistance so that small \n     businesses in areas struck by natural or manmade disasters \n     can quickly return to business to keep local economies alive \n     in the aftermath of such disasters;\n       (D) affordable broadband Internet access is available to \n     all people in the United States, particularly people in rural \n     and underserved communities, so that small businesses can use \n     the Internet to make their operations more globally \n     competitive while boosting local economies;\n       (E) regulatory relief is provided to small businesses \n     through the reduction of duplicative or unnecessary \n     regulatory requirements that increase costs for small \n     businesses; and\n       (F) leveling the playing field for contracting \n     opportunities remains a primary focus, so that small \n     businesses, particularly minority-owned small businesses, can \n     compete for and win more of the $400,000,000,000 in contracts \n     that the Federal Government enters into each year for goods \n     and services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4677-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4677-S4678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1343.

STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Every sovereign nation has an unconditional right and \n     duty to secure its territory and people, which right depends \n     on control of its international borders. The sovereign people \n     and several states of the United States have delegated these \n     sovereign functions to the Federal Government (United States \n     Constitution, article I, section 8, clause 4). The liberty \n     and prosperity of the people depends on the execution of this \n     duty.\n       (2) The passage of this Act recognizes that the Federal \n     Government must secure the sovereignty of the United States \n     of America and establish a coherent and just system for those \n     who seek to join American society to assimilate.\n       (3) The United States has failed to control its borders. \n     The porousness of the Southern border has contributed to the \n     proliferation of the narcotics trade and its attendant \n     violent crime. The trafficking and smuggling of persons \n     across the border is an ongoing human rights scandal.\n       (4) We have always welcomed immigrants to the United States \n     and will continue to do so, but in order to qualify for the \n     honor and privilege of eventual citizenship, our laws must be \n     followed. The world depends on America to be strong \n     economically, militarily, and ethically. The establishment of \n     a stable, just, and efficient immigration system only \n     supports those goals. As a Nation, we have the right and \n     responsibility to make our borders safe, to establish clear \n     and just rules for seeking citizenship, to control the flow \n     of legal immigration, and to eliminate illegal immigration, \n     which has become a threat to our national security.\n       (5) Throughout our long history, many lawful immigrants \n     have assimilated into American society and contributed to our \n     strength and prosperity. Our immigration policy strives to \n     welcome those who share the values of the United States \n     Constitution and seek to contribute to our nation's \n     greatness.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be made and \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 579) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONCERNING THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE \n                   INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Safe, secure, and economical international air \n     navigation and transport is important to every citizen of the \n     world, and safe skies are ensured through uniform aviation \n     standards, harmonization of security protocols, and \n     expeditious dissemination of information regarding new \n     regulations and other relevant matters.\n       (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in international \n     civil aviation forums and programs is beneficial for all \n     nations and their civil aviation authorities. Civil aviation \n     is vital to all due to the international transit and commerce \n     it makes possible, but must also be closely regulated due to \n     the possible use of aircraft as weapons of mass destruction \n     or to transport biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons or \n     other dangerous materials.\n       (3) The Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed \n     at Chicago, Illinois, December 7, 1944, and entered into \n     force April 4, 1947, established the International Civil \n     Aviation Organization (ICAO), stating that ``[t]he aims and \n     objectives of the Organization are to develop the principles \n     and techniques of international air navigation and to foster \n     the planning and development of international air transport \n     so as to . . . [m]eet the needs of the peoples of the world \n     for safe, regular, efficient and economical air transport''.\n       (4) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     demonstrated that the global civil aviation network is \n     subject to vulnerabilities that can be exploited in one \n     country to harm another. The ability of civil aviation \n     authorities to coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in \n     unison is an essential element of crisis prevention and \n     response.\n       (5) Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     the ICAO convened a high-level Ministerial Conference on \n     Aviation Security that endorsed a global strategy for \n     strengthening aviation security worldwide and issued a public \n     declaration that ``a uniform approach in a global system is \n     essential to ensure aviation security throughout the world \n     and that deficiencies in any part of the system constitute a \n     threat to the entire global system,'' and that there should \n     be a commitment to ``foster international cooperation in the \n     field of aviation security and harmonize the implementation \n     of security measures''.\n       (6) The Taipei Flight Information Region, under the \n     jurisdiction of Taiwan, covers an airspace of 180,000 square \n     nautical miles and provides air traffic control services to \n     over 1,200,000 flights annually, with the Taiwan Taoyuan \n     International Airport recognized as the 10th and 19th largest \n     airport by international cargo volume and number of \n     international passengers, respectively, in 2011.\n       (7) Despite the established international consensus \n     regarding a uniform approach to aviation security that \n     fosters international cooperation, exclusion from the ICAO \n     since 1971 has impeded the efforts of the Government of \n     Taiwan to maintain civil aviation practices that comport with \n     evolving international standards, due to its inability to \n     contact the ICAO for up-to-date information on aviation \n     standards and norms, secure amendments to the organization's \n     regulations in a timely manner, obtain sufficient and timely \n     information needed to prepare for the implementation of new \n     systems and procedures set forth by the ICAO, receive \n     technical assistance in implementing new regulations, and \n     participate in technical and academic seminars hosted by the \n     ICAO.\n       (8) On October 8, 2010, the Department of State praised the \n     37th ICAO Assembly on its adoption of a Declaration on \n     Aviation Security, but noted that ``because every airport \n     offers a potential entry point into this global system, every \n     nation faces the threat from gaps in aviation security \n     throughout the world--and all nations must share the \n     responsibility for securing that system''.\n       (9) On October 2, 2012, Taiwan became the 37th participant \n     to join the United States Visa Waiver program, which is \n     expected to stimulate tourism and commerce that will rely \n     increasingly on international commercial aviation.\n       (10) The Government of Taiwan's exclusion from the ICAO \n     constitutes a serious gap in global standards that should be \n     addressed at the earliest opportunity in advance of the 38th \n     ICAO Assembly in September 2013.\n       (11) The Federal Aviation Administration and its \n     counterpart agencies in Taiwan have enjoyed close \n     collaboration on a wide range of issues related to innovation \n     and technology, civil engineering, safety and security, and \n     navigation.\n       (12) The ICAO has allowed a wide range of observers to \n     participate in the activities of the organization.\n       (13) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations and has consistently \n     reiterated that support.\n       (14) Senate Concurrent Resolution 17, 112th Congress, \n     agreed to September 11, 2012, affirmed the sense of Congress \n     that--\n       (A) meaningful participation by the Government of Taiwan as \n     an observer in the meetings and activities of the ICAO will \n     contribute both to the fulfillment of the ICAO's overarching \n     mission and to the success of a global strategy to address \n     aviation security threats based on effective international \n     cooperation; and\n       (B) the United States Government should take a leading role \n     in garnering international support for the granting of \n     observer status to Taiwan in the ICAO.\n       (15) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235 (22 \n     U.S.C. 290 note), a law authorizing the Secretary of State to \n     initiate and implement a plan to endorse and obtain observer \n     status for Taiwan at the annual summit of the World Health \n     Assembly and subsequent advocacy by the United States, Taiwan \n     was granted observer status to the World Health Assembly for \n     four consecutive\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\n     years since 2009. Both prior to, and in its capacity as an \n     observer, Taiwan has contributed significantly to the \n     international community's collective efforts in pandemic \n     control, monitoring, early warning, and other related \n     matters.\n       (16) ICAO rules and existing practices allow for the \n     meaningful participation of noncontracting countries as well \n     as other bodies in its meetings and activities through \n     granting of observer status.\n       (b) Taiwan's Participation at ICAO.--The Secretary of State \n     shall--\n       (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for \n     Taiwan, at the triennial ICAO Assembly next held in September \n     2013 in Montreal, Canada, and other related meetings, \n     activities, and mechanisms thereafter; and\n       (2) instruct the United States Mission to the ICAO to \n     officially request observer status for Taiwan at the \n     triennial ICAO Assembly and other related meetings, \n     activities, and mechanisms thereafter and to actively urge \n     ICAO member states to support such observer status and \n     participation for Taiwan.\n       (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan at the \n     ICAO Assembly.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     Congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the \n     United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer status \n     for Taiwan at the triennial ICAO Assembly and at subsequent \n     ICAO Assemblies and at other related meetings, activities, \n     and mechanisms thereafter. The report shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) A description of the efforts the Secretary of State has \n     made to encourage ICAO member states to promote Taiwan's bid \n     to obtain observer status.\n       (2) The steps the Secretary of State will take to endorse \n     and obtain observer status for Taiwan in ICAO at the \n     triennial ICAO Assembly and at other related meetings, \n     activities, and mechanisms thereafter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4717-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

I \nhave told him this personally. I want the Record to be spread with \nthis. He is a person who as a very young man wanted to change the world \nin his own way, and in his own way he has helped change the world. I so \nadmire him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week, specifically June 19, people all \nacross the Nation are engaging in the oldest known observance of the \nending of slavery, Juneteenth Independence Day.\n  It was on June 19, 1865, when African Americans in the Southwest \nreceived the news from Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon \nGranger, that the enslaved were free. This was 2\\1/2\\ years after \nPresident Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which was \nissued on January, 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of the \nCivil War.\n  For more than 145 years, descendants of slaves have observed this \nanniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of the most tragic \nperiods of our Nation's history. The suffering, degradation and \nbrutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the memory can serve to \nensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again on American \nsoil.\n  Today, 42 States, the District of Columbia, and several other \ncountries, including Goree Island, Senegal, a former slave port, \nrecognize Juneteenth Independence Day with special activities in \ncommemoration of the emancipation of all slaves in the United States.\n  We also celebrate Juneteenth across the country in large measure \nbecause of the efforts of Lula Briggs Galloway, of Saginaw, MI, whose \nefforts to promote recognition of Juneteenth played a major role in the \npassage of the first resolution on Juneteenth Independence Day by the \nU.S. Senate and House of Representatives, in 1997.\n  Already, Congress has observed an important moment today in honoring \nthe history of the fight for justice and equality. The unveiling of a \nstatue depicting Frederick Douglass in Emancipation Hall, on this day, \nJune 19, 2013, means visitors to the Capitol from now forward will be \nreminded of this man's immense contributions to the moral and \nintellectual foundations of our Nation's drive for justice. Douglass \nescaped from slavery and became a leading writer, orator, publisher and \none of the most influential advocates for abolitionism, and equality of \nall people.\n  Today, I am very pleased that the Senate will unanimously adopt a \nresolution, S. Res. 175, recognizing the historical significance of \nJuneteenth Independence Day, which I jointly sponsored with Senator \nCornyn, and is cosponsored by Senators Landrieu, Cowan, Harkin, \nGillibrand, Cardin, Mark Udall, Leahy, Brown, Stabenow, Durbin, \nSchumer, Hagan, Murray, Pryor, Cochran, Sessions, Coons, Whitehouse, \nShaheen, Kaine, Warner, Boxer, Cruz, Rubio, Risch, Mikulski, Wicker, \nBaldwin, Casey, Begich, Nelson, Tom Udall and Warren.\n  The resolution expresses support for the observance of Juneteenth \nIndependence Day, and recognizes the faith and strength of character \ndemonstrated by former slaves, that remains an example for all people \nof the United States, regardless of background or race.\n  All across America we also celebrate the many important achievements \nof former slaves and their descendants. We do so because in 1926, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as \na way of preserving the history of African Americans and recognizing \nthe enormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, \nfaith, and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the \nbetterment and advancement of a nation once lacking in humanity towards \nthem. Every February, nationwide, we celebrate African American History \nMonth. And, every year on June 19 we celebrate ``Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.''\n  Lerone Bennett, Jr., writer, scholar, lecturer, and acclaimed \nExecutive Editor for several decades at Ebony Magazine, has reflected \non the life and times of Dr. Woodson. Bennett tells us that one of the \nmost inspiring and instructive stories in African American history is \nthe story of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West \nVirginia to the summit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at \n     Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines \n     and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. \n     He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he \n     received his bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard \n     University, where he became the second Black to receive a \n     doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history.\n\n  In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I \nwould like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home \nState of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American \ninjustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who \nwould change the course of history.\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\n  The contributions of Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out \nof the dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks, whose dignified leadership \nsparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the civil rights \nmovement, are indelibly etched in the chronicle of the history of this \nnation. Moreover, they are viewed with distinction and admiration \nthroughout the world.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a groundbreaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan has honored her with the dedication of the \nSojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle Creek, \nMI, on September 25, 1999. In April 2009, Sojourner Truth became the \nfirst African American woman to be memorialized with a bust in the U.S. \nCapitol. The ceremony to unveil Truth's likeness was appropriately held \nin Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor's Center. I was pleased to \ncosponsor the legislation to make this fitting tribute possible. \nSojourner Truth lived in Washington, DC for several years, helping \nslaves who had fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage \ngatherings. She returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there \nuntil her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the \nmost troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions \nis that her words continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999, legislation was enacted which authorized the \nPresident of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to \nRosa Parks. I was pleased to coauthor this tribute to Rosa Parks--the \ngentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the \nhumiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. I was \nalso pleased to be a part of the effort to direct the Architect of the \nCapitol to commission a statue of Rosa Parks, which was recently placed \nin the United States Capitol, making her the second African American \nwoman to receive such an honor.\n  Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence \nand respect by us all. Over 55 years ago, in Montgomery, AL, the modern \ncivil rights movement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat \nand move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this \ncourageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American \npeople, but the entire world. The boycott which Rosa Parks began was \nthe start of an American revolution that elevated the status of African \nAmericans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who \nwould one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr. In addition, the overwhelming majority \nof my colleagues in the Senate joined me in sponsoring legislation \nauthorizing the Congressional Gold Medal to be presented to Dr. King, \nposthumously, and Coretta Scott King in recognition of their \ncontributions to the Nation. Companion legislation was led in the House \nby Representative John Lewis.\n  We have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for \nall. We still, however, have work to do. In the names of Rosa Parks, \nSojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nand many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle \nof civil rights and human rights.\n  In closing, I would like to pay tribute to the Juneteenth directors \nand event coordinators throughout my State of Michigan. They have \nworked tirelessly in the planning of intergenerational activities in \nobservance of Juneteenth, heading up a wide range of activities over \nseveral days in Detroit, Flint, Holland, Lansing, Saginaw, and other \nareas around the State.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 148 years ago today Union troops arrived \nin Galveston, TX, to take possession of the State and enforce the \npromise of the Emancipation Proclamation.\n  It had been 2 months since General Lee's surrender at Appomattox \nCourthouse and more than 2 years since President Lincoln had issued the \nEmancipation Proclamation, but word of the proclamation's promise was \nonly now reaching those held in bondage in Texas.\n  With the reading of General Order No. 3 to the people of Galveston, \nthe last remaining slaves in the United States were officially free.\n  The date, June 19, 1865, has gone down in history as ``Juneteenth.'' \nIt is a day to celebrate the end of legalized slavery in America and to \nrededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle for true equality.\n  I can not think of a better day to welcome to the United States \nCapitol--at long last--a statue of Frederick Douglass.\n  The statue of the great abolitionist leader was welcomed in a \ndedication ceremony earlier today. The statue now stands, \nappropriately, in Emancipation Hall, the great hall of the Capitol \nVisitors Center.\n  The Frederick Douglass statue is only the fourth carved likeness of \nan African American to be displayed in the United States Capitol. It \njoins busts of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Douglass' \nfellow abolitionist leader, Sojourner Truth, and a statue of Rosa \nParks, which was dedicated 2 months ago.\n  Importantly, the Douglass statue is the first statue accepted by \nCongress from residents of the District of Columbia for display in the \nUnited States Capitol.\n  A federal law gives each State the right to display in the Capitol \ntwo statues of its distinguished residents. Although District of \nColumbia residents pay federal income taxes and serve in our Armed \nForces, they have no voting member in Congress and they had no statue \nin the Capitol, not one, until today.\n  By accepting the Frederick Douglass statue, Congress honors a great \nman and, I hope, moves closer to recognizing the rights of Washington, \nD.C. to be represented fairly in Congress.\n  Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton is Washington, D.C.'s only elected \nrepresentative in either House of Congress and is a distinguished \nchampion of freedom and equality in her own right.\n  She has been fighting for a dozen years for Washington, D.C.'s right \nto display two statues in the Capitol, the same as every State.\n  I was proud to include language in the fiscal 2013 Financial Services \nand General Government appropriations bill allowing the District to \ndisplay the Douglass statue in the Capitol. I hope that America's \ncapital city will have a second statue in the Capitol soon.\n  I can not think of a better or more distinguished choice for the \nDistrict's first statue than Frederick Douglass.\n  He was called ``the Lion of Anacostia,'' after the section of \nWashington where he lived for the last 23 years of his life.\n  He was a social reformer, a brilliant orator and writer, a statesman \nand a leader in the movement to abolish slavery in America.\n  Frederick Douglass knew that evil institution well. He was born into \nslavery as Frederick Bailey in Talbot County, MD, in 1818. Like many \nenslaved children at that time, he met his mother only a few times in \nhis life. His father was likely his mother's white owner.\n  When Frederick Douglass was 8 years old, he was sent to live with his \nowner's relative in Baltimore. She taught him the first letters of the \nalphabet but quit when she learned that it was illegal to teach a slave \nto read.\n  When he was 15, he was returned to his owner's farm, where he risked \nhis life to educate other slaves.\n  At the age of 20, Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery. Disguising \nhimself as a sailor, he boarded a train from Baltimore to New York \nCity.\n  It was in New York that he changed his name to Douglass, to avoid \nbeing captured.\n  In the north, Douglass began speaking publicly about the horrors of \nslavery. He carried his message throughout the country and to other \nnations.\n  He published a book, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, \ndescribing his life as a slave and his efforts to gain his freedom. The \nbook helped transform the debate over slavery--but it also forced \nDouglass to flee to Europe to avoid being recaptured under the Fugitive \nSlave Act.\n  He continued to speak about equal rights for all people in England, \nScotland and Ireland. Supporters in Great Britain were so deeply moved \nthat they purchased Douglass' freedom, allowing\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\nhim to return to the U.S. after more than 2 years abroad.\n  Upon returning, he settled in Rochester, NY, and began publishing The \nNorth Star, an uncompromising and highly regarded abolitionist \nnewspaper.\n  When the Civil War broke out, Douglass recruited African American \nsoldiers to fight for the Union Army.\n  His passionate writing and speeches are widely credited with \ninfluencing President Lincoln's evolving aims for the war--from simply \npreserving the Union to ending slavery in America for all time.\n  After the war, Frederick Douglass moved to Washington, D.C. He was \nappointed by Presidents to posts as U.S. Marshal for the District of \nColumbia, Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, U.S. Minister \nto Haiti and Charge d'Affaires to the Dominican Republic.\n  Frederick Douglass was a firm believer in the equality of all people, \nregardless of race or gender, whether Native American or immigrant.\n  He famously said: ``I would unite with anybody to do right and with \nnobody to do wrong.'' He also fought for voting rights and home rule \nfor residents of the District of Columbia\n  I hope that the new statue will encourage Members of Congress to \nfinish Frederick Douglass' fight for District residents to have self-\ngovernment and Congressional representation.\n  I will end with a story of the last time Frederick Douglass and \nAbraham Lincoln saw each other.\n  It was Inauguration Day 1865. After hearing President Lincoln deliver \nhis Second Inaugural Address at the Capitol, Frederick Douglass went to \nthe White House for a reception in the President's honor.\n  Police officers refused him entry at first. But President Lincoln got \nword that Douglass was at the door and instructed that he should be \nwelcomed in.\n  When President Lincoln saw Frederick Douglass, his face lit up and he \nsaid in a booming voice for all to hear: ``Here comes my friend \nDouglass.''\n  As we welcome the statue of this revered American to the United \nStates Capitol, we say: ``Here comes our friend Douglass.'' We are very \nglad you are finally here.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of \nSenator Levin's resolution celebrating the 148th anniversary of \nJuneteenth, the oldest commemoration of the end of slavery in the \nUnited States. On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, \nTX, to inform the slaves that they were free. Although the Emancipation \nProclamation had taken effect on January 1, 1863, nearly 2\\1/2\\ years \npassed before the message reached slaves in Texas and the Union troops \nenforced the President's order. Nearly 90 years after America's \nIndependence Day, Africans in America finally obtained their \nindependence from slavery. Juneteenth is a day when all Americans can \ncelebrate Black Americans' freedom and heritage.\n  The House of Representatives and Senate passed resolutions by voice \nvote in 2008 and 2009, respectively, apologizing for the injustice, \ncruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws. The \nresolutions acknowledged that African-Americans continue to suffer from \nthe complex interplay between slavery and Jim Crow long after both \nsystems were formally abolished. This suffering is both tangible and \nintangible, including the loss of human dignity, the frustration of \ncareers and professional lives, and the long-term loss of income and \nopportunity.\n  On this day, it is fitting to remember our Nation's painful history. \nMillions of Africans were torn from their homeland and brought to the \nAmericas as chattel. While it is unknown how many died during the \nMiddle Passage, it is estimated that 645,000 arrived in the United \nStates. My own State of Maryland had slaves. In 1790, more than 100,000 \nslaves, which would have been about one-third of the State's total \npopulation, lived in Maryland. Seventy years later, the 1860 Census \nindicated that there were more than 4 million slaves nationwide.\n  Despite Maryland's history of slavery, many Marylanders led the fight \nfor abolition. The Underground Railroad was a secret network that \nhelped enslaved men, women, and children escape to freedom. Its route \nthrough Maryland took passengers by boat up the Chesapeake Bay. Ships \ndeparted from the many towns located directly on the Bay and from \ncities on rivers that flowed into the bay, including Baltimore. Many \nships' pilots risked their own lives and livelihoods by hiding \npassengers' and helped them on their way.\n  Another route led slaves by land up along the Eastern Shore of \nMaryland and into Delaware, where they could cross into Pennsylvania \nand go north to freedom in Massachusetts, New York, and Canada. This \nwas the route used by Harriet Ross Tubman, a native of Dorchester \nCounty, MD. Tubman not only guided herself and her family to freedom \nthrough the Underground Railroad, she also made more than 19 trips to \nthe South to lead more than 300 slaves to freedom. She never lost a \n``passenger'' along the route.\n  Harriet Tubman's legacy lives on. She and the other brave men and \nwomen who manned the Underground Railroad are remembered as enduring \nsymbols of America's commitment to equality, justice, and freedom. They \nfought for the ideals that this country was founded upon despite the \nfact that their conditions were far from ideal. I have introduced the \nS. 247, the Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks Act, to create a \nnational park in Maryland that would extend north to New York, along \nthe path Tubman traveled to freedom. This legislation, when enacted, \nwill stand as a monument to all that Harriet Tubman risked her life \nfor. The tenacity with which she fought not only for her freedom but \nfor the freedom of her brothers and sisters is certainly something we \nshould remember and commemorate.\n  Juneteenth marked both the end of slavery in the United States and \nthe beginning of a long and arduous civil rights movement. In the years \nsince the first Juneteenth, our Nation has no doubt made considerable \nprogress, but many challenges remain. Discrimination, disparities, and \nracially motivated hate persist. We must confront these issues. We \ncannot ignore the disparities in health care that result in higher \npremature birth rates and reduced life expectancy for minority \npopulations. We cannot ignore discriminatory sentencing in our courts \nor discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. Racially \nmotivated police brutality and hate crimes cannot stand. We must \ncontinue to pursue justice in each of these areas, and for all \nAmericans.\n  We owe it to the legacy of our predecessors in the battle for racial \nequality to keep fighting injustice until the declaration that ``all \nmen are created equal\"' rings true. We cannot be complacent. As Martin \nLuther King, Jr. said, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice \neverywhere.'' We must continue to strive toward elimination of \ninequality so we can truly honor the spirit of Juneteenth.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, on June 19, 1865--2 years after \nPresident Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation Union \nsoldiers arrived in Galveston, TX, with news that the Civil War had \nfinally ended and the African Americans were free from slavery. This \nday marked the first time news of the emancipation had reached the \nsouthern-most tip of the old confederacy.\n  One hundred and forty-eight years later, in Colorado and across the \ncountry, we remember the importance of providing liberty and justice \nfor all and how embracing tolerance has helped our country to move away \nfrom the terrible legacy of slavery.\n  The impact of Juneteenth in 1865 has certainly reached beyond \nGalveston, TX. Across Colorado and the Nation, communities celebrate \nJuneteenth by recognizing the important progress our country has made \ntowards equality and acknowledging how far we still have to go. We do \nthis by remembering the heritage and struggles of African Americans and \ncommemorating their many achievements and contributions to our country. \nIn my home State of Colorado, for example, Pueblo celebrates its 33rd \nannual Juneteenth celebration by honoring active servicemembers and \nmilitary veterans, and Denver hosts the Juneteenth Music Festival one \nof the largest celebrations of Juneteenth in the country.\n  Celebrating this holiday is an important reminder of how our \ndifferences make us stronger. Juneteenth brings people together to \nreflect on our past\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nand look forward to our future where we will all finally achieve the \ndream Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., laid out almost 50 years ago--of \nbeing judged not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our \ncharacter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/19/senate-section/article/S4725-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.
