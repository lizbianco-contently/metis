Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 459, S. \n2578, the Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 459, S. 2578, a bill to \n     ensure that employers cannot interfere in their employees' \n     birth control and other health care decisions.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, there will be a period of morning business until 12 \nnoon today, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes each, with the time equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees. The majority will control the first \nhalf, the Republicans the final half.\n  At 12 noon today the Senate will proceed to executive session and to \na series of two rollcall votes on the following nominations: cloture on \nNorman C. Bay to be a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission and cloture on Cheryl A. LaFleur to be a member of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  Following the second vote, the Senate will recess until 2:15 p.m. to \nallow for our weekly caucus meetings. If cloture is invoked on either \nof the nominations, the time from 2:15 p.m. until 3 p.m. will be \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees. At 3 p.m., the Senate will proceed to vote on confirmation \nof the two nominations.\n\n\n         Measures Placed On The Calendar--S. 2599 and H.R. 4718\n\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are two bills at the \ndesk due for a second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The clerk will read the bills by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2599) to stop exploitation through trafficking.\n       A bill (H.R. 4718) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to modify and make permanent bonus depreciation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nrespect to both of these bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bills will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                            FERC Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, later today, as I have just mentioned, the \nSenate will hold two rollcall votes to confirm nominations to the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission--Norman Bay and Cheryl LaFleur.\n  I am aware of the important nature of these two nominations, and I \nrealize that their confirmations have significant consequences.\n  Upon her confirmation, Cheryl LaFleur will remain at the FERC as \nchair for 9 months. Following that period of time, Norman Bay will then \nassume the position of FERC chair.\n  I appreciate very much the work done by a number of Senators to get \nus to the point where we are. The chair of the energy committee, \nSenator Mary Landrieu, has done really hard work, and it has been a \nbipartisan effort to move these nominations forward.\n  I have been assured by both nominees that the issue which the Wall \nStreet Journal editorialized about yesterday--and they called it ``the \nfederal takeover of New York's electric grid''--will be addressed. I \nhave spoken to both nominees, and they will take a hard look at that. \nWhen it came out yesterday, I directed attention to that, and that will \nbe addressed by both of them, and they have said so.\n\n\n                          Hobby Lobby Decision\n\n  Mr. President, last week my friend, the Republican leader, \nessentially declared victory for American women in their struggle for \nequality by saying:\n\n       We've come a long way in pay equity and there are a ton of \n     women CEO's now running major companies. . . . I could be \n     wrong, but I think most of the barriers [for American women] \n     have been lowered.\n\n  The Republican leader seems to be suggesting the obstacles preventing \nwomen from receiving equal treatment under the law have been \nconquered--the struggle for equality for women is over.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  The only things missing from the Republican leader's declaration \nwould be an aircraft carrier and a large ``MISSION ACCOMPLISHED'' sign \nhanging in the background. We all remember that. Remember, that was \nPresident Bush declaring the war in Iraq was basically over. Well, it \nwas not. And the war regarding women is not over.\n  The Republican leader suggested that the notion of ensuring equal \nrights for American women is tantamount to ``preferential treatment.'' \nThat was his opinion. That is as shocking as it is troubling.\n  The truth is, regardless of what Republicans in Congress may say, the \nbarriers of inequality for American women are very real and very \nsubstantial. Take this as an example. There are many examples, but \nlet's try this one: The Republican leader mentioned pay equity. \nAmerican women are paid an average of 77 cents for every $1 their male \ncolleagues make for doing the exact same work. It is not fair. But \ninstead of working with Senate Democrats to give working women a fair \nshot at equal pay for equal work, Republicans refuse to even let the \nlegislation be debated. This was one of their multitude of filibusters.\n  The Republican leader also spoke of the growing number of women CEOs \nat major companies. Now try this one on: Currently, among Fortune \nMagazine's listing of the 500 top companies in the world, there are 24 \nchief executives who are women. That is 4.8 percent of all the CEOs in \nthe Fortune 500. If anyone believes--including my friend, the \nRepublican leader--that fewer than 1 in 20 is good enough, this \nperfectly illustrates the Republicans' antiquated beliefs concerning \nworking women and American women in general.\n  But perhaps the most disturbing reminder of the inequality barriers \nthat women face is the Supreme Court's recent Hobby Lobby decision. \nJust a few weeks ago, five men on the U.S. Supreme Court gave corporate \nbosses the right to interfere with their employees' decisions about \nbirth control.\n  In its Hobby Lobby decision, those five Justices ruled that for-\nprofit companies can assert religious objections to deny their \nemployees--who may not share their same religious views--the \ncontraceptive coverage required by law. That is what the Court said.\n  The Court's decision was stunningly wrong. The Court's misguided \ndecision effectively takes away the right of American women to decide \ntheir own health care, instead empowering boardrooms to make final \ndecisions on their employees' access to birth control.\n  How is it possible that in the 21st century we are debating whether \nor not bosses should be able to dictate their employees' family \nplanning? It is 2014. It is not 1906 or 1907 or 1915.\n  Health coverage is a form of payment or compensation for employees.\n  There is a strike going on in New York--they are going to start \nMonday, I am told--for the largest short-haul railroad. Mr. President, \n300,000 people ride that every day. What is the big sticking point? It \nis health care. Health care is a big deal to everybody. Health care is \na form of payment or compensation for employees. Should employers' \nreligious beliefs be able to dictate how you spend your paycheck and \nyour days off? Of course not. So why would we let bosses decide \nsomething so personal and so private as the use of contraceptives?\n  Last week Senators Patty Murray and Mark Udall introduced the Not My \nBoss's Business Act to fix the Hobby Lobby decision. This legislation \nwould make it illegal for any company to deny their workers specific \nhealth benefits, including birth control, as required by Federal law.\n  The Murray-Udall bill preserves the exemption for houses of worship \nand the accommodation for religious nonprofits that have religious \nobjections to contraceptive coverage.\n  The decision to use birth control is private--and it should be--and \nit should not be subject to the personal or religious beliefs of some \ncorporate boss; otherwise, where is it going to end? As Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg stated in her dissenting opinion:\n\n       Would the exemption . . . extend to employers with \n     religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions; \n     antidepressants; medications derived from pigs--\n\n  And there are medications derived from swine that help people get \nwell--\n\n     including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated \n     with gelatin; and vaccinations?\n\n  That is what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.\n  As Justice Ginsburg points out, the Court's decision is a very, very \nslippery slope. It opens the door to endless possibilities in which \ncorporate boardrooms trump employees' health coverage.\n\n  That is why I support this bill, which clearly establishes a woman's \nright to quality health care. By passing the Not My Boss's Business \nAct, the U.S. Senate can knock down a significant barrier to women's \nequality. Regardless of what Republicans in Congress will tell you, we \nhave a long, long way to go before American women are equal in all \naspects of the law, as they should be.\n  The bill before us is a step in the right direction. It will help \nundo the damage done by the Supreme Court. But, more importantly, the \nNot My Boss's Business Act will help ensure American women have access \nto the health coverage they need and deserve and should be entitled to \nby law.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we hear the President is planning to \nspend the week calling for Congress to pass highway funding legislation \nthat Congress is already planning to pass. It seems odd for the \nPresident to be focusing so intently on something that is inevitable \nwhile ignoring other issues that really should be addressed--issues \nsuch as ObamaCare.\n  So many middle-class families in my State and across the country \ncontinue to suffer from the impact of this law. One thing that becomes \nincreasingly clear with each passing day is the extent--the extent--to \nwhich ObamaCare is particularly hard on women.\n  Research shows that women make about 80 percent of the health care \ndecisions for their families in our country. Yet ObamaCare has caused \ncountless women to lose the health care plans they had and liked. When \nthese women first spoke out about the betrayal they felt when they lost \ntheir plans, many of the law's supporters simply waved their concerns \naway or said they were making it up. They said they were lying or that \ntheir plans were ``junk''--because, of course, the critics knew better. \nIt is a pattern that seems to have continued ever since.\n  American women also now have fewer choices of doctors and hospitals \nunder ObamaCare. The bill's supporters have continually waived those \nconcerns aside too.\n  Millions of Americans use flexible spending accounts to pay for out-\nof-pocket health care expenses. But ObamaCare imposes arbitrary limits \non how much of a family's own hard-earned money can be set aside, and \nthe law also prevents people who have come to depend on FSAs from using \nthem to pay for common expenses such as allergy medicine or cold \nmedication.\n  ObamaCare's cuts to Medicare Advantage and other regulatory actions \ncould reduce the average benefit for women and men who rely on this \nprogram by more than $1,500 a year. Concerns such as these are all \nsimply brushed aside by ObamaCare's supporters.\n  Washington should also be looking for ways to grow economic \nopportunities for women, but ObamaCare, of course, does just the \nopposite. I have heard from businesses large and small in Kentucky that \nfear they will not be able to cope with the higher costs of coverage \nunder ObamaCare. They do not want to cut hours for their staffs or \neliminate jobs, but many may no longer really have a choice.\n  Many of them are worried about new mandates that place millions of \nAmericans--nearly two-thirds of them women--at risk of having their \nhours and wages reduced. One of my constituents from Somerset recently \nwrote to tell me what this new ObamaCare mandate has meant for her.\n\n       I'm employed at a major chain putting these rules into \n     effect now. This is causing us to lose up to eleven hours per \n     week averaging $440.00 . . . [less] per month less in wages. \n     Obamacare [is] causing us to lose hours [and] lose wages, yet \n     expecting us to spend more.\n\n  Let me repeat that. She says ObamaCare is causing her to lose \nhundreds of dollars a month in lost wages and at the same time causing \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\ncare costs to skyrocket. This is simply not right.\n  Yet despite these terrible stories that keep pouring into our \noffices, the people who supported this law when it passed continue to \ndefend it now. We kept warning them that ObamaCare would hurt jobs and \nincrease costs. They had to know ObamaCare was going to reduce choices \nfor women and limit their access to certain doctors and hospitals. But \nWashington Democrats voted for ObamaCare anyway. They created these \nproblems. That is why they should be working with Republicans now to \nstart over with real, patient-centered reform that lowers costs and \nthat women and men in this country actually want, but of course they \nrefuse. They are just doubling down on ObamaCare.\n  Now they are trying to convince people of another untruth--that \nsomehow it is not possible to preserve our Nation's long tradition of \ntolerance and respect for people of faith while at the same time \npreserving a woman's ability to make her own decisions about \ncontraception. Washington Democrats are doing this based on a claim \nthat, in the words of the Washington Post's nonpartisan Fact Checker, \nis ``simply wrong''\n  I realize Democrats may think the best way to keep people from \nfocusing on the impact of ObamaCare on middle-class families is to just \nmake things up and to attempt to divide us. Well, I think that is a \nshame. It takes a pretty dim view of what we are capable of as a \ncountry. The goal here should not be to protect the freedoms of some \nwhile denying the freedoms of others; the goal here and always should \nbe to preserve everybody's freedoms. We can do both. That is just what \na number of us on this side are proposing to do this week. Instead of \nrestricting Americans' religious freedoms, we should preserve a woman's \nability to make contraceptive decisions for herself. That is why we \nplan to introduce legislation this week that says no employer can block \nany employee from legal access to her FDA-approved contraceptives. \nThere is no disagreement on that fundamental point. The American people \nknow that. They know Democrats are just attempting to offer another \nfalse choice. What we are saying is that of course you can support both \nreligious freedom and access to contraception.\n  Look, if Washington Democrats really wanted to help women, they would \nwork with us to do so. We have been imploring them to work with us to \ndeliver relief to middle-class women for years now, to work with us on \na new approach to the health care law that is hurting millions of \nAmerican women. It is not too late. Work with us to increase jobs, \nwages, and opportunity at a time when American women are experiencing \nso much hardship as a result of this administration's policies--\nespecially ObamaCare.\n\n\n                             Bay Nomination\n\n  I would like to voice my opposition to the nomination of Norman Bay \nto be a Commissioner of and eventually lead the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, or FERC. I fail to see what qualifies Mr. Bay to \nbe Chairman of the Commission, especially when the Acting Chair of \nFERC, whom he would displace, is much more qualified to hold the \nposition. Unlike most FERC Commissioners in the last decade, he has \nnever served as a State utility regulator, he has never served on the \nCommission and does not possess the background in policy areas that \nFERC is charged with overseeing.\n  In contrast to Mr. Bay, the current Acting Chair of FERC, Cheryl \nLaFleur, is much more qualified to hold the Chair position. Ms. LaFleur \ncame to FERC with more than two decades of experience in the electric \nand natural gas industries, including roles as chief operating officer, \ngeneral counsel, and acting CEO of National Grid USA and its \npredecessor. I find it shameful that this administration would seek to \ndisplace a well-qualified woman in favor of a male nominee with less \nexperience.\n  More importantly and of utmost concern to my home State, there are \nfactors that lead us to believe Mr. Bay would reliably serve as a \nrubberstamp for this administration's extreme anticoal agenda. This \nagenda harms the people of Kentucky and is one I most strenuously \noppose.\n  As the current head of FERC's enforcement office, he has shown a \nhistory of targeting carbon-intensive businesses. Who is to say that if \ninstalled as the next head of FERC, he will not come after Kentucky \nbusinesses relying on the coal industry for electricity, which is 90 \npercent of my State.\n  Moreover, during his testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee this past May, Bay cited his home State of New \nMexico as an example of a real-life ``all of the above'' approach to \nenergy. He mentioned his State's reliance on solar, wind, oil, and gas \nfor its energy mix. Notably left out of this supposed ``all of the \nabove'' approach, however, was any mention of coal--which, by the way, \nprovides 70 percent of the electricity in New Mexico.\n  For all of these reasons--because he is not qualified, because he \nholds an anticoal agenda, and because he will be only too willing to \nimplement this administration's anticoal policy--I will be opposing \nNorman Bay's nomination to FERC. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4463-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nrepercussions of the Supreme Court's misguided Hobby Lobby decision \nwhich allows employers to refuse to cover contraception as a part of \ntheir employees' health plans under the false pretense that \ncorporations can not only have religious beliefs but they can impose \nthose beliefs on their employees.\n  Several days ago I was home in the great State of Colorado. I stood \nshoulder to shoulder with experts in women's health care who joined me \nto highlight how the Hobby Lobby decision is already negatively \naffecting women in our State.\n  One Denver-based OB-GYN explained how physicians might now have to \nconsider an employer's religious beliefs when making medical \nrecommendations. She said the Court's decision fundamentally interferes \nwith health care decisions that should be based solely on a patient's \nwell-being.\n  Because of the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision, women across America \nare now facing the uncertainty that their bosses may restrict the \nhealth care benefits Federal law currently secures for them.\n  Birth control has been deemed an essential preventive health service \nby a nonpartisan independent group of doctors and other medical \nexperts. Ninety-nine percent of American women have used birth control \nat some point in their lives. They use it for a variety of health \nreasons. In fact, just hours after Senator Murray and I introduced \nlegislation in response to the Hobby Lobby decision, a Colorado mother \ncalled my office to share the story of how her college-age daughter was \nsuffering from a health condition that was so debilitating that it kept \nher from attending class or really participating in any activities at \nschool. As a result, her doctor prescribed a form of birth control that \nended up managing her symptoms and getting her back on track. This \nColorado mother wanted to make sure I knew that access to contraception \nis not just about birth control and that if her employer took away the \ncontraception coverage in her family's health plan, her daughter would \nnot have coverage for a medically necessary treatment.\n  Regardless of why women take birth control, none of those reasons \nhave any connection to how they do their jobs. Their bosses have no \nbusiness interfering in those decisions. But with the Court's ruling in \nHobby Lobby, corporations and CEOs have been handed\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nthe right to play the role of gatekeeper for what kind of health care \nemployees and their families can access as a part of their health \ninsurance plan. That is not acceptable to Coloradans.\n  I have heard the arguments from those who say the Supreme Court's \ndecision narrowly protects religious freedom. I think we can all agree \nthat where religious freedoms are being threatened, we as Americans \nhave a duty to act swiftly to address it. But the fact is that actual \nreligious institutions are already exempt from requirements that run \ncontrary to their beliefs. Remember, the men and women who went to work \nfor Hobby Lobby signed up to work at a craft store, not a religious \norganization.\n  This decision, in the words of Justice Ginsburg, is one of startling \nbreadth. In the Hobby Lobby majority opinion, the Supreme Court said \nits decision only applied to ``closely held'' corporations, but up to \n90 percent of American companies are considered closely held and over \nhalf of Americans work for a closely held company. To call this \ndecision ``narrow'' is as wrong as the reasoning behind it.\n  Contrary to what supporters of the decision are saying, this is just \nnot about contraceptives. We have been warned by legal experts, \nincluding Justice Ginsburg and the other three Justices who joined in \nher dissent, that this decision could lead to employers discriminating \nagainst women, minority groups, and others because a company's owner \nmay object to any number of medications or procedures, such as vaccines \nor HIV treatment.\n  Just over 2 short weeks ago, before the Hobby Lobby decision, workers \nknew exactly what health services they had access to under their health \nplans. They did not need to be labor lawyers to figure out which \nbenefits they would receive, which benefits they might be at risk of \nlosing, or how much more they would have to pay out of pocket for \nprescription drugs or other critical health treatments. However, with \nthe Hobby Lobby case, that has all changed.\n  Supporters of the Hobby Lobby decision want women to believe this is \nnot a big deal. But let me be clear. This has the potential to change \nhealth coverage for millions of women. I am not--along with millions of \nAmericans--going to stand for this kind of discrimination. I trust \nwomen to make their own health care decisions. I do not believe their \nemployers should have a say in that. Through their hard work and \ninsurance premiums, women have earned and already paid for coverage \nthat includes copay-free contraception under Federal law. Health \ninsurance is a part of their compensation packages. There is nothing \nfree about it; they have earned it.\n\n  Not only does this case wedge bosses into private health care \ndecisions, it unfairly burdens hard-working women, ignoring the fact \nthat contraception can be crucial to women and families' economic \nsuccess. The ability to decide when, how, and with whom to have a \nfamily is critical to the health and economic security of women and \ntheir families.\n  The Supreme Court even stated this in its opinion in Planned \nParenthood v. Casey in 1992. I wish to quote the Supreme Court from \n1992:\n\n       The ability of women to participate equally in the economic \n     and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their \n     ability to control their reproductive lives.\n\n  That is what the Court said in 1992.\n  Today many employees are left wondering if that economic freedom is \nin jeopardy. Women are left to ask their bosses whether they will \ncontinue to cover their birth control--a topic of conversation which \nwomen should never be forced to bring up at work, an issue which is \ncertainly not a boss's business.\n  Throughout my time in Congress I have long believed we all have the \nfundamental right to live our lives as we choose, free from needless \nintrusion, whether by the government, by bureaucrats, or by \ncorporations and CEOs, and certainly free from intrusion by \npoliticians. Indeed, a women should be free to make her own health \ndecisions based on what is right for her and her family, not according \nto her employer's religious beliefs.\n  So the reason I am standing here today is to make very clear that \nthis type of intrusion will not stand. I am proud to lead the effort \nwith Senator Murray to ensure that employers cannot refuse to cover \nhealth services guaranteed to women under Federal law.\n  Our bill, the Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act, \nwould restore a woman's power to make personal health care decisions \nbased on what is best for her and her family, free from corporate \ninterference. I invite my colleagues of both parties to join this \neffort, and I thank my colleagues who will stand with Senator Murray \nand me this week to say: Women's health care is not your boss's \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join with the \nsenior Senator from Colorado, and I thank him for his excellent \nstatement and leadership on this issue as we kick off this important \ndebate on our bill, the Protect Women's Health From Corporate \nInterference Act, or, as we just heard, the ``Not My Boss's Business \nAct.''\n  I start off by asking our colleagues a few basic questions: First of \nall, who should be in charge of a woman's health care decisions? Should \nit be the woman making those decisions with her partner, her doctor, \nand her faith or should it be her boss making those decisions for her \nbased on his own religious beliefs?\n  To me and to the vast majority of the people across the country, the \nanswer to that question is obvious: Women should call the shots when it \ncomes to their health care decisions--not their boss, not the \ngovernment, not anyone else, period. But we are here because five men \non the Supreme Court disagreed.\n  Five men on the Supreme Court decided there should be a group of \nwomen across America who are required to ask their boss for permission \nto access basic health care. Five men on the Supreme Court decided a \ncorporation should have more rights than the women it employs. Five men \non the Supreme Court rolled back the clock on women across America, and \nwe are here today because we cannot allow that to stand. People across \nthe country think the Supreme Court was dead wrong on this decision, \nand we are here to be their voice.\n  When we passed health care reform, we made sure every woman has \naccess to basic health care, including contraception, which is used or \nwill be used by 99 percent of the women in this country. When 58 \npercent of women use birth control for purposes other than pregnancy \nprevention--including managing endometriosis, ovarian cysts, and other \nmedical conditions--we know this provision could have a sweeping impact \non women across our country. In fact, according to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, 30 million women nationally are already \neligible for this benefit, and when the law is fully implemented, 47 \nmillion women nationally will have access to no-pay birth control, \nthanks to the Affordable Care Act. By the way, thanks to this benefit, \nwomen have already saved $483 million, and that is just in the last \nyear alone.\n  Contraception was included as a required preventive service in the \nAffordable Care Act on the recommendation of the independent nonprofit \nInstitute of Medicine and other medical experts because it is essential \nto the health of women and families. After many years of research, we \nknow ensuring access to effective birth control has a direct impact on \nimproving the lives of women and their families in America. It is \ndirectly linked to declines in maternal and infant mortality, to \nreduced risk of ovarian cancer, to better health outcomes for women \nand, by the way, far fewer unintended pregnancies and abortions, which \nis a goal we all should share.\n  We should all know improving access to birth control is a good health \ncare policy and it is good economic policy. We know it will mean \nhealthier women, healthier children, and healthier families, and we \nknow it will save money for businesses and consumers. But with their \nruling, setting a potential dangerous precedent, the Supreme Court has \nnot only inserted a woman's boss into her health care decisions, in \nmany cases they have given him the final word.\n  In the aftermath of this decision, women across America are turning \nto\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\nCongress and demanding we fix this. And by the way it is not just women \nwho want Congress to act. People across the country understand, if \nbosses can deny birth control, then they can deny vaccines or HIV \ntreatment or other basic health care services for employees and for \ntheir dependents. I think what men across America understand is it is \nnot just the female employees who are impacted, it is their wives and \ntheir daughters who are on their health care plan as well.\n  As the ink was still drying on Justice Alito's misguided opinion in \nthis case, I made an unwavering commitment to do everything I could to \nprotect women's access to health care since the five male Justices of \nthe Supreme Court decided they would not. That is why I have been \nworking with my partner, the senior Senator from Colorado, to introduce \nthis bill, and I am proud that in the many days since then we have \nreceived such strong support from people across the country.\n  Our straightforward and simple legislation will ensure that no CEO or \ncorporation can come between people and their guaranteed access to \nhealth care, period.\n  This shouldn't be a controversial issue. The only controversy about \nbirth control is the fact that it is 2014 and women across America are \nstill fighting for this basic health care.\n  The data is clear. Ensuring access to contraceptive coverage isn't \njust the right thing to do, it is a critical part of making sure women \nand their families have a fair shot. In the 21st century, women and \ntheir families shouldn't be held back by outdated policies and unfair \npractices.\n  Again, it is not just about access to contraception. This includes \npay equity, access to childcare, higher minimum wage, and it absolutely \nincludes the right to make their own medical and religious decisions \nwithout being dictated to or limited by their employer.\n  The bottom line is this: Women use birth control for a host of \nreasons, none of which should require a permission slip from their \nboss.\n  I thank Leader Reid for moving this bill to the floor so quickly and \nfor his commitment to getting this done because women across the \ncountry are expecting action. They do not want to wait. As we move \nforward on this bill this week, I hope enough Republicans can put \nproven science over their partisan politics and join us and revoke this \nCourt-issued license to discriminate and return the right of Americans \nto make their own decisions about their own health care and their own \nbodies.\n\n  I thank Senator Udall once again for his work with me on this \ncommonsense and bicameral legislation. I also thank the Members of the \nHouse Pro-Choice Caucus who introduced their companion legislation in \nthe House, and I sincerely hope our Republican colleagues on both sides \nof the Capitol will join us. For those who don't, for those Republicans \nwho have already said they oppose our legislation, I am interested in \nhearing their answer to the question I posed a few minutes ago: Do they \nthink bosses should be in charge of a woman's health care decision? Do \nthey think women should have to ask their boss permission for health \ncare used by 99 percent of the women? Do they think we as a country \nshould start down the path where CEOs and corporations can start making \ndecisions for all kinds of health care for their employees?\n  Women across the country will be watching this debate, and I think \nthey will be very interested in seeing who is on their side.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). No objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise to support the ``Not My Boss's \nBusiness Act,'' which will help to fix the recent Supreme Court Hobby \nLobby decision by making it illegal for a company to deny their workers \nspecific health care benefits, including birth control, as is required \nto be covered by Federal law.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill which is \nnecessary to ensure that all women have access to preventive care.\n  I wish to say, on a personal note, I was a young child growing up in \na household with a working mother. Mom worked for a big corporation and \nworked in human resources. My table would often be one where it was \ndiscussed that my mother was dealing with challenges of racial \ndiscrimination, challenges of sexism in the workplace. I watched how my \nmother, in human resources, would fight to make sure that we as a \nnation, as well as this particular corporation, continued to advance in \nfairly treating all of its employees. I was proud to watch my mother \nassert her independence, her freedoms, and her basic sense of equity, \nwhich resonates with the highest values of this Nation.\n  What is frustrating to me now is here we stand in 2014, and we seem \nto be fighting so many battles and advancements we won before that are \nstill needing to be fought.\n  It is unthinkable to me that as we should be turning our focus toward \nother things such as paid family leave or raising the minimum wage, \nhere we are again fighting about whether women should have the right to \nhave access to birth control. This is unfortunate because contraception \nis essential to a woman's right to make her own personal health care \ndecisions. Birth control is not only basic to making health care \ndecisions, but it is one in which 99 percent of women avail themselves. \nThroughout their lifetime we will see 99 percent of American women \navail themselves of birth control.\n  These women should not be forced to decide between contraception and \na tank of gas or between contraception and meals for their family, \ncontraception and paying rent.\n  The Hobby Lobby decision, if you think about it, is imposing the will \nof a corporation--one corporation's board member's religious beliefs or \nwhat-have-you can be imposed such that it would cost women who now want \nto exercise their freedom up to $1,000 a year. For minimum-wage or low-\nwage workers, the out-of-pocket cost for birth control each month is a \nreal and substantive financial burden.\n  Let's be clear. Workers have insurance coverage through their labor. \nIt is part of their earned pay. This is not a free giveaway. They \nearned this coverage. What they spend their health care coverage on is \ntheir business, not their boss's business.\n  I deeply value ideals of religious liberty. This is what this country \nwas founded on. But religious liberty belongs to all of us; it does not \nbelong to a corporation. Religious liberty means being free from having \nother people's religions foisted upon you, imposed upon you, or forced \nupon you.\n  Most employees would never dream of telling their bosses what they \nmust decide and abide by in terms of religious freedom. And by that \nsame principle, no boss should have the right to impose his religion on \nthe people who work for him.\n  That is one of the reasons why so many faith leaders have spoken \nagainst the Hobby Lobby decision. It is now making it acceptable for a \ncorporation to impose on the individual liberty of others their \nreligious beliefs, also the financial freedom that goes along with \nthat, and also the ability for a woman to make critical health care \ndecisions. They might even be interfering with a doctor telling a \npatient what is best for them and their health.\n  The views held by companies' owners should not be able to interfere \nwith this basic understanding of fundamental rights. The Not My Boss's \nBusiness Act protects workers' religious liberty by not allowing their \nbosses to impose this hardship, to impose their religion, and to impose \nwhat I believe ultimately comes down to discrimination.\n  Finally, the precedent set by this decision could open the door wider \nand wider for more court cases and more employers who want to deny more \naspects of basic health coverage and services because they claim it \nconflicts with the boss's religious beliefs. From blood transfusions to \nvaccinations, we are now in a minefield in which we can have the \ndestruction of religious freedom of employees and the health care \nfreedom we have fought so hard to manifest.\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\n  The Hobby Lobby decision is a step backward that we must correct. It \nis a step against women's rights. It is a step against religious \nfreedom. It is a step against workers who earn basic benefits to have \nthe ability to make those benefits real in their lives.\n  The Not My Boss's Business Act will make it clear that bosses cannot \ndiscriminate. The Not My Boss's Business Act will make it clear that \nthere should be equal treatment under the law for the tens of thousands \nof workers whose coverage now hangs in the balance.\n  A woman's health care decisions should be between that woman and her \ndoctor. There is no room for a boss's religious beliefs in that \nequation, period.\n  I watched for decades, growing up, not only my mother but countless \npeople fight to establish basic principles in the workplace. We cannot \ngo back now. This is such a critical piece of legislation, to correct \nfor the mistakes in this Supreme Court decision and assert those \nfundamental American ideals, that individuals should be able to make \ntheir own health care decisions, that bosses and corporations should \nnot impose religious beliefs on others, and that we are a nation where \nevery woman can create a sacrosanct and private relationship with her \ndoctor and make ultimately the health care decisions that are best for \nher, not ones in any way influenced or affected by a corporation.\n  I thank again the Senate and the Presiding Officer for this time but, \nmost importantly, I thank Senator Murray and other Senators who have \nled on this issue. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am proud to follow my colleague from New Jersey, and I \nam proud to say I am a cosponsor of Senator Murray's bill and Senator \nUdall's bill, the Udall-Murray bill, that is going to make sure we \nprotect the health of our families.\n  I am going to put up a beautiful photograph of the Supreme Court \nwhere above the portico these words are inscribed: ``Equal Justice \nUnder Law.'' We have reprinted them here. I am going to keep this for \nthe remainder of my remarks, because I think that is the essential \nissue before us. Those four words are the promise of our country that \nevery American should be treated equally, should be respected, should \nbe honored.\n  I wish to note that these words don't say: Equal justice under law \nexcept for women. They don't say: Equal justice under law except for \nbirth control. And they don't say: Equal justice under law as long as \nit is OK with your boss.\n  The beauty of this Nation is we respect each other's rights and \nfreedoms, and we have shed blood to make sure those freedoms are \nprotected.\n  Yet with this Hobby Lobby ruling, five men, who happen to be \nappointed by Republicans, decided that a corporation has the power to \ndeny me or to deny you coverage of critical health care for us and for \nour families.\n  What is very upsetting to me is that they have seized on the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 to justify giving for-profit \ncompanies the sweeping power to deny their employees access to \naffordable birth control, and we believe it will prove to be other \nhealth care benefits required under Federal law.\n  I speak as someone who voted for the Kennedy bill, the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, that if anybody thinks Ted Kennedy wanted to \ndeny access for birth control, then they didn't know Ted Kennedy and \nthey didn't read at all the Record as we debated that bill.\n  I voted for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it was \nwritten to protect an individual's freedom of religion so that if I, as \na religious individual working for a corporation, don't want to use the \nbirth control coverage, I don't have to. But if I want to, I make that \nchoice. If I, as an independent individual, want to vaccinate my child, \nit is covered under law, under the insurance. I can if I want to. No \none can force me to do that.\n  The idea behind the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was to protect \nthe individual, and I quote: ``Government shall not substantially \nburden a person's exercise of religion.''\n  Let me repeat: ``a person's exercise of religion.'' It doesn't say a \ncorporation's exercise of religion, your boss's exercise of his \nreligion. It was about protecting the individual.\n  What the conservative majority of the Court did 2 weeks ago turned \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act on its head. As someone who \nsupported that act, it made me angry, sad--put in the adjective. It is \nwrong to reinterpret what a law meant. It stood the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act on its head when they ruled a corporation can put its \nown ideology ahead of the religious freedom and health care needs of \nits employees.\n  A female employee should be able to decide whether to use birth \ncontrol. And that is not all that is at stake after the Hobby Lobby \ndecision, because we know if you follow their logic that if a \ncorporation can deny birth control because of a religious objection, \nwhat if they object to a blood transfusion? There are certain religions \nthat do. Then the employee can't get a blood transfusion. And what if \nthey object to a vaccine or HIV treatment? Then, in order for employees \nto have access to those treatments, they wouldn't have the insurance. \nWe all know, from looking at the real world, if you don't have \ninsurance, these treatments become very expensive and you may not be \nable to avail yourselves of them.\n  Chief Justice John Roberts, during oral arguments in the Hobby Lobby \ncase, made it clear that Congress can fix this and override the Court's \ndecision, and I agree. That is why I am so thankful to Senator Murray \nand Senator Udall for working so hard and so fast so we can have the \nremedy right now. It is important that we act fast. People are very \nconfused out there as to what they can count on in their insurance \ncoverage.\n  We are going to have a vote on this tomorrow. It is a cloture vote to \nend debate so we can actually get to a vote on the substance. Sadly, it \nmeans we need 60 votes, a supermajority. But I hope and frankly pray \nthat we get those 60 votes because we need to protect women's health.\n  The Murray-Udall bill is called the Protect Women's Health from \nCorporate Interference Act, but they have nicknamed it Not My Boss's \nBusiness Act, which I like. It is not my boss's business what I decide \nto do.\n  It would require employers to follow the Federal law when offering \nhealth insurance to their employees, notwithstanding the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act which, as I said, I believe the Court stood on \nits head. It was meant to protect individuals, not corporations, not \nyour boss.\n  The bill says corporations cannot hide behind the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act to deny their workers coverage to the benefits we have \nin law. More than 180 House and Senate lawmakers have cosponsored this \nbill so far, and I hope our colleagues will vote for it.\n  I was saying we need to act fast because there is confusion out \nthere. Virtually so many women rely on birth control at some point in \ntheir lives, it is amazing. Sixty percent of women who take birth \ncontrol, 6.5 million American women, do so in whole or in part to treat \npainful and difficult medical conditions.\n  Let me say that again. One may take a birth control pill for birth \ncontrol, but there are many other uses for that pill; 1.5 million women \nout of the 6.5 million who use it, at least in part for other \nconditions, use it solely as a medication to treat those painful and \ndifficult conditions.\n  By allowing employers to deny coverage for contraception, the Court \nis depriving many women and families of health care. Surveys have shown \nthat 55 percent of young women, aged 18 to 34, struggle to afford birth \ncontrol, which can cost as much as $600 per year. Maybe the Supreme \nCourt Justices in their ivory tower think that is not a lot of money, \nbut let me state, for women working the minimum wage, even for women \nearning more than the minimum wage, it is quite a hit to their \npocketbooks.\n  Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out in her dissent that a woman earning \nthe minimum wage would spend nearly an entire month's wage to get an \nIUD, $1,000. Imagine. This case has unjustly singled out women's health \nservices.\n  I have to make a note here. I do not know of any employer that is \ndropping coverage for Viagra. I don't. I have\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nasked around. I have been on TV, I have invited folks to let me know. \nOh, no, Viagra is fine; birth control is not fine. Just put the pieces \ntogether yourself. I think this decision discriminates against women, \nand in the slippery slope argument you are going to see it affect \neveryone. And we need to listen to the women who rely on birth control \nto improve their health and the health of their families. Let me tell \nyou a few stories. Raquel from Sacramento was diagnosed with non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma in 2010. After her treatment her doctors told her \nshe needed to use birth control to ensure she did not become pregnant \nfor the next 3 years because she was really sick. Luckily, her employer \ncovers birth control and now, happily, 4 years later she is pregnant \nwith her first child. What could have happened to her if she had gone \nthrough an unintended pregnancy? It could have been pretty devastating. \nWhat if she had worked for a different employer who refused to offer \nher that birth control? Her health and the health of her child would \nhave been at risk and that would have been tragic. So let's listen to \nher.\n\n  Let's listen to Katherine from Pleasant Hill, CA, who relies on birth \ncontrol after having her first child.\n\n       Both my husband and I want to be the best possible parents \n     for our son, and having another child so soon would hurt our \n     ability to do that. A variety of affordable birth control \n     options are crucial for me and for all first-time moms like \n     me!\n\n  Many years ago I was on the board of Planned Parenthood, and what we \nsaid all the time was that our dream was that every child be a wanted \nchild--a wanted child. As a parent myself and as a grandparent I tell \nyou right now it takes a lot to raise a child. Hillary Clinton said it \ntakes a village. It certainly takes loving parents, and it takes a \nloving family. It certainly costs money, and it certainly takes energy.\n  We want our families to be healthy. We want our families to be \nproductive, and birth control is a success story. It breaks my heart \nthat women just like Katherine who work at Hobby Lobby and other for-\nprofit corporations now could be denied access to affordable health \ncare unless we fix this.\n  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was not about giving your boss \nthe power over you like this. It was about giving you the right to make \nyour own choices and decisions. We need to listen to women like Ariana \nin Redding, CA, who wrote:\n\n       I am a recent college graduate trying to make ends meet and \n     pay off my student loans. It is a great relief to know I can \n     get the birth control I need without a copay.\n\n  These are real stories. If the boss doesn't like that you choose \nbirth control, that is his right. If he wants to sit down with his \ndaughter and tell her his religious objection, and if she agrees with \nhim, that is fine. I mean, that is what America is about. But don't \ntake your religious beliefs, your ideology, your biases, your \nprejudices, and your opinions and foist them on your employees. That is \nnot this country. That is not what we are about.\n  Shouldn't we care more about the rights of women and their families \nthan the rights of a few employers who can exercise that in their \nfamilies? This bill we are going to vote on is critical, and I hope it \nwon't die as a result of partisanship. We have to rise above \npartisanship around here.\n  ``Equal justice under law''--that is what it says over the portico. \nAnd frankly, there is another issue. If you look at what has happened \nto the rates of abortion since we have seen more use of birth control, \nthey are going down. There has been a study in one of our Nation's big \ncities that proved that because there was broad use of birth control, \nabortions went down by 50 percent. Imagine. So if that is our concern \nregardless of whether we are pro-choice or not, we shouldn't be \nembracing decisions that make it more difficult for women to get access \nto birth control.\n  So equal justice under the law doesn't say: ``except for women.'' It \ndoesn't say: ``except if my boss disagrees with me.'' It is pretty \nbeautiful. It is pretty clear. It is something that we have to respect. \nIt is for the ages, and tomorrow we are going to see if our colleagues \nagree. Every Senator must take a stand tomorrow for individual liberty. \nWhen we vote tomorrow, let's be reminded: Women are watching. The \nAmerican people will hold each of us accountable if we fail to protect \ntheir rights and their ability to decide what is best for their \nfamilies.\n  I have been around a while. I was around when one of the Bushes was \nactually on the board of Planned Parenthood--George Herbert Walker \nBush. Suddenly this issue is back--birth control--and suddenly we are \narguing over it again.\n  So I say this. I may be wearing a white jacket, but it is not a white \ndoctor's coat. I am not a doctor, and I don't want to put myself, as a \npolitician, in between a woman and her doctor or in between a family \nand their doctor. Let's leave important health care choices where they \nbelong: with women, with families, with doctors, and not with \npoliticians, in the Senate or Justices sitting in a courtroom.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4467-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King).

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Protect Women's \nHealth From Corporate Interference Act, to stand up for what I thought \nwas a commonly shared value--that a woman's health care decisions are \nbetween her and her doctor, not her and her boss. I thought that was \nwell-established, straightforward--simple, even.\n  But it turns out that the majority of the Supreme Court thought \ndifferently when it came to certain kinds of health care decisions: \nwhether a woman would have access to contraceptives without copays as \nguaranteed by Federal law. As we all know now, 2 weeks ago the Supreme \nCourt held in Hobby Lobby that an employer's personal beliefs can trump \nsome of the most private and significant health care decisions a woman \nmakes.\n  So let me be very clear on where I stand: What kind of birth control \na female employee uses is not her boss's business.\n  I have heard some of the supporters of the Supreme Court decision \nargue that ruling is a narrow ruling, and that it only applies to \nclosely held family businesses. That doesn't tell the whole story \nbecause just 3 days after this ruling in Hobby Lobby the Court said \nthat a nonprofit religious college didn't have to comply with a \ncontraceptive coverage requirement even though it had already had an \naccommodation that allowed it to avoid paying for such coverage itself.\n  The majority even pointed to this accommodation in the Hobby Lobby \nruling as an example of a less restrictive alternative that could be \nopen to for-profit businesses. A few days later that same accommodation \nwasn't good enough.\n  In her dissent Justice Sotomayor wrote:\n\n       Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe that \n     they can take us at our word. Not so today.\n\n  In other words, in less than a week the Supreme Court's conservative \nmajority went from issuing a supposedly narrow ruling to potentially \nbroadening it to encompass a new class of institutions. The impact of \nthe ruling in Hobby Lobby will most definitely not be limited to those \nclosely held businesses, as some say. I have heard others argue, in \nessence: Don't worry. The ruling doesn't expressly ban access to \ncontraceptives. It just shifts the additional cost of the coverage back \nto the women.\n  But those who say erecting a barrier of cost between a woman and \nbirth control will give her the same access she had before the decision \ndon't understand what women have to go through to get covered and don't \nunderstand the many reasons why women use birth control. Since the \ncoverage requirement went into effect last year, the number of women \nwho got their birth\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\ncontrol without a copay jumped from 14 percent to 56 percent. That \nmeans some serious costs were avoided for many women.\n  The average annual savings for women last year was $269. In total, \nwomen in the United States saved $483 million on contraceptives, thanks \nto the Affordable Care Act. Among those women were 917,000 in North \nCarolina alone who were eligible for preventive services without \nadditional copays. Many of these women sought and used birth control \nmedications for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with planning \npregnancy. In fact, oral contraceptives are a key treatment for at \nleast three major medical conditions that affect women. Polycystic \novary syndrome affects 5 to 10 percent of women of reproductive age, \nand if left untreated can lead to the development of ovarian cysts or \ninfertility. In addition, 11 percent of women are affected by \nendometriosis in their lifetime, and 40,000 women each year are \ndiagnosed with endometrial cancer. Many women are at risk of developing \novarian cancer--one of the most deadly cancers in the United States--\nand women with ovarian cancer also can receive treatment via birth \ncontrol. And yes, one of the best known ways to reduce the risk of \nthese conditions is birth control.\n  Employers who make their female employees pay out of pocket for \ncontraceptives aren't just imposing their personal beliefs, they are \nalso making it more difficult for women to access important lifesaving \nmedical treatment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask for another 45 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. That is why I believe it is so important to debate and to \npass the Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act. This \nbill would fix the Hobby Lobby decision by making it illegal for any \ncompany to deny their workers specific health benefits, including birth \ncontrol, that would be required to be covered. It would make clear that \nbosses cannot discriminate against their female workers and would \nensure equal treatment under the law for tens of thousands of workers \nfor which coverage hangs in the balance. It would preserve and codify \nthe existing accommodation for our nonprofit religious employees.\n  It is troubling to me that in 2014 we are even debating women's \naccess to contraception. Nearly all women--99 percent--will use it at \nsome point in their lives, and they should have access to safe, \neffective birth control if they choose to use it--plain and simple.\n  This bill would ensure that those decisions about an employee's \nhealth can stay between the woman and her doctor, not between the woman \nand her boss. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk about an issue today that \ntranscends party lines: the humanitarian crisis we are seeing in Africa \nand the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n  In September of last year the Congo informed the United States that \nthey would no longer issue exit visas for Congolese children who were \nin the process of being adopted by American parents. These are kids \nthat have gone through the adoption process and yet the Government of \nthe Congo says they cannot leave the country. This terrible and \nunjustifiable action has left hundreds of children and their families \nhere in the United States in limbo.\n  Last Friday the Congolese Government announced an end to exit permit \nexceptions until the country passes what they deem are new adoption \nlaws. I stand here today to express our deep concern and commitment to \nresolve this crisis from so many in the Senate. We have over 50 \ncosponsors for a resolution calling on the Congo to do the right thing. \nThose of us who have cosponsored this are looking for a way to help \nthese children who have already been adopted to be reunited with their \nfamilies permanently.\n  More than 350 families have finalized adoptions of Congolese \nchildren. They have obtained the necessary U.S. approvals, including \nU.S. visas authorizing their children to immigrate to the United \nStates. There were 400 additional families in the process of completing \nadoptions at the time Congo imposed this moratorium. In every way that \nmatters, including in what they feel in their hearts, these are their \nchildren.\n  All told, more than 800 children are caught in this diplomatic \nnightmare. By the way, that is about 10 percent of total adoptions \nworldwide by American families last year. These are international \nadoptions, so it is a significant number. Many of these kids have \nspecial needs, and those needs are not being met. Until they are able \nto come home and be with their families, those needs will not be met. \nIn fact, some lives have been put at risk. In fact, six of these \nchildren have already died.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with some of the parents of some of \nthese children and have seen some of the photos and heard some of the \nstories. If the Congolese Government would simply do the right thing \nand allow these exit permits, lives would be saved. We can't remain \nsilent in the face of this tragedy.\n  Together with Senator Landrieu of Louisiana, I am offering a \nresolution calling on the administration to take action and demand that \nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo resume \nprocessing these adoption cases and issuing exit permits so these kids \ncan leave. They need to prioritize the processing of intercountry \nadoptions which were initiated before the suspension began.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for her hard work on this matter, as well as \n50 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have joined us.\n  Last week I met with a number of families from Ohio, and we had the \nopportunity to talk about some of these kids and some of their specific \ncircumstances. We also talked about what these families are ready to \ndo, and they are ready to give these kids the support and love they \nneed.\n  I met with the Millimans from Columbus, OH. They are adopting a \nlittle girl who has very serious medical conditions. They are in the \nfinal stages of the adoption process, and they fear they will not be \nable to provide her the treatment and care she needs.\n  I also met with the Webb family. The Webbs are in the process of \nadopting a child from the Congo to bring to their home in Wooster, OH. \nThe Webbs' biological daughter Heather is also in the process of \nadopting from the Congo. They were both in the Capitol to talk about \ntheir kids and what they have been through.\n  These families represent the very best of our country and our values, \na respect for these young people's lives and a commitment to live with \nhumility, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable children. This \ndiplomatic impasse is keeping these families apart. It is time the \nadministration joined with Congress to support the families and the \nchildren involved in this crisis in every way possible.\n  In the coming days, I hope we will speak with one voice and demand \nthat Congo reverse their decision and process these adoptions as \nquickly as possible. It is my sense this is an issue that will come up \nin committee this week. I hope before this session is out we will be \nable to take this up on the floor of the Senate, pass it, and begin to \nput some pressure on the Congolese Government to do the right thing. It \nis time to allow these children to be with their loving families.\n  With that, I yield back all time and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I heard the majority leader \nspeak about people who are happy with the President's health care law. \nWhile I agree that some people have been helped by the law, many \nAmericans have been hurt by the law's destructive side effects. \nRepublicans have given examples of people from all across the\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\ncountry of all ages and in all kinds of situations being harmed by the \nhealth care law, and we found that a disproportionate number of those \nbeing hurt are women. These are middle-class Americans who work hard, \ndo the right thing, and they just want to care for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  The health care law that the President wrote--and every Senate \nDemocrat in the Senate voted for--is standing between them and the \nlives they want to live. That is what I am hearing from my neighbors \nback home in Wyoming, and I think I hear from more individuals than \nmany of the Senators do because I was a physician and practiced \nmedicine in Wyoming for 25 years. I have taken care of patients and \nfamilies.\n  I would like to share with everyone what I have been hearing from the \nwomen around the State of Wyoming and how this law has been impacting \ntheir lives.\n  I got a letter from a woman in Gillette, WY, and she said: ``I wanted \nto share with you my frustration and worry concerning the Affordable \nCare Act.''\n  She said she and her husband have three daughters--ages 12, 9, and \n3--and her husband started a new business. She said: ``Thanks to the \nnew health care law our insurance premium increased $560 per month.'' \nThat is $6,700 more a year that this family has to pay for insurance \nunder the President's health care law.\n  She wrote:\n\n       As we struggle to plan for our girls' futures, attempt to \n     make my husband's business prosper, and dream of what our \n     future may hold once our children are raised, it is \n     disheartening that we will now pay nearly $17,000 a year for \n     health insurance.\n\n  She said:\n\n       There are so many things we could, and should, be able to \n     do with that money. That additional $560 per month could be \n     put in our girls' college funds, be given back to our church \n     and community. Sadly, we don't have the luxury of deciding \n     how to use that hard-earned money.\n       We have been told by Washington that we will spend our \n     money on health insurance. I have never felt so completely \n     let down by the American government.\n\n  Here is a woman who just wants to raise her family, send her \ndaughters to college, maybe grow the family business, and there she is \nin Wyoming struggling with the burden Washington Democrats imposed on \nher with this terrible health care law and its damaging and \ndisheartening side effects.\n  President Obama says the Democrats who voted for this law should \n``forcefully defend and be proud'' of the health care law.\n  Are Democrats in the Senate who voted for this health care law proud \nof what they are doing to this woman and her family? Are Democrats \nwilling to come to the floor and forcefully defend and be proud that \nthis Wyoming family has to spend thousands of dollars on health \ninsurance instead of on their daughters' college funds?\n  Millions of women all across America are in the same situation as \nthis woman in Gillette, WY. There has been a new study that looked at \nhow much more money people are paying this year for insurance in the \nObamaCare exchanges than they paid last year before the Obama health \ncare law kicked in. They found that a lot of women are paying much more \nbecause of the President's health care law.\n  In North Carolina--and we just heard from the Senator from North \nCarolina--an average 27-year-old woman is paying $1,100 more for health \ninsurance coverage than she did last year. In North Carolina a 64-year-\nold woman is paying $5,000 more because of all of the requirements of \nthe health care law. Is that Senator willing to come back and \nforcefully defend and be proud of this health care law and what it has \ndone to these women in her home State?\n  It is the same in Arkansas. An average 40-year-old woman pays $1,300 \nmore this year because of the law. A 64-year-old woman in Arkansas is \npaying $3,400 more this year in the exchanges. In one State after \nanother, women are paying more. Women of all ages are getting hurt. The \nWashington Post had a very interesting story about this on June 24.\n  It said: ``Older women bear the brunt of higher health insurance \ncosts under Obamacare.'' That is the headline from the Washington \nPost--``Older women bear the brunt of higher insurance costs under \nObamacare.''\n  The article says a new report found ``women age 55 to 64 will face a \nhuge spike in cost when they go out to buy individual insurance on the \nfederal exchange.''\n  The article says, ``These women bear the brunt of the increased \npremiums and out of pocket expenses after the Affordable Care Act.''\n  Under President Obama and the Democrats' plan, older women are \nbearing the brunt of higher health insurance costs. This is a \ndisgraceful side effect of the Democrats' health care law. Women across \nthe country are paying more money for insurance they do not need, do \nnot want, and will likely never use.\n  Are Democrats willing to come to the floor of the Senate and \nforcefully defend and be proud of the fact that older women are bearing \nthe brunt of higher health insurance costs under this law?\n  I got another letter from a rancher from Newcastle, WY. She and her \nhusband were paying $650 a month for insurance. She said, ``We don't \ncarry maternity insurance because we have completed our family.'' This \nwoman has had a hysterectomy.\n  I get letters more than maybe most because I am a physician who \npracticed in Wyoming for a long time.\n  She says their insurance agent told them they couldn't renew their \npolicy at the end of last year. The reason? Because it didn't meet the \nPresident's requirement that they have to have maternity coverage, so \nthey had to choose a new policy from the exchange.\n  Now, remember, she doesn't need or want maternity coverage and she is \nnever going to use it because she has had a hysterectomy. According to \nPresident Obama and the Democrats, it doesn't matter one bit. It \ndoesn't matter.\n  They were paying $650 a month before ObamaCare. She said her \ninsurance agent quoted her rates for a comparable policy of anywhere \nbetween $1,300 and $1,600 a month or they could take a bronze policy \nwith much less coverage than they had before for $900--still more than \nthey were paying before. So $3,000 a year more than they paid before \nObamaCare, and the out-of-pocket costs would be much higher and much \nmore difficult for the family.\n  This woman from Wyoming writes:\n\n       We're being forced out of a good policy, which we pay for \n     with hard-earned money, which we choose, into a dangerous \n     financial health care situation, with less coverage, and \n     which puts my husband and I, who are proud of our own \n     sustainability, on to what we consider the welfare rolls by \n     needing a government subsidy to afford a plan that we don't \n     want or need.\n\n  We don't want, we don't need, and we are forced on to it.\n  She writes:\n\n       To say that we're angry is an understatement. Why is this \n     happening? Why can Obama force me into this? We feel \n     helpless.\n\n  This isn't what the President of the United States promised the \nAmerican people. It is not what every Democrat who voted for the health \ncare law promised the American people.\n  It seems to me that President Obama and Democrats in the Senate just \ndon't get it. All these women wanted was a chance to buy insurance \ncoverage that worked for them. They wanted the right to be left alone \nto make their own choices about their family's health care, not to have \nWashington make choices for them. They wanted the care they need from a \ndoctor they choose at lower cost.\n  President Obama wasn't interested in listening to what women wanted. \nHe wanted to tell--he wanted to mandate--he wanted to tell them and \nmandate what he thought was best for them. It is outrageous.\n  I hear from people almost every day who are feeling the costly and \ncruel side effects of the health care law.\n  I heard from a woman in Casper, WY, where I practiced and was chief \nof staff of the Wyoming Medical Center in Casper. She gets her \ninsurance through her job. The costs have gone up so much under \nObamaCare that she is worried about what might happen. She writes:\n\n       I am concerned for what I might be facing when my employer \n     has to comply with the [health care law] next year. I have \n     not had children yet because of the effects the recession had \n     on me and my husband. I would very much like to think we \n     could have one in the next couple of years, however, the \n     insurance fiasco worries me.\n\n  So this woman is worried that the health care law might actually \naffect her and her husband having a family.\n  Why did President Obama take away the rights of women to choose what\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\nhealth coverage is right for them and their families? This was an \nactive decision made by Democrats in this body and the President of the \nUnited States to take away the rights of women to choose what health \ncoverage is right for them and their families.\n  Why did President Obama raise the cost of health care and make it \nmore expensive for women?\n  These are just a few of the women who are being hurt by ObamaCare and \njust a few of the ways the President's health care law is affecting \nwomen all across America.\n  Again, there are some people who have been helped by the law. Some \npeople are happy with their insurance. Nobody is denying that. There \nare also people who have been hurt by the law and who can't afford it \nand who are devastated because of it. What does the President have to \nsay to those people? Why won't President Obama sit down with just one \nof these women who has written to me and actually listen to the damage \nhe has done to them, to their families, and to their health care as a \nresult of his health care law?\n  Why won't Democrats come to the floor of the Senate and talk about \nthese millions of Americans--millions of women--whom they have harmed \nwith the health care law?\n  Republicans have offered ideas for health care reform that allow \nwomen to make choices on what is best for them and their families. If \nthey want maternity coverage, they can find a policy that offers it. \nThey wouldn't be forced to pay for what they don't need or don't want \njust because someone in Washington tells them they must. People wanted \nhealth care reform to give them access to quality, affordable care--not \nmore expensive coverage.\n  Republicans are going to keep coming to the floor. We are going to \nkeep offering real solutions for better health care without all of \nthese expensive and offensive side effects.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, as have many Americans, I have watched with \nincreasing concern and increasing frustration the rapidly growing \nhumanitarian crisis on our southern border. More than 60,000 \nunaccompanied alien children--mostly minors from Guatemala, Honduras, \nand El Salvador--have been apprehended at the border in this fiscal \nyear, and we have 2\\1/2\\ months remaining. The numbers are staggering. \nAnother 40,000 family members--one or both parents traveling with their \nchildren--have also been apprehended just in this fiscal year.\n  To put these numbers in perspective, in 2008, the number of \nunaccompanied alien children apprehended at the border was 8,000. Three \nyears later, in 2011, the number had doubled. It had doubled to 16,000. \nThis is a situation we perhaps didn't see coming, but should have.\n  Today, of course, the numbers are staggering, as I mentioned. The \nnumber has skyrocketed. In fact, in April and May of this year, 10,000 \nhave arrived. We simply cannot sit back and let this situation grow \nworse as it does day by day. We must now find a way to solve this \ncrisis and stem the flow of unaccompanied minors entering our country. \nIt is imperative that this Congress and this administration work \ntogether to do this and do this immediately. We dare not move toward \nour regularly scheduled August recess without accomplishing the \nsolution or resolution of this current crisis, which is impacting \nchildren, impacting families, impacting communities, impacting many \nacross the United States in terms of this crisis.\n  As we do this, I think it is important that we be guided by some key \nprinciples, including laws that are currently on the books--laws that \nmight need to be adjusted--as well as compassionate hearts in terms of \nhow we deal with those who are here but will need to be returned to \ntheir homeland.\n  First, clearly and foremost, we have to enforce existing law. \nExisting law says we need an orderly process. Immigration needs to be \nlegal. It needs to be processed in an orderly way and in a way so that \nwe can accommodate those who come from out of the country. I am the son \nof an immigrant who was processed through a legal process, a process \nthat speaks for many of us not only here in this Chamber but for many \nacross America. We are all in a sense immigrants. For over 200 years, \nwe have come as immigrants through a legal process. Today we find a \nsituation where our borders are being swamped with those who are \nattempting to come illegally, for whatever reason. More importantly, we \nhave to make it clear to them that the law does not allow this to \nhappen. So we have to get control of the border. We have to get control \nof our immigration process.\n  I think all of us feel the need for immigration reform. Step No. 1 \nhas to be securing our borders so we can convince the American people \nwe can return to an orderly process of bringing immigrants to this \ncountry and not be overwhelmed by the illegal immigration flowing to \nour southern borders. It is also important because we need to let the \nfamilies know and the children know their trip to America is not what \nhas been promised them.\n  Many believe this humanitarian crisis is focused on how we handle \nthese children once they arrive at the border, and there is a need to \naddress that issue. But in reality, the crisis for these children \nbegins when they start their trip, given the dangers of the journey. We \nnow know the children who are making these dangerous treks from Central \nAmerica are often in the hands of smugglers, drug cartels, coyotes--\ncriminal elements that are delivering a false lie to families and \nindividuals in these countries. They are basically saying, Get your \nchildren across the border and they will then be absorbed into American \nsociety and they will be in a better place. And, by the way, write us a \ncheck for $7,000 or $10,000 or $5,000, whatever the market bears, and \nwe will ensure that your children arrive safely, and then you won't \nhave to worry about them anymore. That is simply not true.\n  Sadly, from the latest information that has come to us, in surveys \nthat are being taken and investigations that are being made, the story \nis horrendous. Often, for those in the hands of those who are seeking \nto bring them along the approximately 1,500-mile trip from Central \nAmerica to the Texas border, the reality of what these children are \nfacing and what these families are facing is startling and it is an \nissue that absolutely has to be addressed.\n  Doctors Without Borders exists in southern and central Mexico, and \nthey did surveys of those who were attempting to make this trip. They \nindicated that 58 percent of their patients suffered at least--at \nleast--one episode of violence along their way from Central America to \nthe United States. One media network did an investigation that followed \nthe path of Central American migrants, including children, and while \ntheir numbers have not been verified or documented, they are \nstaggering. Even if the results are half of what they claim, it is a \nsituation of immense humanitarian dysfunction. They found that 80 \npercent of all migrants will be assaulted, 60 percent of women will be \nraped, and only 40 percent will actually make it to the border.\n  Let's say those numbers are exaggerated. There is some indication \nthis media outlet was, perhaps, sensationalizing their numbers. Let's \nsay it is just half of that. But if it is half of that, it is a \nsituation we absolutely cannot tolerate. We absolutely cannot sit by \nand say the only humanitarian crisis is taking care of these children \nonce they cross the border--making sure they have vaccinations, \nsustenance, and a place to sleep until we get them processed. Those who \nclaim that need to understand the crisis that exists before they ever \nget to the border, and the impact on these children in particular.\n  In 2010, when the narrative coming out of the administration was \nchipping away at our Nation's immigration laws through the abuse of \nprosecutorial discretion, this generated whispers of hope that ran \nrampant through the families of our Central American neighbors and gave \na false confidence that if you illegally enter our country, once you \nare here, you will be able to\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nstay. The belief spread in 2012 when the President took his \nprosecutorial discretion a step further by essentially halting the \nremoval of illegal immigrants who arrived as minors.\n  There was a process where, of course, they were given a piece of \npaper, which basically said: You have to appear before a judge, who \nwill determine whether you are able to stay in the country or whether \nyou will have to be sent back home.\n  The narrative there was: This is your document that allows you to \nstay in America. In fact, it was not that at all. But because of the \noverwhelming number of people who received these documents, allowing \nthem to stay here until they were adjudicated by a judge--because that \nnumber now exists around 375,000, and there is no way we can possibly \nadjudicate these and make these decisions in a short amount of time--\nthose who arrived simply melded into the society, and most never showed \nup before a judge who was making a decision about their legality or \nillegality.\n  A key part of what we have to do here, in my opinion, is a \nrepatriation plan. It is easy to just simply throw money out there and \nsay we will come up with a plan later. I cannot support a provision \nthat does not have policy changes to address this situation--policy \nchanges that will allow us to inform our Central American neighbors \nthat they must make every possible effort to engage with us in telling \nthe truth to their constituencies and the parents of these children as \nto what lies ahead for them: the fact that they will be subjected to \npotential brutality, unspeakable, brutal efforts and consequences of \nthis trip, as well as returned to their families and their countries.\n  We have to together make this message clear that our laws require \nthat these children be sent back, but we also have to make it \nabundantly clear they are putting their children at great harm and \ngreat risk to believe this narrative that says: They will be fine, they \nwill be taken care of. Just give us the money and we will make sure \nyour children become Americans and they will be fine in the future.\n  Secondly, I think we need to go a step further. To deter children \nfrom making this journey, we have to return those who have already \ncome.\n  Included in a viable repatriation program has to be a streamlined \nprocess. I mentioned the number of the hundreds of thousands who are \nstill waiting for their adjudication. There have been efforts and \nsuggestions made by some of our colleagues on a bipartisan basis that \nwe address and dramatically increase the number of judges who can go \ndown to the border and make these decisions quickly so we can safely \nreturn these children home without having the horror of seeing these \nchildren rejected in different communities and no place to put them, as \nthe numbers simply overwhelm our ability to care for them.\n  The administration does have some flexibility under current law to \nmove families and children through these immigration proceedings in an \naccelerated manner. However, I believe--and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity has stated--that we need to go further to change current law \nto treat all unaccompanied alien children the same.\n  Now this is the President's own Secretary of Homeland Security, who \nhas been to the border, whom I have met with and talked to several \ntimes, who is assiduously trying to address this issue in a bipartisan \nway. We need to work together to make sure we put the processes in \nplace and the policies in place before we simply decide on a number and \nhope for the best later.\n  We need to change the law to allow Central American children who \nqualify to choose voluntarily to return as well, rather than go through \ndrawn-out immigration proceedings that should still lead to their \nremoval and damage any chance they have to seek legal immigration in \nthe future.\n  This narrative out there, this story out there, is: Oh well, just go \nback across the border. Then maybe tomorrow you will get back here, and \nsomeone else will pick you up, and you will go to a different place, \nand you will start the process all over again, and you will finally get \nhanded a piece of paper, and then don't worry about showing up in 12 to \n18 months later. You can meld into society, and everything will be \nwell. That absolutely has to be addressed. If we do not do that, we \nwill not succeed with this process.\n  We also need to use our leverage with these foreign countries to gain \ntheir cooperation if they refuse to cooperate with us--whether it is \nwithholding foreign aid, whether it is any number of punitive measures. \nWe need to make sure the governments of these nations understand the \nrisk to their children, the harm to their children, and the fact that \nwe are going to enforce the law, and that if they want to continue \nfuture relations with the United States through a legal immigration \nprocess, they have to work with us to convince their constituencies and \ngive them the truth as to what is happening to their children--to \nengage in this process of working with us to stop this flow of \nillegals.\n  Now, obviously, we have to provide reasonable care for those who are \nalready here. The vast majority of the new funding the President is \nrequesting would go for caring for the illegal immigrants who are \nalready here. It includes housing, transporting, and caring for the \nchildren and families already in the United States.\n  I believe it is our responsibility as a nation and as a compassionate \nsociety to care for the hurt and displaced. But we cannot simply open \nour arms and encourage all the world's children to strike out on their \nown, face endless dangers, and come to our shores with the belief that \nthey will be welcomed and accepted and integrated into our society. We \nsimply do not have the capacity to do that on a worldwide basis, and we \nsee the trouble we are having from just three countries. What are we \nactually doing to stem the flow of unaccompanied alien children coming \nto the United States? And when will we begin to see the tide turn? That \nis something that has to happen and must happen initially.\n  Finally, in addition to the care which we must provide--the \nsustenance and the health care and the bedding and the nutrition and \nthe efforts we need to make; and thank goodness for so many nonprofit \norganizations, churches, and others that have volunteered to join us in \nthis particular effort--but it cannot be an ongoing effort. It has to \nbe something that is accompanied by significant changes I have talked \nabout before in terms of policy. You have to stop the bleeding. You \nhave to stop the effort first and convince the American people that we \nfinally gained control of our borders before we can move to any kind of \nsensible immigration reform.\n  This is going to be expensive. We are going to have to make sure the \nmoney we are spending is spent as part of a plan to address the \nproblem--not just simply address it and have the problem continue, but \naddress it in a way, on a one-time basis, that we put an end to this \nstory: Send your children and they will be just fine.\n  Mr. President, the time is moving on, and I know my colleague is \nwaiting to speak and we have votes coming up. So let me shorten this by \nsimply concluding, at the end of the day, we have a huge humanitarian \ncrisis on our hands on our border. I believe we have a moral \nresponsibility to swiftly address and solve this crisis. We have to \nunderstand that the crisis involves more than just unaccompanied \nminors. We cannot ignore the national security implications of a weak \nborder. There are many dark powers in this world that wish to see the \ninfluence of the United States diminish--that wish to extinguish the \nbeacon of freedom that we have been to the world.\n  So for the sake of the rule of law, for the sake of our national \nsecurity and the safety of these children, it is imperative we act now \nand get it right. It will only happen if this body, the Congress--the \nHouse and the Senate--and the President will work together to put in \nplace, on an expedited basis, a sensible plan to address this \nhumanitarian crisis. ``Save the children'' means: Don't put those \nchildren in the hands of smugglers, coyotes, criminal elements, only \nfor them to go through the horrendous consequences that have become the \nhumanitarian crisis we are addressing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp.)\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4472-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If neither side yields time, both sides will be \nequally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, are we in a quorum call presently?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have come to speak about the two \nnominees on the executive calendar who are before us this afternoon. \nNorman Bay and Cheryl LaFleur are nominated to be commissioners on the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, an increasingly critical, \nindependent regulatory commission.\n  As the Senate has considered these nominations, there has been kind \nof a weird drama that has played out throughout the entire community \nthat follows the FERC and, as I understand, the agency itself has been \nreally very distracted by it. Many are concerned the wrong person is \nset to take over as chair of the FERC and that the Commission is at \nrisk of losing its reputation for objectivity. So for the benefit of \nSenators who are not on the energy committee and for members of the \npublic who have not followed the controversy surrounding these \nnominees, let me provide a little bit of perspective this afternoon.\n  Both nominees have been serving at the FERC. Ms. LaFleur currently \nleads the agency as its chair. She has done so with distinction for the \nbetter part of a pretty difficult year. This is a year that has brought \nabout the polar vortex and challenges to bulk power system reliability. \nThe other individual, Mr. Bay, is an employee. He is the director of \nthe agency's Office of Enforcement. He was appointed to that post by \nits somewhat controversial former chair, John Wellinghoff of Nevada.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Bay will become the first FERC employee in the \nagency's history who would go directly and immediately to the \ncommission itself, despite just 5 years of relevant experience. \nFurthermore, Mr. Bay will not only be elevated to the post of \ncommissioner; President Obama has announced that Mr. Bay will be \ndesignated as chairman after his confirmation. That means that Ms. \nLaFleur, the FERC's only female commissioner, will be demoted when Mr. \nBay takes over as chair. How soon Ms. LaFleur's demotion will take \nplace is unclear at this moment.\n  At the energy committee's business meeting to consider these \nnominees, there was a lot of talk about a deal that would allow Ms. \nLaFleur to remain as chair for a period of time. It was suggested that \nthis would give Mr. Bay some much needed on-the-job training as a rank \nand file commissioner. So there was a lot of discussion going back and \nforth. I was certainly part of that discussion. But talk of a deal and \nconfirmation of a deal, giving the assurances that certainly this \nSenator has sought and yet was not given--talking about a deal and \ngetting a deal are two different things.\n  So as we discuss where we are with these nominees, I think it is \nimportant to recognize that even if Ms. LaFleur stays on for a period \nof months--whether it is 9 months as some have suggested the deal is or \na different period of time--what we understand is that Ms. LaFleur will \nonly be allowed to continue in an acting capacity.\n  So stop and think about this. We have President Obama who has \nnominated Ms. LaFleur twice for high office, and despite what I think \nhas been her distinguished service as a commissioner and as chair of \nthe FERC, the White House dismisses her as an acting chair. The \nadministration reportedly has limited her authority even to hire staff. \nAs some have suggested, this is just a technicality and this is what \nhappens within the Commission. That is not my understanding at all. I \nwould view it as an affront. If one is going to be the chair, one \nshould have the full authorities of the chair.\n  Even though I disagree with ``Acting'' Chair LaFleur on some key \npolicy matters, by all accounts, from both Republicans and Democrats, \nshe is doing a good job. She is fair. She seeks balance. She has the \ntemperament I think we need for this commission. She has the personal \nqualities of leadership we look for. She clearly has the experience. \nShe has 25 years' worth of experience, in fact. I certainly hope she \nwill be easily confirmed this afternoon. In fact, I hope Chair \nLaFleur's bipartisan support has not hurt her prospects.\n  Chair Landrieu observed during the committee's consideration of these \nnominees that Ms. LaFleur's renomination ``was not a sure thing just a \ncouple of months ago.'' But we have to ask: Why not? Why wasn't the \nrenomination of the only woman serving as a FERC commissioner--a \nHarvard-educated Obama appointee from Massachusetts--why wasn't she a \nsure thing from the get-go? Was it her bipartisan appeal? I would \ncertainly hope not. Was it her good work as a chair? Again, I hope not. \nTo me, those are reasons one would choose her to lead the FERC, not \nsomeone else.\n  One hint came from our majority leader, Senator Reid. He recently \ntold the Wall Street Journal that Ms. LaFleur ``has done some stuff to \ndo away with some of Wellinghoff's stuff.'' Now, he didn't really \ndefine what ``stuff'' that was and didn't acknowledge that much of Mr. \nWellinghoff's ``stuff'' was either controversial or incapable of \nwithstanding legal challenge.\n  Before we turn to Mr. Bay and his unprecedented promotion from \nDirector of the Commission's Office of Enforcement in the face of Ms. \nLaFleur's demotion, let's discuss the agency the White House proposes \nhe would lead for just a second. Why does the chairmanship of the FERC \nmatter so much? Well, the Presiding Officer sits on the energy \ncommittee. She knows. She is watching this. She is looking at the \nissues of reliability. In the energy world, FERC regulates ``midstream \neverything.'' The chairman is its CEO, and under his or her leadership, \nFERC regulates interstate natural gas and oil pipelines, LNG import and \nexport facilities, the sale of electricity at wholesale, the \ntransmission of electricity in interstate commerce--basically the \nNation's bulk power system, practically speaking, its high voltage \ntransmission networks, also the reliability of the bulk power system, \nthe licensing of hydroelectric facilities and the safety of dams. The \nlist goes on and on.\n\n  One further example is the safeguarding of sensitive information \nabout our critical energy infrastructure--information that was \ncompromised by FERC during the tenure of former Chairman Wellinghoff. \nThat series of events is now subject to an ongoing inquiry by the \ninspector general of the Department of Energy, and it is a breach that \nMs. LaFleur has vowed will not happen again.\n  Given the significance of this agency, let's consider Mr. Bay. So, \nbeyond the demotion of Ms. LaFleur, and beyond his lack of relevant \nexperience, what is causing me pause? To begin, there are questions \nabout the fairness and transparency of the functioning of the FERC \nOffice of Enforcement during Mr. Bay's tenure there. I haven't resolved \nthose questions, but I know others are looking at them. Senator \nBarrasso has called attention to some of the questions. He has called \nfor an independent review of the facts in dispute.\n  Second is the question of the circumstances under which Mr. Bay would \nrecuse himself from at least 43 different matters, including some high \nprofile matters that have been pending in the Office of Enforcement on \nhis watch. But, unfortunately, Mr. Bay apparently doesn't see a need to \nrecuse himself from these proceedings.\n  Third are the answers that Mr. Bay provided to questions from those \nof us on the energy committee. At best, many were unclear and, at \nworst, his responses were simply evasive.\n  Finally, I keep coming back to the deal--the waiting period that was \nneeded to attract enough support on the Democratic side to report Mr. \nBay's nomination from committee. So we\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nhave to ask the question: What are those terms? Will the acting chair \nhave the opportunity to serve fully and completely as chair? Will it be \nclear that Mr. Bay is not a ``shadow chairman'' or a ``chairman-in-\nwaiting'' during this crucial period? At a minimum, before we make a \nchoice about who should lead the FERC, the President owes Senators a \nclear time line of who will be in charge and what the powers are that \nwill be given to him or her.\n  FERC is just too important a commission. It is too important for \nappointees to be handled in this way.\n  So, today, I am going to be supporting the confirmation of Ms. \nLaFleur. In fact, I am pleased to support her, even though I don't \nalways agree with her policy views. But I do regret I will not give my \nsupport to Mr. Bay, and I urge other Senators to withhold their support \nas well.\n  With that, I would yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n         Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nspeak in support of the Murray legislation to protect women's health \nfrom corporate interference. Because of an obligation to speak at a \nmemorial service tomorrow, I will not be able to speak tomorrow \nmorning. I feel so strongly about this issue that I would like to say a \nfew words today.\n  This legislation ensures that the personal opinion of an employer \ndoesn't trump the medical opinion of a doctor. I sure wish this \nlegislation were not necessary, but, unfortunately, because of the \nrecent Supreme Court decision now known as the Hobby Lobby decision, it \nis necessary.\n  Let's talk about how we got here. As the Presiding Officer knows, we \nworked on health care reform. We were so concerned that over 40 million \npeople didn't have access to health care. We were concerned that just \nbeing a woman was treated as a preexisting condition. We were charged \ndouble for our insurance, and we often had to pay significant \ncopayments for those procedures related to early detection and \nscreening, for those procedures that would affect us such as mammogram \ncare. So on a bipartisan basis we ended that discrimination so women \ncouldn't be charged more than men of the same age or comparable health \nstatus.\n  We also wanted to be sure we could do preventive health care \nbenefits. That was an amendment I offered on the Senate floor. We had a \nspirited debate, even with Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski and I \nagreed on the same goals, but we had different methods. Ours won; mine \nwon. I wanted to be sure politicians didn't decide what was preventive \nhealth care. I wanted to be sure politicians didn't decide what should \nbe covered or not, and I didn't want to bring politics into it. So we \nturned to one of the most distinguished organizations in our government \nthat makes recommendations to our government on health care policy. It \nis known as the Institute of Medicine. It is a nonpartisan group funded \nby this Congress made up of scientific experts to advise us on medical \nand health care. We wanted them to tell us what should be the \npreventive services that were included.\n  So when we hear the criticism: ``Some government agency decided this; \nsome bureaucrat decided this''--these are scientists, these are \nphysicians, these are skilled researchers, and they determined that \nwomen should have access to eight preventive health care benefits for \nfree. First of all, screening for gestational diabetes--that is, when a \nwoman gets diabetes while she is pregnant or because she is pregnant-- \nhigh risk to the mother, high risk to the child. That means high risk \nHPV DNA testing, annual counseling and screening for HIV, comprehensive \nlactation support, and counseling, screening for domestic violence, an \nannual well-woman preventive care visit, and a full range of FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods. That is what it was. It was the \nInstitute of Medicine--the Institute of Medicine--not Barbara Mikulski, \nnot the Democrats, not President Obama--that said the FDA-approved \ncontraceptive methods should be available.\n\n  That brings us to the Supreme Court and Hobby Lobby, a for-profit \ncompany, employing thousands of people of different faiths and \nreligions.\n  Hobby Lobby's owners did not want to cover certain forms of \ncontraception for their female employees. They said it was against \ntheir religious beliefs, and the Supreme Court agreed with that--\nactually, the five men on the Supreme Court said they did not have to. \nThe women on the Supreme Court offered a dissenting opinion.\n  This ruling of the Court says the personal opinion of your employer \nis more important than the medical opinion of your doctor. As the \nPresiding Officer from Wisconsin knows--she, has put a lot of work into \nunderstanding health care and the delivery system--contraceptive \nmethods are not always used to prevent pregnancy. Some are to deal with \nfibroids and other medical conditions. This ruling, unfortunately, says \nthat a for-profit company can deny female employees coverage of \nimportant preventive health care based on religious objections of the \ncompany's health care ownership or leadership team.\n  I always felt health care decisions should be made by the patient and \ntheir doctor, by a woman and her doctor, not by an employer or an \ninsurance company. So it concerns me greatly that the Supreme Court \nJustices decided against that. It concerns me greatly that the Supreme \nCourt Justices decided the employers should have the power to determine \nwhat medical care is available to their female employees. This is \npretty scary, actually. I support what Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg \nsaid. What exemption does this extend? Does this go to blood \ntransfusions for some groups, antidepressants for some other groups, \nvaccinations for other groups? The Supreme Court said: Oh, no, it is \nonly for this. Well, one Supreme Court decision leads to another \nSupreme Court decision.\n  So Senator Murray, who is an architect of a bill of which I am a \ncosponsor, has led the way. Her bill does two things. It prohibits \nemployers from denying coverage of specific health care items or \nservices if the coverage of that item or service is required by Federal \nlaw. It keeps in place, however, protections for religious \norganizations. So houses of worship can be exempted from this mandate \nof contraceptive coverage, religious nonprofits can certify that they \ndo not want to offer contraceptive care, and insurers work separately \nwith employees.\n  The Supreme Court decision is an attempt to deny women's access to \nbirth control disguised as an effort to protect religious freedom. I am \na strong supporter of religious freedom. I stood on this floor and \nvoted with its architect, Senator Ted Kennedy--a happy memory--that we \nwould always have this religious protection of religious organizations, \ntheir nonprofit affiliates.\n  So I hope we do support the Murray bill, that it follows the \nprocesses within the Senate, and it comes to our attention. I believe \nthis will go a long way to clarifying this very important distinction \nbetween the religious freedom, particularly of religious \norganizations--houses of worship and the nonprofits affiliated with \nthem--but it does not embody in a private business the rights of an \nindividual.\n  Madam President, I thank you for your attention and that of the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I have to dispel some of the myths that are being told about the \nHobby Lobby decision.\n  First of all, one of the biggest distortions I think has been this \nhashtag campaign #NotMyBossBusiness because before the Hobby Lobby \ndecision--and as now--employers cannot deny their employees access to \nbirth control.\n  So let's be clear. Employers cannot deny their employees access to \nbirth control. So the #NotMyBossBusiness hashtag and I think some of \nthe statements that are being made on the Hobby Lobby decision are a \nmisrepresentation or distortion of what that decision stands for.\n  You do not have to take my word for it. In fact, the Washington Post \nFact Checker yesterday debunked several of the outrageous claims that \nare being made about this decision. In fact, here are some of the \nthings we know are true about the Hobby Lobby decision:\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\n``Nothing in the ruling allows a company to stop a woman from getting \nor filling a prescription for contraceptives.'' ``Nothing in the ruling \nallows a company to stop a woman from getting or filling a prescription \nfor contraceptives.''\n  The majority opinion of Hobby Lobby actually states expressly that \n``under our cases, women (and men) have a constitutional right to \nobtain contraceptives.''\n  In fact, what the Fact Checker found in response to one lawmaker's \nclaim about the Hobby Lobby decision--who claimed that it means \nemployers can restrict the ability of their employees to use \ncontraceptives--the Washington Post stated:\n\n       No boss under this ruling has the right to tell an employee \n     that they cannot use birth control. That's simply wrong.\n\n  I think that is very important for the American people to understand, \nfor the women of this country to understand.\n  Also, the Washington Post, when debunking many of the claims made \nabout the Hobby Lobby decision, said: ``Simply put, the court ruling \ndoes not outlaw contraceptives, does not allow bosses to prevent women \nfrom seeking birth control and does not take away a person's religious \nfreedom.''\n  In fact, what the decision does is focus on the fact that under the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, which was a law that was passed with \noverwhelming support in the House of Representatives and in this body--\nin fact, by our count, as I understand it, over a dozen Democrat \nMembers of the current Senate actually supported the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act in some way. It was signed into law by President \nClinton. So it used to be bipartisan that we would support religious \nfreedom in this body. The notion that somehow Hobby Lobby as a closely-\nheld corporation would have to give up all their religious beliefs \nseems to me to be antithetical to what we supported on a bipartisan \nbasis in this Congress, which is the religious freedom of Americans \nthat is reflected in the First Amendment to our Constitution.\n  In fact, contrary to the misleading rhetoric, the Hobby Lobby \ndecision does not take away a woman's access to birth control. That \nexisted before the Hobby Lobby decision and it exists today. That \nexisted before ObamaCare and it exists today, thankfully.\n  No employee is prohibited from purchasing any FDA-approved drug or \ndevice. Contraception remains readily available and accessible to women \nnationwide. Prior to ObamaCare passing in this body, over 85 percent of \nlarge businesses already offered contraceptive coverage to their \nemployees.\n  One thing that has not been mentioned is the ObamaCare mandate that \nhas been the subject of the Hobby Lobby decision does not even apply to \nbusinesses that are under 50 employees in this country. So there are \nmillions of women for whom the mandate that is addressed in the Hobby \nLobby decision does not even apply to.\n  For lower income women, there are five programs at the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that ensure access to \ncontraception for women, including Medicaid.\n\n  In fact, more than 19 million women were eligible for government-\nsupported contraceptive assistance in 2010, and that has not changed.\n  So for those who would distort the Court's decision and insist that \nwe cannot stand for religious liberty while simultaneously ensuring \nthat women continue to have safe, affordable access to birth control--\nit is just not true. We can do both and we need to do both on behalf of \nthe American people because people have deeply held religious beliefs, \nand it was so important to our Founding Fathers that they put respect \nfor religion and protection of people's ability to choose what they \nbelieve in in the First Amendment to the Constitution.\n  Americans believe strongly that we should be able to practice our \nreligion without undue interference from the government. That goes to \nour character. So what happened in the Supreme Court's decision in \nHobby Lobby is reaffirming that, but it did not say an employer will \nsomehow now be making the decision whether a woman can have \ncontraception. That is not what it said. In fact, employers have no \nright under the law to even know what my prescriptions are or any other \nwoman's prescriptions are for contraception. So any suggestion to the \ncontrary is entirely misleading.\n  The decision applies to closely-held businesses whose owners have \ngenuine religious convictions. In this case, the company's owner, the \nGreen family, agreed to provide coverage for 16 of the 20 contraceptive \nmethods that are required under ObamaCare, including birth control \npills. So I want people to understand that. They only had a moral \nobjection to the remaining four methods.\n  In the narrow ruling, the Court agreed, based on the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act--an act that was introduced into Congress by \nthe late Senator Edward Kennedy from Massachusetts and then-Congressman \nCharles Schumer from New York. Again, it was supported by over a dozen \nof my Democrat colleagues at the time. They brought forth the law \nbecause they were concerned at the time about another Supreme Court \ndecision which held that generally applicable laws that have nothing to \ndo with religion could effectively prevent Americans from fully \nexercising their religious rights. And guess what? It passed a then \nDemocrat-controlled House by voice vote and was approved by a Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate by a vote of 97 to 3. There is not much that happens \naround here 97 to 3.\n  When President Clinton signed it into law, he said: ``What this law \nbasically says is that the government should be held to a very high \nlevel of proof before it interferes with someone's free exercise of \nreligion.''\n  In the Hobby Lobby decision, the government did not even try to meet \nthat standard. They have tried to meet that standard with other \nreligious organizations, but they did not even try in this situation to \ncontend what the Court found to be genuinely-held religious beliefs on \na very limited basis.\n  There have been a lot of misrepresentations about the breadth of this \ndecision. The Court's majority opinion explicitly states that the \nruling does not ``provide a shield for employers who might cloak \nillegal discrimination as a religious practice.''\n  Additionally, the Court said that ``our decision should not be \nunderstood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily \nfall if it conflicts with an employer's religious beliefs,'' meaning \nthat someone must show a genuine religious objection. The government \ncan overcome it if they are willing to show that they can do it in a \nless restrictive way. They did not even try in this case.\n  Well, some Americans may disagree with the family who owns the Hobby \nLobby stores. All Americans believe religious freedom is a fundamental \nright that should not be abridged. When President Clinton signed the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act into law, he said:\n\n       Our laws and institutions should not impede or hinder, but \n     rather should protect and preserve fundamental religious \n     liberties.\n\n  I come to the floor today because I want people to understand this \ndecision. Employers cannot tell you what kind of contraception you can \nhave as a woman. Employers cannot even know what kind of contraception \nyou have as a woman. That is protected under HIPAA laws, privacy laws \nthat are very important.\n  Finally, this notion that it is not my boss's business--of course an \nemployer cannot tell you that you cannot go fill a prescription for \ncontraception. I think that to suggest otherwise is really to distort \nwhat the facts of this case are.\n  I believe we can protect people's fundamentally-held religious \nbeliefs and provide women safe, effective access to contraception. \nBecause of that, I will be introducing legislation on the Senate floor. \nThat legislation would reaffirm that no employer can restrict an \nemployee's access to contraceptives. Finally, it would also ensure that \nwe look at ways to potentially give women greater access to \ncontraceptives.\n  The legislation I will be introducing would also ask the FDA to study \nwhether women can purchase contraceptives over the counter and whether \nit would be safe and effective for adult women to be able to do so. So \nwe should have the FDA look at this issue to see if women can perhaps \nhave even greater access than they do right now.\n  But the American people need to understand that the Hobby Lobby \ndecision did not change women's access to\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\ncontraceptives. In fact, under our HIPAA laws, no employer can know \nwhat kind of contraception you may have been prescribed or are using. \nNo employer can tell you that you cannot fill a prescription for any \nkind of contraception that you think is appropriate and that your \ndoctor thinks is appropriate for you.\n  Finally, I would say our bill also does one other important thing; \nthat is, it repeals the restrictions ObamaCare put on health savings \naccounts and flexible spending accounts. ObamaCare actually reduced the \namount someone can put aside on a tax-free basis to pay for their own \nhealth care. ObamaCare also restricted the use of those accounts for \npurchase of over-the-counter medications. I have had many of my \nconstituents complain to me about this. We would like to eliminate \nthose restrictions and give people greater ability to set aside money \non a tax-free basis to pay for their own health concerns, including \nover-the-counter medications.\n  One thing I would say finally is that I have heard so much from my \nconstituents about the concerns they have with ObamaCare. I have heard \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who voted for ObamaCare, \nnow come to the floor and complain about the Hobby Lobby decision. \nWell, I would argue that we are where we are today because they decided \nthat ObamaCare was the way to go for health care in this country.\n  I have heard from a lot of my both male and female constituents about \nthe real concerns they have with ObamaCare that I hope we will debate \non this floor. I have heard from people who lost policies they liked, \nwho are paying more for coverage than they were before, have higher \ndeductibles. I have had women write me about concerns that their \nemployer is going to cut their hours because of ObamaCare. Talk about a \nbad mandate. It redefined the 40-hour workweek. It is now a 30-hour \nworkweek. So people are losing hours.\n  In my own State of New Hampshire, right now 10 of our hospitals are \nexcluded from the exchange. We are not a very big State. It is a big \ndeal. So some people have lost access to the doctor with whom they had \na longstanding relationship or the hospital where they had their first \nchild. Now, if they are expecting their second child and they are on \nthe exchange, that hospital is excluded, and they are in a situation \nwhere ObamaCare is restricting women's rights as far as what hospital \nthey can go to, when they could have gone there before.\n  Those are the real issues as we think about what has happened with \nObamaCare. There are so many other issues I could talk about, stories \nmy constituents have written to me. But I would hope the American \npeople understand that employers cannot restrict your access to \ncontraception. We will reassert in our bill that no employer can do \nthat. We will look at the FDA studying whether women can potentially \nhave greater access to contraceptives in a safe and effective manner by \nlooking at whether adult women can safely purchase contraceptives over \nthe counter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I rise to speak on the pending nominations.\n  I appreciate the majority leader scheduling this vote to confirm Mr. \nNorman Bay to be a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  FERC is one of the lesser known but perhaps one of the most important \nindependent agencies in the Federal Government. It has jurisdiction \nover interstate transmission of electricity, oil, and natural gas, as \nwell as licensing of hydroelectric power.\n  I believe Mr. Bay will be an outstanding member of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission. I urge all of my colleagues to support his \nnomination today.\n  Since 2009 Mr. Bay has been the Director of the Office of Enforcement \nat FERC, where he has gained extensive experience in the regulation of \nenergy markets. The Office of Enforcement is responsible for market \noversight and surveillance and for implementing the antimanipulation \nauthority Congress enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This \nauthority provided FERC new tools to combat the type of market \nmanipulation that produced the devastating power crisis a decade ago \nacross the West.\n  Under Mr. Bay's leadership, FERC has increased transparency in its \nwork, while bringing a number of enforcement actions that have helped \nprotect the integrity of the energy markets and provided $300 million \nin relief to consumers--$300 million back into the pockets of energy \nconsumers.\n  He is a graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School and has \nhad a long and distinguished career of public service. Before joining \nFERC, he taught law at the University of New Mexico. He also served as \nan assistant U.S. attorney and in 2000 was nominated by the President \nto be the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico. He was \nconfirmed in that position by the full Senate by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. Bay is an outstanding public servant with extensive experience in \nthe field of energy markets. I am confident he will judiciously \nimplement FERC's statutory responsibility of oversight of our Nation's \nenergy infrastructure, competitive markets, and reliability.\n  At his confirmation hearing in May, members of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee had a chance to question Mr. Bay extensively on his \nwork at the FERC and his views on regulatory policy. Senator Pete \nDomenici, a former chairman and longtime member of the energy committee \nfrom my home State of New Mexico, spoke at the hearing in strong \nsupport of Mr. Bay's nomination. Senator Jeff Bingaman, another former \nchairman of the energy committee from New Mexico, wrote a letter in \nsupport of his nomination.\n  The Senate must give consent to the President's nominees to be \nmembers of the FERC. The Senate is fulfilling that responsibility with \nthis vote today. However, there should be no misunderstanding--Congress \ngave the President alone the responsibility of designating a member of \nthe Commission to be the Chairman of the Commission. The law enacted by \nCongress in 1977 remains very clear: The President, and not the Senate, \ndetermines who will serve as Chairman of the Commission.\n  I believe Mr. Bay will be fair, balanced, pragmatic, and a consensus-\noriented member of the FERC. He will decide cases on the merits, based \non the facts, based on the law and on the record.\n  I am pleased to support the nominations of both Commissioner LaFleur \nand Mr. Bay to be members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nI hope the Senate will vote today to confirm them both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes and that it not be counted against the majority's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last week the President was in Denver, CO, \nwhere he talked about the economy. He said this: ``By almost every \nmeasure, we are better off than when I took office.'' That is quite a \nstatement. ``By almost every measure we are better off than when I took \noffice.'' I know a lot of Americans struggling with high health care \nbills who might disagree with that because the truth is that very few \nAmericans are better off than they were 5\\1/2\\ years ago. Household \nincome has plummeted by more than $3,300 since the President took \noffice. Meanwhile, the price of everything, from milk to the \nrefrigerator to store it in, has risen. Gas prices have nearly doubled \nsince the President took office. College costs have soared. Of course, \nfamily health insurance premiums have increased by nearly $3,000 per \nfamily.\n  Combine reduced income with higher prices and you get a reduced \nliving standard. Under the Obama Presidency, families who were once \ncomfortably in the middle class are now struggling to make ends meet. \nOther Americans have dropped out of the middle class altogether.\n  There are 3.7 million more women in poverty today than there were \nwhen the President took office. Mr. President, you want to talk about \nthe war on women?\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\n  When the President took office, 33 million Americans were on food \nstamps. Today more than 46 million Americans receive food stamps. \nAmericans struggling financially have had few opportunities to get \nahead because the Obama economy has offered very little in the way of \nopportunity.\n  The President likes to talk about the jobs the economy has gained \nrecently. But what he does not say is that 5 years after the recession \nofficially ended, our economy is still posting recession-type levels of \nunemployment.\n  Back in 2009 the President's economic advisers confidently predicted \nthat unemployment would fall below 6 percent in 2012. Well, here we are \n2 years later. We are still not below 6 percent unemployment even after \na historic expansion of monetary policy and the largest fiscal stimulus \nsince World War II. The only reason the unemployment rate is not higher \nis because so many Americans have given up looking for a job entirely \nand dropped out of the workforce. The labor force participation rate \ncurrently stands at 62.8 percent--near a 36-year low. To put it another \nway, if the labor participation rate today were what it was when the \nPresident took office, unemployment would not be a little over 6 \npercent, it would be 10.2 percent. That is how many people have \ncompletely dropped out of the labor force and are no longer even \nlooking for a job.\n  Then there are the millions of Americans who are working part time \nbecause they cannot find a full-time job. The Labor Department reported \nthat the economy lost more than half a million full-time jobs in June \nand gained almost 800,000 part-time jobs. That is not a good statistic. \nIt is the rare part-time job that pays all the bills and gives \nfinancial stability. Americans need more full-time jobs, not more part-\ntime jobs.\n  They also need the opportunity for higher paying jobs, but that is \nanother opportunity which is in short supply in the Obama economy. \nForty-one percent of the jobs lost during the recession were high-wage \njobs, but just 30 percent of the jobs recovered have been high-wage \njobs. Similarly, 37 percent of the jobs lost in the recession were \nmidwage jobs, while just 26 percent of the jobs gained since the \nrecession have been midwage jobs. Meanwhile, while just 22 percent of \nthe jobs lost during the recession were low-wage jobs, 44 percent of \nthe jobs gained since the recession have been low-wage jobs.\n  We are trading high-wage jobs for low-wage jobs, full-time jobs for \npart-time jobs. That is the reality that many Americans are \nexperiencing. The Obama recovery, however, has been producing low-wage \npart-time jobs--not the types of jobs that Americans need for a future \nof financial security and stability.\n  No policy is threatening Americans' economic future more than \nObamaCare. As every American knows, ObamaCare has failed to deliver on \nits promise of making health care more affordable. The President \npromised that his health care law would reduce premiums by $2,500. \nInstead, premiums have risen.\n  Millions of Americans had their insurance plans cancelled and were \ntold that their new plans would cost more--sometimes much, much more. \nOne constituent wrote to tell me that the cheapest plan she could find \nfor her family of four would cost $17,000. Another wrote to tell me \nthat his insurance plan was cancelled due to ObamaCare and the cheapest \nbronze plan he could find was $987 a month--more than double what he \nwas paying before. On top of that, the plan had a higher deductible and \nsignificantly higher cost-sharing requirements than his old plan.\n  I am sure every one of my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--has \nreceived letters just like this. Our constituents are hurting. What \nmiddle class family can afford to pay $17,000 a year in insurance or \ndouble its health care premiums from the year before?\n  ObamaCare is placing an immense burden on middle-class families. The \nhuge premium hikes that many Americans are facing are having a real \nimpact on families' budgets. Money eaten by health care costs is money \nthat can't be spent on a daughter's college education or a new car to \nreplace the failing one or on repairs for the roof--and there is \nseemingly no end to ObamaCare's penalties.\n  In addition to hiking insurance premiums, ObamaCare is also \nencouraging companies to drop spousal coverage from their health plans. \nUPS and the University of Virginia, for example, have already dropped \nspousal coverage because of ObamaCare. Women are particularly affected \nby this since, as the Wall Street Journal reports, they tend to be the \nones being dropped from employer-sponsored health care plans.\n  Then there is ObamaCare's marriage penalty. A woman who qualifies for \na tax subsidy to help her purchase insurance could lose that subsidy if \nshe gets married--even if both she and her husband qualified for the \nsubsidy when they were single.\n  ObamaCare isn't just hiking Americans' health care bills, it is also \ndamaging their economic prospects. Thanks to the 30-hour workweek rule, \nObamaCare is helping to drive the surge in part-time employment. \nBusinesses that couldn't afford to give health insurance to workers \nworking more than 30 hours have been forced to reduce their employees' \nhours and, by extension, their wages. Sixty-three percent of those \naffected by this provision are women.\n  Then there is the employer mandate, which is discouraging wage growth \nand making it more difficult for employers to grow their businesses and \nto hire new workers. When employers are forced to pay for benefits they \ncan't afford, they often have no choice but to reduce wages or cancel \nraises and abandon plans for growing their businesses.\n  Then there are the other ObamaCare provisions that discourage job \ngrowth, such as the tax on medical devices such as pacemakers and \ninsulin pumps, which has already been responsible for the loss of \nthousands of jobs in the medical device industry.\n  The last thing that we need right now in this weak economy is the \nkind of widespread devastation ObamaCare is causing. Americans are \nbeing hit from both sides. ObamaCare is raising their medical bills and \nit is destroying their job opportunities.\n  If the President were serious about trying to help middle-class \nAmericans, he would be looking at where his health care law went wrong \nand at least supporting fixes for its most damaging provisions.\n  If Democrats were serious about fixing health care and helping the \neconomy, they would be taking up Senator Collins' Forty Hours is Full \nTime Act, which would fix the ObamaCare 30-hour workweek rule and put \nAmericans back to work or they would support my bill to eliminate the \nemployer mandate for schools, colleges, and universities, so that these \ninstitutions aren't forced to cut wages or to eliminate positions.\n  Democrats thought if Americans found out what was in ObamaCare and \nwhat it meant for them, they would come to like it. Well, Americans \nhave found out what is in the President's health care law, what it \nmeans for them, and they don't like it.\n  ObamaCare is hurting American families, it is hurting our economy, \nand it is time to start over and replace this bill with real health \ncare reform, the kind that will lower costs, that will increase choice, \nand that will put Americans back in charge of their health care.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nCheryl LaFleur to serve as a commissioner on the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and in opposition to the nomination of Norman \nBay to serve as a commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission.\n  On May 20, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which I am \na member, held a hearing on these two nominations. I had questions \nregarding Mr. Bay's qualifications prior to that hearing, and they were \nnot allayed. If anything, they were reinforced. Mr. Bay's experience in \nthe energy field consists of his service over the past 5 years as \nDirector of the Office of Enforcement at the FERC, a tenure which has \nbeen marked by that office's controversial theories of market \nmanipulation and concerns by long-time industry experts about due \nprocess. Mr. Bay has 5 years of enforcement experience, but he has no \nregulatory experience. By contrast, Commissioner LaFleur, currently \nserving as the Acting Chairman of the FERC, has 5 years of experience \non the FERC and decades of experience in the energy sector, including \nas a State utility commissioner.\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nYet we are being asked to demote Commissioner LaFleur to commissioner \nand replace her with an unproven and arguably less qualified candidate.\n  But most important from my perspective is whether a nominee will \naddress the key responsibilities assigned to the agency to which he or \nshe is being nominated. At FERC, job one with respect to the electric \nsector is assuring just and reasonable electric service in interstate \ncommerce, which Congress has found for the past 80 years to be in the \npublic interest. Assuring the reliability of such service is an \nimportant task that Congress explicitly made part of FERC's \nresponsibilities nearly a decade ago.\n  At our May 20 hearing, I asked Mr. Bay whether he agreed with the \ndeveloping consensus that baseload power plants, the ``always on'' \nenergy resources vital to reliable operation of the grid, deserve \nadditional consideration for the irreplaceable reliability benefits \nthey provide. Mr. Bay answered that he looked forward to reviewing \ncomments on the issue. I then asked whether as a commissioner he would \nlook at the cumulative effect of EPA rules that, by various estimates, \nhave resulted in the announced closure of 40,000 to 70,000 megawatts of \ncoal-fired power plants across the country, many of them in Ohio, the \nclosure of which has raised strong concerns about maintaining electric \nreliability in many parts of the country. He answered that if \nconfirmed, he would be willing to discuss the issue with his colleagues \nto see if consensus could be reached.\n  Mr. President, these are simple questions that go to the heart of \nFERC's mission. On both, Mr. Bay gave non-answer answers that are the \nbasis for substantial concern. Either you agree that something needs to \nbe done to keep power plants running that are vital to maintaining a \nreliable electric system, or you don't. Either you are concerned that \nEPA's rules, which even the environmental groups attribute to \nshuttering more than 68,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation, need to \nbe evaluated for their electric reliability impacts, or you don't.\n  A presidential nominee deserves the benefit of the doubt, but in the \ncase of Mr. Bay, whose nomination has been rushed to the floor, the \ndoubts remain too strong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n      Unanimous Consent Agreement--Calendar Nos. 894, 704, and 508\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 842, the Senate remain \nin executive session and consider Calendar Nos. 894, Nealon; 704, Wood; \nand 508, Jaenichen; that there be 2 minutes for debate equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees prior to each vote; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \nwithout intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order \nlisted; that any rollcall votes, following the first in the series, be \n10 minutes in length; that the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; that no \nfurther motions be in order to the nominations; that any statements \nrelated to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, we expect the \nnominations considered in this agreement to be confirmed by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about \nnominees that are before the Senate for confirmation and to thank \nMembers on both sides of the aisle for working together to try to move \nforward two very important nominees for FERC.\n  First, let me say there has been some criticism of one of the \nnominees from some Members of the other party and, of course, everyone \nis entitled to their opinion; that is what the Senate is for. But I \nwould like to make sure that the Senate record reflects an opinion of \nsomeone whom I admire greatly and I believe is very admired--\nsignificantly admired--by every Member of this Senate, and that is the \nopinion of Senator Domenici, the Republican chair of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee for many years and a long-serving Senator \nfrom the State of New Mexico.\n  Senator Domenici, it may not be clearly understood, actually came to \nthe energy committee to testify on behalf of Norman Bay.\n  His testimony was one of the most artful and compelling I have seen \nin my days here--which are now quite long at almost 18 years--and \nunusual in the sense that he read from no script, spoke from the heart, \nand spoke to Democratic and Republican members of our committee. This \nis some of what he had to say:\n\n       I am pleased to provide a strong statement of support to \n     the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on behalf \n     of Norman C. Bay. I first met Norman in early 2000, when he \n     was nominated to be the U.S. Attorney in the District of New \n     Mexico. I supported his nomination then and I support his \n     nomination now to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . \n     . .\n       He was a good U.S. Attorney--fair, capable, and non-\n     partisan--and, with my support, he remained in office as U.S. \n     Attorney until 2001.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       In July 2009, Norman became the Director of the Office of \n     Enforcement (OE) at FERC. This is a big job, because among \n     other things OE must administer the anti-manipulation \n     authority of the Energy Policy Act of 2005--a bill that I had \n     authored when I was the Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources and one that passed with wide \n     bipartisan support. The anti-manipulation authority was \n     intended to give FERC the tools to combat the type of \n     manipulation we saw in the Western Power Crisis from 2000 to \n     2001. I am pleased to hear that FERC has brought a number of \n     significant anti-manipulation cases and that the EPAct \n     authority I gave to FERC has been put to good use to protect \n     consumers, as well as the integrity of the wholesale natural \n     gas and power markets.\n\n  I could not think of a more compelling person to have in your corner \nthan the former Republican chair of the energy committee in support of \nthe Bay nomination.\n  Now, there are a handful of Members on the other side that have \nopposed every nominee put forward by President Obama because their \nagenda is very different. It is a political agenda. But on policy, \nSenator Pete Domenici's testimony goes a long way in his support of a \nman who he believes is extremely qualified for the job to which the \nPresident has nominated him.\n  In addition to the compelling testimony of Senator Domenici, which \nwas very influential in my final decision to support this nominee, I \nalso want to present for the record the letter from the Republican \nGovernor of New Mexico, Susana Martinez, who let me know personally \nthat she would have loved to have been there personally to testify on \nbehalf of Norman Bay but was unable to do so because of her schedule. \nShe goes on to write a strong letter of recommendation, which is in the \nrecord of our committee. She says:\n\n       I am certain that Norman has been dedicated in his efforts \n     to protect consumers, has been fair and balanced in his \n     approach, and has focused on doing the right thing on behalf \n     of the public interest.\n       For all those reasons, I hope the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources will approve Norman's nomination to the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\n  These are just a few of the strong testimonials that led me to \nfinally consent to my support of Norman Bay, but I did so with the \nsupport of the Presiding Officer as a member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, making sure that the current chair, Cheryl \nLaFleur, could stay on for an additional length of time. I would have \nliked another year. Some people wanted 3 months, some people wanted 6 \nmonths, and some people wanted a full term. But we settled on a 9-month \ncompromise--which is actually the fundamental nature of our business in \nthe Senate.\n\n  It has been lost in the last couple of years, but I continue to be an \noptimistic believer that a good compromise can help us move the country \nforward, reduce rancor, hold people together, and make some decisions \nthat are so important for the people who we are trying to serve.\n  FERC is not an insignificant entity. FERC, given the power by us, is \nthe guardian of the public interest in our natural gas and electricity \nmarkets,\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nsomething that Louisiana knows a lot about--natural gas and electricity \nmarkets.\n  We produce a tremendous amount of oil and gas for this Nation, and we \nconsume a lot of oil and gas as producers of chemicals and other \nproducts that use natural gas as a feedstock. We are proud of our \nindustry, and I would never casually support members on FERC if I \ndidn't believe they were prepared to do this job and to do it well.\n  In particular, with the testimony from the former Republican chairman \nof the committee and a current serving Republican Governor for Norman \nBay, I feel confident, based on his background, that he could do a good \njob, after working with Cheryl LaFleur for 9 months, which is the \nagreement that the White House and others have made.\n  Let me talk about Cheryl LaFleur for a moment. She is a graduate of \nPrinceton. She is able, she is competent, and she has served as a \nmember of FERC. She, in my view, has also been doing a spectacular job. \nShe will continue to serve as chair of FERC for the next 9 months--\nshould she be confirmed today--and will continue with the members of \nFERC to try to provide reliable power and electricity to our country--\nbeing fair and protecting the public interest.\n  This is a very complicated field of law and policy, as we know. This \nis not an easy part of the law to interpret.\n  There are many different electricity markets, there are many \ndifferent ways to supply it. They are not-for-profits, they are \nmunicipals, and they are public utility companies. They all have \npipelines and issues that have to go before FERC, and there are over \n2,000 people who work for this agency. It may not be a household word, \nbut it affects every household in America. So Cheryl LaFleur will \nremain, at my request, as chair for 9 months. Norman Bay will come on \nand train, if you will, under her leadership, and I think grow into the \nrole as a policymaker. He clearly is qualified--by the demonstration of \nthe letters I have put in.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the leadership role he has played \nin outlining that path forward, trying to broker a compromise between \npeople who wanted to do it very differently.\n  We had opposition on both sides for what is actually happening today, \nas we know, but we worked with Democrats and Republicans, trying to \nfind a way forward, honoring the right of the President to make his \nnominations and still doing the right thing by FERC and the country. I \npersonally think we have achieved that. I wanted to put that on the \nrecord before we vote. I understand the vote should be called any \nmoment now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Vote on Bay Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today in \nsupport of the Not My Boss's Business Act. I thank Senator Murray and \nSenator Udall for introducing this legislation to help address the \nrecent Supreme Court decision.\n  Women have gone to the tops of the mountains and to outer space. \nWomen are serving as CEOs, as scientists, and starting our own \ncompanies. Here in the Senate we have gone from no women to 20, and \nthat is a great accomplishment.\n  But for all of our progress--and there has been a lot--this stubborn \nfact remains: Women still struggle to attain the basic health care \nservices that allow them to plan their families, protect their health, \nand contribute to our economy. This is fundamentally an issue of \nfairness and an issue of equality.\n  I have always said that the Affordable Care Act is a beginning and \nnot an end. I would like to see changes to that bill. I have sponsored \nchanges to that bill. But the law does take significant steps forward \non health care for women. One that is of particular importance to women \nis requiring that all health insurance plans cover FDA-approved forms \nof contraception. This decision was based on the recommendations of the \nInstitute of Medicine.\n  The Institute of Medicine had good reason to include contraception as \nan essential preventive service. We know that pregnancies that are \nplanned are good for moms; they are good for babies. Better access to \ncontraception prevents unintended pregnancies--something we can all \nagree we want. We do not want unintended pregnancies. We do not want to \nhave abortions. So better access to contraception, as has been proven \ntime and time again, brings down those numbers. And access to birth \ncontrol is essential for women to meet their career and their education \nand their family goals.\n  Not every employer was required to provide contraceptive coverage. \nCertain nonprofit religious employers were allowed an exemption. It \nprotected the beliefs of religious nonprofits but could be implemented \nin a way that still ensured all women could receive the same preventive \nservices in their health insurance.\n  What I do not believe is sensible, however, is allowing any for-\nprofit business to ask for an exemption. That, in practice, is what the \nHobby Lobby Supreme Court ruling could do and what the bill we are \nconsidering today would correct.\n  First, what this bill will not do: It will not force churches or \nreligiously affiliated nonprofits to offer contraception coverage. This \nbill maintains their exemption. It will not force anyone to use \ncontraception. That decision is and must remain with each person.\n  What this bill will do, however, is to add a provision to the \nAffordable Care Act's requirements that would prohibit an employer from \ndenying coverage of a health care service that is required under \nFederal law. It clarifies that this requirement applies even under the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act--the law that the Supreme Court ruled \nwas violated by the contraception coverage requirement.\n  In other words, it says if you work for an American corporation, you \ncan expect that your health insurance--which you work for and receive \nas part of your compensation--will cover the same basic preventive \nhealth benefits everyone else receives. It says that your boss--\nregardless of his or her religious beliefs--cannot pick and choose what \nbenefits your health insurance covers.\n  This is common sense. A woman's decision about her birth control is \nbetween her and her doctor, not her employer. What she chooses to use \nher compensation for is really not her boss's business, whether we are \ntalking about a salary or other compensation, including health \ninsurance.\n  There is no doubt that women have come a long way. But when a woman's \nboss can step in, as a result of this narrowly decided Court decision--\na 5-4 ruling--and prevent her from making the best health care \ndecisions for her health, her career, and her future, it makes me \nwonder just how far we have actually come.\n  Mr. President, that is why I urge you to support this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill. This important legislation will help \npreserve the rights of employees while protecting religious employers. \nIt will help women access the preventive services they need and it will \nprevent unintended pregnancies and improve the health of both women and \ntheir children. That is not just good for women; that is good for \nfamilies, that is good for business, that is good for our economy, and \nthat is good for our future.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto finish my remarks.\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Religious Liberty\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in defense of the most \nfundamental principle on which our Republic was founded--what is \nrightly recognized as our first freedom--religious liberty.\n  Our fellow citizens today do not think much of Congress. The Gallup \norganization, whose results are actually less grim than some other \npolls, gives Congress a job approval rating of just 15 percent. That \nfigure has not risen above the teens in more than 3 years.\n  Now and then, however, Congress does rise to the occasion, putting \naside partisan or ideological differences to achieve something \nimportant for our Nation and its citizens.\n  One example occurred in 1993--I had a lot to do with it--when \nliberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, stood to defend \na fundamental human right. On October 27, 1993, this body passed the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act by a vote of 97 to 3.\n  It went through the House by a unanimous vote. By mid-November the \nHouse had passed it unanimously and President Bill Clinton had signed \nit into law. I was there at the signing ceremony on the south lawn. \nDespite the overwhelming bipartisan support for final passage of RFRA, \nit took Congress 3 years to achieve that defense of religious freedom.\n  The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights \nheld hearings in 1990 and 1992, and the full Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing in 1992. Concerned citizens and groups came together to \nform the Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion--a grassroots \neffort more diverse than any I have ever seen in all of my 38 years \nhere. Americans of every political stripe joined hands to defend the \nfirst freedom mentioned in the Bill of Rights. The resulting \nlegislation, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, allows the Federal \nGovernment to interfere with the exercise of religion only for the most \ncompelling reason and only in the least restrictive way. This law was \nnecessary because in 1990 the Supreme Court had changed the legal \nstandard, making it easy, rather than difficult, for the government to \nburden religious exercise.\n  A bill recently introduced here in the Senate, S. 2578, would turn \nthe clock back, requiring that Federal laws and regulations ignore \nrather than respect religious freedom. This is the first time in \nAmerican history that the Congress will consider a bill intended to \ndiminish the protections for the religious liberty of all Americans. It \nis part of a broader campaign to demonize religious freedom as the \nenemy, as an obstacle to certain political goals.\n  It is important for the American people to know the truth about how \nwe got here. The Affordable Care Act requires that most employers \nprovide insurance coverage at no cost to employees for what it calls \npreventive services. Regulations from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services define that category as covering all forms of birth \ncontrol approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including both \ncontraceptives and methods that can act after conception.\n  The difference between a contraceptive and an abortifacient is the \ndifference between preventing and taking human life. That discrepancy \nmay be meaningless to some, but it is very important to many and can be \na matter of the most profound moral and religious significance. As a \nresult of the birth control mandate, many religious employers faced \nmassive fines if they followed their religious beliefs, so some of them \nfiled suit to prevent its enforcement.\n  This is exactly the kind of situation that the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act was enacted to address, the kind of situation that \nshould require the government to justify why it wants to interfere with \nthe exercise of religion.\n  Cases brought by two companies owned by religious families made it to \nthe Supreme Court. These companies do provide insurance coverage for \nthe FDA's 16 methods of contraception, but they believe that doing so \nfor its 4 methods of birth control that can cause abortion violates \ntheir deeply held religious beliefs.\n  Two weeks ago, in a case titled ``Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores,'' \nthe Supreme Court ruled that the HHS birth control mandate does not \nsufficiently accommodate these employers' exercise of religion as \nrequired by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  It took a lot of work to establish RFRA's defense of religious \nfreedom, but it would not take much work to destroy it. The bill we \nwill soon consider, S. 2578, would in one fell swoop reduce the free \nexercise of religion from a fundamental human right to a cheap \nelection-year prop.\n  RFRA was developed after months of discussion and debate. It was the \nproduct of bipartisan deliberation and considered judgment. I know. I \nwas there. I was the one who talked Senator Kennedy into coming on this \nbill. When it was signed on the south lawn--when President Clinton \nsigned it, Senator Kennedy was one of the most proud people there. This \nbill represents vindication of the fundamental and natural rights that \nwe originally established government to protect.\n  By contrast, S. 2578 was thrown together in a matter of days. It has \nnot received a single committee hearing in either Chamber. In fact, \nhere in the Senate it is not even being sent to a legislative \ncommittee. The majority has put their finger to the political wind and \ndecided that all they want is a show vote they can spin to their \nadvantage in the election this fall. That is ridiculous. They ought to \nbe ashamed.\n  One sign of what is really going on is the fact that the bill's \n``findings'' are about four times as long as its actual provisions, and \nit reads more like a series of press releases than serious legislative \nlanguage. The bill's supporters wish to ram it through Congress without \nmeaningful deliberation, without hearings, without the kind of scrutiny \nthat would expose this effort for what it is. The bill's findings, for \nexample, say not one word about the exercise of religion that gave rise \nto the Hobby Lobby litigation in the first place. Instead, one of the \nbill's findings claims that those lawsuits were filed by employers who \nsimply wanted to deny their employees health insurance coverage for \nbirth control. I guess you can call it contraception. In reality, the \nemployers do not want to take anything away from anyone. They simply \nask, as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act requires, that laws and \nregulations about health insurance coverage also consider and balance \ntheir basic right to religious exercise.\n  I have heard proponents of this legislation make wild claims that \ncorporations are denying access to health care, intruding into people's \nbedrooms, and even taking away their freedoms. Nonsense. Such claims do \nnot even pass the laugh test. They are so clearly false that those who \npeddle such fiction must ignore both RFRA and the Supreme Court's \ndecision in the Hobby Lobby case or deliberately distort them beyond \nrecognition.\n  Just yesterday the Washington Post Fact Checker listed example after \nexample of what it charitably described as the rhetoric getting way \nahead of the facts as Democrats have made one outlandish claim after \nanother.\n  Finding 19 in this bill is perhaps its most outrageous, claiming that \nlegislation ``is intended to be consistent with the Congressional \nintent in enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.'' But of \ncourse that claim is absurd on its face. Congress expressed its purpose \nin enacting RFRA in the text of that statute, including RFRA's finding \nthat its legal standard applies ``in all cases where the free exercise \nof religion is substantially burdened.'' RFRA's most prominent backers \nin Congress also expressed its intent. Over in the House, for example, \nthen-Representative Charles Schumer said that RFRA would restore the \nAmerican tradition of ``allowing maximum religious freedom''--spoke \nabout this bill, spoke glowingly about what it means on both sides of \nthe floor.\n  The bill before us today does the opposite, requiring employers to \nprovide insurance coverage ``notwithstanding any other provision of \nFederal law,'' including specifically the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct. If a bill prohibiting consideration of religious exercise is \nconsistent with the law requiring consideration of religious exercise, \nsuch as RFRA, then words have no meaning whatsoever.\n  We are also told that S. 2578 simply responds to the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision in Hobby Lobby, but in reality\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nit goes much further. The Supreme Court's decision involved only the \nAffordable Care Act and the HHS birth control mandate, but this bill \nprohibits consideration of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nregarding insurance coverage of any health care item or service \nrequired by any Federal law or regulation. The Affordable Care Act and \nthe HHS birth control mandate apply to employers with at least 50 \nemployees, but this bill's much broader mandate applies to any employer \nregardless of size. The Hobby Lobby case involved a for-profit \ncorporation, but this bill applies to any employer. This bill appears \nto be not so much a response to the Supreme Court's decision in Hobby \nLobby as the attempt to broaden and extend the Affordable Care Act and \nthe HHS birth control mandate.\n  The bill's mandate that health insurance coverage for any health care \nitem or service under any Federal law or regulation be provided \nnotwithstanding any other provision of Federal law seems to reach \nbeyond the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Does it include, for \nexample, the Hyde-Weldon amendment or other laws that have for more \nthan 40 years protected health care providers and facilities from being \nforced to participate in abortion? Before you answer no, remember that \nno one thought RFRA's protections for religious freedom would ever be \nattacked as they are today.\n  Under S. 2578, the lone protections for the fundamental right of \nreligious exercise would be the narrow statutory exemption for churches \nand houses of worship and the weak administrative accommodation for \nreligious nonprofits that could be revoked at any time. Even worse, the \nbill would allow for a future reduction or elimination of this so-\ncalled accommodation but not for its expansion. Not only would \nreligious freedom be diminished immediately but what is left would be \nsubject to a one-way ratchet toward elimination.\n  Earlier this summer I spoke here on the Senate floor about how \nreligious freedom in America has three key dimensions: It includes \nreligious behavior as well as belief. It applies collectively as well \nas individually. It is public as well as private in scope.\n  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act represents the full \nunderstanding of religious freedom. It requires that when Congress \nconsiders legislation or executive branch agencies consider \nregulations, they must take this fundamental freedom into account and \ngive it the respect it deserves. S. 2578 would be the first bill to \ncreate an exemption from RFRA and the first bill explicitly to prohibit \nconsideration of the fundamental right of religious exercise.\n  Five years after enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \nCongress enacted the International Religious Freedom Act, which \nestablished the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. \nThat legislation declared that the ``right to freedom of religion \nundergirds the very origin and existence of the United States.'' The \nSenate passed that legislation by a vote of 98 to 0, including 10 \nDemocrats who have today cosponsored the bill before us that would \ndisregard freedom of religion. Those Democrats include the majority \nleader and the sponsor of S. 2578. They cannot have it both ways.\n  Like his predecessors, President Obama designated January 16 as \nReligious Freedom Day. In his proclamation, the President declared that \n``my administration will remain committed to promoting religious \nfreedom both at home and across the globe. We urge every country to \nrecognize religious freedom as both a religious right and a key to a \nstable, prosperous and peaceful future.'' Actions speak louder than \nwords. Either religious freedom undergirds the origin and existence of \nAmerica or it does not. Religious freedom is either a universal right \nor it is not. Religious freedom is either a key to a stable and \nprosperous future or it is not.\n  If America is about allowing maximum religious freedoms, as my \ncolleague the senior Senator from New York once said, then it should \ncontinue to do so.\n  It is time for this body to choose whether it will protect religious \nliberty or whether it will seek to destroy it.\n  In 1993, Congress stood up to defend the free exercise of religion \nafter a Supreme Court decision undermined it. The bill before us today \nwould undermine the free exercise of religion after a Supreme Court \ndecision defended it.\n  In 1993, the free exercise of religion was offered as a solution. The \nbill before us today targets religious freedom as the problem. It \ntreats certain religious beliefs as simply unworthy of recognition and \nreligious exercise in general as a second- or even a third-rate value. \nI believe we can both uphold fundamental rights and find solutions to \npublic policy issues.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, even though we have \ndifferences about policy, will once again join together for the common \ngood by recommitting ourselves and our Nation to the fundamental right \nof religious freedom. We have to do this. It is the first freedom \nmentioned in the Bill of Rights. One would think everybody here would \nbe absolutely on the side of upholding it.\n  This bill is anything but that, and I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle start to realize how important this is and vote \nagainst this terrible bill that has been slapped together for political \npurposes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, Republicans are on the attack once again, \ntrying to put women's fundamental rights on the chopping block. I stand \nwith my colleagues to fight back. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, \nSenator Mark Udall of Colorado, and 40 other Senators have stood to \nsponsor new legislation to reverse the Supreme Court's shocking \ndecision in Hobby Lobby, where the Court gave corporations the power to \ndeny their employees access to birth control. We will vote on this \nlegislation tomorrow morning, and I urge my colleagues to pass it \nwithout delay.\n  Right now, with millions of Americans still out of work and \nstruggling to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great \nDepression, with 40 million Americans dealing with student loans, with \nmillions of people working full time at minimum wage and still living \nin poverty, with the big banks getting bigger, workers getting poorer, \nand seniors struggling to make ends meet, Republicans in Washington \nhave decided that the most important thing for them to focus on is how \nto deny women access to birth control.\n  I will be honest: I cannot believe we are even having a debate about \nwhether employers can deny women access to birth control. Guys, this is \n2014, not 1914. Most Americans thought this was settled long, long ago. \nBut for some reason Republicans keep dragging us back here over and \nover again.\n  After all, the Hobby Lobby case is just the most recent battle in an \nall-out Republican assault on women's access to basic health care. In \n2012 the Republicans tried to pass the Blunt amendment, a proposal that \nwould have allowed employers and insurance companies to deny women \naccess to health care services based on any vague moral objection. \nDemocrats said no, the President said no, and the American people said \nno to this offensive idea.\n  But instead of listening to the American people, Republicans in \nWashington doubled down. Remember last year's government shutdown that \nnearly tanked our economy? That fight started with a GOP effort to hold \nthe whole operation of the Federal Government hostage in order to try \nto force Democrats and the President to let employers deny their \nworkers access to birth control. Well, we rejected the hostage taking. \nDemocrats said no, the President said no, and the American people said \nno to this offensive idea.\n  But instead of listening to the American people, Republicans turned \nto their rightwing friends on the Supreme Court, and those Justices did \nwhat Congress would not do, what the President would not do, and what \nthe American people would not do. Those Justices decided that \ncorporations have the right to ignore the law and determine for \nthemselves whether their employees can access basic health care \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\n  The Hobby Lobby decision is a stunning case. As Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg noted in her dissent, the result of this case could be to deny \n``legions of women who do not hold their employers' beliefs access to \ncontraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure.''\n  The case is the first step on a slippery slope that could eventually \nallow corporations to deny health care coverage to employees for other \nmedical care including immunizations that protect our children from \ndeadly disease, HIV treatment that saves lives or blood transfusions \nneeded in surgeries.\n  The Hobby Lobby case is stunning, but not entirely surprising. Giant \ncorporations and their rightwing allies fight every day in Congress to \nprotect their own privileges and to bend the laws to benefit \nthemselves. They devote enormous resources to the task. Sometimes we \nbeat them anyway. We beat them when they tried to pass the Blunt \namendment, and we beat them when they tried to shut down the government \nover birth control. But when corporations lose in Congress, they don't \njust give up. They know they can often turn defeat into victory if they \ncan get a favorable court decision. So while they push hard on \nCongress, they also devote enormous resources to influencing the \ncourts, trying to transform our judiciary from a neutral, fair and \nimpartial forum into just one more rigged Washington game. Nowhere has \nthe success of this strategy to rig the courts been more obvious than \nwith the U.S. Supreme Court. Three well-respected legal scholars \nrecently examined 20,000 Supreme Court cases from the last 65 years, \nand they listed the top 10 most procorporate Justices in that entire \ntime. The results? The five conservative Justices sitting on the Court \ntoday were all in the top 10, and Justices Alito and Roberts are \nnumbers 1 and 2.\n  So it is no surprise that those five Justices banded together in the \nHobby Lobby case to decide that corporations have more rights than the \nwomen who work for them. They decided that corporations are people who \nmatter more than real living men and women who work hard everyday and \nwho are entitled to the protection of our laws.\n  Now we can fight back against this decision and against the corporate \ncapture of our Federal courts. We can fight back by appointing judges \nwho are fair, judges who are impartial, judges who won't show up on any \n``top 10'' list for putting a thumb on the scales in favor of big \nbusiness. We can fight back tomorrow by passing legislation to overturn \nthis terrible Supreme Court decision.\n  The proposed law, called the Protect Women's Health From Corporate \nInterference Act is simple. It does not require any person, any church, \nany house of worship, any faith or any religious nonprofit to endorse \nor provide insurance coverage for contraception. It does just one \nthing: It prevents ordinary for-profit corporations from ignoring the \nlaw and imposing their own religious beliefs on their employees by \nrefusing to provide basic health benefits that are legally required. \nThat was the law before Hobby Lobby, and it should be the law again.\n  Senators will have a chance to vote tomorrow, and I urge every \nSenator to do the right thing. But whatever happens, we have won this \nfight many times before, and I am confident that sooner or later we \nwill win it again, because no matter how many resources the other side \npours into this battle, they will never convince Americans that their \nbosses should be in charge of their most intimate health care \ndecisions, and they will never convince Americans that corporations are \npeople whose imagined rights are somehow more important than the health \nof real living, breathing people.\n  I have a daughter, I have granddaughters, and I will never stop \nfighting the efforts of backward-looking ideologues who want to cut \nwomen's access to birth control. We have lived in that world, and we \nare not going back--not ever.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, according to the Border Patrol, more than \n57,000 unaccompanied children have entered the United States illegally \nthis year. That number is expected to grow to 90,000 by the end of the \nyear and 140,000 by the end of next year. These startling facts speak \nfor themselves. Swift and dramatic action, both on the part of Congress \nand the administration is needed.\n  We know why most children are coming. America offers more opportunity \nthan the country from which they are fleeing. Most of these children \nhope to be reunited with a parent or a relative. Many just hope to \nblend into the United States and to stay for an indefinite period of \ntime. I understand that.\n  I understand the incentive to be in the United States, but we cannot \nsimply allow this to continue. According to reports about a recent \nWhite House meeting the President had with some people concerned about \nthis wave of people coming from Central America, the President said \nthat sometimes there is an inherent injustice in where you are born, \nand no President can solve that. He reportedly said that Presidents \nmust send the message that you just cannot show up at the border, plead \nfor asylum or refugee status and hope to get it.\n  The President is quoted as saying:\n\n     . . . then anyone can come in, and it means that, \n     effectively, we don't have any kind of system. We are a \n     Nation with borders that must be enforced.\n\n  The President is right. If the reckless journey from Central America \nor Mexico or any other country to the United States is met with, at \nworst, long stays in the United States and, at best, long stays coupled \nwith family reunification, these crossings will continue. It is just \nhuman nature. Even if every child and every adult is ultimately \ndeported 6 months or a year from now, it will be too late, for in the \nintervening months the message is: Make it to the United States and you \ncan stay.\n  The incentives must change. When planes full of those who crossed are \nreturned, people in those countries will stop paying smugglers \nthousands of dollars to take their children north. Incentives work, and \nin this case it may be the only way.\n  So what are we to do? At one point the President asked Congress for \nsome legal authority. Congress should give it to him. In addition, \nSenator McCain and I will offer a bill that will hinge U.S. foreign aid \nto Central American countries on their response to this situation, \nproviding for refugee processing in those countries. They will heighten \npenalties for human trafficking and it will expedite the removal of \nthose who are here without a legitimate claim.\n  The President did ask for funds to deal with the crisis, although he \nasked for those funds without reforms. I am pleased to say that there \nappears to be a growing consensus that any funding request in a \nsupplemental bill should include substantive reforms that deal with the \nexisting circumstances that we are in as well as heading off future \nimpacts. In the meantime the administration has at its discretion the \nability to dramatically stem this wave of crossings.\n  I will talk about a few of the options that the President clearly has \nright now. First and foremost, the Department of Homeland Security is \nnot required to release unaccompanied children after they have been \napprehended. While requiring DHS to transfer them to Health and Human \nServices within 72 hours, the 2008 trafficking law provides flexibility \nin ``exceptional circumstances.''\n  Second, the administration has at its discretion the ability to \nexpedite or trim the timelines of hearings for unaccompanied children. \nFor example, the President can direct the Department of Justice to not \nagree to continuances for these hearings. He should do that as well.\n  Third, for children already released to HHS, the President can direct \nHHS to not place children automatically with their parents or family \nmembers. The 2008 trafficking protection law requires the \nadministration to place children in the ``least restrictive setting'' \nin their best interest. The administration has discretion as to what \nconstitutes least restrictive setting. If we acknowledge, as the \nPresident has, that most of these children will not be able to stay in \nthe United States, why would we place them with a parent or a guardian \nonly to take them from that parent or guardian months or years later? \nThat, I would submit, is not in their best interest.\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\n  I am certain that there are those who will object to these actions if \ntaken by the President, but I will submit that we should do everything \nwe can to ensure that another 30,000 or 60,000 or 100,000 children do \nnot stream north on this dangerous journey. The real question is, What \nwouldn't we do to prevent that from happening? The current situation is \nnot humane at all. It is not humane to allow these children to come \nforward this way.\n  Let me be clear. For those seeking asylum, there will be many who \nwill have a legitimate claim of persecution. Nobody is talking about \nshutting down the avenues to submit or to have such a claim. There will \nstill be protections for genuine asylum seekers. It is best for those \nwho seek refuge to do so in their own home country at an American \nembassy or consulate. That should, at best, be done in their own \ncountry. The legislation we will put forward will provide more \nresources for that to happen.\n  Earlier this month the President's spokesman indicated that ``it's \nunlikely that most of the kids who go through this process will qualify \nfor humanitarian relief, which is to say that most of them will not \nhave a legal basis . . . to remain in the country.''\n  Cecilia Munoz, the Director of the White House Domestic Policy \nCouncil, made it clear: ``If you look at the history of these kinds of \ncases and apply them to the situation, it seems very unlikely that the \nmajority of these children are going to have the ability to stay in the \nUnited States.''\n  Here is my primary concern: Despite discretion to do otherwise, the \nadministration continues to provide precisely the goal of those \ncrossing illegally--being allowed to enter the United States, reuniting \nwith their families, and staying for an extended period of time. They \nare allowing these incentives to continue. Despite firm quotes and \nstatements otherwise, the administration's response to the crisis is a \ncase study in sending the wrong message.\n  In his July 8 request for $3.7 billion in supplemental spending \nrelated to this crisis, the President stated that his administration \nwould work with Congress to ``ensure that [they] have the legal \nauthority'' they need, including ``providing the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity additional authority to exercise discretion in processing the \nreturn and removal of unaccompanied children from these Central \nAmerican countries.'' More than a week later, with the wave of children \ncrossing illegally every day and increased anger pointed at the issue, \nit remains anyone's guess as to what the President is actually seeking. \nHe didn't ask for any new authority in the funding request that was \njust sent up. In the days after the supplemental request was made, it \nbecame clear that nearly $2 billion of the funding request is for the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services--a department that plays no \nrole in deportation and a department that the administration permits to \nplace those who cross illegally with families inside the United States.\n  Congress needs to do what it can to provide the statutory tools to \naddress this crisis. As I mentioned earlier, the senior Senator from \nArizona and I will offer a bill in the coming days to do that. In the \nmeantime, the President has the discretion and the authority to act \nwithin the law, follow the law, and offer the right incentives so we \ndon't have this situation continuing as it is today. I encourage the \nPresident to do so.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The senior Senator from New \nJersey.\n\n\n                           Iran Negotiations\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I come again to the floor to speak \nabout one of our greatest national security challenges, which is a \nnuclear-armed Iran and the latest conflicting remarks coming from \nIran's leaders.\n  I will say at the outset, as I have said in the past, I support the \nadministration's diplomatic efforts. I have always supported a \nbipartisan, two-track policy of diplomacy and sanctions. At the same \ntime, I am convinced that we should only relieve pressure on Iran in \nexchange for very verifiable concessions that will fundamentally \ndismantle Iran's illicit nuclear program and that any deal be \nstructured in such a way that alarm bells will sound from Vienna to \nWashington to Moscow and Beijing should Iran restart its program \nanytime in the next 20 or 30 years.\n  I am gravely concerned by the recent remarks of Iran's Supreme \nLeader, the Ayatollah, whose views about what Iran is willing to give \nup in a deal seem to deliberately undermine the positions of Iran's \nnegotiators in Vienna and clearly curtail their flexibility as we enter \ninto a critical stage of the talks.\n  Yesterday, Foreign Minister Zarif gave an interview that went public \nwith Iran's negotiating position. Let's break down exactly what it is \nhe offered. He said Iran will freeze its nuclear fuel program for \nseveral years in exchange for being treated like other peaceful nuclear \nnations and for sanctions relief. Let's be clear. This will leave \n19,000 centrifuges spinning in Iran. It would not, from what I can \ntell, require Iran to dismantle anything. In my view, that is not a \nstarting place for an end game. It is the same obfuscation and the same \nIranian tactics we have seen for years and decades. Iran puts offers on \nthe table that appear to be concessions but in reality are designed to \npreserve Iranian illicit nuclear infrastructure and enrichment so that \nthe capacity to break out and rush toward a nuclear weapon is still \nvery much within reach. That is not an end game; it is a nonstarter.\n  Essentially what Zarif is offering is the same concessions as what \nIran made for the interim agreement over 6 months ago. In exchange, \nIran gets sanction relief--except we know Iran is not like any other \nnation, and its history of cheating, lying, and evading inspections \nproves it.\n  One commentator said this morning: ``So it seems that Iran is trying \nto protect its nuclear breakout capacity while trying to appear \nmoderate.''\n  Zarif's proposal last night is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. \nIt is more moderate than the Ayatollah's outlandish demand for 190,000 \ncentrifuges last week, but at its core it is an offer to not give \nanything in terms of enrichment capacity and in exchange receive \nsanctions relief, and that is unacceptable.\n  The Zarif proposal will extend the joint plan of action, allowing \nIran's nuclear program to run in place subject to inspections but will \nnot make a single concession--none--that would demonstrably set back \nIran's nuclear ambitions in the long term, including no concessions on \nthe number of centrifuges in the secret Fordow enrichment facility. \nIran would get the relief it wants while retaining the infrastructure \nto quickly rebuild its stockpile of highly enriched uranium. That is \nstraight out of the North Korea handbook--freeze and preserve your \nability for a future date.\n  I remind my colleagues in the Senate that in October of 1994, the \nUnited States and North Korea signed an agreed framework which the \ninternational community hoped would end the ongoing crisis over North \nKorea's nuclear program. The agreement froze the operation and \nconstruction of North Korea's nuclear reactors which were part of its \ncovert nuclear weapons program. In exchange, the United States agreed \nto provide two proliferation-resistant nuclear power reactors. There \nwere high hopes for the agreement. Many called it a first step in the \nfull normalization of political and economic relations with North \nKorea.\n  While North Korea carried out some of the measures in the agreement, \nit simultaneously continued its ballistic missile program by improving \nthe range and accuracy of its missiles, and it secretly began to pursue \na clandestine program to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons separate \nfrom the plutonium program which the agreement had frozen.\n  Once again, international tensions came to a head in January of 2003 \nwhen North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, \nand following its withdrawal from the NPT, North Korea kicked out IAEA \ninspectors, restarted the nuclear reactor that had been frozen under \nthe 1994 agreed framework, and began moving spent fuel rods to a \nreprocessing center that could produce plutonium.\n  At the time of its withdrawal, North Korea, like Iran, said it ``had \nno intention of making nuclear weapons'' and that its nuclear \nactivities ``would be confined only to power production and other \npeaceful purposes.'' Of course, as\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nwe know now, North Korea would conduct a nuclear test establishing its \npotential to build nuclear weapons.\n  This history should serve as a warning about what could happen if we \nallow Iran to maintain a robust nuclear infrastructure.\n  The fact is that Iran is simply agreeing to freeze and to temporarily \nlock the door on its nuclear weapons program as is and walk away. \nShould they later walk away from the deal, as they have in the past, \nthey can simply unlock the door and continue their nuclear weapons \nprogram from where they are today. That is exactly what the talks--in \nmy mind--were intended to avoid.\n\n  As I stand here, there is a rush for our negotiators in Vienna and \nSecretary Kerry to go and try to save the essence of what seems to be a \nsignificant distance between the parties. I know our side is working in \ngood faith to reach an agreement. Our terms have been on the table for \nmonths, and now, at the critical hour, the Supreme Leader throws a \nmonkey wrench into the negotiations and even surprises his own \nnegotiating team by demanding that 190,000 centrifuges remain for any \nfinal deal.\n  At this point it is our obligation to ask some very pointed \nquestions. Are Zarif and President Ruhani truly empowered to make this \ndeal? Even though Zarif and Ruhani's intentions seem sincere, can we \nsay the same about the ultimate decisionmaker in Tehran, Supreme Leader \nKhamenei? Does the Supreme Leader truly want a deal or are his redlines \nan attempt to undermine the negotiations?\n  Secretary Kerry said this morning that ``the U.S. believes Iran has \nthe right to a peaceful nuclear program under the NPT.''\n  Let's remind ourselves of first principles. No country has a right to \nenrichment. They may have the ability to enrichment or a desire to \nenrich, but they do not have the right to enrich, and certainly not \nIran given its past behavior.\n  Let's remember how we reached this point. Over a period of decades, \nIran has deceived the international community about its nuclear \nprogram, breaching its international commitment in what everyone agrees \nwas an attempt to make Iran a nuclear weapons state or at least a \nthreshold state. Experts such as those at the Institute for Science and \nInternational Security believe that Iran began building a secret \nuranium enrichment centrifuge facility underground at Fordow in 2006--3 \nyears--3 years--before it was declared to the International Atomic \nEnergy Administration. Now Iran is seeking to turn the tables on the \nnegotiation to again convince the international community--through \nwords rather than deeds--that it seeks a peaceful nuclear energy \nprogram. The Supreme Leader called the idea of closing Fordow \n``laughable.'' For my colleagues, this is a facility built under a \nmountain, declared only after Iran was caught cheating, and designed to \nwithstand a military strike. It does not take a nuclear expert to draw \nthe obvious conclusion about Iran's intentions.\n\n  If Iran can't even agree to close the facility that is at the heart \nof its covert enrichment program, what concessions can it possibly make \nthat would address international concerns? Are we supposed to take Iran \nat its word when its actions have demonstrated over years that it is \nnot a good-faith actor? Are we supposed to believe that Iran wants \n190,000 centrifuges--about 171,000 more than it has right now--for \npeaceful purposes? That is truly laughable.\n  Even for a country that doesn't have the world's third largest oil \nreserves--which Iran does--that would be an absurd position. Iran can--\nand in fact already does--get cheaper and better nuclear fuel for the \nBushehr reactor from Russia than it could make at home. Let me repeat \nthat. It gets cheaper and better fuel from Russia for its nuclear \nreactor at the Bushehr facility than what it can make at home.\n  Experts agree that centrifuges must be a part of the deal. David \nAlbright, a respected former International Atomic Energy Administration \ninspector, has said for Iran's move from an interim to a final \nagreement, it would have to close the Fordow facility and remove \nbetween 15,000 and 16,000 of its existing 20,000 centrifuges. Even \nthen, we are looking at a breakout time of about 6 to 8 months, \ndepending on whether Iran has access to uranium enriched to just 3.5 \npercent or access to 20-percent enriched uranium.\n  Dennis Ross, one of America's preeminent diplomats and foreign policy \nanalysts, who has served under both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents, has said Iran should retain no more than 10 percent of its \ncentrifuges. That is no more than 2,000.\n  So maybe the comments we have heard from the Supreme Leader were, as \nsome analysts have suggested, an effort by the Supreme Leader to \nsuperimpose limitations on the negotiating team so at some point they \nwould be free to say these issues are out of their hands, in the hope \nof somehow forcing a better deal this week in Vienna. So I suggest that \nwe are either seeing a not so clever game of good cop-bad cop or Iran's \nnegotiators in Vienna have done a poor job of communicating what their \nboss believes is the bottom line at the negotiating table or maybe we \njust haven't been listening to what we don't want to hear. From the \nonset of the talks, Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif and President Rouhani \nhave said they would not dismantle any centrifuges. President Rouhani \nwas adamant in an interview on CNN that Iran would not be dismantling \nits centrifuges.\n  Let me quote from that interview with Mr. Zakaria.\n  President Rouhani:\n\n       We are determined to provide for the nuclear fuel of such \n     plants inside the country, at the hands of local Iranian \n     scientists. We are going to follow on this path.\n\n  Zakaria said:\n\n       So there will be no destruction of centrifuges, of existing \n     centrifuges?\n\n  President Rouhani said:\n\n       No, no, not at all.\n\n  Let's remember that the onus in these talks is on Iran, not the P5+1. \nIran is the party at fault. Iran is the party that came to these talks \nwith unclean hands. Iran is the party that has been consistently and \noverwhelmingly rebuffed by the United Nations and the international \ncommunity for its nuclear ambitions and support for terrorism, the \nsubject of six U.N. Security Council resolutions and a multitude of \nsanctions regimes.\n  Just last week the U.S. courts agreed to a landmark payment of $1.7 \nbillion to the families of Iranian terror victims, including families \nof the 241 servicemembers who died in the bombing of the Marine Corps \nbarracks bombing in Lebanon in 1983--31 years ago--and 19 who died in \nthe Khobar Towers bombing in eastern Saudi Arabia in 1996--both \nbombings perpetrated by Iran. Iran's duplicity has been going on for \ndecades.\n  So who is the bad guy here? Now commentators may choose to see the \nU.S. Congress as the antagonist here, but I suggest they look across \nthe table and decide whether they want to take a deal with Iran on a \nnod and a handshake. In my view, through its history, through its \nactions, through its false words and deeds for decades, Iran has \nforgone the ability for us to shake on a deal that freezes their \nprogram. The only option on the table can be a long-term deal that \ndismantles Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program--a deal that clearly \nprovides for a long-term verification, inspection, and enforcement \nregime, and incentives for compliance in the form of sanctions relief--\nbased on Iranian actions that are verifiable, not on what Iran claims \nto be the truth.\n  The fact is, from my perspective, there is no sanctions relief \nsigning bonus. If Iran wants relief from sanctions, then it needs to \ntangibly demonstrate to the world it is giving up its quest for nuclear \nweapons--period.\n  Let's remember that, although none of us in this Chamber are at the \nnegotiating table, we have a tremendous stake in the outcome. Without \nCongress's bipartisan action on a clear sanctions regime, there would \nhave been no talks and we would not even have had the hope of ending \nIran's nuclear weapons ambitions. As a separate and coequal branch of \ngovernment representing the American people, Congress has an obligation \nto provide oversight and a duty to express our views of what a \ncomprehensive deal should look like. I will continue to come to this \nfloor to express my views and my concerns given what we have heard and \nseen in the past from Iran.\n  Iran has a history of duplicity with respect to its nuclear program, \nusing past negotiations to cover advances in its nuclear program. And \nlet's not forget that President Rouhani, as the\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nformer negotiator for Iran, said, in no uncertain terms:\n\n       The day that we invited the three European ministers to the \n     talks, only 10 centrifuges were spinning at Natanz. We could \n     not produce one gram of U4 or U6. We did not have the heavy \n     water production. We could not produce yellowcake. Our total \n     production of centrifuges inside the country was 150. We \n     wanted to complete all of these. We needed time. We did not \n     stop. We completed the program.\n\n  That is his quote.\n  The simple truth is he admitted to deceiving the West.\n  Everyone knows my history on this issue. Everyone knows where I \nstand. It is the same place I have always stood. For 20 years I have \nworked on Iran's nuclear issues, starting when I was a junior Member of \nthe House, pressing for sanctions to prevent Iran from building the \nBushehr nuclear powerplant and to halt IAEA support for Iranian mining \nand enrichment programs. For a decade I was told that my concern had no \nbasis, that Iran would never be able to bring the Bushehr plant on \nline, and that Iran's activities were not a concern.\n  Well, history has shown those assessments about Iran's abilities and \nintentions were simply wrong. The fact is Iran's nuclear aspirations \nhave been a long and deliberate process. They did not materialize \novernight, and they will not end simply with a good word and a \nhandshake. We need verification.\n  If Iran's nuclear weapons capability is frozen rather than largely \ndismantled, they will remain at the threshold of becoming a declared \nnuclear State should they choose to start again, because nothing will \nhave changed if nothing is dismantled.\n  Make no mistake. Iran views developing a nuclear capability as \nfundamental to its existence. It has seen the development of nuclear \nweapons as part of a regional hegemonic strategy to make Tehran the \ncenter of power throughout the region. That is why our allies and \npartners in the region--not just Israelis, but the Emiratis and the \nSaudis--are so skeptical and so concerned about having a leak-proof \ndeal. Quite simply, our allies and partners do not trust Iranian \nleaders, nor do they believe that Iran has any intention of verifiably \nending its nuclear weapons program.\n  So while I welcome diplomatic efforts as what we have worked toward \nand I share the hope that the administration can achieve a final \ncomprehensive agreement that eliminates this threat to global peace and \nsecurity, for the U.S. Congress to support the relief that Iran is \nlooking for, we will need a deal that doesn't just freeze Iran's \nnuclear weapons program, but a deal--demonstrated through verifiable \naction by Iran over years--that in fact turns back the clock and makes \nthe world a safer place.\n  Let me say the fact is there are those who have created a false \nnarrative over the last 6 months that now seems to be self-\nperpetuating, that anyone who expresses an opinion different than the \ndesire to have a deal--almost a deal at any cost--is a warmonger. For \nthose who now say, Well, if we don't have a deal, then what? I would \nremind them of what the administration has said time and time again: No \ndeal is better than a bad deal. I agree with that sentiment. But I am \nconcerned that there are forces that would accept a deal even if it is \na bad deal. This doesn't serve the interests of the negotiators at the \ntable in Vienna, and it doesn't serve the interests of the American \npeople who want to ensure that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, and \nthat any deal permanently eliminates the possibility that Iran could \ndevelop a nuclear weapon that threatens the international order. One \nmistake is all it takes.\n  At the end of the day, keeping the pressure on Iran to completely \nsatisfy the United Nations and the international community's demands to \nhalt and reverse its illicit nuclear activities is the best way to \navoid war in the first place.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I wish to commend the senior Senator from \nNew Jersey for the powerful remarks he has just given about the threat \nposed both to the United States and to the world of Iran acquiring \nnuclear weapons capabilities. I wish to commend the Senator from New \nJersey for his leadership, along with Senator Mark Kirk, on Iran \nsanctions legislation--legislation that enjoys wide bipartisan \nsupport--and indeed that would have passed into law months ago were it \nnot for the majority leader of this Chamber refusing to allow a vote on \nit. Even to this day, we should vote on Kirk-Menendez, because a \nsubstantial majority of Members of this body and of the House of \nRepresentatives would pass this legislation to make clear what the \nsenior Senator from New Jersey just made clear: that no deal is not \nnearly as bad as a bad deal, which all of us fear we are on the verge \nof entering into in Vienna.\n\n\n                      Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n\n  I rise today to address the misguided foreign policy of the Obama \nadministration, which is wreaking catastrophic consequences across the \nglobe. The Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy has profoundly undermined \nour national security, along with that of our friend and ally, the \nNation of Israel.\n  Just last week the White House coordinator for the Middle East, \nPhillip Gordon, gave an astonishing speech at an international \nconference from Tel Aviv to try yet again to revive the Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process. In his remarks, Mr. Gordon criticized Israel \nfor the failure of the most recent round of attacks, urging yet further \nconcessions to the Palestinians. He asserted that the United States, as \nIsrael's ``greatest defender and closest friend,'' had the obligation \nto ask ``fundamental questions'' about Israel's very viability as a \ndemocratic Jewish State after the breakdown of negotiations.\n  I am not sure about the role Mr. Gordon suggests friends should play, \nbut undermining our allies is not one of them.\n  Mr. Gordon threatened that America would not be able to prevent the \ninternational isolation of Israel--what Secretary of State John Kerry \nshockingly recently referred to as Israel becoming an ``apartheid'' \nstate--if Israel did not return to the table on terms he found \nacceptable.\n  Mr. Gordon warned that the clock is ticking and that Israel should \nnot take for granted the Palestinian Authority's willingness to \nnegotiate. He claimed that the administration's negotiations with Iran \nhad halted that country's nuclear program and made Israel safer.\n  Mr. Gordon's comments are belied by the facts given that, No. 1, this \nconference took place under the direct threat of rocket attack from the \nPalestinian-sanctioned terrorist group Hamas--indeed, delegates \nliterally had to, at one point, scatter for shelter--given that, No. 2, \nthese rockets were fired by the very same terrorist actors who abducted \nand then brutally murdered three Jewish boys 3 weeks ago near Hebron, \nand given that, No. 3, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan announced just days \nlater that it was working closely with Iran in its attacks on Israel, \ndeclaring Hamas's ``connection with Hezbollah and Iran is much stronger \ntoday than what people tend to think.''\n  Given these facts, Mr. Gordon's remarks seem utterly detached from \nreality.\n  Even more disturbing, the speech did not take place in a vacuum but, \nrather, was part of a coordinated messaging effort. It was accompanied \nby an op-ed by President Obama in Ha'aretz, which sponsored the \nconference, repeating Mr. Gordon's main themes. Taken as a whole, these \nstatements demonstrate that the administration's longstanding policy of \npressuring Israel into a peace deal with the Palestinians remains \nunchanged by the harsh reality in which Israel finds herself.\n  In the hopes of demonstrating that there are some in the U.S. \nGovernment who do not share this policy, I would like to offer an \nalternative approach.\n  As Israel's greatest partner and ally, the United States has \nweathered with Israel relentless attacks from terrorist organizations \nlike Hamas and Hezbollah, belligerents from rogue nations like Iran, \nand unremitting hostility from international organizations like the \nUnited Nations.\n  As such, we are veritable brothers in arms--and who better than a \nbrother to tell the truth about you?\n  The truth is that Israel is the one country in the Middle East that \nfully shares America's fundamental values and interests.\n  The truth is that Israel is a vibrant, inclusive democracy that \nrespects the\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\nrights of its citizens--Jewish and Arab alike.\n  The truth is that Israel has for more than six decades wanted nothing \nmore than peace and has repeatedly made significant concessions to \nachieve it.\n  The truth is that Israel can never be isolated on the international \nstage because the United States, with or without the President, will \ncontinue to stand with Israel.\n  And the truth is that for the United States to abandon Israel would \nbe to abandon the very moral principles that have made our Nation \nexceptional.\n  These basic truths should inform any discussion of the current \nconflict taking place between Israel and the Palestinians.\n  We also need to recognize that the circumstances leading to the 2012 \ncease-fire between Hamas and Israel are not the circumstances in which \nwe find ourselves today, and that the terms of that agreement have \nproven inadequate to the current reality. Both Israel and the United \nStates had hoped that the relative calm following the 2012 cease-fire \nwould lead to peace and that the increasing prosperity of the West Bank \nwould lead the Palestinians to renounce war. Sadly, those hopes proved \nillusory. That cease-fire did not change the fact that the Palestinians \nhave remained implacably hostile and, indeed, their government is \nactively indoctrinating yet another generation in vicious genocidal \nhatred toward Israel and the West.\n  That simmering hatred burst into flame last month when three innocent \nteenagers--Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaar, and Eyal Yifrah--were \nkidnapped and murdered by Hamas agents. In a stark reminder of how \nintertwined our nations are, Naftali was a duel Israel-American \ncitizen. This was a vicious attack against innocent Jews, regardless of \ntheir nationality, and Americans as well as Israelis were considered \nlegitimate targets.\n  There is a temptation to refer to the murder of three teenagers as a \nsenseless tragedy that should be handled by law enforcement. But this \nattack was nothing of the sort. It was a terrorist atrocity coldly \nplotted and executed by vicious killers whose only motivation was to \nmurder teenage Jews regardless of their citizenship, and whose larger \nmission is the annihilation first of Israel and then of the United \nStates.\n  It was therefore my privilege last week to file S. 2577, a bill that \nwould direct the Secretary of State to offer a reward of up to $5 \nmillion for the capture or killing of Naftali's killers--and by \nextension those of Gilad and Eyal as well.\n  No one doubts Israel's ability to handle this matter on her own, but \nthe Hamas terrorists need to be perfectly clear that the United States \nunderstands that kidnapping and murdering a U.S. citizen is an attack \non us as well and we will actively support Israel's response to this \natrocity.\n  I am gratified by the support this bill has gotten in the Senate from \nboth sides of the aisle and, in particular, I am gratified that this \nbill is cosponsored by the senior Senator from New Jersey, the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, and I look forward to that \ncommittee's markup of the bill this week and then, hopefully, to its \npassage through both Houses of Congress. There is also a bipartisan \nversion of this bill in the House of Representatives led by \nRepresentative Doug Lamborn of Colorado and Representative Brad Sherman \nof California.\n  Following the discovery of the murdered teens, the Israeli Government \nhas moved decisively against Hamas in a just and appropriate action to \nboth bring the terrorists responsible to justice and to degrade Hamas's \ncapability to launch further attacks.\n  Now is not the moment to suggest that Israel open itself to further \nterrorist attack by, for example, withdrawing from the West Bank.\n  Now is not the moment to urge restraint or to try to broker yet \nanother temporary cease-fire that does not stop the threat of Hamas \nmurdering innocent civilians. Now is the moment to support Israel in \nthe effort to eliminate the intolerable threat of Hamas, and given \nHamas's commitment to terrorist violence, the Israeli response is by \nnecessity military and it must be decisive.\n  This conflict is not of Israel's choice; it is Hamas's choice, and to \nargue that there is some sort of viable diplomatic alternative, as Mr. \nGordon and President Obama did last week, is denying the truth.\n  In addition to the current military offensive, there are a number of \nimportant long-term steps that the Government of Israel has taken to \nreduce the threat of terrorist attacks and so to secure the civilian \npopulation. One is the security barrier in the West Bank initiated by \nPrime Minister Ariel Sharon during the second intifada. Necessitated by \nwaves of Palestinian suicide bombers targeting Israel, this fence was \nimmediately decried as an abuse of the Palestinian people and, indeed, \ndeclared illegal by the International Court of Justice. But since the \nfencing began, attacks have declined by 90 percent--90 percent. No \napology should be required for securing a nation's border and for \nsaving innocent civilian lives.\n  The Israeli missile defense system that protects against short-range \nrockets coming out of Gaza is an equally remarkable success story. In \npartnership with the United States, Israel has conceived, designed, and \nimplemented Iron Dome, which enjoyed a remarkable 87 percent success \nrate during the 2012 operation Pillar of Defense and to all appearances \nis exceeding that performance in this most recent action. Iron Dome has \ndramatically changed Israel's ability to determine the future on its \nown terms, not because the Palestinians have in any way modified their \neagerness to fire rockets at their neighbors in an attempt to murder \ninnocent civilians but, rather, because the Israelis now have a system \ncapable of neutralizing the vast majority of those rockets and \nprotecting the hospitals and schools and homes that the Palestinians \nseek to destroy.\n  President Obama wrote in his Ha'aretz op-ed that ``[w]hile walls and \nmissile defense systems can help protect against some threats, true \nsafety will only come with a comprehensive negotiated settlement.'' But \nthat can only be true when both sides genuinely seek peaceful \ncoexistence, which at this time, sadly, the Palestinians do not. \nProjects like the security barrier and Iron Dome may well be, both \npractically and philosophically, Israel's only real option. That the \nIsrael response to hostility out of the territories has been primarily \ndefensive is an important illustration of their preferred approach to \nthis problem, which is not to attack or destroy but, rather, to protect \nand defend.\n  This posture illustrates the fundamental difference between the \nIsraelis, who have pledged they will stop fighting when the \nPalestinians stop fighting, and the Palestinians who swear they will \nstop fighting only when Israel ceases to exist. As Prime Minister \nNetanyahu recently said: Israel uses missiles to protect its citizens; \nwhereas Hamas uses its citizens to protect its missiles.\n  We must reject any assertion of moral equivalence between the \nPalestinians who seek to attack Israel and the Israelis who are trying \nto defend themselves from terrorist attack.\n  Nowhere was the contrast between these two sides more clear than in \nthe two investigations that are taking place into the murders that \noccurred in Israel in recent weeks. After the bodies of Naftali, Gilad, \nand Eyal were discovered, an Arab teen, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, was \ntragically, savagely murdered by Jewish extremists in a perverted \nattempt at retribution. Prime Minister Netanyahu rightly, quickly, and \nemphatically condemned this act and he called the victim's father \npersonally to offer condolences. Naftali's mother Rachael stated her \nsympathy publicly saying:\n\n       No mother or father [should] go through what we are going \n     through now. We share the pain of the parents of Muhammad Abu \n     Khdeir. . . . Even in the depth of the mourning over our son, \n     it is hard for me to describe how distressed we were over the \n     outrage that happened in Jerusalem--the shedding of innocent \n     blood is against morality, it is against the Torah and \n     Judaism, it is against the basis of our life in this country. \n     The murderers of our children, who ever sent them, who ever \n     helped them and who ever incited toward that murder--will all \n     be brought to justice, but it will be them, and no innocent \n     people, it will be done [by] the government, the police, the \n     justice department and not by vigilantes.\n\n  Contrast Racheal Fraenkel's powerful statement with that of the \nmother of one of the Hamas suspects in Naftali's abduction and murder, \nwho while the boys were still missing and before their executed bodies \nhad been\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\ndiscovered, publicly announced: ``They're throwing the guilt on him by \naccusing him of kidnapping. If he truly did it--I'll be proud of him \nuntil my final day . . . If he did the kidnapping, I'll be proud of \nhim. I raised my children on the knees of the religion, they are \nreligious guys, honest and clean-handed, and their goal is to bring the \nvictory of Islam.''\n  Contrast those two statements. One is serious law enforcement \nresponding to the wrongful murder of a teenager. The other is a society \nthat celebrates, that glorifies, that lionizes vicious criminals who \nkidnap and murder innocent teenagers. Further highlighting the contrast \nis the fact that the murderers of Mohammed Abu Khdeir were apprehended \nin less than a week. The Israeli police moved and moved expeditiously.\n  Almost a month after the abduction of Naftali, Gilad and Eyal, their \nHamas murderers are still at large because they are being protected by \nthose who consider them heroes rather than terrorists. When Mr. Gordon \nasserted in his speech that Israel's ``military control of another \npeople,'' for ``recurring instability,'' and for ``embolden[ing] \nextremists'' were to blame for the regions problems, he ignored the \nfacts that the Palestinian Authority bears the real responsibility for \nthe crisis by including Hamas in their so-called ``unity government,'' \nand then urging the international community to officially sanction this \ndeal with the devil.\n  This should not be surprising as the PA is headed by Mahmoud Abbas, a \nHolocaust denier who was Yasser Arafat's right-hand man for 3 decades. \nEver since Arafat and Abbas were given autonomy to run the Palestinian \nterritories 20 years ago through the Oslo Accords, they have used that \npower to radicalize their population and to harden opposition to the \nvery idea of peaceful existence with the Jewish State of Israel.\n  Palestinian children are bombarded with heavy-handed propaganda \npraising the virtues of suicide bombers and other mass murderers. \nSesame Street-style puppets and cartoon characters are horrifically \nused to encourage children to grow up to become terrorists. Yet \nPresident Obama hails President Abbas as a man who can help broker a \npeace deal. Phillip Gordon called him in his speech last week a \n``reliable partner'' for peace. Holocaust deniers are not reliable \npartners. Leaders who incite hatred and bigotry and the murder of \ninnocent children are not reliable partners.\n  Just 2 months ago I was back in the nation of Israel. I traveled to \nthe north of Israel, to the Ziv hospital, a hospital in the north of \nIsrael that has treated over 1,000 Syrians wounded in the horrific \ncivil war waging in that country. I met with those Israeli physicians \nand nurses as they described how they have given over $8 million in \nfree medical care, uncompensated.\n  One person in particular I spoke with there was a social worker who \ndescribed the shock and trauma of young children. Imagine, you are a \nlittle boy, you are a little girl in Syria. You go to bed in your \nbedroom. A bomb, a missile, a mortar comes through the ceiling and \nexplodes. When you awake, you have been horrifically wounded. You find \nyourself in the nation of Israel in a hospital surrounded by Israeli \ndoctors and nurses.\n  What this social worker told us was that as horrifying as being the \nvictim of terrorism, as horrifying as some of these little boys or \ngirls discovering limbs of their body had been blown off, that \nconsistently the greatest terror of these children was finding \nthemselves in Israel because their entire time they had been told that \nIsrael was the devil. This social worker who is fluent in Arabic would \nspend time talking and reassuring these children and comforting them, \nbecause they were sure horrible things would happen to them.\n  Why were they sure of this? Because they had been taught those lies \nfrom the moment they could learn. One Israeli physician described to me \na comment that a Syrian woman made to her. She said: My entire life the \nArmy that I had been told was there to protect me--now they are trying \nto kill me. My entire life the Army I had been told wanted to kill me--\nnow they are the only people protecting me and my family.\n  We will not see peace between Israel and the Palestinians until the \nPalestinian Government stops incitement, stops systematically training \nits children to hate and to kill. Neither Hamas nor its partner, the \nPalestinian Authority, has displayed any interest in peace. The so-\ncalled Hamas-affiliated technocrats that Abbas has embraced have done \nnothing to curb Hamas's violence, as missiles continue to rain down on \ninnocent civilians in Israel or even to express sympathy for the \nmurdered Jewish teenagers. Even that is a bridge too far given the \nhatred that the Palestinian Government promotes.\n  The incessant campaign of incitement carried but out by the PA lays \nbear the myth that Abbas is in any way a moderate or possesses any real \ndesire for peace with the Jewish state. In his speech, Mr. Gordon \nasserted that ``Israel should not take for granted the opportunity to \nnegotiate peace with President Abbas, who has shown time and again that \nhe is committed to nonviolence and coexistence with Israel.'' How can \nany rational sentient person utter that sentence--that Mr. Abbas has \nshown time and again that he is committed to nonviolence and \ncoexistence with Israel, while he partners with Hamas, a terrorist \norganization that is raining rockets on Israel as we speak, when he is \ndirectly responsible for a pattern of incitement that is training young \nPalestinians in vicious, racial bigotry and hatred, that is celebrating \nmurderers and kidnappers as heroes and martyrs?\n  Anyone who utters a statement like Mr. Gordon uttered is being \nwillfully blind to the facts on the ground. Given that it was Mr. \nAbbas, not Israel, who accepted Hamas into the PA's Government, the \nburden should be on the PA, not Israel, to unequivocally condemn not \nonly Hamas but also their fellow terrorist groups, the Islamic Jihad \nand Abbas' own Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.\n  The PA should not take for granted the limitless patience, not only \nof Israel but also the United States, and, indeed, any responsible \nmembers of the civilized world for the legitimization of these \nterrorist groups.\n  While the PA harbors Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al Aqsa Martyrs \nBrigade or any other terrorist group and supports their vicious \nactivity, it should forfeit its position as a legitimate negotiating \npartner with Israel. It is the height of delusion to suggest that \nIsrael should accommodate the Palestinian Authority with any further \nsecurity concessions until this activity stops.\n\n  While the PA harbors Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al Aqsa Martyrs \nBrigade or any other terrorist groups, and supports their vicious \nactivity, it should forfeit any and all material support from the \ntaxpayers of the United States--not one penny. Only when the PA takes \nsignificant and affirmative steps to stop the incitement, eradicate \nterrorism, and demonstrate its leadership ability to honor their \npledged commitments in the past, including the Oslo Accords, and \naffirms Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state should this aid be \nreconsidered.\n  It must also be recognized that Hamas is not acting alone in the \ncurrent crisis. In an alarming escalation of the rocket attacks out of \nGaza, Hamas militants recently fired an M-302 type rocket an \nunprecedented 70 miles north, some 30 miles north of Tel Aviv, meaning \nthat now 6 million Israelis are vulnerable to the rocket attacks.\n  Israel has intercepted a shipment of these weapons bound for Gaza \nfrom Iran earlier this year. It now appears that some of them have \ngotten through by other means. As Osama Hamdan's celebrating their \nclose collaboration demonstrates, neither Hamas nor Iran is even trying \nto hide the connection. In the face of this blatant hostility from the \nIslamic Republic of Iran, it seems the height of foolishness for the \nUnited States to be participating in nuclear negotiations with Tehran \nat this time. Iran's leaders are actively engaged in inciting and \nsupplying violent terrorists. Indeed, Iran is the chief state sponsor \nof terrorism on the globe today.\n  Our focus should be on thwarting Iran's behavior in Gaza and across \nthe world, not in engaging in diplomatic niceties over Chardonnay in \nVienna. Given Iran's ongoing pattern of arming Hamas with increasingly \nsophisticated weapons, it is simply unacceptable to risk their \nachieving nuclear capability by exploiting the eagerness--the utterly \nunexplainable eagerness--of the Obama administration to get a deal--\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\nany deal--any deal at all it seems--by the July 20, 2014, deadline.\n  We need to recognize that the arbitrary decision to relax sanctions \nand to engage in 6 months of negotiations under the joint plan of \naction last year was a historic mistake. We need to dramatically \nreverse course, and we should immediately reimpose sanctions until Iran \nmakes fundamental concessions by ceasing all uranium enrichment, \nhanding over its stockpiles of enriched uranium, and destroying its \n19,000 centrifuges.\n  The Obama, Clinton, Kerry foreign policy is setting the stage for \nIran to acquire nuclear weapon capability. If Iran acquires that \ncapability, it will pose a grave if not mortal threat to the nation of \nIsrael and to the United States. The strategy of the Obama \nadministration--relaxing sanctions first and then hoping to get some \nconcessions later--is putting the proverbial cart before the horse.\n  You do not negotiate with bullies and tyrants by conceding everything \nat the outset and then hoping for good faith. Instead, we should \nreimpose those sanctions and additionally, as a further condition, we \nshould demand that Iran stop its state sponsorship of terrorist attacks \nagainst our allies. Only then should Iran see a relaxation of \nsanctions.\n  In the coming days, I will be filing legislation which will do \nexactly that: reimpose strong sanctions on Iran immediately, strengthen \nthose sanctions, include an enforcement mechanism to ensure that these \nmeasures are implemented, and call for the dismantling of Iran's \nnuclear program, which should be the only path to relaxing sanctions in \nthe future.\n  This legislation will lay out a clear path that Iran can follow to \nevade the sanctions: Simply behave in good faith and stop its \nrelentless march towards acquiring nuclear weapons capability.\n  The connection between Hamas and Iran is a sobering reminder of a \nlarger context in which the events of the past month have taken place. \nThey are not an isolated local issue that could be managed if only \nIsrael would act with restraint. Both the United States and Israel want \nthe Palestinian people to have a secure and prosperous future free from \nthe corrosive hatred that has so far prevented them from thriving. But \nas has been demonstrated time and time again, the simple truth is that \nconcessions from Israel are not going to alleviate that hatred. The \ntruth is that aid from the United States is not going to alleviate that \nhatred. The truth is that even the establishment of a Palestinian State \nwould not alleviate that hatred while the avowed policy of the \nPalestinian Government is the destruction of Israel.\n  Only when the Palestinians take it upon themselves to embrace their \nneighbors and to eradicate terrorist violence from their society can a \nreal and just peace be possible. Until then, there should be no \nquestion of the firm solidarity of the United States with Israel in the \nmutual defense of our fundamental values and interests. This is nothing \nless than the defense of our very exceptionalism as a nation--that same \nexceptionalism fueled by those God-given rights of life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness to which Israel aspires.\n  Writing in the New York Times last September, Russian President \nVladimir Putin warned that it is ``extremely dangerous to encourage \npeople to see themselves as exceptional.''\n  In a very odd echo of President Putin's sentiment, Secretary Kerry \nsaid just today, in Vienna, that hearing politicians talk about \nAmerican exceptionalism makes him quite uptight because it is ``in-\nyour-face'' and so might offend other nations. Secretary Kerry should \nknow, as President Putin clearly fears, it is indeed discomforting for \nbullies and tyrants such as Hamas and their Iranian sponsors to see \nfree people boldly assert their exceptionalism. Indeed, in modern \nhistory it has been dangerous for totalitarian despots when the \nAmerican people rise and defend our exceptionalism.\n  I would encourage Secretary Kerry to unambiguously explain American \nexceptionalism to his colleagues across the negotiating table. They \nmight benefit from hearing that one of the most exceptional things \nabout America is that we will robustly support our allies when they are \nengaged with the radical terrorist enemy that targets us both.\n  It is not enough, as Mr. Gordon seems to think sufficient, to ``fight \nfor it [Israel] every day in the United Nations.'' We shouldn't just \n``have Israel's back.'' We should be proud to stand beside Israel, to \nmake sure that both Hamas and Iran know that the United States is ready \nto provide whatever moral support or military resupply Israel might \nneed.\n  It is true we might risk a little of the criticism from the \ninternational community that seems to be of such concern to Mr. Gordon \nand to President Obama, but the United Nations should be the least of \nour worries at this point.\n  In any event, threats of Israel finding herself isolated--threats \nsadly emanating, in part, from the administration of this government--\nappear empty, as many of our closest friends, including Canada, Great \nBritain, France, and Germany, have spoken out in the strongest of terms \nsupporting Israel's right to self-defense.\n  I add my voice to theirs and urge President Obama to reconsider the \ncounterproductive policies laid out by Mr. Gordon last week. The White \nHouse should explicitly disavow Mr. Gordon's misguided speech, \nharanguing, and attacking our friend and ally in the nation of Israel.\n  A negotiated settlement is not an absolute prerequisite to Israel's \nsecurity, as the administration has claimed but, rather, establishing \nIsrael's security may be the only way to eventually reach any such \nsettlement. Israel's fight against radical Islamic terrorism and by \nextension the radical Iranian regime that supports it is our fight as \nwell.\n  There is a reason they call Israel the little Satan and America the \ngreat Satan. This menace does not discriminate between Israelis and \nAmericans, and it cannot be placated or appeased even by the deftist \ndiplomacy. It must be diligently defended against and at times, when \nnecessary, it must be directly confronted.\n  This is difficult, dangerous work that Israel's Government and the \nbrave men and women who serve in its Armed Forces are doing right now \nfor the sake of both nations. I hope and I pray for their continuing \nsuccess as America stands, unashamedly, alongside the nation of Israel.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. I rise to describe my concerns with the recent U.S. \nSupreme Court ruling of the Hobby Lobby case and also to describe my \nsupport for the Murray-Udall legislation which I am cosponsoring and \nwhich we will act on later this week.\n  First, just a word about one item in the case that is not my main \nconcern but is worthy of a passing comment; that is, whether a \ncorporation can have religious rights.\n  Of course, individuals can have religious rights. Churches can have \nreligious rights. Religiously affiliated organizations have religious \nrights. That has been recognized often. But do corporations have \nreligious rights?\n  I would argue that the Supreme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby that \nthey do is sort of fundamentally at odds with what notion a corporation \nis. Corporations exist for many reasons, but fundamentally the core of \na corporation is the creation of a fictional entity that is supposed to \nstand apart from the individual owners. That fictional entity has \nrights and responsibilities that are different than the rights and \nresponsibilities of the owners. In fact, we create the corporate forum \nto protect the individual owners. The individual owners, once a \ncorporate forum is created, as you know, are generally protected \nagainst legal liability. A corporation's actions, if they are illegal, \ncan only be held against the corporation and except in very rare \ninstances the individuals who own the corporation are free from the \nliability that might flow from a corporation's acts.\n\n  So the basic question is, if individuals decide to form a corporation \nto distance themselves and to protect themselves from liability for a \ncooperation's acts, how can they also presume to exercise their \nreligious viewpoints--their personal, intimate, religious viewpoints--\nthrough the very form of the corporation? It is allowing the owners to \nhave it both ways--complete protection from legal liability\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\nbut continued ability to exercise their personal and intimate religious \nviewpoints through the corporate forum.\n  I think the notion of corporate religious freedom is almost an \noxymoron. The statute at question in the Supreme Court case, the RFRA \nstatute, refers to the sincerely held religious beliefs of a person.\n  What are the sincerely held religious beliefs of a person of the \ncorporation under the corporate charter that would be granted by the \nStates? In order to determine that, should we inquire in this instance, \nfor example, whether the families of the owners ever use contraception? \nIf in fact they did, would that undermine a claim that they have a \nsincerely held religious belief against contraception?\n  What if it could be shown that the owners invested in stocks in \ncompanies that produced contraception, would that undermine the claim \nthat a corporation has a sincerely held religious belief against \ncontraception? I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think \nthe mere raising of the questions demonstrates again that the notion of \na corporation exercising religious beliefs is highly suspect.\n  But I don't think the Hobby Lobby case was about religious freedom. I \nread the opinion. I practiced law, including constitutional law for 17 \nyears. I have read the opinion. I don't think this is a case about \nreligious freedom.\n  I think the opinion in the Hobby Lobby case is, instead, part of an \nanticontraception movement where the political goal is not just to \nencourage women or families to not use contraception but instead it is \ngeared toward the reduction of social access to contraception for all.\n  This isn't a case about religious freedom. It is a case that is very \nfocused on attempts to reduce access to contraception throughout \nAmerican society.\n  The Court does something in the opinion that is fascinating. There is \na phrase--I am not a poker player, but there is a phrase that if you \nplay a lot of poker, a poker player should watch for their tell. If \nthey reveal by knocking on the table or something that, oh, well, they \nare bluffing now, you watch for the tell. I think the Hobby Lobby \nmajority opinion has a tell that tells us this case is not about \nreligious freedom.\n  In response to a notion raised in the dissent: Well, hold on a \nsecond. If you allow this corporation to deny coverage for \ncontraception because it has a sincerely held religious belief against \ncontraception, there are other religions and other corporations that \nmight have a sincerely held religious belief against transfusion. That \nis a sincere belief of certain religions commonly practiced in America; \nagainst vaccination, that is a sincerely held religious belief in \ncertain religions in America. There are other sincerely held religious \nbeliefs, but the majority in this opinion says: Oh, don't worry. This \nis just about contraception. You don't need to worry that the rationale \nin this case would be used to allow an employer to exclude vaccination \nor to exclude transfusions.\n  If those are religious beliefs every bit as sincere as some who think \ncontraception is bad, why wouldn't this ruling apply to those kinds of \ncoverage?\n  The fact that the Supreme Court took such care in the majority \nopinion to say: Don't worry. It is not going to apply to that, tells me \nthis is not a case about religious freedom. Because if it were a case \nabout religious freedom, a sincerely held religious belief about \ntransfusions or vaccinations would be equally implicated by this case. \nThe Court instead is very clearly telling people: Don't worry. You \ndon't need to worry about this stuff.\n  So it is not about religious freedom. I read this case as a very \ncandid admission that what the case is truly about is contraception \naccess.\n  There is an unfortunate legal movement in this country--that is kind \nof surprising--where the focus is to deny women access to \ncontraception, even though access to contraception has been \nconstitutionally protected in this country since 1967, nearly 50 years.\n  I am stunned. I am reluctant as a lawyer to criticize court opinions. \nLawyers always have different points of view. You always have to give \nsome latitude that the court might decide something in a different way \nthan you think. But I am stunned to see in the rationale expressed by \nthe majority that the Court is joining an ideological, anti-access \nmovement.\n  Contraception access is important to women, it is important to \nfamilies, and it is important to society. For women, contraception is \nimportant not only surrounding the planning of pregnancy but the \nhormones in contraception are often prescribed for all manner of other \nconditions, some related to pregnancy and reproduction and some \nunconnected to pregnancy and reproduction. The access to contraception \nis critically important, and that is why the panel that looked at \nimplementing the Affordable Care Act found that contraception was an \nimportant active goal of prevention. Prevention is good. Contraception \nis part of prevention.\n  Contraception is also costly. So when a company strips that coverage \nfrom employees and says, ``You can just buy it yourself if you want,'' \nlet's be clear. That is not a minor expense, especially in a time where \nwages have been stagnant. It is a significant expense, and the notion \nthat coverage would be stripped away from thousands and thousands of \nemployees is not a minor burden at all, it is a significant burden on \ntheir lives.\n  Contraception is not only important for women, it is important for \nsociety. Contraception and the access to contraception are achieving \nimportant social goals. From 2008 to 2011, in 3 years, the number of \nabortions in the United States fell by 13 percent, and teen pregnancy \nin this Nation has been falling steadily since 1991. Why are both of \nthese things happening? Those who study these laudable trends conclude \nthat access to contraception is one of the main reasons abortion is \nfalling and that teen pregnancy is falling.\n  It would seem those are laudable trends that we would want to \ncontinue and that access to contraception therefore is very important, \nbut the Court instead finds otherwise.\n  I want to conclude and say I don't think this is a case about \nreligious freedom. I think the Court has strangely joined an \nanticontraception ideological crusade. But I want to say a word about \nreligious freedom. It is critically important. I am a lifelong \nCatholic. I served as a missionary with Jesuit missionaries in 1981. I \nam a Virginian, and it was a Virginian, James Madison, who wrote the \ndraft of the Constitution, including the First Amendment, the Bill of \nRights that protects our rights to religious freedom.\n  Gary Wills, the great American historian, said, ``Every wonderful \nidea in the American Constitution was already part of somebody else's \nConstitution or laws.'' Our drafters did a great job of finding the \nbest and putting it in. But there was only one unique provision in the \nAmerican Constitution that wasn't part of any organic law before us and \nthat was freedom of religion. Jefferson wrote it into Virginia law, the \nStatute of Religious Freedom, in 1780. The basic idea was no one can be \npunished or preferred for their choice of worship or for their choice \nnot to worship. That has been a critical component of American life for \na very long time. So religious freedom is incredibly important.\n  There was nothing about the bill we will take up on the floor \ntomorrow that impinges upon religious freedom because, as you know, if \na church or a religiously affiliated institution or an individual or \neven a corporation has as their view that contraception is wrong, they \ncan take to the airways. They can run a newspaper ad. They can go stand \non a street corner. They can encourage anyone they want by explaining \nthe merits of their view and hoping to persuade someone that they are \nright, and they are protected in doing that. They are protected in \ntheir religious liberty to try to encourage people to follow their \npoints of view. But when these entities try to go beyond that, and in \nthis case corporations, and use legal mechanisms not just to encourage \npeople but whether it is lawsuits or personhood amendments or other \nthings that we see popping up in States and here in this body, not just \nto discourage use of contraception but instead to reduce access to \ncontraception for women--even women who do not share their moral point \nof view, who do not share their particular religion--then I view that \nas extremely troubling and actually contrary to the notion of religious \nfreedom that is established in the First Amendment. Advocate your moral \nposition, but don't force it onto people who have a different moral \nviewpoint.\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\n  In conclusion, I support the bill we will debate tomorrow because it \nwill protect the access to contraception. Whether people choose to use \ncontraception or not will be up to them and to their own medical and \ntheir own moral calculation, and that is as it should be in a society \nthat is supposed to protect the rights of all.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, thank you.\n  Before I get into the business I have come to address, let me thank \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia for his remarks. I was a lawyer \nat a time when the previous case on this subject came out of the \nSupreme Court that said something very different. It said if you were a \nNative American and if as a Native American you had a sincerely held \nreligious belief that peyote was actually a part of your religion's \nsacrament, that in pursuing that ritual and that tradition you could \nutilize peyote notwithstanding the laws of the State to the contrary. \nThat was the argument they made. It was protected by the free exercise \nof religion. The Supreme Court said absolutely not. No way. If you are \na Native American, your sincerely held belief that peyote is an \nappropriate part of your religious sacrament is overruled because of \nsociety's interest in enforcing the law generally.\n  Now if you are a corporate CEO, a completely different set of rules \napplies. Remember, in the case of the Native Americans the question was \nwhether that individual could ingest the peyote themselves and they \nwere told no, the interest of the State prevailed. In this case, if you \nare a corporate CEO, you are being told that you are free to exercise a \nright to control what other people do. And in this case the Supreme \nCourt completely reversed itself and said no, the State has to back off \nif you are a corporate CEO telling other people what they have to do. \nBut if you are a Native American seeking to honor your own tradition, \nwell, there the State can butt in and move around.\n  So in addition to the distinctions the Senator so eloquently and \nproperly described, certain of this might have been influential with \nthe Court in the fact that these were corporate CEOs, and there is very \nlittle the corporate CEO can do that the five activists on the \nconservative side of this Court won't encourage them to do and let them \ndo.\n  I will reserve for another day statistics of how this Court has over \nand over again turned itself over to corporate interests and over and \nover again ruled in favor of corporate interests and over and over \nagain reversed precedent to give precedence to corporate interests in \nthis country.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  My original topic of being here before I got into the subject is this \nis my 74th visit to the floor to urge my colleagues that it is truly \ntime to wake up to the threats of climate change.\n  The reports keep rolling in. The latest one for coastal States such \nas ours is a study called ``Risky Business'' that was commissioned by \nformer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who knows something about \ncoastal issues, having been flooded by Sandy, former George W. Bush \nTreasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and former hedge fund manager Tom \nSteyer. This report calculated the economic effects of climate change \nthroughout the United States and it found that along our coast between \n$66 billion and $106 billion worth of existing property--property that \nAmericans own right now--will likely be below sea level by 2050. By \n2100, $238 billion to $507 billion worth of Americans' hard-earned \nproperty will be underwater.\n  Now, everything doesn't happen just as you guess. Sometimes you get \nbad news that there are long odds and you need to be prepared for those \nlong odds. The report found there are 1 in 20 odds that by 2100, the \nend of this century, there would be around $700 billion of \ninfrastructure below sea level and nearly $730 billion more of \ninfrastructure that would be potentially in trouble during high tides. \nSo our landlocked colleagues may laugh this off, but if a similar \nthreat were looming at their State's door, they would, I submit, be \npaying attention. For coastal States such as ours, this is deadly \nserious. The Atlantic coast, including Rhode Island--a coastal State \nnamed the Ocean State, the second most heavily populated State in terms \nof population density in the country--we have a lot of people living \nalong that coastline. Our coast will see the worst of it.\n  Climate change, unfortunately, has become, mostly since Citizens \nUnited for reasons I have elaborated on before, a taboo subject now for \nRepublicans in Congress. So the discussion here of climate change is \nsomewhat one-sided, but Americans who are witnessing climate change's \neffects firsthand in every State around the country know--and if they \ndon't know they are learning--that climate change is a real problem.\n  I have discussed my travels to Florida, to Iowa, to North and South \nCarolina, to Georgia, to New Hampshire, and of the actions these people \nare taking in their home States to stave off the worst effects of their \nchanging oceans and climate. But at the local level folks truly aren't \ndenying climate change. That is something that is unique to Congress \nand the peculiar world we inhabit. They are not denying, they are \npaying attention. And it is not just in coastal States that people are \npaying attention.\n\n  This week I am going to look at Utah. Utah is right here on this \nsection of the map of the southwest corridor of our country. This is a \nmap of temperature trends. Temperature is not complicated. It is not \nsome difficult theory that people have to try to get their minds \naround. We measure it with thermometers. It is pretty straightforward \nstuff.\n  On this chart we see that average temperatures over the last 13 years \ncompared to the long-term average over a century show there has been an \nincrease in temperature across the entire State of Utah. Down here, \nthis region, the average has increased 2 full degrees Fahrenheit. In \nthe southeastern part of the State there are actually spots where the \ntemperature has risen as much as 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  Southern Utah is home to iconic national parks including Zion, Bryce \nCanyon, and Arches National Park. In Utah, park officials aren't \ndenying climate change. Just last week the Park Service released a \nreport called ``Climate Exposure of U.S. National Parks in a New Era of \nChange.'' This report studied dozens of climate variables in 289 \nnational parks. In Bryce, Zion, and Arches, the report shows higher \nyear-round temperatures, hotter summers and warmer winters. Such \nsignificant shifts in temperature can mean less snowpack, worse \nwildfire seasons, and abnormal conditions for the plants and animals \nthat reside in those parks.\n  Utah is getting warmer and it is getting drier. The U.S. Geological \nSurvey shows a significant drop in the size and scope of floods in \nrivers and streams all across the Southwest in this area from 1920 to \n2008, and that of course includes southern Utah.\n  Indeed, here are the symbols for the negative trends, and the biggest \nsymbol for a negative trend in river and stream flooding is this one. \nIf you cannot see the map very clearly, that is southern Utah. Here is \nthe State of Utah right here and there is the location where the \nhighest drying trend in streams is taking place--again, not \ncomplicated. This isn't a theory, this is based on simple rainfall \nmeasurements and simple flooding measurement.\n  If you look at it, you will see another place that is going up a lot. \nWe New Englanders are seeing an increase, although in the Southwest \nthey are seeing a substantial decrease. So when those characters come \ninto our hearings and give testimony saying, oh, you don't have to \nworry about this because there isn't an overall increase in flooding or \nanything, yeah, because they offset each other--but go to Utah and you \nsee a very distinct trend and it is drier. Other factors, such as \npopulation growth and water management policies, play a role, but Lake \nPowell in Utah is about half full right now. Lake Mead, farther down \nthe Colorado River in Nevada, has drained down to just 39 percent of \nits capacity. That is the lowest level Lake Mead has ever been since it \nwas first filled behind the Hoover Dam. Scientists at Colorado State \nUniversity, at Princeton, and at the U.S. Forest Service predict that \nunless we take major action climate change may lead to water shortages \nso\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\nsevere that Lake Powell and Lake Mead dry up completely.\n\n  The drying of the Western United States and of southern Utah means \nless water for drinking, fighting fires, farming, wildlife, and \nrecreation. Salt Lake City gets 80 percent of its water supply from \nsnowpack in the Uinta and Wasatch Mountains. If predictions hold true, \nlocal water managers in Utah will no longer be able to depend on \nhistorical data to predict and manage how much water the mountains will \nyield. Utah will be in a brave new world--a dry new world.\n  The prolonged drought conditions in the Western United States, \ncompared to the last century, make it ripe for forest fires, and indeed \na recent study of western wildfire trends--led by Dr. Philip Dennison \nof the University of Utah--from 1984 to 2011, fires have become larger \nand more frequent. The total area burned by these fires is increasing \nover this time period at roughly 90,000 acres burned per year. That is \nthe rate of increase.\n  The recent National Climate Assessment similarly shows that ``between \n1970 and 2003, warmer and drier conditions increased burned area in \nwestern U.S. mid-elevation conifer forests by 650 percent.'' That \nreport is quite clear about the link between climate change and these \nforest fires in the region, noting that ``climate outweighed other \nfactors in determining burned area in the western U.S.''\n  These changes in temperature and precipitation are putting Utah's \niconic desert sagebrush at risk, according to Peter Alder, an ecologist \nat Utah State University. Sagebrush is grazed by livestock, and it is \nimportant to Utah's ranching industry. Dr. Alder is working with \nfaculty and students from seven area universities to better understand \nthe vulnerability of sagebrush ecosystems to climate change.\n  These Utah scientists are not denying climate change, and neither is, \nfor instance, Utah State University. Utah State has entire new courses \nof study to train the next generation of students to predict and combat \nclimate change. Utah State has its own climate action plan. Utah State \nhas an active climate center, and it is not the only one. The \nUniversity of Utah has an active sustainability center and an army of \nstudents and researchers working on addressing climate change. Each \nyear, the University of Utah publishes an annual report on climate \nchange.\n  Members of Utah's delegation may be pretending climate change is not \nreal, but Utah's universities are not. They are not denying. They are \nacting. Utah's capital city is not denying climate change.\n  There may be a barricade of polluter influence around Congress, but \nmayors all across the country are taking action, including in Utah, as \nwe saw with the unanimous resolution of the Conference of Mayors \nrecently. The United States Conference of Mayors ranked Salt Lake City, \nUT, and its mayor Ralph Becker first place in the Mayors Climate \nProtection Center rankings because of the impressive work being done in \nSalt Lake City. For example, the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building \nwill be the first public safety building in the Nation to achieve a net \nzero rating, which means it generates as much electricity as it uses.\n  Utah also has energy investors who are wide awake, building a growing \nnumber of solar installations. Community Solar has a pilot project in \nSalt Lake that allows homeowner groups to purchase solar energy. It is \nestimated that over its 25-year lifetime, this installation will avoid \n5,500 tons of carbon dioxide pollution.\n  Renewable energy is integral in Utah's energy portfolio moving \nforward. In this chart, we can see this display showing that by 2050, \nUtah will rely mostly on wind, solar, geothermal, and natural gas to \nachieve carbon dioxide emission reductions of 80 percent compared to \n1990 levels. As we can see, the yellow is solar. Solar is projected to \naccount for more than half of this shift.\n  Utah-based businesses, such as EBay, are enhancing renewable energy. \nEBay built a data center in South Jordan, UT, and wanted to make sure \nit used only clean energy to run that facility. To accomplish this, \nEBay worked with GOP State senator Mark Madsen, Rocky Mountain Power--\nthe State's largest electric utility--and a local renewable energy \ngenerator on legislation to make renewable energy available to Utah \nelectricity consumers. None of them were denying climate change. The \nrenewable energy bill was unanimously passed by the Utah State Senate \nand House of Representatives and signed into law by Republican Governor \nGary Herbert. EBay employs 1,500 people in Utah, including its 400-\nmember group in Salt Lake City known as the Green Team, dedicated to \nmaking the company environmentally responsible. They are not denying \nclimate change in Utah. EBay is actually looking to add another data \nfacility and more jobs using that same clean energy framework.\n  The faith community in Utah is taking action as well. Utah Interfaith \nPower and Light is a network of nearly 30 Christian, Jewish, and \nnondenominational congregations, representing thousands of Utahans \nseeking ``to promote earth stewardship, clean energy, and climate \njustice.'' In addition to conducting free energy audits for new-member \nchurches and offering plans to increase energy efficiency in their \nbuildings, Utah Interfaith Power and Light also works to educate its \nmembers about climate change and advocates at the local and State level \nfor moral and responsible climate policy.\n\n  Then, of course, there is the famous Utah ski industry. The operators \nof Utah's great ski resorts have been outspoken about the threat \nclimate change poses to their business. Five of them--Alta Ski Area, \nCanyons Resort, Deer Crest Private Trails, Deer Valley, and Park City \nMountain Resort--signed the BICEP coalition's Climate Declaration in \nsupport of national action on climate change. They are not denying \nclimate change.\n  Indeed, the Park City Foundation in Utah issued a report explaining \nthat as drought and increasing temperatures reduced the snowpack in the \nCascade Range and the Rocky Mountains, the future of skiing and \nsnowboarding in those ranges is at risk. This Utah report predicts a \nlocal temperature increase of 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2075, which \ncould cause a total loss of snowpack in the lower Park City resort \narea. Beyond the loss to the skiing tradition in Park City, this will \nresult in thousands of lost jobs, tens of millions in lost earnings, \nand hundreds of millions in lost economic output, and that is according \nthis Utah report.\n  In Utah as in other States there is a groundswell coming from local \ncommunities asking for action on climate change. There are scientists, \npublic health advocates, business owners and corporate leaders, \noutdoorsmen, faith leaders, State and local officials, and countless \nothers demanding action on climate change and leading the charge.\n  David Folland is a retired pediatrician, and he is the co-leader of \nthe Salt Lake City Citizens Climate Lobby, which recently joined 7 \nother Utahans and 600 volunteers from around the country to come to \nCongress to push us for swift passage of a proper carbon fee. In a Salt \nLake City Tribune op-ed last week, Dr. Folland wrote: ``[p]lacing a fee \non carbon sources and returning the proceeds to households would create \njobs, build the economy, improve public health, and help stabilize the \nclimate.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have Dr. Folland's op-ed \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Outside these walls, climate change is an issue \nRepublicans can actually discuss. Outside these walls, 2012 Republican \nPresidential candidate John Huntsman, who won reelection as Utah's \nRepublican Governor in 2008 with almost 80 percent of the vote--this is \na popular guy in Utah--wrote a New York Times op-ed this year entitled \n``The G.O.P. Can't Ignore Climate Change.'' That is the title of \nGovernor Huntsman's article.\n  He wrote:\n\n       While there is room for some skepticism given the \n     uncertainty about the magnitude of climate change, the fact \n     is that the planet is warming, and failing to deal with this \n     reality will leave us vulnerable--and possibly worse. Hedging \n     against risk is an enduring theme of conservative thought. It \n     is also a concept diverse groups can embrace.\n\n  That is from Utah's former Governor.\n  By the way, when he ran for reelection and won by that near 80-\npercent margin, he was running on a pretty good environmental platform. \nHe was\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\nnot denying. But in Congress there is silence from the Republican \nParty--except those who come and say that climate change is just a big \nold hoax. It would have to be the most complicated hoax in the world, \nwith most of our corporations, the Conference of Catholic Bishops, the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration--NOAA--and innumerable \nother groups involved in it, and it would be pretty impressive to \nactually raise the level of the seas 8 to 10 inches as a part of that \ncomplicated hoax, but I guess that is their notion of why that is \nhappening.\n  Here, other than that hoax argument, there is silence. No Republican \ncomes to the floor to say: You are right. This is a problem. We should \ndo something about it. Let's work together. We may not agree on the \nsolution right now, but let's at least work on it as a serious problem.\n  They won't do that. The Republican Party has taken the position and \nfollowed the direction of the polluters. It is as simple as that. I, \nfor one, believe they will be judged very harshly for that choice \nbecause Americans know better. Utahns know better. More and more people \nacross America see what is happening before them, and they are no \nlonger fooled by the phony campaign of denial.\n  I hope this Congress will listen to the people in our home States and \nthe people across this country and wake up to what has now become a \nclear and present danger. We need to do what the people who elected us \nsent us here to do, which is face reality, make sensible choices, work \ntogether, and solve problems, not stick our heads in the sand and \npretend problems don't exist.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Salt Lake Tribune, July 11, 2014]\n\n   Op-Ed: Carbon Tax Provides Market-Based Solution to Climate Change\n\n                           (By David Folland)\n\n       Imagine receiving a check for $390 each month, deposited \n     directly into your checking account, through no effort of \n     yours except that you had previously voted for visionary \n     members of Congress. Indeed that is what a family of 4 would \n     receive if carbon fee and dividend legislation were to be \n     enacted by the Congress, according to a new study by the \n     highly-respected economic analysis firm REMI (Regional \n     Economic Models, Inc.). The study was commissioned by \n     Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL).\n       Last week I joined 7 other CCL volunteers from Utah in \n     Washington, D.C., to ask our federal elected officials to \n     support such a carbon fee and dividend (F) policy. We were \n     among 600 other volunteers who together visited over 500 \n     members of Congress or their aides. Our visits were all part \n     of actions by the non-partisan, non-profit Citizens Climate \n     Lobby, a rapidly growing organization of committed volunteers \n     who are creating the political will for a stable climate. We \n     are taking democracy into our own hands and not leaving our \n     future to the paid lobbyists and special interest groups.\n       The REMI study modeled the effect of a fee and dividend \n     policy. In this plan, a fee would be charged on the carbon-\n     based fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) at the point they \n     enter the economy (the mine well head, or port of entry) \n     based on the amount of carbon dioxide they produce when \n     burned. The fee would increase by a defined amount yearly for \n     20 years. The revenues would be distributed to households \n     equally.\n       The results after 20 years are striking: 2.8 million jobs \n     would be created; the economy would grow by $1.375 trillion \n     more than the economy with no carbon fee; 227,000 lives would \n     be spared due to reduced air pollution; and carbon dioxide \n     emissions would be reduced by 52 percent.\n       Sound too good to be true? Not really. By returning all \n     revenues to households, consumers would spend their dividend, \n     adding to demand for goods and services. And energy prices \n     actually decrease after the uth year, as less-expensive \n     energy sources come on line. Americans would enjoy better \n     health as coal-fired power plants and other dirty energy \n     sources are phased out and their toxic fumes eliminated.\n       This market-based solution contrasts quite markedly to the \n     EPA regulations proposed by President Obama. The EPA \n     regulations pertain only to coal-fired power plants. By \n     contrast, F's effects would ripple through the entire \n     economy. Also, the elevated cost of electricity from EPA \n     regulations would affect the poorest citizens most severely. \n     By returning the dividend to households, two thirds of people \n     would receive more in their dividend checks than they would \n     pay for the increased cost of energy and goods, and that \n     would include the poorest among us. Also our proposal would \n     not grow government, thus could appeal to both political \n     parties.\n       After a long day of lobbying, Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon \n     Whitehouse addressed the CCL volunteers. He suggested that \n     the tipping point that will lead to action and policy on \n     global warming is probably closer than most people think Many \n     who attended the conference have the same feeling. Our \n     members of Congress and/or their aides listened carefully and \n     responded thoughtfully to our proposal.\n       There is ample reason for our elected federal officials to \n     support carbon fee and dividend legislation whether or not \n     they are concerned about the threats of global warming. \n     Placing a fee on carbon sources and returning the proceeds to \n     households would create jobs, build the economy, improve \n     public health, and help stabilize the climate.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor, and I note the absence after \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Crisis\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yesterday I went to Chicago to a \nresidential neighborhood, and I went into a building and saw a piece of \nAmerican history and an American humanitarian challenge, the likes of \nwhich we have seldom seen. In this building were 70 children. They were \nchildren who just hours and days ago were at the border of the United \nStates in Mexico. They had turned themselves in to the border officials \nand they were being processed. Our law says that within 72 hours they \nneed to be moved from the law enforcement world to the world of \nprotection or at least a secure environment. That is the right thing to \ndo. It was a law passed years ago when President Bush was in the White \nHouse, signed by him, and I believe unanimously passed by at least one \nof the Chambers, so it was not controversial at the time. It was \nthoughtful. It basically said if it is an unaccompanied child at the \nborder, within 72 hours put them in a safe place.\n  This is one of the safe places across America. It is a shelter in the \ncity of Chicago. It is not the only one. It is protected from the \npublic. If someone went by it in a car, they wouldn't even know it was \na shelter with 70 children inside, in a residential neighborhood where \nfor 19 years the shelter has been welcome, because it is clear, \nsecure--no problems.\n  But now we face a challenge because the number of children \nunaccompanied coming into the United States is reaching recordbreaking \nproportions.\n  America, primarily because of location and other circumstances, \nseldom has faced anything like a refugee crisis. We can remember \nefforts by the Haitians or the Cubans, maybe the Vietnamese, the Hmong \npeople, to come to the United States, but our experience pales in \ncomparison to countries such as Jordan. Ten percent of the population \nof Jordan today is refugees who come to that country from all over the \nMiddle East. With Syria collapsed under the weight of war and all of \nthe horrors that it brought, 2.3 million, maybe 3 million left Syria \nfor countries such as Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon. For these \ncountries, refugees are part of their daily lives. For the United \nStates, it is rare. It is rare to see one. It is rare to speak to one.\n  That is why yesterday's experience for me was so important. I had \nheard all of these stories about these children and a lot of \nspeculation about why they are here and what we should do with them, \nand I wanted to see them firsthand.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, of the 70 children, there were some who \nwere newborns, babies being held by their mothers. I have reached a \npoint where it is hard for me to guess anyone's age, particularly young \npeople. It is harder still when they are from countries in Central \nAmerica because they are smaller in stature, many of them malnourished, \nand they are usually a little older than one might think. They look \nyounger. But five women walked into this dining hall carrying their \nbabies, and I don't believe a single one of them was 15 years old. They \nhad brought these babies, many of them on buses, for 8 days to the \nborder of the United States to try to escape. Cases of rape and assault \nhad led to these pregnancies and these babies, and they were trying to \nget away from drug gangs and threats on their lives. And here they \nwere, in this neighborhood in Chicago, in a safe place, with others \njust like them.\n  Then I went among the children--90 percent of them from Central \nAmerica;\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\nsome from Africa, some from China; 90 percent of them from Central \nAmerica--and I would speak to them and hear their stories. For many of \nthem, there was a relative in the United States they were hoping to \nfind so they could finally find a safe place. This situation is a \nterrible humanitarian crisis involving vulnerable children.\n  The United States is about to be tested. We are going to be tested as \na people--our generation--as to how we respond. I hope we pass that \ntest.\n  Remember, our country--the United States--issues a report card every \nyear. The State Department issues a human rights report card on the \nworld. The United States stands in judgment of the world and their \nrecord on human rights, and we take into consideration the way they \ntreat women, how other countries treat children, how they treat \nrefugees, and we grade them. That is a pretty bold position for us to \nstand in judgment of other countries, but we do, hoping we can set a \nstandard they will follow and hoping we can hold them to those \nstandards. Now we are going to be graded. The United States will be \ngraded as to how we respond to this crisis.\n  The President has sent a bill to Congress. He is asking for a \nsubstantial sum of money so we can not only deal with this issue at the \nborder but beyond, in places such as the shelter I visited in Chicago.\n  There is a lot of speculation among Senators and Congressmen about \nhow our laws are going to deal with this current flood of children \ncoming into the United States. We know why they are coming. Many are \nbeing pushed out of their country by drug gangs and violence--girls who \nare threatened with sexual assault if they don't give in to a gang \nleader and then, if they do, killed and left in plastic bags by the \nside of the road. Young boys are drafted into these gangs at the point \nof a gun; they are going to comply or be shot and killed. That is the \nreality, not to mention the horrible poverty which is endemic to these \nthree countries--Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\n  So now we have to decide what we will do. There are several things \nthat are obvious. First, I am glad President Obama and Vice President \nBiden are going to Central America and telling these families: Please, \ndo not send any more children. It is just too dangerous. They don't \nautomatically come into the United States and receive citizenship. If \npeople have heard that, it is wrong.\n  We have told these countries, begged their leaders to help us in \ndiscouraging these children from coming. But in many cases desperate \nparents, desperate families are doing desperate things.\n  I asked yesterday at the shelter: Is it true that some of the teenage \ngirls who arrive here--and they all go through a physical exam--are on \nbirth control pills? They said: Yes. Before they start the journey, \ntheir families will give the girls birth control pills as a protection \nfrom pregnancy because they fear they will be assaulted and raped. I \ncan't imagine--I cannot imagine a family situation so desperate where \nthey would make that decision, but it is happening.\n  I looked too at some of the comments that have been made. There are \npeople who have said we need to flood the border of the United States \nwith National Guard troops. It doesn't make sense because these \nchildren are not trying to sneak past border guards; they are turning \nthemselves in as soon as they cross the border because they have a \nlittle piece of paper with the name of someone in the United States to \ncontact. So more troops and guards on the border won't change those \ndesperate children.\n  One of them I saw from Guatemala with his little sister. She is a \ncute little thing but too shy to say anything to me. He, through a \ntranslator, said a few words, and he carried her on his shoulders \nacross the Rio Grande River. That is what his responsibility was, and \nhe was going to get across that river with his little sister. He did. \nThat is why we need to look at this in human terms as well.\n  Before I came to Congress, I used to be a lawyer in Central Illinois, \nthe small town of Springfield. It is not a big city, I guess, by our \nState's terms, but we are proud of our population--but not a major \ncity. I practiced law there, and I knew what it was like in a small \ntown to practice law. I also knew this: No one in good conscience with \nan ethical bone in their body would put a 6-year-old kid in a courtroom \nand say: Good luck. We never did that. It was inconceivable. If there \nwas a child whose fate was going to be decided in a courtroom, there \nwas a guardian ad litem appointed to represent that child's interests--\nnot the interests of any other party, just that child. There may have \nbeen an attorney appointed in addition to represent that child because \nwe realize they cannot make decisions for themselves.\n  Now we are faced with a suggestion by some that when it comes to \nthese children, within a few days after their arrival in the United \nStates, they will be put in a courtroom. If Members of the U.S. Senate \nand the House of Representatives came to that shelter in Chicago and \nsaw those little children sitting at the table, they would be \nembarrassed by that suggestion. We can't do that. It isn't fair to \nthem, and it doesn't reflect well on our values if it is even \nsuggested. We have to have a process that is fair and one that reflects \nour values in the United States.\n  This is a human tragedy. These children have made it through this \ndeath-defying journey. I can tell my colleagues it broke my heart when \nI heard them tell their stories. A little girl--she was there with her \nlittle brother. She was 12; her little brother was 6. He had Down \nsyndrome, and she brought him from Honduras to the United States. She \nsaid she came by bus and she was on that bus for 6 or 7 days before she \nmade it to the border. Can my colleagues imagine turning a child loose \nto catch a bus ride that would last 6 or 7 days to go to a country in \nthe hopes they might be safer and also take their disabled little \nbrother with her? Every time that little boy would get up and scramble \naround the room, she was right after him. She wasn't going to let him \nout of her sight. That is what her life is and what it has been, and it \nis an indication of the kind of children we are now facing and need to \ndeal with.\n\n  This is not a political issue, although politics are involved. It is \nmuch more. It is humanitarian--testing who we are, what we believe. It \nis a challenge to us to deal with immigration in the 21st century. It \nis a challenge to us as well to make sure that at the end of the day, \nhistory writes this chapter about the American people and says they \nwere good and caring people, compassionate and caring people.\n  Today I received a press release that was put out by a religious \ngroup, the Evangelical Leaders of America. This is not my religion, but \nI respect very much what they had to say. I would like to read what one \nof the ministers said:\n\n       As a former Texan, my heart goes to the border of Texas. As \n     a born-again Christian, the Gospel of Jesus Christ calls me \n     to compassionate action for those who are suffering right now \n     as a result of the immigration crisis, especially the \n     children.\n\n  This was written by Ronnie Floyd, president of the Southern Baptist \nConvention and pastor of the multicampus Cross Church in northwest \nArkansas. His Friday Baptist Press op-ed continues:\n\n       This is an emergency situation that requires the best of \n     each of us in America . . . The gospel of Jesus Christ moves \n     me to call on all of us to demonstrate compassionate action \n     toward the immigrant.\n\n  As I said, he is not a member of my religion, but I respect very much \nthat he would stand up and speak out and remind people that this really \nis a test. Regardless of whether one is a Christian or some other \ndenomination or one has no religion, it is a test of who we are and our \nhuman values.\n  When I read the suggestion that these young children need to be \nplaced in a hearing room or a courtroom within a few days with the \npossibility of someone standing by their side--that is wrong. That is \njust wrong. We can't let that happen.\n  Many years ago we signed a refugee convention saying that when it \ncame to refugees, countries in the world should accept and adopt the \nsame humane standards.\n  Now we are facing our refugee crisis here in the United States. We \nneed to make it clear to these countries that these children are not \ncoming in to be citizens of the United States. That is not in the \ncards. But we never want to be in a position where these children\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\nare returned to dangerous situations, harmed, and it is on our \nconscience, on our watch. That is unacceptable.\n  I want to say one thing in closing. We need to solve this problem, \nbut God forbid that is the end of the conversation. We passed an \nimmigration bill, a comprehensive immigration bill, to clean up this \nbroken immigration system over a year ago on the Senate floor. \nDemocrats and Republicans agreed on it, and we sent it to the House of \nRepresentatives. But for over a year they have refused to even call the \nbill, refused to even debate the bill, refused to even come up with a \nsubstitute to the bill. They are ignoring the broken immigration system \nin America and criticizing this President when the breakdown is \nobvious.\n  The President is ready. He has said over and over he will step aside \nand let them work it out and come up with a congressional answer. But \nthere is no excuse for this. For Congress to refuse to accept its \nresponsibility when it comes to immigration reform is just wrong. I am \nglad the Senate met its responsibility, and now I call on my colleagues \nover in the House to do the same.\n  (Mr. DONNELLY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. President, on June 30, five conservative Justices of the Supreme \nCourt held that certain for-profit corporations--closely held \ncorporations--could refuse to provide their female employees with \ncoverage for health care benefits that are guaranteed by law. This \nHobby Lobby decision, some estimates suggest, would apply to as many as \n90 percent of American businesses, depending on what the courts define \nas a ``closely held'' corporation.\n  This was an activist decision by an activist Supreme Court. Congress \nnever intended for for-profit corporate entities to claim religious \nbeliefs or to use religious objections to deny their employees rights \nguaranteed by law.\n  For-profit corporations, for the record, are not people, and they are \nnot created for a religious or charitable purpose. They are created to \nmake a profit while giving their owners protections from liability \nunder the law. I have been to a lot of churches. I have yet to see a \ncorporation in a pew in a church.\n  Moreover, previous cases ruled on by the Supreme Court have \nestablished a tradition of privacy--one that permits women, not the \ngovernment or their employers, to make their own decisions about birth \ncontrol and family planning.\n  The ruling in Hobby Lobby violates that tradition by empowering for-\nprofit corporations to claim religious objections to a law that \nguarantees access to cost-free contraceptive coverage. As a result of \nthis decision, women across America are at risk of losing access to \nelements of their health care coverage, including coverage for \nprescription birth control pills and more.\n  Birth control is an important part of a woman's health care, and \nmillions--99 percent of child-bearing-age women--rely on these \nbenefits.\n  The Affordable Care Act and its regulations provide for insurance \ncoverage for birth control, allowing for a woman, her family, and her \ndoctor to decide what is best. As a result, about 30 million women have \ngained access to cost-free insurance coverage for contraceptive \nservices, including 1.1 million in my State of Illinois--almost 10 \npercent of the population.\n  This is coverage that nearly all women use. In 2013 the Centers for \nDisease Control reported that 99 percent of sexually active women \nbetween the ages of 15 and 44 have used birth control at some point in \ntheir lives.\n  So here is the bottom line: No for-profit corporate entity should be \nallowed to discriminate against women and take away an insurance \nbenefit that a woman is entitled to just because the owner of the \ncompany does not agree with it. A woman's personal health choices are \nnone of her boss's business.\n  Last week my colleagues and I introduced legislation that would \nensure that women affected by this decision can continue to get \ncontraceptive coverage they need and that the law provides regardless \nof who signs their paycheck.\n  Importantly, this bill being offered by Senators Patty Murray and \nMark Udall prevents any corporation from using the Supreme Court \ndecision to deny women access to services guaranteed to them under \nFederal law.\n  Although the Supreme Court ruling focused primarily on contraceptive \ncoverage, it left the door open for future litigation challenging other \nbasic health care benefits--vaccines, blood transfusions. This is \nunacceptable, and the legislation before us would stop this \ndiscrimination once and for all.\n  This legislation is not about overriding the religious beliefs of any \nliving person or any nonprofit charity. Our legislation respects and \naccommodates the beliefs of individuals and nonprofits. Remember, the \nHobby Lobby case involved for-profit companies which are not human \nbeings but are legal entities that are incorporated for a profit-making \npurpose.\n\n  When people decide to incorporate a for-profit entity, they agree \nthat the entity will be subject to basic laws that protect the rights \nof their employees, including laws that prevent discrimination and laws \nthat enable women who work for them to access adequate health care.\n  The decision of the activist Hobby Lobby majority suddenly allows \nthese for-profit corporations to declare themselves exempt from these \nbasic laws and discriminate against women's health care coverage. That \nis a significant change in the law and, as a result, untold thousands \nof American women will end up losing access to affordable health care \nthat they had been guaranteed.\n  This is a problem, and it is a challenge. We need to protect women's \naccess to affordable prescription contraception and prevent corporate \nentities--for-profit corporations--from interfering with their \nemployees' health care decisions.\n  This week in the Senate my colleagues and I will have a chance to \nvote on it. I think it is a critical vote. I might add another element \nhere. Many people want to discuss the issue of birth control in the \ncontext of abortion, a hot-button issue, and it has been for years \nacross America. The record is pretty clear. If there are more unplanned \npregnancies, there are more likely more abortions. Reducing the number \nof unplanned pregnancies reduces the number of abortions. It is simple \nmath. There are some who disagree on theological grounds. They cannot \ndisagree on biological grounds. So standing up for family planning and \nbirth control to avoid unplanned and unwanted pregnancies is going to \nreduce the incidence of abortion in this country--something I hope all \nof us feel would be a positive development. I certainly do.\n  So I hope we can stand together this week on a bipartisan basis and \ntell the Supreme Court they are wrong and pass this new law that takes \naway the power of bosses to determine the health care of the women who \nwork for them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do. I am sorry; I did not see my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am honored to follow those eloquent and powerful remarks by my \nfriend and colleague from Illinois, and I am particularly impressed and \nmoved by his comments on young people coming across the border that \ndeserve better from this Nation--better in the care they receive when \nthey are here, better in the due process and the justice this country \ngives them once they have arrived. But I am here to talk about the \nHobby Lobby decision by the Supreme Court and to second in every single \nrespect the remarks that Senator Durbin has just made.\n  I went to the site of a new Hobby Lobby store in the State of \nConnecticut, being built in Manchester--the second in Connecticut--\nwhere its goods and services will be available to consumers in \nConnecticut. It is an impressive new structure. But it was not a \ngroundbreaking or ribbon cutting. I went there to call on Hobby Lobby \nto do right for its employees and for its customers in the State of \nConnecticut.\n  I went there to make public a letter that I have written to the chief \nexecutive of Hobby Lobby, asking that he and his company respect the \nlaw, history, and policy of our State and also of the United States.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has made its decision interpreting the \nReligious\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\nFreedom Restoration Act in giving this corporation--a for-profit \nentity--the right to tell its women employees that they have no access \nto certain kinds of contraceptive care approved by the FDA. That is a \nlegal decision that cannot be overturned by my speaking on the floor of \nthe Senate or in my writing to the CEO of Hobby Lobby. But it can be \noverturned by a law that changes that opinion--changes the opinion, in \neffect, by overruling it.\n  That is the purpose of the Not My Boss's Business Act, as well as the \nProtect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act, and that is the \nreason I am going to vote for it because I feel that women should be \nmaking these decisions with their doctors, and that neither politicians \nnor business executives nor their corporate entities should be \ninterfering and intruding in that decision.\n  We can debate whether corporations ought to have these rights under \nthe law, whether they are entitled to use the law, in effect, to assert \nlegal claims, whether to the First Amendment or to the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act. This decision was a statutory one. We can \ndisagree with it all we want. But the way to overturn it is to legally \nadopt a new statute here.\n\n  That is why I am so strongly supporting this change in the law that I \nhope will be adopted on a bipartisan basis, because there ought to be \nnothing partisan about women's health care, about preventing \nunnecessary abortion, as Senator Durbin has said so well, and about \nproviding a form of health care that really is in the interests of \nfamilies as well as women. It is in all of our interests.\n  I called on Hobby Lobby to put aside the technical distinctions that \nit can assert and the legal principles that it may invoke because it is \na self-funded plan under the law, but simply do the right thing and \nfollow Connecticut's law, policy, and history.\n  Connecticut has a law. It is a State statute that was adopted in \n1999. I vigorously advocated for it. It requires that contraceptive \ncare be covered by insurance plans--any contraceptive method approved \nby the FDA. That is the law of Connecticut--well established, long \naccepted, and strongly supported, and Hobby Lobby is flouting it. Maybe \nin letter it has a leg to stand on, but in spirit it is thumbing its \nnose at the people of the State of Connecticut. My message to Hobby \nLobby is, if you want Connecticut customers, respect Connecticut's law.\n  Now, this principle of privacy--of women following their conscience \nand their conviction, making these decisions on their own, one way or \nthe other, to use contraceptives or not, after consulting with their \ndoctor or other medical experts and their family, their clergy, \npersonal advisors--this principle of personal privacy is enshrined not \nonly in Connecticut law but in our history. In fact, Connecticut has \nled the Nation in asserting and respecting the right of privacy. \nGriswold v. Connecticut, which struck down a prohibition on the sale of \ncontraceptives, arose in Connecticut, argued by a great renowned \nConnecticut lawyer Catherine Roraback.\n  The right of privacy, as one of our Supreme Court Justices said, is \nessentially and fundamentally the right to be let alone. It is the \nright to be let alone from unwarranted government interference and \nintrusion. This interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nby the Supreme Court contravenes that basic principle embodied and \nenshrined in Connecticut history as well as law.\n  I call on Hobby Lobby to respect that law and our policy of \nrespecting that right of privacy that is embedded and respected in the \nway that law enforcement as well as our statutes and our courts \ninterpret their role in Connecticut, and their authorities and their \npowers. The fundamental principle here is that religious liberty should \nbe respected.\n  It is the religious liberty of those executives at Hobby Lobby, its \nowners and private corporation shareholders, for-profit entity owners. \nThey deserve respect for their religious liberty. But religious liberty \nis about the right to practice your religion; it is not the right to \nimpose your religion on someone else. This country was founded on that \nfundamental principle of religious liberty and the right of privacy, \nthe right to be let alone from unnecessary and unwarranted \ninterference. It is the right of privacy and religious liberty that is \nat stake here in this activist, erroneous Supreme Court decision, which \nwe have the power to overturn here, and to restore religious freedom, \ntruly restore the liberty of conscience and conviction that is so \nfundamental to American life and American exceptionalism.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dress for Success \nLexington and its Kentucky co-founders, Analisa Wagoner and Jennifer \nMonarch. It was my distinct pleasure to help these women secure \n501(c)(3) nonprofit status from the IRS for their business, and I am \nhonored to know that I have played a role, albeit a minor one, in all \nthe good that will continue to come of Wagoner and Monarch's venture.\n  Dress for Success was founded in New York City in 1997. Since then \nthe organization had expanded into 128 cities around the world, \nincluding locations in Louisville and Lexington, KY.\n  As its name suggests, Dress for Success provides gently used, \nprofessional clothes to disadvantaged women. This is not, however, the \ntotality of the organization's services. Looking the part is indeed a \npiece of the equation, but to ensure success they also provide \ncounseling and training as their clients navigate the jobs market and \nbegin work.\n  Jennifer and Analisa opened the doors to Dress for Success Lexington \nover a year ago. In the intervening time, they were inundated with \nenough clothing donations to render their initial location inoperable. \nTheirs is a business model that does not work unless people are willing \nto give. Fortunately, helping others in need is second nature for the \npeople of Lexington, KY.\n  Last September, Dress for Success Lexington moved into a newer, much \nlarger location in the Eastland Shopping Center. And with its newly \nacquired non-profit status, which makes the organization eligible for \ncertain grants, donations, and a tax-exempt status, the future looks \ndecidedly bright for Dress for Success Lexington.\n  Dress for Success Lexington is a model for serving the community. \nThey are not just helping people--more importantly they are providing \nthe tools and training for women to help themselves, and in turn do the \nsame for others.\n  Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in paying tribute \nto these exemplary citizens and Dress for Success Lexington.\n  Mr. President, the Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an \narticle profiling Analisa Wagoner and Jennifer Monarch, and their work \nwith Dress for Success Lexington. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Aug. 21, 2013]\n\n  Dress for Success Lexington Has Found a Home, Plans To Open in Late \n                               September\n\n                           (By Merlene Davis)\n\n       I wrote about Analisa Wagoner and Jennifer Monarch in April \n     as they were being overrun by mounds of gently worn clothing.\n       They had run out of room for the generous donations from \n     Lexington women who were more than willing to help their less \n     fortunate sisters get on their feet.\n       A bit overwhelmed but definitely not discouraged, Wagoner \n     and Monarch had been approved to start a local affiliate of \n     the\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\n     international Dress for Success program which provides \n     professional attire, a support network and career development \n     tools to help women become economically independent.\n       Now I am writing about them because they have secured a \n     permanent home for Dress for Success Lexington in the \n     Eastland Shopping Center. It will open in late September. The \n     non-profit will be the second such program in Kentucky. \n     Louisville's affiliate was established in 2000.\n       Wagoner said the new location is getting spruced up and \n     painted, the furnace is being replaced and a dressing room is \n     being added.\n       ``We are still in that process,'' she said. ``In the ideal, \n     fingers-crossed time line, we may get the keys by the end of \n     the week.''\n       That will be followed by the addition of furniture and \n     clothing racks.\n       Meanwhile, the women have scheduled the first of many \n     mandatory orientation and training sessions for volunteers. \n     People are needed in administration, inventory, fundraising, \n     outreach, and technical and graphic areas. Soon, there will \n     be a need for volunteers in the career center to conduct mock \n     interviews, offer job search tips and edit resumes and cover \n     letters. The training session will be held at the Central \n     Library downtown.\n       ``That is where we held our start-up meeting in May,'' \n     Wagoner said. ``We have come so far since then. We've come \n     full circle.''\n       The sessions are geared to get everyone on the same page, \n     she said. A video provided by the worldwide organization will \n     be shown, featuring Joi Gordon, chief executive officer, who \n     will talk about the program.\n       Those in attendance will be able to select their preferred \n     area in which to help.\n       The Eastland site has more than 2,000 square feet of space \n     and was the ``last missing piece of the puzzle,'' Monarch \n     said. It will be enough space for organized racks of \n     professional clothing, two dressing rooms, an area with \n     computers, and office space.\n       ``With the space, we have everything we need to start \n     helping women, which is our No. 1 and only goal,'' she said.\n       Clients are helped through referral only, Wagoner said, and \n     after completing a job training program through a government \n     or social services agency.\n       The client then works with a volunteer personal shopper who \n     helps her select appropriate attire and also provides support \n     and encouragement as she prepares for job interviews.\n       After landing a job, the client can then return for more \n     clothing and support.\n       On Sept. 19, referral agencies will be invited to an open \n     house to learn about the program's mission. But that's not \n     all the events being planned. On Oct. 1, Mayor Jim Gray will \n     be on hand for the official opening.\n       And on Oct. 17, local designers, who have been given \n     outfits that aren't suited for the workplace, will show off \n     their skills in a Recycle the Runway fundraiser and fashion \n     show at The Grand Reserve on Manchester Street.\n       Wagoner and Monarch are determined to see this program \n     flourish. Considering where they started and where they are \n     now, I wouldn't advise anyone to stand in their way.\n       It will be better for us to just get onboard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4497-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING GEORGE CARNES, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to report some sad news to my Senate colleagues. On June 29, \n2014, Mr. George Carnes Jr. of Walker, KY, passed away at the age of \n87.\n  George was born on November 3, 1926, to George and Mossie Bargo \nCarnes. In the aftermath of the Second World War, he served his country \nas a part of the U.S. Army's German occupation force.\n  Upon returning from Germany, George married Lena Shelton on a summer \nday in 1953. Family was paramount in George's life, and the two were \nhappily married for 52 years until Lena's passing. Together they had, \nand are survived by, three children Alene Foley, Sandra Howard, and \nGeorge Carnes III.\n  I am fortunate to know well one of his four grandchildren, Andrew \nHoward, who is on my staff, and to see firsthand the product of \nGeorge's influence. George loved most of all spending time with his \nfamily, whether it was discussing the latest Kentucky basketball and \nCincinnati Reds news, passing down his farming techniques, or simply \nplaying with his two great-grandchildren.\n  George was also a man of great faith. As an ordained Baptist \nminister, he was a member of the Salt Gum Baptist Church and former \npastor of the Moore's Creek Baptist Church.\n  George was an exemplary citizen who served his country honorably, was \ndevoted to his church and community, and loved his family.

Today, we mourn the loss of a Southern Illinois legend, \nCongressman Ken Gray. Kenny had many roles in his lifetime. He was a \nlicensed auctioneer, a pilot, and a magician. But he made his greatest \nmark serving the people of Southern Illinois in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives for nearly a quarter of a century.\n  Kenny was a World War II veteran who served with the Army and Air \nForce in North Africa, Italy, Southern France and Central Europe. After \nthe war he operated an air service in Benton, IL.\n  He was elected to Congress in 1954 at the age of 30 and went on to \nserve 10 consecutive terms. When he first went to Washington, Southern \nIllinois was an impoverished, rural area. Congressman Gray took great \npride in the regional improvements he helped steer to his region. His \nwork made a real difference in the daily lives of Southern Illinoisans.\n  His constituents loved him and the House entrusted him with \nincreasing responsibilities. Speakers of the House Sam Rayburn and Tip \nO'Neil regularly called on him to preside over the chamber.\n  You could never forget Kenny Gray. With his rainbow of sport coats \nand personal helicopter, Kenny was a legend. He even had a pink \nCadillac. His repertoire of jokes borrowed heavily from Red Skelton and \nhometown stories from Little Egypt.\n  Among his notable achievements in Congress: Ken helped write the 1956 \nFederal-Aid Highway Act, which created America's interstate highway \nsystem. Kenny kept the pen that President Dwight D. Eisenhower used to \nsign the historic legislation.\n  With president Deltye Morris, Kenny Gray helped to put Southern \nIllinois University Carbondale on the map as a leading university in \nAmerica.\n  Today the section of Interstate 57 between milepost 0, at the \nIllinois State line, to milepost 106, at the Marion/Jefferson County \nline, is known as Ken Gray Expressway in honor of his role in the \ncreation of America's highway system.\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\n  You can also see Kenny Gray's legacy in Rend Lake, which was created \nby the Army Corps of Engineers and supplies 15 million gallons of water \nper day to 300,000 people in more than 60 Southern Illinois \ncommunities. Rend Lake has saved more than $100 million worth of \nproperty downstream during flood years and it would not exist without \nKenny Gray's leadership.\n  Congressman Gray stepped away from Congress in 1974. My mentor Paul \nSimon succeeded him in Congress. When Paul ran for the Senate in 1984, \nKenny Gray returned to Congress to serve two more terms. In 1988, Kenny \nleft Congress for the last time to come home after developing a \nmuscular disorder caused by a tick bite on a congressional visit to \nBrazil.\n  Ken Gray passed away just days after we lost another Illinois \npolitical giant with whom he served in Congress, Senator Alan Dixon.\n  Alan Dixon once said of Kenny Gray, ``A true political legend, Gray \nnever was defeated. He just quit.''\n  Congressman Gray remained a voice in the community after leaving \nCongress. We will miss that voice, but we won't forget his \nachievements.\n  I want to express my condolences to Kenny's family, especially his \nwife Margaret ``Toedy'' Holley-Gray, his daughters: Diann, Becky and \nCandy, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4498-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a troubling \nanniversary--that of the 40th year of the division of the island of \nCyprus.\n  U.N. peacekeepers first came to Cyprus in 1964 due to intercommunal \nfighting.\n  Since 1974, Cyprus has been divided into the government-controlled \ntwo-thirds of the island and the remaining one-third of the island \nwhich is administered by Turkish Cypriots and occupied by Turkish \nmilitary forces. The Republic of Cyprus, which joined the European \nUnion in 2004, continues to be the only internationally recognized \ngovernment on the island.\n  Tragically, Cyprus has been divided now for four decades, with a U.N. \nbuffer zone separating the entire island--the so-called green line. \nViolence today is rare, but the long-term impacts of the separation are \nstark--displaced people, memories of family members killed in earlier \nviolence, and lost property rights. Quite simply, a people who share a \ncommon island have been unnecessarily divided for far too long.\n  Over the last decade there have been signs of hope that the island \nwould be reunified and the Turkish occupation brought to an end. In \n2009, for example, I visited Cyprus and met with then Cypriot President \nDemetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. \nChristofias and Talat, at considerable political risk, had undertaken \nnegotiations that showed real promise--talks that I and the \ninternational community hoped would succeed. Unfortunately, they did \nnot, and several years have passed without a resolution.\n  Meanwhile, the situation in Cyprus has left an island and a region \ndivided. People have died. Families have been separated. An entire \ncoastal area, Varosha, remains an occupied ghost town. There has been a \ngreat deal of pain inflicted on the people of this island.\n  While I am saddened by this 40th anniversary, I am also encouraged \nthat a new group of leaders in Cyprus has undertaken talks that show \nsome promise. After Vice President Joe Biden visited Cyprus in May, \nCypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis \nEroglu agreed to meet at least twice a month and undertake confidence \nbuilding measures aimed at easing the many years of mistrust between \nthe two sides.\n  I hope the leaders of Turkey will also step forward and bring an end \nto the military occupation of a third of the island. Such military \nseizure of territory has no place in today's modern Europe.\n  While this is a Cypriot-led process and negotiation, I wish to \nexpress my strong hope and support for the current negotiations to \nbring peaceful and enduring settlement to the island.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the \nsituation in Cyprus. Forty years ago this week, military forces from \nTurkey invaded Cyprus, eventually taking control of 38 percent of the \nisland. Cyprus has remained divided ever since. As we observe this \nsolemn occasion, I call on all parties to find a peaceful negotiated \nsettlement in Cyprus.\n  Cyprus is an important partner to the United States, and I appreciate \nthe recent attention given to Cyprus reunification by the Obama \nadministration. In May 2014, Vice President Biden visited the island \nand met with President Anastasiades and Dr. Eroglu. Vice President \nBiden personally conveyed our country's support for reunification of \nCyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation. However, as Vice President \nBiden said, ``. . . ultimately, the solution cannot come from the \noutside. It cannot come from the United States or anywhere else; it has \nto come from the leaders of the two communities, and from the \ncompelling voices of the civil society leaders . . .''\n  In February 2014, Cypriot leaders issued a joint statement, prompting \nthe formal resumption of unification talks. I was encouraged by this \nstep but have followed this issue long enough to know that negotiators \nface a difficult, though not insurmountable, task. I wish them well in \ntheir negotiations and hope we can soon see progress towards a peaceful \nreunification in Cyprus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4498-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MOUNT CHASE SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 150th \nanniversary of the Town of Mount Chase, ME. Mount Chase was built with \na spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the \ncommunity today, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of \nhard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place \nto live, work, and raise families.\n  While this sesquicentennial marks Mount Chase's incorporation, the \nyear 1864 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For \nthousands of years, the land surrounding Mount Katahdin, Maine's \nhighest peak, was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Penobscot and \nMaliseet tribes. In the 1830s, the first White settlers were drawn by \nthe fertile soil, vast stands of timber, and fast-moving streams, and \nthe young village became a center of the Maine North Woods' lumber \nindustry. The wealth produced by the forests and saw mills was invested \nin schools and churches to create a true community. The incorporated \ntown that followed was named for the prominent mountain peak, Mount \nChase, which towers more than a half-mile above the farms and forests \nbelow.\n  The arrival of the railroads in the aftermath of the Civil War \nfurther secured Mount Chase's prominence in the lumber industry, and \nthe town was home to the largest cold-storage plant on the line for \nwild game and other perishable food products. By the end of the 19th \ncentury, modern transportation and the region's spectacular scenery and \nabundant wildlife combined to create a new economic opportunity--great \nsporting camps and lodges that drew outdoor enthusiasts from around the \nworld. Today, the people of Mount Chase continue to honor the strong \nland use traditions and love of the outdoors that have helped make such \nplaces as Shin Pond a favorite recreation destination for residents and \nvisitors.\n  In the early 20th century, the history, industry, and beauty of the \nMount Chase region were made immortal by the great Swedish-born artist \nCarl Sprinchorn, who spent many years at Shin Pond. From his paintings \nof the strenuous daily life of lumberjacks to his evocative landscapes, \nthe artist recorded a very special time in Maine history and a place \nthat remains special today.\n  This 150th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years. It is about human accomplishment, an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who for generations have pulled together, cared \nfor one another, and built a community. Thanks to those who came \nbefore, Mount Chase has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are \nthere today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4498-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4498-S4499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HAMTRAMCK FIRE DEPARTMENT BICENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation's first responders are in many \nways our everyday heroes. Always\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\nready when we need them most, they risk their lives to ensure our \nsafety. To do this, they spend long hours away from their families on \ngrueling shifts and make countless other sacrifices. For the last \ncentury, the Hamtramck Fire Department has been a part of this \ndistinguished tradition.\n  The Hamtramck Fire Department was established in its current form in \n1914, but the department's roots run deeper. The Hamtramck Spouters, \nthe first organized firefighting unit in the area, was founded in \nFebruary 1857. From its inception, the department has sought to improve \nwith each passing year, which has led to many advances, including \nupdated technology, lowered response times, and fewer fires through \nprevention efforts. The department has served Hamtramck citizens with \ndistinction, even as tough economic times have made the job harder. \nTheir mission to protect the residents of Hamtramck is as vital today \nas it was 100 years ago.\n  Today, the fire department tackles a heavy load, making more than \n3,100 runs each year. In the process, they have saved countless lives \nand property, often at great personal risk. Their courageous service is \nremarkable, and their reputation within the community is impeccable.\n  The Hamtramck Fire Department also has sought to make an impact in \nthe community outside of the fire hall. From organizing park cleanups, \nto buying uniforms for Hamtramck High School's women's basketball team, \nthe fire department has provided valuable services to the community.\n  Just this year, the fire department won a fireworks display for the \ncity in the national Red, White & You contest. They were chosen from a \ngroup of more than 2,500 entries. Because of their efforts, the city \nhosted its first Fourth of July fireworks display in more than three \ndecades. Announcing the fireworks display, Fire Chief Paul Wilk noted, \n``We are a very diverse city that's fallen on hard times--we need a \nboost like this.''\n  The pride in their city and sense of service the department displayed \nin their application to the Red, White & You contest bears repeating. \nFirefighter John Dropchuck, who has been with the department for 15 \nyears, wrote, ``Cultural diversity and a strong blue collar work ethic \nmake up the backbone of our town. There is no better representation of \nthe pursuit of the `American Dream' than Hamtramck. . . The Hamtramck \nFire Department is entering this contest on behalf of our residents, \nwho we feel deserve this celebration.'' The commitment of Hamtramck's \nfirefighters to going above and beyond for their city and its citizens \nis an example for all of us.\n  On May 3, 2014, the Hamtramck Fire Department celebrated its 100th \nanniversary with the annual St. Florian March and Mass. It was a \nfitting way to mark this historic milestone, giving the community an \nopportunity to offer their thanks. On July 5, the celebrations \ncontinued with an impressive fireworks display, another opportunity to \ncome together in fellowship and thanksgiving.\n  We owe our Nation's firefighters and first responders a huge debt of \ngratitude. Their bravery and willingness to serve provides families \nacross Michigan with a measure of security. I know my colleagues join \nme in congratulating the Hamtramck Fire Department on a century of \nservice and a job well done. They are a wonderful example of public \nservice, and I wish them much success as they continue their mission to \nprotect the public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4499-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4499-S4500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Specialist Francisco J. Briseno-Alvarez\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a true American \nhero, Army SPC Francisco Briseno-Alvarez who died on September 25, 2011 \nserving our Nation in Laghman Province, Afghanistan. Specialist \nBriseno-Alvarez was assigned to Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, \n279th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma \nArmy National Guard.\n  SPC Briseno-Alvarez died of injuries sustained when the vehicle in \nwhich he was riding was attacked with an improvised explosive device in \nLaghman Province while conducting combat operations. He was 27 years \nold.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to those in his family he left \nbehind: his father Javier Briseno, mother Lurdes Alvarez, and siblings \nAdrian and Diana Briseno.\n  Francisco graduated from U.S. Grant High School in Oklahoma City in \n2003. He enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard on September 11, 2010 \nand served as a motor transport operator in the 700th Brigade Support \nBattalion and then with the 1-279th Infantry Regiment.\n  As evident from reading through quotes from friends and family, \nFrancisco touched people's lives in remarkable ways:\n  Brenda Fetzko, a neighbor said, ``I know he loved his mother very \nmuch so'' and was a good man and had a strong connection to his family. \n``He was a very good person and was just getting his life going.''\n  Ruben Gonzalez, a friend said, ``Paco was a very nice man, and I am \nproud to say that he was my friend from high school and after. . . . \nI'm very proud of you Francisco.''\n  Juan Cerano, a cousin said, ``He died doing the right thing. He died \nserving and protecting his country. He was like the brother I never \nhad. There's always going to be a part of him in our hearts.''\n  MG Myles Deering, the Oklahoma Adjutant General said, ``My thoughts \nand prayers are with the Briseno-Alvarez family and those of our \nwounded heroes. SPC Briseno-Alvarez answered the call to serve this \ngreat Nation and help defend it. His loyalty and ultimate sacrifice for \nthe sake of our Country will never be forgotten.''\n  A true warrior, Francisco died while participating in tough and \ndemanding combat operations. This fight took Francisco from us \nprematurely, but make no mistake; it is a fight we will win. We must \ncontinue our unwavering support for the men and women protecting our \nNation and allies.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Francisco's family \nand friends. Francisco lived a life of love for his family and country. \nHe will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness \nof our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero \nwho volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor our protection and freedom.\n\n\n                 Army Specialist Christopher D.

Previously deployed to Iraq in 2007 to 2008 as a motor \nvehicle operator, he departed for Afghanistan in June 2011.\n  The Oklahoma National Guard family is deeply saddened by the loss of \nthese two outstanding citizen-soldiers,'' MG Myles L. Deering, the \nAdjutant General for Oklahoma, said in a news release. ``Their \ncommitment and willingness to serve our nation during a time of war is \nindicative of their tremendous character and courage. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with their families, friends and those that continue to \nserve our country in Afghanistan.''\n  Survivors include his parents Shan and Tammy Gailey of Ochelata, OK, \nhis daughter Allison Marie Gailey of Bartlesville, one brother Beau \nDugan of Merriam, KS, two sisters Angelina Janelle Niko of Bartlesville \nand Kristina Jeanette Gailey of Stillwater, OK, his paternal \ngrandmother Lela Belle Gailey of Marshfield, MO, his maternal \ngrandparents Carl Eugene Maples and his wife Carol of Joplin, MO, one \nuncle Jesse Robert Gailey, four aunts: Barbara Jane Foster, Shawn Dee \nAdams, Manya Alice Maples, and Sonya Jolene Hamblin,\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\nand several nieces, nephews and cousins.\n  ``Keep good memories of him,'' his father Shan Gailey said. ``Keep \nhim in your heart.''\n  Funeral services were held on November 12, 2011 in the Bartlesville \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

He was a great \nhusband who loved us all very much. It makes me sad to know we won't \ngrow old together, but he lived a beautiful life and (he) gave me three \nof the most beautiful things I could ask for,'' his wife Lindsey said.\n  His mother said she looked forward to getting calls from her son \nwhile he was in Afghanistan. ``I learned very quick when a phone call \ncame in at 3 a.m. to jump up and answer it,'' Mitchell said. ``He would \ncall and play his guitar and sing me a song he had written.''\n  On March 6, 2012, Robby was laid to rest in Hillside Cemetery in \nPurcell, OK. Oklahoma Governor, Mary Fallin ordered flags on State \nproperty to fly at half-staff on March 6, 2012 in honor of Robby.\n  Robby is survived by his wife Lindsey McKenna of Purcell, three sons: \nAllen Robert McKenna III, Michael ``Mickey'' McKenna, and Waylon Roan \nMcKenna, and the only girl in the family, his pet cat ``Scat;'' father \nand stepmother, Allen and Pam McKenna of Purcell, grandparents Bill and \nCharlotte McKenna of Alex, Alvie and Cleta Mitchell and Grace Cummins \nof Noble, OK; three brothers and their families, Billy and Jamie \nBingenheimer of Little Axe, OK, Bobby and Charlene Bingenheimer of \nPurcell, OK, and Scotty and Lenette McKenna of Anchorage, AK, one \nsister Jessi McKenna of Purcell, OK, stepfather Lamar Bingenheimer, \nstep-grandparents Frankie and Mary Rinehart of Purcell, OK, father-in-\nlaw,Donnie Jones of Noble, OK, mother-in-law Donya Jones of Norman, OK, \nnumerous cousins, nieces, nephews and a host of other relatives and \nfriends.\n  Today we remember Army SSG Allen R.

Mr. President, I would like to take the time to \nrecognize the loss of Walter Parker. Walter Parker passed away on June \n25, 2014, in Anchorage, AK. Walt Parker was dedicated to our State and \nhe made his mark in many ways.\n  Walter Parker came up to Alaska in 1946 after serving in World War II \nand held vital roles in the development of the State of Alaska. From \noverseeing the construction of the Dalton Highway to being appointed to \nthe Alaska State Pipeline office, Walter Parker helped shape Alaska \ninto what it is today. He was a constant advocate for stronger \ncommunities, higher education, parks and trails, safer transportation \nand better communities. He was a musher, trapper, bush pilot, planner \nand borough assemblyman who never lost his commitment or faith to help \nmake Alaska a great place to live.\n  Throughout his life, Walter Parker approached all parts of his life \nwith excitement, passion, idealism and energy--he was a force to be \nreckoned with. He passed on his knowledge by teaching at the University \nof Alaska and helped our State after the devastation of the Exxon \nValdez oil spill. He served as chairman of the Alaska Oil Spill \nCommission. Later in his life, he held various government positions and \nwas involved in public interest organizations that helped make Alaska \nbetter.\n  The loss of Walter Parker is sad and all who knew him mourns his \nloss. The work Walter Parker did for Alaska will never be forgotten, \nand we are all thankful for his commitment and dedication to the people \nof Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4500-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING FRED BROWN\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to honor and remember long \ntime Alaskan, Mr. Fred Brown. Mr. Brown died in Fairbanks at the Denali \nCenter on Friday, June 27, 2014 at the age of 70.\n  Fred Brown was a former 4-term Fairbanks legislator who was elected \nin 1974 served in the Alaska House of Representatives in the 1970s and \nearly 1980s. He was not only an active member of the community, but a \nman with a passion for contributing to the development of the State of \nAlaska. With a remarkable passion for music and radio, he enriched the \nterritory and State for decades. He was an avid ham radio operator \nknown by the call sign KL7CUS.\n  Outside the legislature, Fred Brown played the flute, piccolo and \ncontra bassoon for 50 years with the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra. He \nwas also an active member at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church where his \nmemory will be honored.\n  Fred Brown cared deeply about his community and was committed to \npublic service. As a legislator, he carried himself and the State \nforward with self-determination and dignity. His wife Helen said her \nhusband had three main passions: ``Politics, music and religion were \nwhat mattered to him, which is a strange combination, but that really \nwas the triumvirate of his life.'' He was a master of parliamentary \nprocedure and scrupulously ran meetings according to Mason's Rules in \nthe interest of fairness to all.\n  While we mourn the loss of his presence, the legacy of this \nremarkable man lives on. He leaves behind many friends who are grateful \nto have known his exceptional character. The people of Alaska will \nalways owe a debt of gratitude to former Alaska legislator Fred Brown.\n  On behalf of his family and his many friends, I ask that we honor \nFred Brown's memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/15/senate-section/article/S4500-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4500-S4501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n   RESPECT TO THE FORMER LIBERIAN REGIME OF CHARLES TAYLOR THAT WAS \n      ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13348 ON JULY 22, 2004--PM 50\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to extend and modify the pilot program of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs on assisted living services for veterans \nwith traumatic brain injury, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleague Senator Dean Heller, legislation that would extend a critical \nand innovative program for our nation's veterans. Senator Heller and I \nurge our colleagues to consider The Assisted Living Program for \nVeterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Extension, AL-TBI, Act which \nauthorizes the continuation of a Veterans Health Administration program \nthat provides intensive care and rehabilitation to veterans with severe \nbrain injuries.\n  Thanks to this program, veterans with traumatic brain injuries more \nquickly re-adjust to their day-to-day lives--from making dinner for \nothers, to fixing a faucet, to doing yard work. AL-TBI consists of \nprivately run group homes around the country where veterans are \nimmersed in therapies for movement, memory, speech, and gradual \ncommunity reintegration. Veterans in these homes benefit from 24-hour \nteam-based care. There are about twenty of these homes in New Jersey \nthat have yielded impressive results. Nationally, several dozen \nveterans have been rehabilitated from severe injuries that are \nnotoriously difficult to treat.\n  This program is working to help a generation of veterans with \ntraumatic brain injuries and so many older veterans that have been \nsuffering for decades. Since 2001, more than 265,000 U.S. troops \nsuffered traumatic brain injuries, according to the Defense and \nVeterans Brain Injury Center. While most were mild concussions, over \n26,000 men and women veterans suffered from moderate or severe head \nwounds. Advances in medicine keep alive soldiers with head wounds that \nmight have killed them in previous conflicts. However, the ability to \ncure these injuries has not kept pace. Innovative, effective programs \nmust be supported by Congress in order to give our veterans the care \nthey need and deserve.\n  But unfortunately, as the program nears the end of its 5-year \nauthorization, veterans across the country are being told that they \nneed to prepare to move out of the facilities in September. I have \nheard from a veteran in New Jersey, who was told he will need to be out \nof the program on September 15 and worries he will be out on the \nstreet. He has made tremendous gains with the AL-TBI program. He has \nrekindled his relationship with his son. He is able to do basic math \nagain. But, he has a lot more to do to get his independence back. We \ncannot leave him and other veterans like him out in the cold.\n  The VA offers no alternative program that replicates the \ncomprehensiveness of the rehabilitative care, the benefit of providing \ncare in a residential setting, and the positive impact on veterans of \nsustained, longer-term care.\n  This is a proven program that does not require new funds, and I urge \nmy colleagues in the Senate to join Senator Heller and myself in \nsupporting this critical piece of legislation for our Nation's \nveterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. \n        Wicker):\n  S. 2611.
