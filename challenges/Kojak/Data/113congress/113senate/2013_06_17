Mr. President, it has been 86 days since the Senate passed \nits budget. We have been through this on several occasions. We have had \nRepublican Senators come and criticize the Republican leadership here \nfor not letting us go to conference. They talked about their wanting \nregular order so we could move forward in dealing with the financial \ncrisis facing this country, but they have ignored us.\n  We are proud of the budget we passed. It was hard, but it reflects \nour priorities: protecting middle-class families and growing the \neconomy. Even though that is the case, we are still willing to work out \na compromise with our Republican counterparts.\n  We are not going to get everything we want. That is what conferences \nare all about. They have been going on in this country for more than \ntwo centuries. But we believe our sound fiscal policy would stand out \nas being so much better than what they have done in the House. We could \ndo this through the regular order of the budget process. Unfortunately, \nDemocrats and Republicans are not going to find common ground if we \nnever start negotiating. As I said, for 86 days Republican leaders have \nobjected to a conference with the House of Representatives. In \nconference, Democrats and Republicans could work together to work out \nour differences--differences between our budgets as well as our \npriorities. But Senate Republicans have objected to a conference time \nand time again.\n  Today, I read in the Hill newspaper called Politico that the House \nRepublicans are more than happy for their Senate colleagues to obstruct \nand delay. They know a budget conference would only put the spotlight \non divisions within the House Republican caucus. Here is what the \narticle said:\n\n       Going to conference to match the House and Senate-passed \n     budgets--or making any movement on the budget right now--\n     could open up a schism in the [Republican] caucus on spending \n     that for months leadership has managed to keep mostly at bay.\n\n  So what they are saying is the Republican leadership over here is \nprotecting the House. The House Republican leadership understands they \ncannot agree on anything--nothing. Therefore, objecting to this is the \nright thing to do because they will never get out in the open as to how \ncrazy their budget priorities are.\n  But as Senate Republicans cover for their dysfunctional House \ncolleagues, the country inches closer to another crisis: a default on \nthe Nation's bills.\n  Reasonable Republicans are just as concerned as I am about this last \nmanufactured crisis--a crisis that would undercut the economic progress \nof the last 4 years. Those reasonable Republicans have come to the \nfloor repeatedly to call on Republican leaders to stop blocking \nbipartisan budget negotiations. I hope those reasonable Republicans \nprevail. I hope Republican leaders in the House and in the Senate will \nstop bowing to tea party extremists and listen to the more reasonable \nMembers of their caucus.\n  I repeat, Republican Senators have arrived here on the floor on more \nthan one occasion and criticized our not being able to go to \nconference. So if past is prologue, using the full faith and credit of \nthe U.S. Government as a political hostage will not only be bad\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nfor the economy, it will also be bad for the Republican Party.\n  It is time Republican leaders acknowledge that compromise--not \nreckless brinkmanship--will put America on the road to fiscal \nresponsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4498-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for 16 years, Blanca Gamez thought she was \nan average American girl. But when she turned 16, one by one her \nfriends learned to drive. Her parents sat her down and explained an \nimportant truth she did not know at the time: She could not get her \ndriver's license because she is an undocumented immigrant.\n  Blanca's parents brought her from Mexico to the United States when \nshe was 7 months old. Because they came without proper paperwork, she \nwas missing something really important. Blanca's parents told her: \n``You need nine numbers.'' That refers to a Social Security number, \nwhich she did not have. A Social Security number--those nine numbers--\nopens doors to American citizens, which American citizens take for \ngranted.\n  I had an opportunity to visit with Blanca when I was in Las Vegas \nrecently. She is a young woman with everything going for her. She is \nsmart, she is driven, and she loves this country with a passion that is \ntruly moving. In fact, she does not remember the country she was born \nin, Mexico. She was 7 months old when she came here. To her home means \nNevada. That is our State song: ``Home Means Nevada.'' And home \ncertainly means Nevada to this young woman.\n  Unfortunately, without a Social Security number--those nine numbers--\nBlanca faced challenges her American-born peers simply did not.\n  But all that changed a year ago this week when President Obama signed \na directive suspending deportation of upstanding young people such as \nBlanca who were brought to this country as children. As a result, she \nnow has her nine numbers.\n  Almost 300,000 DREAMers--undocumented immigrants who came to this \ncountry as children--have already taken advantage of this opportunity.\n  Thanks to President Obama's courageous action, Blanca and hundreds of \nthousands of upstanding young men and women like her can rest easier \nknowing they are no longer in danger of being deported. They can now \ndrive, they can work, and they can get the nine numbers that unlock a \nsuccessful future--I repeat: a Social Security number.\n  Blanca's future--and the future of 800,000 young DREAMers--will \nremain uncertain until Congress passes commonsense immigration reform. \nPresident Obama's directive is only a temporary solution.\n  The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has taken aim \nat the DREAMers, voting recently to resume deportation of promising \nyoung people such as Blanca.\n  The directive does not address the 10 million people living in this \ncountry without the proper documentation who do not qualify for \ndeferred action. Many of these individuals are the parents or siblings \nof DREAMers such as Blanca. The bipartisan legislation before the \nSenate is the opportunity they have been waiting for. This bill offers \na pathway to earned citizenship that begins by going to the back of the \nline, paying penalties and fines, working, paying taxes, staying out of \ntrouble, learning English, getting right with the law.\n  The measure will be good for national security, it will be great for \nthe economy, and it will be good for millions of immigrant families.\n  The bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reform our \nbroken legal immigration system and strengthen border security.\n  I know many of my colleagues have ideas about how to improve this \nbill. I hope we will be able to process additional amendments soon so \nwe can give these ideas the debate they deserve here in the Senate and, \nafter that, of course, the votes they deserve.\n  We have five amendments pending. We could vote on four of them right \naway. I also think it would be fair to add the Heller amendment. That \nwould mean three Republican amendments and two Democratic amendments.\n  My colleagues should be aware, unless we begin voting on amendments \nsoon, we will need to work through the weekend in order to finish the \nbill before July 4.\n  Recognizing that this is a Nation founded by immigrants, I hope \nSenators will consider every amendment to this bill with compassion. \nLike generations before them, Blanca's parents and millions of other \nundocumented immigrants came here seeking a better life. The famous \nauthor C.S. Lewis said:\n\n       You are never too old . . . to dream a new dream.\n\n  It is time for Congress to help 11 million dreamers--young and old--\nget right with the law and unlock their potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4498-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, there are two matters I want to talk about. \nBefore I speak about the immigration, I want to speak about the Supreme \nCourt ruling today in Alleyne v. the United States, that facts \nunderlying mandatory minimum sentences must be proved to a jury beyond \na reasonable doubt.\n  I continue to believe our criminal justice system's reliance on \nmandatory minimum sentences is a mistake.\n  In March, Senator Paul and I introduced the Justice Safety Valve Act \nof 2013, to give Federal judges greater flexibility in sentencing in \ncases where a mandatory minimum is not only unnecessary but often \ncounterproductive.\n  Mandatory minimum sentences imprison some people, particularly \nnonviolent offenders, for far longer than is just or beneficial.\n  Looking at it just from a fiscal point of view, as a result of \nmandatory minimums the Federal prison population has exploded in recent \nyears. This has placed enormous strain on the Justice Department's \nbudget. That means less money for Federal law enforcement, less aid to \nState and local law enforcement, less funding for crime prevention \nprograms that make us safer, plus less money for prisoner reentry \nprograms.\n  Sentencing reform has worked at the State level. The Justice Safety \nValve Act is an important step toward the sentencing reform our Federal \nsystem desperately needs. I applaud the Supreme Court decision today in \nAlleyne.\n  I have long felt that when legislative bodies pass mandatory \nminimums, it is a feel-good response to crime, but it does no good.\n  Judges need discretion. Every case that comes before a judge is \ndifferent. Now, do judges always get it right out of the tens of \nthousands of cases that come before them? No. Of course not. Sometimes \nthey might not, but they are far more often right than wrong. They are \nalways more right than a legislative one-size-fits-all approach. \nMandatory minimum laws are one size fits all. Anybody who has spent \ntime in the criminal justice system either as a defense counsel or as a \nprosecutor or as a judge knows that one size does not fit all. We \nshould get rid of all of our mandatory minimums, have real standards\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\nthat judges will follow, and then let the individual men and woman who \nsit on the bench make the decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4499-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4499-S4501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we continue yet another week debating S. \n744, the bipartisan immigration bill, I hope we can start making some \nprogress on this vital legislation. The American people know what some \nof us have to realize: our immigration system is broken; it has to be \nfixed. If we are going to have an effective solution to this complex \nproblem, we cannot focus simply and effectively on one border or any \nsingle aspect of our immigration system. We have to address all parts \nof our immigration system.\n  Of course, we all agree we have to secure our borders, but we must \nalso reduce the incentives people have to come here illegally or to \noverstay their visas. It means we have to implement E-Verify so \nemployers stop hiring those who are not authorized to work here. We \nalso have to eliminate the extensive backlogs that tear so many \nfamilies apart.\n  We have to respond to the needs of American farmers and technology \ncompanies and investors who create jobs in this country. We also need \nto remember that our history and the future of the Nation is based on \nimmigrants when we are considering the legalization process provided in \nthis bill.\n  Almost 4 weeks ago the Judiciary Committee voted to report this \nimmigration reform bill with a strong bipartisan vote of 13 to 5. I \nunderstand the Congressional Budget Office's task is a difficult one, \nwith complex, comprehensive measures such as this. We expected their \nscore today. I hope they are able to get the official score early \ntomorrow so we can move forward and complete consideration of this \nbill. As we closed out each title during our extended mark ups, we \nforwarded the text to the CBO, so they have had the border security \ntitle and the non-immigrant visa title for well over a month. I look \nforward to reviewing their analysis when we receive it.\n  In addition to the CBO score we are awaiting, we should also credit \nthe extensive testimony the Judiciary Committee received from former \nCBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin. He testified that immigration reform \n``will increase the productivity growth in the U.S. economy, the \nfundamental building block of higher standards of living, and generate \nlarger economic growth numbers than we have seen in recent years.''\n  Specifically, he estimated reform of this nature would increase \ngrowth so that ``the overall growth rate and real GDP would rise from 3 \npercent to 3.9 percent, on average annually, over the first 10 years. \nThe upshot of GDP after 10 years would be higher--a difference of \n$64,700 per capita versus $62,900 per capita. This higher per capita \nincome of $1,700 after 10 years is a core benefit of immigration \nreform.''\n  According to Holtz-Eakin this increase in growth would also help \nlower our deficit. In fact, he testified that ``Over 10 years an \nadditional 0.1 percentage in average economic growth will reduce the \nfederal deficit by a bit over $300 billion. In this context, the rules \nimply that over the first 10 years of the benchmark immigration reform \nthe federal deficit would be reduced by a cumulative amount of $2.7 \ntrillion.''\n  Also, the Judiciary Committee received powerful testimony from Grover \nNorquist. He was asked repeatedly by those who oppose this bill whether \nlegalizing immigrants would lead to a drain on our safety net. His \nresponse was that just the opposite would occur. He testified that \n``immigrants come at the beginning of their working lives, which means \nthey will have years to pay taxes and contribute to the economy before \nbeing eligible for entitlements.'' Furthermore, Mr. Norquist testified \nthat ``Some argue that the fiscal burden of America's entitlement \nprograms make more immigration cost prohibitive. That is a false \nchoice. That our entitlement systems are broken is not an argument for \nless immigration; it is an argument to fix our entitlement systems.''\n  It is not every day that I agree with these very conservative \ncommentators and advocates, but I was happy to invite them to testify \nbefore the committee and commend their analysis to Members who are \nconcerned about the approximate `cost' of reforming our broken \nimmigration system. All the valid testimony--all the valid testimony we \nreceived says that fixing the broken immigration system adds to our \nbottom line in a beneficial way.\n  One of the hallmarks of this country is how we have historically \ntreated those who have sought shelter and refuge on our shores. America \nprotects the most vulnerable among us. This includes survivors of \ndomestic violence and human trafficking, as well as pregnant women and \nchildren. I am proud to report that there are strong protections in \nthis bill for the treatment of children caught in the broken \nimmigration enforcement system.\n  In the Judiciary Committee we added to those protections for domestic \nviolence and human trafficking victims. But the Judiciary Committee \nalso considered and rejected, as it should, several amendments that \nsought to take away protections in our safety net programs for \nimmigrants who need them. I know some may want to punish the 11 million \nundocumented people currently living here in the shadows. The bill \nspecifically contains a steep financial penalty for that purpose. The \nundocumented also need to go to the back of the line and take classes \nto learn English, but even these tough steps are not enough for those \nwho oppose this bipartisan bill.\n  While some may want to look like they are being even tougher on the \nundocumented population, we all need to consider how further punitive \nmeasures may deter people from coming out of the shadows. When children \nand pregnant women are put at risk by an urge to punish millions of \npeople who are trying to make a better life for their families, as \nmy grandparents did, we do not live up to our American values and we do \nnot make this a safer country. Last week, Senator Hatch filed several \namendments to deny or delay protections for the millions of people who \napply for registered provisional immigrant status. I will oppose all of \nthose amendments. They are not fair. They deter people from coming \nforward to register. That makes us all less safe.\n\n  It is a cruel irony when my friends on the other side of the aisle \ntalk about border security, the high cost of implementing their \nproposed measures is always absent from the discussion. But when we are \ntalking about programs that help children who live near the poverty \nline, well, then suddenly fiscal concerns are paramount.\n  So if we are talking about a specific type of fencing, or a new \nexpensive exit program, our concern is supposed to trump any hesitancy \nabout government spending. Spend whatever it takes. Spend whatever it \ntakes, and at the same time dramatically increase the boon that their \nproposals give to the government contracting firms that make money off \nof them.\n  However, if we are talking about programs literally to feed the \nhungry or provide vaccinations to children, vaccinations which make us \nall healthier because of the disease it stops, then we hear lectures as \nto how we cannot afford those programs in the current fiscal \nenvironment. Maybe some of these contractors with their lobbyists ought \nto be covering those programs. Maybe we will hear more need for them.\n  I would say from a moral point of view, as an indication of how great \na country we are, we ought to be saying: Hungry children, children who \ncan be saved from childhood illnesses, it is in our moral core as a \nNation, the most wealthy, powerful Nation on Earth to help them. The \nbill we are considering prohibits immigrants in registered provisional \nimmigrant status from accessing Federal means-tested public benefit \nprograms throughout their time in provisional status.\n  In addition, as a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, even qualified legal permanent \nresident immigrants must wait an additional 5 years after they are \nlegalized to receive any safety net protections. We have already put \nall kinds of barriers up here.\n  So including the 5-year bar, most immigrants who are working their \nway through the path to legalization will have to wait anywhere from 13 \nto 15 years before having any access to safety net programs. Given the \npenalties and the fines they have to pay, it is wrong to further deny \nthese low-income families protection that some may desperately need.\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\n  We have seen amendments that try to designate an immigrant a ``public \ncharge'' and thus deportable simply because the individual's child \nreceived health or nutrition benefits. If a child is an American \ncitizen, would we really want that child's parents deported simply \nbecause the child needed food stamps while the parent was in \nprovisional status?\n  We should protect the children of immigrants and their families. In \n2009, President Obama signed the Children's Health Insurance \nReauthorization Act (CHIPRA). Under Senator Rockefeller's strong \nleadership, CHIPRA included a provision which allowed states the option \nto waive the five-year bar to the Children's Health Insurance Program \n(CHIP) and Medicaid for lawfully residing immigrant children and \npregnant women. Today, 25 states offer this safety net for children and \n20 states offer it to pregnant women. My own state of Vermont offers \nthis protection to both pregnant women and children. I commend my \nfriend, Chairman Rockefeller, for allowing states the option to \nimmediately provide CHIP and Medicaid for immigrant children and \npregnant women.\n  Like so many harsh amendments that have been filed with respect to \nthe safety net, I have seen similarly harmful amendments on the issue \nof the earned income tax credit, the EITC, or the child tax credit, \nCTC, which were designed to help hard-working families pay their taxes.\n  The earned income tax credit is available only to families who are \nworking and paying payroll taxes, not some kind of giveaway. They have \nto be working and paying taxes. EITC is a core part of the Tax Code \nlike any other tax credit that adjusts Federal tax liability, based on \nfamily circumstances. It is not, and it has never been, considered a \n``public benefit.'' But some amendments have been filed seeking to deny \nthe EITC for all registered immigrants for eternity, even after they \nhave obtained legal status. One of these amendments was offered during \nthe committee process, and was rejected.\n  Similarly, the Child Tax Credit was enacted in 1998 for the benefit \nof U.S. citizens or U.S. resident alien children under the age of 17. \nIn practice, it first requires that an individual work and pay her \ntaxes. If the person meets this basic requirement, undocumented or \notherwise, the Child Tax Credit may be claimed for the benefit of the \nU.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien child. Undocumented immigrants who \nuse an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number are able to benefit \nfrom the Child Tax Credit since they work and pay taxes. However, there \nare numerous workers who are lawfully present that also use Individual \nTaxpayer Identification Numbers to pay taxes. During the Committee \nmarkup, one senator proposed an amendment that would have denied the \nChild Tax Credit to low-wage workers who pay their taxes using an \nIndividual Taxpayer Identification Number. This overreach would have \nharmed numerous U.S. citizen children and their families. Fortunately, \nthis unduly harsh amendment was rejected by the Committee as well.\n  I would strongly oppose any amendment to deny hard-working families \nfrom participating in these tax credits when they are paying payroll \ntaxes. We know that these credits are vital to working families and we \nhave a moral obligation not to harm children in our communities and \ntheir families by denying their families these credits.\n  We give huge tax benefits and loopholes to millionaires. Yet a hard-\nworking family, should they not be entitled to these tiny benefits? \nThey are dwarfed by what we give to millionaires. Let's start paying \nattention to the people who need our help.\n  Some who oppose comprehensive immigration reform have raised the \nfalse alarm this immigration bill would drain the Social Security trust \nfund and bankrupt our Medicare system. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. The Wall Street Journal and Commentary are two publications \nthat almost never agree with my positions. In fact, the opposite is \ntrue. In an editorial dated June 2, 2013, entitled, ``A $4.6 Trillion \nOpportunity,'' the Wall Street Journal states unequivocally that \n``Immigration reform will improve Social Security's finances''--not \ntake away from it, but will improve it. In fact, it notes that\n\n       The Senate bill raises immigration quotas by about 500,000 \n     a year over the next decade (to reduce backlogs) and by about \n     150,000 a year after that. Thus the net effect of the \n     immigration bill on the long-range Social Security trust fund \n     ``actuarial balance will be positive,'' Mr. Goss recently \n     wrote in a letter to Senator Marco Rubio. These higher post-\n     reform levels of immigration would mean an extra $600 billion \n     into the trust fund to about $4.6 trillion over 75 years.\n\n  It is true that ``Immigration won't solve all of Social Security's \nfinancial problems.'' However, it said ``immigrants unquestionably \nnarrow the funding gap. More generous immigration is a wise step toward \nsolving the entitlement crisis in Washington.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 2, 2013]\n\n                      A $4.6 Trillion Opportunity\n\n\n       Immigration reform will improve Social Security's finances\n\n       The Senate immigration bill has ignited a debate over the \n     fiscal costs of reform, with some conservatives claiming \n     costs far exceed the benefits. We think that's wrong, and one \n     place to look for evidence is the costliest of all federal \n     programs, Social Security. As some 75 million baby boomers \n     prepare to retire, immigrants will be crucial to keeping the \n     federal pension program afloat.\n       As too few Americans understand, Social Security is not a \n     pre-funded retirement system and there is no ``lock box'' \n     with money set aside for each worker's retirement. It \n     operates as a pay-as-you-go system.\n       Benefits paid out each year roughly match payroll tax \n     revenues collected, at least until the program goes into \n     annual deficit in a few more years, and the so-called trust \n     fund only contains IOUs that the government owes itself. \n     Those IOUs don't help. The Social Security Administration \n     estimates that the present discounted value of the 75-year \n     shortfall of promised benefits beyond the taxes expected to \n     be collected is $8.6 trillion.\n       The crux of the problem is that the ratio of workers to \n     retirees is falling fast. While there were 16 workers for \n     every retiree in 1950, the ratio now stands at a little under \n     3 to 1 and within 20 years when the baby boomers are age 65 \n     or older the ratio will fall to about 2.5 to 1.\n       Immigrants help ease this demographic problem in three \n     ways. First, most come here between the ages of 18 and 35, \n     near the start of their working years. Second, few come with \n     elderly parents (only about 2.5% of immigrants are over age \n     65 when they arrive), and the seniors who do come aren't \n     eligible for Social Security because they have no U.S. work \n     history. Third, immigrants tend to have more children than do \n     native-born Americans and their offspring will also pay into \n     the system.\n       These facts are confirmed in the latest report of the \n     Social Security trustees released last week. They conclude \n     that the program's long-term funding shortfall ``decreases \n     with an increase in net immigration because immigration \n     occurs at relatively young ages, thereby increasing the \n     numbers of covered workers earlier than the numbers of \n     beneficiaries.''\n       How big a bonus are we talking about? Enormous. We asked \n     Stephen Goss, Social Security's chief actuary, to estimate \n     the value of the 1.08 million net new legal and illegal \n     immigrants that currently come to the U.S. each year. He \n     calculates that over 25 years the trust fund is enriched in \n     today's dollars by $500 billion and the surplus from \n     immigration mushrooms to $4 trillion over 75 years.\n       ``The numbers get much larger for longer periods,'' Mr. \n     Goss explains, ``because that is when the additional children \n     born to the immigrants really help.''\n       The Senate bill raises immigration quotas by about 500,000 \n     a year over the next decade (to reduce backlogs) and by about \n     150,000 a year after that. Thus the net effect of the \n     immigration bill on the long-range Social Security trust fund \n     ``actuarial balance will be positive,'' Mr. Goss recently \n     wrote in a letter to Senator Marco Rubio. These higher post-\n     reform levels of immigration would mean an extra $600 billion \n     into the trust fund to about $4.6 trillion over 75 years.\n       The reason is that most immigrant workers pay into the \n     program for 20 to 40 years before they collect any benefits, \n     and they don't have parents who collect benefits while they \n     pay in. Once the immigrants retire and collect benefits, \n     their children are making tax payments roughly covering the \n     payments to their parents.\n       All of this offsets the cost of legalizing currently \n     illegal immigrants. Illegal workers are especially beneficial \n     to Social Security because millions pay into the system--for \n     example, by using fake Social Security numbers when they \n     apply for a job. But since they are illegal, they don't \n     qualify for benefits when they get old. Legalizing their \n     status means they will qualify for future benefits based on \n     their work from now on, but the fiscal impact of the Senate \n     bill is still positive, says Mr. Goss.\n       The relative skills and earnings of immigrants and their \n     children also matter a great deal in measuring their \n     financial contributions. More skilled immigrants have higher \n     earnings, so they pay more in payroll taxes.\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\n     And because of the progressive benefit structure of Social \n     Security, those with higher incomes collect less per dollar \n     paid in.\n       This underscores an under-appreciated bonus of the Senate \n     immigration bill. The bill shifts U.S. immigration policy \n     somewhat more toward skills-based entry rather than family \n     unification. It also increases green cards for foreigners who \n     graduate from American schools in science and engineering, \n     thus raising the education and skills of new immigrants. This \n     means the future fiscal immigration windfall is likely to \n     exceed $4.6 trillion.\n       Immigration won't solve all of Social Security's financial \n     problems. The program still needs reform in its benefit \n     formula and to allow private accounts. But immigrants \n     unquestionably narrow the funding gap. More generous \n     immigration is a wise step toward solving the entitlement \n     crisis in Washington.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Likewise, an article dated June 6, 2013 in Commentary \ndebunks the myth that immigration would bankrupt the Medicare trust \nfund. The title of the article is notable: ``Message to Congress: \nImmigrants Pay More Than Their `Fair Share' of Medicare.'' According to \nthe article, ``it turns out that closing the borders would deplete \nMedicare's trust fund.'' In fact, ``over a seven-year period, \nimmigrants paid in $115.2 billion more than they took out. Meanwhile, \nnative-born Americans drained $28.1 billion from Medicare. In other \nwords, immigrants are keeping Medicare afloat. And it's non-citizen \nimmigrants who make the biggest contribution. On average, each one \nsubsidizes Medicare by $466 annually.'' It concludes that ``Scare-\nmongering about the cost of immigration has become a staple of \npolitical debate . . . But our findings indicate that economic \nfairness, not just morality, argues for immigrants' rights to care.''\n  The goal in this bill is to encourage undocumented immigrants to come \nout of the shadows so we can bring them into our legal system and then \ndo what all Vermonters tell me, what Americans everywhere tell me: Play \nby the same rules. I mean, that is a sense of fairness we should agree \nto. If we create a reason for people not to come out and register, this \nis going to defeat the purpose of this whole bill. It makes all of this \nwork: the hearings, the hours and days and weeks of markups and \nconsideration, makes it for naught. Amendments that seek to further \npenalize the undocumented would just encourage them to stay in the \nshadows. These steps are not going to make us safer and they are not \ngoing to spur our economy.\n  One of the many reasons we need immigration reform is to ensure there \nis not a permanent underclass in this Nation. As part of this effort, \nwe need to continue the vital safety net programs that protect \nchildren, pregnant women, and other vulnerable populations.\n  Too often immigrants have been unfairly blamed and demonized as a \ndrain on our resources. Facts prove the opposite.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. As I have said many times before, my \nmaternal grandparents came from Italy to Vermont seeking a better life. \nThey created many jobs when they did that. They sent their children to \ncollege and saw their grandson become a Senator.\n  My wife's parents came from the Province of Quebec, speaking French. \nShe was born here. Her family contributed to the economy of Vermont, \nand our whole region, with the jobs they created. They raised three \nwonderful children at the same time.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. Let's fight to maintain our tradition \nof protecting the vulnerable. Let's allow the American dream to be a \nreality for all those who are in this country because they want to be \nin this country.\n  Time is not now divided from one side to the other, is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about Doug \nBailey. Doug Bailey died last week at age 79. The New York Times \nreported on Tuesday that Doug Bailey helped define the role of \npolitical consultant in the 1960s and 1970s and that he founded the \nHotline. He was much more than that to me and to countless others for \nwhom he was an example of how to live a public life.\n  I am aware that when offering a eulogy it is good form to speak more \nof the deceased than of oneself, but that is hard to do with Doug \nbecause he cared so much about everyone he met and everyone he worked \nwith. I first met Doug Bailey in Washington, DC, in the spring of 1977. \nI was here for a few months working with Howard Baker, the former \nSenator from Tennessee, who had just been elected to be the Republican \nleader of this body. He asked me to come work for him. I think part of \nthat was to console me, to let me lick my wounds for having lost the \nGovernor's race a couple years earlier in Tennessee. There wasn't much \nprospect for a political future for me then because the Nashville \nTennessean had written that there wouldn't be a Republican Governor in \nTennessee for another 50 years.\n  So I was here in Washington, and while I was here I became energized \nby the Republican Senators. It looked to me as though Jimmy Carter was \nalready in trouble, and my friend Wyatt Stewart introduced me to Doug \nBailey. The reason I thought it was an important meeting was because at \nthat time he and his partner John Deardourff represented 7 of the 12 \nRepublican Governors in the country who were still in office after the \nWatergate debacle of 1974.\n  Doug came to Nashville. He sat down with my wife Honey, Tom Ingram, \nand me, and we talked about the idea of another Governor's race--this \ntime in 1978. Doug's view was that I had lost, among other things, \nbecause I wasn't a very interesting candidate, that I campaigned in a \nblue suit and talked to Republicans and to rotary clubs. So the talk \nwas about what would be authentic, what did I really like to do.\n  To make a long story short, I ended up walking 1,000 miles across \nTennessee over 6 months in a red-and-black plaid shirt, followed by a \ngroup of four University of Tennessee band members in a flatbed truck. \nAnd several times a day we would get up on the truck and play in \nAlexander's washboard band. Doug put all that on television, and I won \nthe election.\n  Now, to some, that would seem like an ultimate political gimmick, but \nif you think about it, the idea of the walk across Tennessee was a good \ndeal more authentic than the photo-ops and the press releases and the \n5-second sound bites that are often what we end up with in politics \ntoday. But let me just say it this way: I would have never been elected \nGovernor if it hadn't been for Doug Bailey.\n  He also did something else I had never seen anybody else do--no other \npolitical consultant. He actually wrote a plan and we actually followed \nit during the campaign.\n  The important thing for me to say today is that political consulting \nwas not the end of Doug Bailey's help. He came to Nashville once a week \nduring my first term as Governor not so much to talk about politics, \nbut to talk about how to be a better Governor, which was his idea of \nhow to be a political success. Our conversations were usually not about \nhow to follow, but how to lead, and how to deal with the political \nimplications, for example, of wanting to have three big road programs \nand do it on a pay-as-you-go basis so we could attract the auto \nindustry to our State without running up debt and persuade all the \nRepublican Members to vote for three gas tax increases, which every \nsingle one of them did.\n  Doug's advice was that a good tactic was to do the right thing \nbecause it would confuse your opponents; they wouldn't understand what \nyou were up to.\n  His advice about recruiting people to work in the cabinet, for \nexample, was not to just invite someone who might take the job, but to \nmake a list of the four or five best persons to do the job and then ask \nthe best one. He said: You might be surprised--that person might be \nwaiting for an opportunity to serve the public. That was some of the \nbest advice I ever got because some of the best persons were waiting \nfor the right opportunity for public service.\n  All this sounds hopelessly naive, especially today, in a time when \nthere is\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\nso much cynicism about politics. But that is the way it was then, and \nthat is the way I was trained, and that is the way I tried to do my \njob. I would wake up every day literally thinking about almost nothing \nelse other than how I could help our State move ahead.\n  I called Doug Bailey throughout the last 30 or 35 years whenever I \nneeded good advice. I called him when the Democrats swore me in early \nto remove a corrupt Governor who was selling pardons for cash in \nTennessee, and he gave me a few words I used to speak to the public on \nthat day.\n  One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was when the first \nPresident Bush called me while I was the University of Tennessee \npresident. I knew President Bush was going to ask me to be the new \nEducation Secretary, and I had about 2 hours to think about it.\n  Doug said: Ask these two questions. One, Mr. President, may I come up \nwith a plan, subject to your approval? Two, may I go and recruit a \nteam, subject to your approval? Well, that may not seem like much, but \nafter I was announced by the President, I walked into the White House \npersonnel office, and they tried to tell me whom to hire. I said: I \ndon't have to do that. I already have the President's assurance that I \ncan recruit a team subject to his approval. So I was able to recruit \nDavid Kearns, former head of Xerox, and Diane Ravitch and others who \nnever would have ended up in President Bush's administration, and he \nwas delighted with them.\n  Doug always had a project. Some were zany. Some were downright \nbrilliant. One of the most recent was to try to persuade someone to run \nfor President on an Independent ticket online. He didn't succeed at \nthat. He was starting another project when I saw him last at a dinner \nat the end of January in Washington this year.\n  Ironically, Doug Bailey was an expert in the technology, TV ads, and \nthe Hotline, which have contributed to today's polarization in \npolitics. But he withdrew from politics after a while and from \npolitical consulting because he didn't like what politics had become. \nHe thought more elected officials needed to understand that there is a \ndifference between campaigning and governing and that differences \nshould be resolved in the middle rather than entrenched in the fringes \nor on the extremes.\n  In a tribute, Judy Woodruff wrote about perhaps Doug's greatest \npassion and his greatest legacy: inspiring youngsters such as Chuck \nTodd and Norah O'Donnell--whom he paid almost nothing to work at the \nHotline--to care about and be involved in America's political system. I \nam sure Chuck and Norah would tell you that Doug considered it even \nmore important and an even nobler calling to actually serve in \ngovernment, and that he spent most of his life teaching and helping \nthose who were willing to do it.\n  I would never have been elected Governor without Doug Bailey's help. \nMore important, I will give Doug most of the credit for whatever \nsuccess I had as Governor and in politics. It has been a long time \nsince I regularly checked with him before I made a political move, but \nwhen I did, I always felt as though the next step was a surer step and \na step more likely to be in a direction that served a larger purpose \nother than my own political existence.\n  I have never known a person who cared more about each person he met \nin every issue he tackled. So I wanted to come to the floor today and \nexpress this tribute to a public life well lived, and to offer my \ncondolences to his wife Pat, his children Kate and Edward, his brothers \nand his grandson.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks the New York Times story about Doug Bailey's death and Judy \nWoodruff's blog about his passing. It has lots of comments from other \npeople, and I have not seen a blog in a long time where all the \ncomments are positive. Usually that is not the case.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 13, 2013]\n\n          Doug Bailey, G.O.P. Political Consultant, Dies at 79\n\n                           (By Paul Vitello)\n\n       Doug Bailey, who helped define the expanding role of \n     political consultants in the 1960s and '70s and later founded \n     The Hotline, a digest of political news, distributed by fax, \n     that became an indispensable tool of the political trade in \n     the pre-Web 1980s and '90s, died on Monday at his home in \n     Arlington, Va. He was 79.\n       Mr. Bailey, who had health problems in recent years, was \n     working at home on several projects when he died, apparently \n     in his sleep, said his daughter, Kate Bailey.\n       His consulting firm, Bailey Deardourff & Associates, which \n     he started in 1967 with a fellow political hand, John \n     Deardourff, worked mainly for moderate Republican candidates \n     like Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, Mayor John V. \n     Lindsay of New York and Senator Charles H. Percy of Illinois. \n     At one point in the late 1970s, the firm had 11 of the \n     country's 19 Republican governors as clients.\n       Its work on behalf of President Gerald R. Ford's campaign \n     in 1976 against Jimmy Carter, then a former Georgia governor, \n     was widely credited with helping to narrow Mr. Ford's deficit \n     of much as 20 points in the polls--most of it attributed to \n     his pardon of President Richard M. Nixon for his role in \n     Watergate--to 2 points by Election Day.\n       The firm made some commercials featuring ordinary Americans \n     questioning Mr. Carter's lack of national experience, and \n     others focused on Mr. Ford's likability and long government \n     service, all to the tune of a campaign song, ``I'm Feeling \n     Good About America.''\n       ``We said to ourselves, what the country knows about Gerald \n     Ford is that he pardoned Nixon,'' Mr. Bailey told The New \n     York Times. ``Let's tell them more, let's give them a view of \n     Jerry Ford the man that's upbeat.''\n       Mr. Deardourff died in 2004 at 71.\n       Mr. Bailey, who had grown dismayed by the polarization of \n     national campaigns in the 1980s, started The Hotline in 1987 \n     partly as an experiment in bipartisanship, he said. With the \n     Democratic strategist Roger Craver as his partner, he sought \n     to expose the professional political class to a broad range \n     of issues across the ideological spectrum.\n       Mr. Bailey told interviewers that in The Hotline's first \n     year, potential subscribers asked three main questions: \n     ``You're going to do what?'' ``You want me to pay you how \n     much?'' And ``What's a fax?''\n       The Hotline's 500 or so paying subscribers--among them \n     politicians, pundits, political operatives and Congressional \n     staff members--received an exhaustive aggregation of \n     information at 11:30 each morning, including news about state \n     and local election campaigns and grass-roots trends like tax \n     revolts, term-limit drives and environmental initiatives.\n       It also offered a roundup of political jokes from the \n     previous night's talk-show monologues. Before ``The Daily \n     Show,'' The Hotline was one of the most prodigious purveyors \n     of political humor in the country.\n       ``That's part of political communication these days,'' Mr. \n     Bailey said, presciently, in a 1991 interview with The \n     Washington Post. ``As a practical matter, if you want to know \n     where the people are, their views come from television, and \n     more from programs that don't try to influence them directly, \n     such as the late-night monologues.''\n       The Hotline, which was bought by The National Journal in \n     1996 and is part of its Web site, became a training ground \n     for political reporters, including Chuck Todd of NBC and \n     Norah O'Donnell of CBS. Its currency has been somewhat \n     devalued in the past decade by free political sites like \n     Politico and Talking Points Memo, whose creators acknowledge \n     The Hotline in their lineage.\n       Douglas Lansford Bailey was born on Oct. 5, 1933, in \n     Cleveland to Walter and Marion Bailey. His father ran a \n     manufacturing company. After receiving a bachelor's degree \n     from Colgate University, Mr. Bailey received his master's and \n     doctorate degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and \n     Diplomacy at Tufts.\n       Besides his daughter, Mr. Bailey is survived by his wife, \n     Patricia, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission from \n     1979 to 1988; his son, Ed; a brother, David; and a grandson.\n       In 1999, again with Mr. Craver, Mr. Bailey founded the \n     Freedom Channel, which offers politically oriented video \n     online on demand.\n       In 2006, Mr. Bailey joined with the Democratic political \n     consultants Hamilton Jordan and Gerald Rafshoon in founding a \n     political reform organization, Unity08. It suspended its \n     activities in 2008 after a failed effort to draft Mayor \n     Michael R. Bloomberg of New York to run for president.\n       ``The two-party system has worked well for 200 years and \n     can continue to do so,'' Mr. Bailey said at the time, ``but \n     only when elections are fought over the middle. Our goal is \n     to jolt the two parties into recognizing this, by drawing \n     them into a fight over the middle rather than allowing them \n     to keep maximizing the appeal to their bases at the \n     extremes.''\n       Asked in another interview about politics today, Mr. Bailey \n     said, ``Candidates listen too much to consultants because \n     they're driven by winning and money.''\n       This article has been revised to reflect the following \n     correction:\n       Correction: June 17, 2013\n       An earlier version of this obituary omitted one survivor \n     and erroneously included two brothers among the survivors. Of \n     Mr. Bailey's three brothers, only one, David, survives him; \n     Robert and Richard are deceased.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Rundown, June 13, 2013]\n\n                        Remembering Doug Bailey\n\n                           (By Judy Woodruff)\n\n       It doesn't happen often. But every once in a while, you \n     meet a person who carries the\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n     human equivalent of sunshine around with them. It's the guy \n     or girl who always seems to be smiling--if not outright, then \n     just beneath the surface. And not in a goofy way, but rather \n     as if they love life and what they're doing and have decided \n     not to let the gremlins throw them off course. My friend Doug \n     Bailey, who died this week at the age of 79, was like that. I \n     never had a conversation with him, over the course of more \n     than thirty years, when he didn't have a piece of good news \n     to share. He was one of the most upbeat people I've ever \n     known.\n       What may surprise you is that he spent his life in \n     politics. Given the partisanship and negativity that define \n     today's political arena, it's hard to imagine. But Doug got \n     his start when things were different, when candidates could \n     be moderate Republicans (as most of those he supported were), \n     or conservative Democrats, and still get elected to office. \n     This was back in the 1960s and '70s when Republicans such as \n     New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, and Sens. Charles Percy of \n     Illinois, Howard Baker of Tennessee and Richard Lugar of \n     Indiana were running for election and re-election. Doug \n     Bailey worked for all of them, and for President Gerald Ford \n     in his re-election campaign of 1976.\n       Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, whose \n     gubernatorial campaign Bailey worked on in that era, told the \n     National Journal in an interview this week, ``He cared about \n     every person he met and every issue he tackled.''\n       President Ford's close loss to challenger Jimmy Carter was \n     hard on Doug, but what caused him to leave campaign work \n     altogether, he later told friends, was the negative tone \n     politics started to take on in the 1980s. He went on to \n     create the Hotline, a pioneering daily newsletter on \n     campaigns and candidates, and later to launch a succession of \n     projects aimed at bringing the two parties together, \n     searching for the increasingly elusive common ground between \n     the far left and the far right.\n       But what I remember best about Doug Bailey was his passion \n     for getting young people turned on to politics. He refused to \n     accept the idea that entire generations of Americans would \n     grow up and be repelled by the thought of a life in public \n     service. When I first talked to him in 2005 about a rough \n     plan for a documentary project, traveling around the United \n     States and profiling the group that has come to be known as \n     ``millennials,'' no one was more enthusiastic than Doug.\n       He put me in touch with the surprisingly large national \n     network of young people he knew--all leaders, many then still \n     in college; at the same time, he urged me not to forget to \n     talk to young people who were not in school. In 2007, when \n     the project was over, after two documentaries and other \n     reports had been aired or published, he urged me to do a \n     sequel. Since then, and as recently as this spring, he's had \n     one idea after another about how to engage young people in \n     public life. In the hundreds of tweets that popped up after \n     word spread of his death, there were scores from young folks \n     he mentored.\n       Doug was not only really smart; he was wise. He believed \n     politics was meant to help people and to make this a better \n     country, and he thought political people should work together \n     to make that happen. He never gave up on the idea. We honor \n     his legacy by not giving up either. Doug Bailey is survived \n     by his wife Pat, their children Ed and Kate, and a \n     grandchild.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4503-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4503-S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Saturday was the first anniversary of \na very historic day. On June 15, 2012, President Barack Obama announced \nhe would grant temporary legal status to immigrant students who arrived \nin the United States as children. This status, known as deferred action \nfor children arrivals, or DACA, allows these young people to live and \nwork legally in America on a temporary basis without fear of \ndeportation.\n  June 15, 2012, is a day I will never forget. It was personal. It was \n12 years ago that I introduced legislation known as the DREAM Act. This \nbill gives immigrant students who grew up in this country a chance to \nearn their citizenship. I have worked hard to pass this bill for 12 \nyears. During that time it has been my honor to meet hundreds of the \nyoung people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act.\n  I don't know when it started, but we started calling them, and they \ncalled themselves, the DREAMers. They were brought to the United States \nas children. They grew up in this country, and they have overcome some \namazing obstacles. They are tomorrow's doctors, engineers, teachers, \nand soldiers. They are young people who will make America a better \ncountry. But for most of their young lives they have been trapped in a \nlegal limbo, fearing that they could be deported away from their \nfamilies, away from their homes, away from the only country they have \never called home with just a knock on the door. Yet they have developed \namazing lives with great potential.\n  Incidentally, we have already invested in them. They were educated in \nAmerica. They have a great potential to make this country even better \nfor the future generations. It just doesn't make any sense to walk away \nfrom the talents they can bring to us.\n  In 2010, Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and I joined together \nacross the aisle to ask the Obama administration to grant deferred \naction to DREAMers. President Obama wanted to give Congress a chance to \nact before using his Executive power, and he said: I know I have the \nauthority, but let's see if you can pass the DREAM Act.\n  We brought it to the floor of the Senate. I remember that day. If I \nam not mistaken, it was a Saturday, and that gallery was filled. It was \nfilled with young people in caps and gowns who were watching the debate \non the floor of the Senate on the DREAM Act. We needed 60 votes because \nwe faced a Republican filibuster. We have always faced a Republican \nfilibuster.\n  Fifty-five Senators voted for it, which by most standards is a \nsufficient majority, but not by the Senate standard. We fell five votes \nshort of defeating the filibuster.\n  I watched those students file out of those doors, and then I left the \nfloor of the Chamber. I walked downstairs to meet with them. There was \nnot a dry eye in the room. They had just watched their dreams disappear \nright here on the floor of the Senate--five votes short.\n  The House, in which the Presiding Officer was serving, had already \npassed the DREAM Act under the leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, \nHoward Berman, Zoe Lofgren, and especially my colleague from Illinois, \nLuis Gutierrez. The House had risen to that challenge. We had our \nchance and fell short by five votes.\n  After that Republican filibuster of the DREAM Act, President Obama \ndecided he needed to take charge. He established the deferred action \nfor childhood arrivals to give those DREAMers and the thousands like \nthem across the country a chance to come out of the shadows and be part \nof America.\n  What has happened since then? In the last year more than 539,000 have \napplied for DACA. So far about 365,000 applications have been granted; \n140,000 applications are still being considered. I am proud to say my \nhome State of Illinois has the third most DACA applicants, more than \n28,000, and the third most DACA recipients, approximately 23,000 young \npeople. It wasn't too surprising because shortly after the President \nannounced his program, Congressman Luis Gutierrez and I held a \ngathering at the Navy Pier, which is kind of a seminal site in downtown \nChicago.\n  We invited those who wanted to apply for this deferred action. We \nthought: What are we going to do if 400 or 500 people show up? Then we \nwere worried no one would show up. We didn't know what to expect. Well, \nwe knew the night before what was coming. The line started forming at \nmidnight. At midnight these families stood there--mom, dad, and their \nson or daughter--waiting for a chance for that son or daughter to apply \nfor this decision by President Obama of deferred action.\n  Many times the parents were undocumented themselves and even risked \ndeportation by showing up. But the thought of saving a child in their \nfamily and giving that child a chance was enough for them to take the \nrisk.\n  Well, it turned out over 12,000 people showed up. We were \noverwhelmed. We couldn't even come close to processing the applications \nthat were involved. We knew then this was an idea whose time had come.\n  It is especially important to note the 1-year anniversary of \nPresident Obama's announcement as we consider what is going on on the \nfloor of the Senate this week. We are debating comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  The reality is that DACA is overwhelmingly popular with the American \npeople. The American people--I have always trusted--have in their heart \nof\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\nhearts a goodness, an understanding, and a caring. They saw these young \npeople brought here as babies, infants, as little children, and they \nknew they had not made the decision to come here, but their parents \nmade the decision to come here. If anybody did anything wrong, violated \nany law, overstayed a visa, whatever the circumstances, it wasn't the \nchild, it was the parent. They understand the basic element of justice \nnot just in America but in life, and it is this: You don't hold a child \nresponsible for the wrongdoing of a parent. Most Americans understood \nthat and want to give these young people a chance.\n  On election day last year, Hispanic Americans voted overwhelmingly in \nfavor of President Barack Obama. There were many Republican Members of \nCongress, including my good friend Senator John McCain of Arizona, who \nheard that message loudly and clearly, and that--in no small part--is \nwhy we are considering comprehensive immigration reform today. Within \nthis bill is the DREAM Act, and not just the DREAM Act, but the \nstrongest version of the DREAM Act that has ever been written.\n  It is also important to note what happened to the DREAMers in the \nlast year. These young Americans were finally able to work legally in \nAmerica and have already stepped forward to contribute their talents. \nThe Center for American Progress and the bipartisan Partnership for a \nNew American Economy has concluded that giving legal status to DREAMers \nwill add $329 billion to America's economy and create 1.4 million new \njobs by 2030. The economic benefit of legalizing 11 million \nundocumented could be even greater.\n\n  According to the study by the Center for American Progress, if \ncomprehensive immigration reform becomes law, undocumented immigrants \nwill increase their earnings by 15 percent over 5 years, leading to \n$832 billion in economic growth and $109 billion in increased tax \nrevenues--money that will be paid by the currently undocumented \nimmigrants who will become legally part of America in the next 10 \nyears. It will also create an estimated 120,000 jobs every single \nyear--a growth engine. It always has been a growth engine in America. \nThis Nation of immigrants, when it builds on the strength and \ncommitment of newcomers, is a stronger and better Nation and continues \nto lead the world. How could we have forgotten that lesson of history?\n  Conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin recently concluded \nimmigration reform would actually reduce Federal deficits by $2.7 \ntrillion, add a full percentage point to our economic growth, and raise \nGDP per capita by approximately $1,700.\n  I started several years ago coming to the floor of the Senate to not \njust speak about the DREAM Act but to tell the stories of DREAMers. It \nwas something I came to do because I finally witnessed their courage \nand realized I had to share it here on the floor of the Senate. When I \nfirst started talking about the DREAM Act and undocumented young people \nwho could be deported in a moment, torn away from their families and \ntheir lives and sent to a place they could never remember, facing a \nlanguage they couldn't speak, they would very quietly wait until my \nmeeting was over and come out of the darkness by my car as I was \nleaving and say, Senator, I am one of those kids who would be helped by \nthe DREAM Act. They didn't want anyone to see them for fear of being \ndeported. But over time they came to realize that standing up, with the \ncourage to tell their stories, they risked deportation but they put a \nface on this issue. It wasn't some politician giving a speech, it was a \nreal life, and that is what they did. As they came forward to tell \ntheir stories with their courage, I came to the floor of the Senate.\n  I wish to take a moment now to thank a man who is sitting to my \nright, Joe Zogby. Joe has been a staffer on this issue from the \nbeginning, and when it passes I know he will celebrate just as I do, \nunderstanding, as I do, the lives that will be impacted by this \ndecision if the DREAM Act becomes the law of the land.\n  These DREAMers are an amazing group. The stories I told on the floor \nincluded DREAMers who grew up in 17 different States, from Arizona and \nTexas in the Southwest, Missouri and Ohio in the Midwest, and North \nCarolina and Georgia in the Southeast. These talented young people came \nto America from all over the world--19 different countries \nrepresented--and from every continent except Antarctica. Yet all of \nthem share something in common: America is their home. They are only \nasking for a chance to give back to their home.\n  Today I wish to spend a minute or two to update the Senate on what \nhas happened to some of these DREAMers since they received DACA--this \ndeferred status--last year.\n  Angelica Hernandez was brought to America when she was 9 years old. \nTwo years ago, Angelica graduated from Arizona State University as the \noutstanding senior in the mechanical engineering department with a 4.1 \nGPA. Angelica just finished her first year of graduate school at \nStanford University where she is working on a master's degree in civil \nand environmental engineering with a focus on energy. Her dream is to \ndedicate her career to developing renewable energy. After receiving \nDACA, because of the President's Executive order, this summer Angelica \nwill work at Enphase Energy, a solar energy startup company.\n  This is Pierre Berastain. Pierre and his sister were brought to the \nUnited States from Peru in 1998 when they were children. Pierre didn't \nspeak a word of English when he arrived in Texas, but he went on to \nreceive a bachelor's degree with honors from Harvard University. He is \ncurrently pursuing a master's degree at Harvard Divinity School. Two \nyears ago, Pierre cofounded the Restorative Justice Collaborative, a \nnonprofit organization which involves criminal offenders in the process \nof repairing the harm they have done. Since he received DACA, Pierre \nwas awarded one of only 10 Harvard Presidential Public Service \nFellowships so he can expand this organization.\n  This is Carlos Martinez. Carlos and his brother were brought to the \nUnited States when he was only 9 years old. He graduated with honors \nwith a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering from the \nUniversity of Arizona. Carlos received job offers from Intel, IBM, and \nmany high-tech companies, but he couldn't work because he was \nundocumented. So he went on to get a master's degree in software \nsystems engineering at the University of Arizona. After receiving DACA, \nCarlos is finally able to work in America as an engineer. This \nWednesday he will start a new job with IBM, a company that first tried \nto hire him 6 years ago when he was undocumented. Out of more than \n10,000 applicants who applied to IBM, Carlos Martinez was 1 of only 75 \npeople they hired.\n  This is Nelson and Jhon Magdaleno. They came to the State of Georgia \nfrom Venezuela when Nelson was 11 and Jhon was 9. Nelson and Jhon went \nto Georgia Tech University, one of the most selective engineering \nschools in America. Nelson graduated with an honors degree in computer \nengineering and Jhon is currently an honor student majoring in chemical \nand biomolecular engineering. After receiving deferred action, Jhon is \nworking at a biomedical engineering lab at Georgia Tech researching \nglaucoma. He recently secured an internship with Eastman Chemical \nCompany. Nelson is now working at Texas Instruments, one of America's \ntop high-tech companies.\n  Ola Kaso was brought to the United States from Albania at the age of \n5. What a superstar. Valedictorian of her high school class, she is now \na pre-med student in the honors program at the University of Michigan. \nHer dream is to become a surgical oncologist. Can we use more of those? \nYou bet. In 2011, I invited Ola to testify at a hearing on the DREAM \nAct. She was the first undocumented immigrant to openly testify before \nthe Senate. It took amazing courage for this young woman. After \nreceiving deferred action this spring, Ola interned in the office of my \ncolleague and friend Senator Carl Levin.\n  This is someone those following the debate may recognize: Tolu \nOlubumni was brought to the United States from Nigeria when she was a \nchild. In 2002, Tolu graduated with a degree in chemical engineering \nfrom Washington and Lee University in Virginia. For 10 years--10 years \nafter graduating from college--Tolu couldn't work as an engineer. She \nspent her time working to pass the DREAM Act. Since receiving the \ndeferred action, Tolu is working as\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\nan advocate for comprehensive immigration reform with the Center for \nCommunity Change. Last week, Tolu was introduced to America. She had \nthe honor of introducing President Obama at a White House event on \nimmigration reform.\n  I met with the President last week. I asked him about those DREAMers. \nHe said they came into the Oval Office and met with him, and he said \nthere were tears in everyone's eyes as they realized the opportunity \nthese young people might finally get if we pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n\n  This is Erika Andiola. Erika was brought to our country from Mexico \nwhen she was 11 years old. She graduated with honors from Arizona State \nwith a bachelor's degree in psychology. Erika was the founder and \npresident of the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition, an immigration group \nadvocating for the passage of the bill. She received DACA and has since \nbeen working in Congress. She is the district outreach director for one \nof the Arizona delegation's newest members, Representative Krysten \nSinema.\n  Now I want my colleagues to meet Carlos and Rafael Robles. Carlos and \nRafael were brought to the United States as children. They grew up in \nsuburban Chicago in my home State of Illinois. They were both honor \nstudents at Palatine High School and Harper Community College. Carlos \nis now attending the University of Chicago majoring in education. With \nDACA, Carlos can pursue his dream to become a teacher and he will have \nthe opportunity to student-teach in a suburban high school in the \nChicagoland area. Rafael is at the University of Illinois in Chicago \nwhere he is majoring in architecture. After receiving DACA, he is \nworking at Studio Gang Architects, an award-winning architectural firm \nin the great city of Chicago.\n  This is Jose Magana. Jose was brought to the United States from \nMexico at the age of 2. He graduated valedictorian of his high school. \nHe is the first member of his family to attend college. In 2008, he \ngraduated summa cum laude from Arizona State University with a major in \nbusiness management. He went on to graduate from Baylor University Law \nSchool. After receiving DACA, Jose began working with the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense Fund, a leading civil rights organization. This \nweek, Jose will be sworn in as a member of the bar which he was unable \nto do before President Obama's Executive order 1 year ago.\n  To hear the stories of these amazing young people is to realize the \nbenefits immigration has always meant for America. Imagine what will \nhappen when 11 million undocumented immigrants have the opportunity to \ncome out of the shadows and be part of America. Like these DREAMers, \nthey will be able to contribute even more to this country they worked \nso hard to come to and worked so hard to stay in and now call home. \nLegalization will unleash the earning potential for millions of people. \nThey will be able to pursue jobs and manage the skills they have \ninstead of working and being exploited in the underground economy. It \nis the right thing to do and it will make America stronger.\n  It was so disappointing last week when the Republicans in the House \nof Representatives passed an amendment to cut off funding for this \nprogram. That is right. All of these young people who have received a \nchance--the first chance ever to be part of America's future--would \nhave the program shut down by a vote last week in the House of \nRepresentatives. Supporters of this amendment want to deport these \nyoung people. They make no bones about it. They believe they should \nleave. Their belief is that if these DREAMers are forced out of the \ncountry and deported to some other country, we will be a stronger \nNation because of that. What are they thinking, to lose people such as \nCarlos Martinez and Tolu Olubumni? These young people can make a \npositive difference for America. It is shameless, absolutely shameless, \nto play with the lives of these young people. These are people who need \na chance. They don't need to be the victims of some political gambit. \nIt would be bad for America's future if they leave. We couldn't \npossibly be stronger if Angelica Hernandez could not continue to work \non future renewable sources of energy and Ola Kaso could no longer be \nthe researcher in cancer she wants to be.\n  The answer is clear: We need to pass comprehensive immigration reform \non a bipartisan basis right here in the Senate. We have waited way too \nlong. For over 25 years this broken immigration system has not done \nthese people justice nor has it done America justice.\n  During the next 2 weeks the Senate will conclude one of its most \nhistoric debates on comprehensive immigration reform. It has been over \n4 months that I have been actively involved in this Gang of 8--four \nDemocrats and four Republican Senators. We have had over 30 sitdown \nmeetings, face to face. Many of them went smoothly, as did the \ndiscussion of the DREAM Act; some of them not so smoothly. We \ndisagreed, and some of the disagreements were pretty vocal. At the end \nof the day, though, we realized we had a larger responsibility that \nwent beyond any single difference of opinion we might have. We reached \na bipartisan agreement. Now the question is, can the Senate hold that \nagreement together, on the floor of the Senate, when the amendment \nprocess begins, and next week when we face a vote.\n  The values and principles that underlie this agreement are \nfundamental and critical. They include a path to citizenship not only \nfor these young people but for many of their parents. They have to come \nout of the shadows, up to 11 million of them, and identify themselves \nto a government they have feared their whole lives. They have to \nregister with this government and then submit themselves to a criminal \nbackground check. If they are found to have a serious problem in their \nbackground, they are gone. They don't have a chance to become legal in \nAmerica. But if they pass that background check, they have to pay a \nsubstantial fine, pay their taxes, and then learn English and be \nmonitored during the course of 10 years--10 years--in probationary \nstatus. During that period, they can work legally in America--they \nwon't be deported--and they can travel without fear of being stopped at \nthe border. Then, at the end of 10 years, if they have met all of the \nstandards, all of the scrutiny, if they have paid the fines and paid \ntheir taxes, they will have a chance for a 3- to 5-year path to \ncitizenship. It is a long process. For many of them, it will be a great \nsacrifice, but they have offered great sacrifices with their lives \nalready.\n  On the other side, we have agreed with our Republican colleagues to \ndo even more in our power to make sure our border with Mexico is as \nstrong as humanly possible and to make certain our immigration system \nis changed so we don't face this debate every 5, 10, or 25 years.\n  I think it is a good bill. There are parts of it I am very proud of, \nsome parts of it I do not like at all, but that is the nature of a \ncompromise, that is how you get something done.\n  I look around this institution, and I realize how important this \nissue is, but I also realize how important this issue is to the Senate. \nIf I asked the people of America, what do you think about Congress \nthese days, I think I would know the answer. Somebody said our approval \nrating just broke double digits again. We are up to 10 percent of the \nAmerican people who think we might be worth having. That must include a \nlot of our relatives and close friends that we made it up to 10 \npercent.\n  We better prove something on the floor of the Senate over the next 2 \nweeks. We better prove that we can work together, Democrats and \nRepublicans; that we will not break down and fall apart over one issue \nor the other; that we will keep our focus on getting this job done.\n  Then we need to turn to our colleagues and friends in the U.S. House \nof Representatives and tell them they face the same historic \nresponsibility we faced. I have heard a lot of speculation about what \nmight happen in the House. Let's just focus on the Senate for the next \n2 weeks. Let's do our part and do our job and let the American people \nwitness this process as it should be. If we are successful at the end \nof next week and pass this legislation, then let the American people \nspeak up to the Members of the House of Representatives. Let them hear \nfrom their districts and the people they represent what they feel about \nthe importance of this issue when it comes to immigration reform. I am \nconfident, as I said\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nearlier, that deep in their hearts, the American people are good \npeople, they know our roots, they know our story, they know our origin.\n  I stand here today as the son of an immigrant. My mother came to this \ncountry at the age of 2. She was a DREAMer in her day. Her mom brought \nher to the Port of Baltimore, put her on a train, and they linked up \nwith my grandfather in East Saint Louis, IL. Upstairs in my office is \nmy mother's naturalization certificate. It is proudly displayed because \nI want people to know who I am and where I came from. It is my story, \nit is my family's story, but it is America's story that the son of an \nimmigrant can be standing on the floor of the Senate representing the \ngreat State of Illinois and speaking to the next generation of \nimmigrants to America and the difference they can make.\n  This is our opportunity. We know America will be a stronger and \nbetter nation when we do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, last week I gave remarks on the floor \nthat pointed out that promises made that the immigration bill before us \nwas a significant move toward merit-based immigration and away from \nchain immigration--I dealt with that subject. I am not aware that any \nof my comments have fundamentally been disputed.\n  The fact is that 30 million people will be given legal status as an \nimmigrant on a pathway to citizenship over the next 10 years--that 30 \nmillion is three times the current legal flow of 1 million a year, \nwhich would be 10 million a year. It would triple the number of people \nput on a path to permanent legal residence and citizenship. Only 2.5 \nmillion of those would be admitted under this new, small, actually \nweak, merit-based section of the bill. This is nowhere close to the \ntruly effective and popular merit-based immigration system which Canada \nadopted a decade--maybe more--ago and which is being followed and \nadopted in other developed countries around the world.\n  Evidence has also been introduced that nonimmigrant guest workers--\nthat is, those who come not for immigration, to be a citizen and be \npermanent, but come to work for a period of time and return home--that \ngroup of workers will double under the legislation that is before us \nover current law.\n  All of this is at a time of persistently high unemployment and when \nvirtually all serious academics, economic experts agree that such a \nhuge flow will depress wages of our middle-class workers and increase \nunemployment. Politicians blithely claim otherwise, but Professor \nBorjas at Harvard and the Federal Reserve in Atlanta and others have \nstudied this, and they show otherwise with in-depth economic research.\n  There is a long list of other promises. The reason I raise this is \nbecause these were promises that we are going to improve the working \nconditions of Americans, we are going to shift to a merit-based system. \nThat is not correct.\n  There are other promises. I made a speech and so have others that \nhave clearly demonstrated that the triggers in the bill do not work. \nThe triggers are supposed to say: You do not get legal status or you do \nnot get green card status until these law enforcement issues are fixed, \nuntil the illegality is fixed. The triggers are ineffective. That has \nbeen documented. It really is not disputable, in my opinion. All the \nSecretary of Homeland Security has to do is to submit a plan that she \nsays will work. It does not require any fencing or any other actions \nspecifically. And she gets to determine whether it is working. If it \ndoes not meet the standards according to the Secretary, then a border \ncommission is established, but the border commission has no power. It \ncan only issue a report, and it dissolves in 30 days. So these promises \nthat we have a very tough plan that is guaranteed through a series of \ntriggers are not so.\n  Today I will talk about the DACA program and how that has undermined \nlaw enforcement. Surely we can agree that congressional legislation is \nmore than salesmanship, it is more than puffing, it is more than \npromises. Surely it represents a bill and a bill that must be read.\n  The words of legislation are not a mere vision designed to touch our \nhearts. It is not something that the sponsors can come in and say: We \nbelieve the American people are correct. They want A, B, C, and D. We \nhave a bill that does it. And then nobody reads the bill to determine \nwhether it does it. So that is what I have been trying to do.\n  Congress and the good American people do want to solve our \nimmigration problems--problems that our politicians and government \nleaders have messed up for 30 years. The American people have pleaded \nwith Congress to fix this system for 30 years. Congress has failed to \ndo so. They continue to promise to do so but do not. Now, that is a \nfact.\n  But legislative language is the real thing. Legislation is not a \nvision. Legislation has power--power to fix our broken system or power \nto allow the lawlessness to continue. Thus, it is legislation, not \nspin, that we will be voting on. A promise made by a gang is of no \nvalue if the bill language does not produce the results they promise. \nSo that is the rub. That is the problem we face.\n  Presumably there are ads running this very day which claim to be \nsponsored by conservative voices, founded by Mr. Zuckerberg of \nFacebook, no conservative to my knowledge, featuring Senator Rubio \nurging the passage of the bill. Indeed, Mr. Zuckerberg created a front \ngroup that is on the advertisement--they are called Americans for a \nConservative Direction, that purports to be reflective of conservative \nthinking in America.\n  I think that is a bit odd. It is odd right now that Senator Rubio, \nwho is still talking to the American people on those ads and to my \nconstituents in Alabama, is saying all of this on the ad when he has \nalready said the bill is flawed and he cannot vote for it in its \ncurrent circumstance. I think that advertisement ought to be pulled.\n  Worse, virtually everything in the ad, especially in the voiceover--\nnot Senator Rubio--but the voiceover is false. It is not an accurate \ndescription of the legislation, what it does, how it will work. It is \njust not. If it was, I would be intrigued by this legislation and would \nbe interested in thinking it should set sort forth a framework that \nmost Americans agree would be a basis for immigration reform.\n  So conservatives should be careful, no matter how sincere, in being \npart of promoting legislation that we do not fully understand or will \nnot do what it claims it will do. A commitment to truth is a \nconservative value. I like all of the Gang of 8 members personally. I \nhave worked with them for a number of years. I truly admire Senator \nRubio. He is a fantastic new Member of the body. I understand the goals \nthey articulate and would support most of those goals. So it is no \npleasure for me to raise these uncomfortable points.\n  But at this very minute, Mark Zuckerberg and his supporters are \nrunning these ads promoting legislation as doing something I do not \nbelieve it does. I think we should be working on that. I know we have \nhad a number of our colleagues, another one of my good friends this \nweekend pronounced a political doctrine of the death spiral of the \nRepublican Party. I have to tell you, we have a lot of people who make \npolitical prognostications. But the truth is who knows what political \nissues will dominate in 2016 or 2020 or 2030.\n  Mr. President, is there a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator has 10 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you. I did not realize that. How much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  The best politics, in my view, is to do the right thing for the right \nreason and to be able to explain what one is doing cogently and \nhonestly to the American people, and then the people will decide. If \nthey do not like your decisions over a period of time you are out. So \nbe it.\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\nIs that not the way the system is supposed to work?\n  It is not wrong to give respect to the opinions of the American \npeople, to ask what they think about issues and how they react to \nissues. There is nothing wrong with that. Actually, we should do that. \nBut it is not right to poll a large and complex issue to find out what \npeople want and then propose legislation that you say fulfills their \ndesires, when the legislation does not fulfill those desires.\n  That is not the right thing to do, to promote good policy in America. \nAs a matter of fact, polls show the American people want enforcement \nbefore amnesty by a 4-to-1 margin. Polls also show a clear majority \nactually favor a lower legal flow or the same amount of legal flow into \nour country from immigration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They do not favor the huge increase of legal flow that \nis called for in this bill. Maybe later I will be able to talk about \nsome of the difficulties of enforcement under current law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4507-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4507-S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the great work my colleagues, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Schumer, Senator Rubio, and others, have done \non the immigration bill. I am going to be pleased this week to support \ntheir work. But I came to the floor, as I have most weeks since being \nsworn in, to talk about the issue that has dominated discussions in my \nState over the past 6 months; that is, the issue of gun violence.\n  Last week we commemorated the 6-month anniversary of the deadly \nshooting in Sandy Hook, CT, in which 20 6- and 7-year-olds, first \ngraders, were gunned down, and 6 of their teachers, including as well \nthe gunman and his mother. A lot of families came down here last week \nto continue to lobby both the House and the Senate.\n  The look on their face is a complicated look. It is clearly first and \nforemost the look of incalculable grief as these families still try to \nfigure out how to live the first summer of their life without their \nloved one, whether it be a first grader who would have been heading \ninto second grade or a mother or a teacher or a brother or sister.\n  But there is also, in combination with this grief, this look of \nshock, this look of shock that frankly gets worse every time they come \ndown here as they try to understand how this place could stand by and \ndo nothing, absolutely nothing, in the wake of the horror that Newtown, \nCT, has seen.\n  At least we have taken a vote on the Senate floor. Very much like the \ndescription that Senator Durbin gave earlier of his attempt several \nyears ago to pass the DREAM Act, we got 54 votes on the floor of the \nSenate. Under our Draconian and backward rules, that was not enough to \nget the bill done. But the House has not even scheduled a debate on gun \nviolence legislation. Families in Newtown, CT, cannot understand that. \nThey cannot understand how Senators and House Members can look them in \nthe eye, can hear the story of their grief and do nothing.\n  They certainly cannot understand it after, almost to the day of the \n6-month anniversary, another mass shooting occurred, this time on the \nother side of the country. We almost know the story before we hear it: \nMass shooting; four dead; others wounded. In Newtown, we did not even \nhave to pick up the paper to know it was going to be an assault weapon; \nit was going to be high-capacity magazines, once again.\n  Every story is a little bit different. So this one was an assault \nweapon that was partially handmade. This time there was a lot of \nammunition that may not have been used. But it is a story that gets \nrepeated over and over: Lots of people dead, assault weapon used, high-\ncapacity magazines.\n  So for those people who say we cannot do anything about it, we can. \nWe can. Because we can keep these dangerous, military-style weapons in \nthe hands of law enforcement and people who are hired and trained to \nshoot these weapons for a living. We can say that 8, 10, 15 rounds is \nenough, that you do not need 30 rounds in a magazine, you do not need \n100 rounds.\n  We can do something about our mental health system, try to reach out \nand give some help to people who are struggling, but we do not. That is \nwhat is so hard for the families of Newtown to understand. What is \nadditionally hard for them to understand is this number. Since those 28 \npeople were killed in Newtown on December 14, 5,033 people have died at \nthe hands of gun violence across this country. This chart is a couple \nof days old, so we can take down the 33 and add a handful more.\n  I hope people here have gotten to understand the stories of people \nsuch as Jack Pinto and Dylan Hockley, Grace McDonnell. I hope people \nhere have come to know the stories of the 20 little boys and girls whom \nwe will never know their greatness because they were cut down in their \nyouth.\n  But I wish to tell some other stories, about the common, everyday, \nalmost routine gun violence that for some reason we have decided to \nlive with in this country. So I am coming down here every week to tell \nanother handful of stories about victims. Today, instead of telling \ndetailed stories about specific victims, I wish to talk about one \nweekend in New York City.\n  About 2 weeks ago, the weekend of May 31 to June 2 was kind of the \nfirst truly warm outdoor weekend we had in the Northeast. The police, \nin places such as New York City and Bridgeport and Hartford, have come \nto dread that first real hot summer weekend because the summers tend to \ncome with a lot of guns and a lot of gun violence and a lot of \nshootings in places that maybe not a lot of Americans are used to, \nliving in the safety and security of their neighborhoods.\n  Let me tell you what happened on that one weekend in one city, New \nYork, NY. That weekend 25 people were shot over the course of 48 hours. \nSix people were killed over one single weekend in New York City. It \nstarted with Ivan Martinez, 21 years old, who was approached at about \n3:25 a.m. on Friday night by a 20-year-old gunman and a woman in the \nBronx. The gunman shot Martinez once in the head. Then he ran off with \nthe woman.\n  Over the course of the weekend, 12 people were shot in Brooklyn, 8 \npeople were shot in the Bronx, 4 in Queens. It went like this on Sunday \nnight: At 12:10 a.m., a 21-year-old man was shot in the leg; at 2:36 \na.m., a 22-year-old man was shot three times on East New York Avenue in \nBrooklyn; about an hour later at 3:30, a 20-year-old man was shot in \nthe leg at Bedford Park in the Bronx; at 4:12 a.m. that morning, a 35-\nyear-old man brought himself to Jamaica Hospital with a gunshot wound; \nat 11:40 a.m., a 15-year-old was shot in the leg and the back--at 11:40 \na.m., middle of the day on Sunday, a 15-year-old shot in the leg and \nthe back. At about 3:25, a gunman opened fire at the corner of Bedford \nand Lenox at Prospect-Lefferts Gardens.\n  The carnage in one weekend barely made news across this country. Most \npeople would not know it if I did not come down to the Senate floor and \ntell this story. That is what we have come to accept in this country. \nThis represents a dramatic drop in gun violence in New York City. So \nfar we have had 440 shootings in New York City. That is a 23-percent \nreduction from last year. This has been a good year in New York City, \nand 440 people have been shot.\n  We do nothing about it. We cannot even bring ourselves to say \ncriminals should not have guns, that gun trafficking, done out of the \nback of vans on the side streets of the Bronx and Brooklyn and Queens \nshould be a crime. We cannot even do that on the floor of the Senate.\n  That weekend, maybe the most tragic shooting was one that didn't end \nup in a death, and that was the shooting of a little girl named Tayloni \nMazyck.\n  Three men opened fire in a wild episode that weekend in Brooklyn. \nPeople said it sounded as though it was the 4th of July, so many \ngunshots were going off in this neighborhood. It was likely gang \nactivity, but the consequence of the shooting wasn't a gang member, it \nwas a little 11-year-old girl who was struck through her neck. The \nbullet lodged in her spine. Although Tayloni lived, she will never walk \nagain.\n  Listen, I grieve every single morning and every single night for the \n20 little girls and boys who died in Newtown, CT. If that is what has \nprompted us to\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nfinally have a serious discussion here on the floor of the House and \nthe Senate about gun violence reform, then so be it.\n  This is an average summer weekend in New York, with a little girl \ngetting paralyzed and shootings throughout Saturday and Sunday night. \nPeople are getting shot in the middle of broad daylight on a Sunday \nafternoon. We can do something about it. We don't have the power to \neliminate gun violence, we can't make bad people stop doing bad things, \nbut we can pass commonsense laws such as background checks to check if \ncriminals are getting guns or people with serious, dangerous mental \nillness. We can increase the resources of social workers and \npsychologists to try to reach some of these kids to try to teach them \nother ways of dealing with their anger than going in and reaching for a \ngun. We can lock up anybody who takes a bunch of guns from a gun show, \nthrows them into a sack and sells them to criminals on the streets of \nNew York, Bridgeport, Los Angeles, or Chicago.\n  We are not helpless. We have power in this place to do something \nabout the mass shootings in Newtown, the mass shootings in Santa \nMonica, and the 5,033 people who have died across this country since \nDecember 14, in the 6 months since. It is not too late. We have a \nchance to come back to this floor after immigration, perhaps after the \nsummer, let cooler heads prevail and allow this body to do something \nabout the scourge of gun violence that so far this place has had no \nanswer for. It causes the families of Newtown and the families of these \nvictims to leave this place shaking their heads.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4508-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4508-S4510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I earlier reported on some points in \nspeeches I had made about some of the promises from the Gang of 8 \nconcerning the legislation they have offered and why they are not \nfulfilled in their bill; for example, the triggers, and the merit-based \nmovement they claim is significant in their legislation. I believe both \nof those are inaccurate.\n  Today I wanted to point out how government officials are refusing to \nenforce our current law and the unease that causes all of us. This bill \ndoes not fix that problem but gives even more power and discretion to \nthe political appointees to waive, moderate, and get around the \nenforcement requirements of this new bill. These are the requirements \nof enforcement that our bill's sponsors say are important and must \nhappen, but the bill does not require it to happen in many different \nplaces.\n  The story I will be telling is effective to explain why, despite the \npleas from the American people for 30 years, lawlessness continues to \nrise in the immigration area and why we now have 11 million people here \nillegally.\n  Senator Durbin earlier made a reference to the DREAM Act that he has \nworked hard on. It does present, for the most part, some of the most \nsympathetic claims for some sort of legalization in the country. The \nreason Congress rejected his legislation is because it overreached, in \nmy opinion, which is not necessarily to say that it would have passed \nhad it been more narrowly drafted.\n  It did not pass, but the President of the United States did it \nanyway. The President of the United States just did it anyway. He \nissued a directive to Federal law enforcement officers: Don't enforce \nthis law, this law, and this law. Instead, do it as we tell you to.\n  That comes from the President to the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nto John Morton, and all the supervisors down to the officers.\n  Officers are up in arms about this. The ICE officers who enforce \nthese laws have voted no confidence in Mr. John Morton. Today Mr. \nMorton announced his resignation after quite a long time being the \ncenter of this controversy. ICE officers said they had no confidence in \nhim. He basically spent his time promoting amnesty, meeting with \nspecial-interest groups, not helping them do their job, and directing \nthem not to do what the law plainly required them to do. It put them in \nan untenable position of having to follow their boss's political \ndirection and violate their oath to follow the law.\n  Indeed, and amazingly, the law enforcement officers filed a lawsuit \nagainst Secretary Napolitano and Mr. Morton. They are claiming they are \nbeing forced to violate the law.\n  The judge has allowed this case to go forward, and it is being \nreviewed. It is in court right now. I never heard, as a federal \nprosecutor of nearly 15 years, of such a thing where the officers are \nsuing their supervisors who won't let them follow plain law. This is \nthe problem we are dealing with.\n  Over a year ago, as Senator Durbin mentioned earlier, the Obama \nadministration implemented a backdoor amnesty for an estimated 1.7 \nmillion, a Pew estimate, illegal immigrants through a program called \nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the DACA Program. It covers \naliens who entered the country illegally when they were under the age \nof 16 and not older than 31 as of June 15, 2012.\n  Congress dealt with legislation to that effect and rejected it. It \ndid not pass it. According to the published Department of Homeland \nSecurity guidelines, each DACA applicant is required to submit \nbiographic and biometric information along with other information to \nprove they are eligible for the program.\n  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, is to process \nthe applications. In a little under a year, USCIS has approved an \nastonishing 291,859 applicants. On May 20, Kevin Palinkas, president of \nthe National Citizenship and Immigration Service Council, the union \nrepresenting the 12,000 USCIS adjudication officers who were supposed \nto adjudicate these matters, issued a press release reporting ``a 99.5 \npercent approval rating for all illegal alien applications for legal \nstatus filed under the Obama administration's new deferred action for \nchildhood arrivals, DACA, policies.''\n\n  He reported a 99.5-percent approval. He attributed the exceptionally \nhigh approval rate to policies implemented by the Department of \nHomeland Security leadership that essentially made it impossible to \nmake any real effort to eliminate fraud or identify dangerous criminal \naliens.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       DHS and USCIS leadership have intentionally established an \n     application process for DACA applicants that bypasses \n     traditional in-person investigatory interviews with trained \n     USCIS adjudications officers. These practices were put in \n     place to stop proper screening and enforcement.\n\n  He is saying the new policies that eliminate the interviews ``were \nput in place to stop proper screening and enforcement, and guarantee \nthat applications will be rubber-stamped for approval, a practice that \nvirtually guarantees widespread fraud and places public safety at \nrisk.''\n  That is a pretty gutsy thing to say for a person who works in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security about his supervisors. I am sure he \ngave great thought to that.\n  This press statement goes on to say:\n\n       The attitude of USCIS management-- These are the political \n     appointees.\n       is not that the agency serves the American public or the \n     laws of the United States, or public safety and national \n     security, but instead that the agency serves illegal aliens \n     and the attorneys which represent them. While we believe in \n     treating all people with respect, we are concerned that this \n     agency tasked with such a vital security mission is too \n     greatly influenced by special interest groups--to the point \n     that it no longer properly performs its mission.\n\n  That is a strong statement. It should be something we listen to as we \nevaluate whether we need to give more discretion to these supervisors \nwhen we pass a new bill.\n  Mr. Palinkas sent a letter to Congress on June 5 of this year, a few \nweeks ago, reiterating his concerns in light of S. 744.\n  He wrote and said this bill ``would lead to the rubber-stamping of \nmillions of applications for both amnesty and future admissions, \nputting the public safety and the taxpayer at risk.''\n  He further stated:\n\n       In addition to the impossible time constraints imposed on \n     each and every adjudicator to complete our assigned \n     workloads, we are currently lacking the manpower, training, \n     and office space to accomplish our mission and achieve what \n     our jobs demand.\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\n     These challenges cry out for reconsideration of S. 744 in its \n     present form.\n\n  A few days ago, a report released by Judicial Watch revealed that \ndocuments obtained through the Freedom of Information Act confirm all \nof Mr. Palinkas' concerns. The documents reveal the administration has \nabandoned official background check procedures in order to keep up with \nthe hundreds of thousands of amnesty applications under the program.\n  For example, according to a September 17, 2012, e-mail from Associate \nRegional Director for Operations Gary Garman, field offices could \nexpect the benefits center to conduct just ``lean & light'' background \nchecks with only random samples of modified cases being sent to the \nfield for verification.\n  It goes on to say about the inadequacy of the applications submitted \nfor amnesty under the ``lean & light'' system, St. Paul Field Director \nSharon Cooley e-mailed staffers in October of last year with the \nfollowing observation:\n\n       As you are already aware the [applications] will not be as \n     complete and interview ready as we are used to seeing. This \n     is a temporary situation--I just can't tell you when \n     things will revert back to the way things used to be.\n\n  That is the kind of situation we are in today. Then, on November 9, \n2012, last November, the entire agency was directed to halt all \nbackground checks. It is unknown how long USCIS stopped conducting \nbackground checks, but apparently they did. They may still be approving \napplications without background checks.\n  We must conduct background checks to protect against public safety \nand national security threats. We can say that we want to move people \nout of the shadows, but if we don't complete the necessary background \nchecks, those who are criminals or terrorists would be out of the \nshadows, and hiding in broad daylight with the absolute protection of \nlegal immigration status. We should not transform them from the shadows \nto legal status without some sort of serious analysis of who they are, \nas the USCIS adjudicators and ICE officers tell us.\n  If nobody is checking, nobody is digging into it, then this will \nbecome a common thing. They will just submit some false documentation, \nnobody will look at it, and they are home free. That is not the way we \nshould be doing this. It is the kind of sliding, slipping away from \nreal enforcement that has helped put us in the fix we are in today.\n  This is troubling because the bill of the Gang of 8 gives Secretary \nNapolitano the discretion to determine the specifics of the amnesty \napplication process for the entire 11 million people who will be given \nlegal status in the country, including the responsibility or the \ndiscretion to determine the specific information required of the \napplicant; the form of the application, paper or electronic--and \nelectronic ought to be a big part of it because we can immediately \ncheck with the National Crime Information Center on criminal \nbackgrounds. It would be easier whether any applicant is actually going \nto be interviewed or not.\n  It also requires the Secretary to collect biometric, biographic, and \nother data the Secretary deems appropriate for use in conducting \n``national security and enforcement clearances,'' which is left \nundefined.\n  Knowing the administration is so determined to accelerate these other \nclearances, we can assume they would not be following strictly any of \nthe law as it would be passed. This is why our law enforcement officers \nare concerned about the bill. This is what is causing them angst.\n  If the administration does not currently do even minimum interviews \nunder the DACA Program they are not going to do it in the future when \nwe have 11 million people being cleared. These clearances should \ninclude checks against Federal and State law enforcement databases, \nboth biometric and biographic, including the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and FBI databases, the consolidated watch list, and \n``lookout,'' and the biometric immigration databases. They are there to \nidentify people who may be in violation of the law, have warrants out \nfor their arrest for murder, drug dealing, or robbery, and are on a \nterrorist watch list. That is why we have these systems.\n  I offered an amendment during the Judiciary Committee markup that \nwould have mandated those checks as well as allowed for electronic \nfiling of applications so that information could be easily checked \nagainst the law enforcement electronic data bases. It would have \nrequired in-person interviews where national security or public safety \nconcerns arise, not interviewing everybody--although we really probably \nshould interview everybody. But my amendment just said for those where \nnational security or public safety concerns arise.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary doesn't have to interview a \nsingle amnesty applicant. But my amendment was rejected. This is a \nquote from the bill's lead sponsor, Senator Schumer, when talking about \nrequiring such safeguards being unacceptable because they would ``slow \nthings down dramatically. It will be impossible--it could take a year, \n18 months, 2 years before this would be effectuated. We hope that most \nfolks could get in[to] within 6 months.''\n  So I would say this is the plan: We say we have an effective \nbackground check system for all those who are going to be applying to \nbe put on a guaranteed path to citizenship. We say to the American \npeople we have a system, while failing to require any of that in any \neffective way.\n  Mr. President, I don't know, do we have a time limit on these \nremarks? I see some of my colleagues here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  A quick turnaround of applications seems to be far more important to \nthe Gang of 8 than the issue of identifying people who may be a threat \nto public safety--criminals who may have warrants out for them and who \nmay have been arrested or served time for felonies. We need to know \nthat. They are not supposed to be given status if they have been \nconvicted of a felony.\n  This is despite what we learned from the 1986 amnesty. The failure to \nconduct adequate background checks in 1986 and vet for national \nsecurity threats enabled both criminals and terrorists to be legalized. \nA 2009 report by the Homeland Security Institute, prepared at the \nrequest of the USCIS Ombudsman in anticipation of immigration reform \nconcluded:\n\n       The potential volume of new cases generated by immigration \n     reform legislation could overwhelm USCIS capabilities and \n     capacities.\n\n  I think that is true. The report also warned:\n\n       It is important to recognize that every ineligible illegal \n     immigrant who comes across the border during the preparation \n     and implementation phases of any new legalization program \n     intending to apply for legal status entails yet another \n     possible fraudulent application for a limited number of \n     adjudicators to weed out.\n\n  In other words, we are going to have people coming right now--the \nimmigration flow has picked up dramatically--once they hear amnesty is \nafoot. If we don't have any ability to do the kind of fundamental \nchecking here, everybody will be successful and fraudulent applications \nwill be cleared in large numbers.\n  The bill does not require the Secretary to interview a single amnesty \napplicant, including those who might pose a national security risk. \nEven the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill mandated in-person \ninterviews, with terrorism concerns being one of the reasons. The 1986 \namnesty required face-to-face interviews, but no routine interviews are \nbeing conducted under the President's DACA Program--his amnesty for \nthose who came here as teenagers--and there is no reason to expect \nthere will be anything done in this program either, which is 22 times \nlarger.\n  Interviews are very important. Not interviewing applicants for \nadmission to the country facilitated the 9/11 hijackers, hundreds of \nterrorists who have entered the country since the 1990s, and most \nrecently was a contributing factor to the Boston Marathon terrorist \nattack. The 9/11 Commission concluded that:\n\n       There were opportunities to stop both World Trade Center \n     pilots in secondary interviews at the border. That did not \n     happen. We also know that not having a fifth man on the \n     Pennsylvania flight mattered as well. Al-Kahtani's turn-\n     around at Orlando International Airport after an extensive \n     secondary interview meant there were only four\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\n     hijackers on the flight headed for either the White House or \n     the Capitol. That plane was overrun by the passengers who \n     knew their plane was headed for disaster, and gave their \n     lives to stop the hijackers. This one secondary interview \n     prompted by two astute border inspectors in Orlando \n     determined how many hijackers the passengers had to fight on \n     Flight 93.\n\n  Press reports indicate that Boston bomber Tamarlan Tsarneav was \nwatchlisted, but because of a ``downgrade'' on the watchlist, he was \nnot placed in a secondary interview when he returned from six months in \nRussia in 2011. If Tsarneav had been interviewed, and even slightly \nquestioned about where he had been and why, knowing he was already \nwatchlisted, then he could well have been further interviewed by the \nFBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Because the bill does not require \nbasic checks, the bill will continue to allow terrorists and criminals \nto exploit weaknesses in our immigration system and use it to gain \nlegal status.\n  Indeed, the bill specifically permits the Secretary to streamline \napplications for adjustment of status of those who were recipients of \nthe administration's DACA initiative. In fact, in the Justice \nDepartment's brief recently filed in Crane v. Napolitano, in which ICE \nagents have sued DHS leadership over policies that they believe require \nthem to violate the law and their oath, the Obama administration made \nclear that it believes it ``inherently'' has almost unbridled \ndiscretion in the matter of immigration enforcement. It even argued \nthat the federal court has no jurisdiction to review or question DHS's \ndecisions. The court disagreed.\n  This bill surrenders to the executive branch's overreach. In fact, \nmany provisions inexplicably weaken the law with regard to future \nillegal immigration and we are going to talk more about that as this \ndebate continues. If this bill is going to secure the border and end \nillegal immigration ``once and for all'' as its sponsors say it will, \nthese provision that weaken law enforcement must be removed.\n  The American people rightly expect their government to enforce the \nlaws enacted by Congress and keep its promises. But given this \nadministration's refusal to enforce the laws currently on the books, \nthe American people have no reason to believe that the loopholes, \nwaivers and discretion granted to the administration will not be used, \nas they are being used now, to reduce enforcement and public safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss recent \nnational security leaks by a former NSA contractor by the name of \nEdward Snowden. His name is known now throughout the world. Some have \npraised Snowden as a hero and a whistleblower. I do not. Anyone who \nviolates their sworn oath to not disclose classified information and \nthen leaks national security documents that compromise our intelligence \noperations and harm our country's ability to prevent future terrorist \nattacks should neither be called a hero nor a whistleblower. What \nSnowden has done borders on treason, and I believe he should be \nprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret we have a serious trust deficit in \nthis country with the Federal Government. I understand the concerns and \nthe fears of my constituents and the American people relative to some \nof the things that have occurred here that lead them to question their \ntrust in their elected officials or in their government.\n  There has been a series of scandals over the past several months, \nincluding but not limited to the IRS targeting conservative groups, the \nactions of Attorney General Eric Holder, and the ever-changing \nresponses from this administration regarding the attacks on Americans \nin Benghazi. We still don't have the full story, and the narrative \nkeeps bouncing around with change after change after change. So I \nunderstand this distrust the American people have about anything that \ncomes out of Washington, DC.\n  A lot of this is being fueled by mischaracterizations and \nmisrepresentations in the media, grabbing onto whatever is said in the \nGuardian. Of course, the Guardian says, and people hear: This is what \nis happening to your country. This is what is happening with your \ngovernment. They are violating your civil rights and violating your \nprivacy. But none of us stand for that, nor will we stand for that. But \nin their rush to be the first to break the news of the NSA or other \nclassified programs, to break it first online or on the air, the media \nhas fueled this distrust of the American people by misrepresenting the \nfacts.\n  Contrary to what some news reports and other sources have said, let \nme say this for the record: The government is not and cannot \nindiscriminately listen in on any Americans' phone calls. It is not \ntargeting the e-mails of innocent Americans. It is not indiscriminately \ncollecting the content of their conversations. And it is not tracking \nthe location of innocent Americans through cell towers or their cell \nphones.\n  There are civil liberties and privacy protections built into this \nprogram that are now being released in great detail, and it is \nimportant the American people understand those and know what they are. \nWe have to understand this careful balancing act between protecting \nclassified methods and sources to the detriment of losing that \ninformation, losing lives, identifying sources, and compromising \nprograms, and the need to reassure the American people we are following \nthe law and following the constitutional right of Americans to privacy. \nAll of this has to be put in the right context.\n  As a side note, let me just simply say, Mr. President, that it is \nironic that a lot of American private companies seem to have more \ninformation about us than the government does. They may have a phone \nnumber, but many of the private companies know what we like to eat, \nwhere we shop, what we like to wear, what movies we order, where we \nlike to vacation, and we are flooded with marketing attempts to use the \ninformation they have collected against us.\n  But that is not what the NSA is doing under these programs and the \nprograms in question. These programs are in place solely for the \npurpose of detecting communications between terrorists who are \noperating outside of our country but communicating with operatives \npotentially within the United States.\n  The intelligence community neither has the time nor the inclination \nnor the authority to track people's Internet activity or pry into their \nprivate lives. Even if someone is suspected, by the way, of a phone \ncall match with a foreign terrorist and someone residing or living in \nAmerica and suspected of having a link to terrorism, the government can \ngo no further than the court to get an order to investigate any other \ninformation or material about them. And let's not forget why these \nprograms are there in the first place.\n  Following the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001, America realized \nit needed to greatly improve our intelligence efforts and \ncommunications among our agencies--we were facing a different kind of \nwar. This wasn't two States lining up against each other. This wasn't \naddressing wars from the past. This was a whole new way that enemies \nwere attacking Americans on our homeland. We needed to modernize our \napproach, and we needed to connect the dots before a terrorist attack \noccurred again at the level of 9/11 or others.\n  In fact, had these programs been available to NSA before that \nSeptember date, I believe we could have identified some or all of the \nhijackers. When one of the September 11 hijackers called a contact in \nYemen from San Diego, we could have identified them through this \nprogram. We could have prevented the terrorists from boarding those \nplanes and blowing up the World Trade Center, striking the Pentagon, \ncrashing into a field in Pennsylvania, and killing thousands of \nAmericans.\n  These programs connect the dots and have successfully thwarted dozens \nof terrorist attacks. They are some of the most effective tools \navailable to protect our country from terrorist organizations like al-\nQaida.\n  That is why I find it so troubling and, frankly, irresponsible for \nthe media and others to distort the nature of\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\nthese counterterrorism programs. These programs are legal, \nconstitutional, and utilized only under the strict oversight of both \nparties and all three branches of government, including a highly \nscrutinized judicial process. In the end, these programs rely on the \ntrust of the American people. And with that trust lacking today, I am \nasking my fellow Members of Congress, as well as the media, to fact-\ncheck first before mischaracterizing programs that save lives.\n  I believe we can--and we must--protect both security and liberty when \nit comes to counterterrorism efforts, and I believe these programs do \njust that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4511-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Luis Felipe Restrepo, \nof Pennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania and\n  Kenneth John Gonzales, of New Mexico, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nstrongly support the confirmation of Kenneth Gonzales for U.S. district \njudge for the District of New Mexico.\n  Mr. Gonzales is an exceptional nominee with an impressive range of \nlegal experience and expertise. He was unanimously confirmed by the \nSenate as the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico in 2010. But \nhe is more than just his resume, remarkable as it is. He is also an \ninspiring American story.\n  Mr. Gonzales grew up in the Pojoaque Valley in the northern part of \nour State. He was the first in his family to graduate from college. \nWith the help of scholarships and grants, he received his undergraduate \nand law degrees from the University of New Mexico, a school that I am \nproud to call my alma mater.\n  After graduating he was a law clerk to New Mexico Supreme Court \nJustice Joseph Baca, and he worked as a legislative assistant for \nSenator Jeff Bingaman.\n  He began his career as a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the District of New Mexico in 1999, prosecuting a wide range \nof Federal offenses, including narcotics and violent crime cases. He \nholds the rank of major as a judge advocate in the U.S. Army Reserve, \nwhich he joined in September 2001. He has provided critical legal \nassistance to hundreds of active and retired soldiers and spouses, both \nhere and overseas. In 2008 he was called to Active Duty as a part of \nOperation Enduring Freedom, where he was stationed at Fort Bragg and \nserved as a senior trial counsel.\n  Mr. Gonzales has been an exemplary U.S. attorney for the District of \nNew Mexico. He oversees a broad array of criminal and civil cases.\n  I would also like to note that he has made Indian Country a priority \nin the U.S. Attorney's Office, making a real difference in prosecuting \ncases of violence against native women and children.\n  Not surprisingly, his advice and counsel are highly valued. He serves \non the Attorney General's Advisory Committees on Native American \nIssues, on the Southwest Border and Immigration Issues, on the \nEnvironmental and Natural Resources Working Group, and is a member of \nthe Tenth Circuit Advisory Council.\n  He is also a member of the New Mexico Hispanic Bar Association. If \nconfirmed, he will join only 58 other Hispanic active district court \njudges--less than 10 percent of the country's 677 district court \njudgeships.\n  Mr. Gonzales is esteemed for his diverse experience, for his even \ntemperament, and for his integrity. From a young man dreaming of going \nto college, to his life in public service, his story is one of great \ndetermination and commitment. He has shown a reverence for and \ndedication to the law throughout his career.\n  I urge his confirmation. I know Ken Gonzales will serve New Mexico \nwell on the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nalso speak about the nomination of Kenneth Gonzales to be a Federal \ndistrict judge for the District of New Mexico.\n  Ken, as he is known back home to many of us, is truly a standout \nnominee. I wish I could take credit for his nomination, but that credit \nbelongs to our former U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman and to our senior \nSenator Tom Udall. But I want to thank both of them for putting forward \nsuch a great candidate for this position, and I am very pleased to be \nhere today to support him.\n  Ken has a long and distinguished record of public service, including \nmore than a decade of service in our military. Ken has served as the \nU.S. attorney for New Mexico since April 2010. His elevation to lead \nthat office followed more than a decade of service there as an \nassistant U.S. attorney. I would like to highlight at least one of his \nmany accomplishments that I find particularly important.\n  I think Ken's efforts as U.S. attorney demonstrate not only his \ncharacter and his intellect but the dedication that he has to serving \nhis home State and making it a better place for all our residents.\n  Much of New Mexico is Indian Country for which the U.S. attorney has \nthe responsibility to prosecute criminal activity. Ken has taken the \ninitiative to reorganize and focus the U.S. attorney's resources to \nmore effectively combat the higher-than-average rates of violent crime, \nsexual assault, and sexual abuse that have plagued Indian Country.\n  This includes creating the first Indian Country Crime Section within \nany U.S. Attorney Office. This section includes a team of lawyers \nresponsible for pursuing felony offenses on tribal lands. The office is \nalso collaborating with tribal prosecutors to investigate and prosecute \ndomestic violence in more than 20 pueblos and tribes located throughout \nthe State of New Mexico.\n  This is just one example of Ken's work, but throughout his career Ken \nhas shown a dedication to serving the people of New Mexico. It is the \nsum of all his efforts and accomplishments that make me believe he will \nmake an outstanding addition to the Federal bench, and I am pleased \nthat today we are at the final step toward getting him here.\n  The process for getting to the Federal bench is a long road to \ntravel. The Judiciary Committee's leadership from both sides of the \naisle takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that every nominee \nis fit to serve. I want to say a special thanks to Senator Leahy and \nSenator Grassley for working together and with Senator Udall and myself \nto get Ken through this process.\n  As the vetting process surely showed, Ken has the knowledge, \ntemperament, and integrity to serve on the Federal bench. I have no \ndoubt that he will distinguish himself there, as he has throughout his \nentire legal career.\n  I strongly support his nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to offer my full support for \nthe nomination of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo to serve as U.S. District \nJudge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Before I begin, I wish to take this opportunity to thank Chairman \nLeahy and Senator Grassley for helping facilitate Judge Restrepo's \nconfirmation\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nhearing and Leader Reid and Leader McConnell for their assistance in \nbringing his nomination to the Senate floor.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Casey for his collaboration in our \nbipartisan effort to fill Pennsylvania's judicial vacancies with \nexceptional candidates. Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years, we have worked \ntogether to identify and recommend eight candidates, seven of whom have \nbeen confirmed. The people of Pennsylvania value this bipartisan spirit \nand I am pleased our joint efforts have led to today's consideration of \nJudge Restrepo.\n  Judge Restrepo currently serves as a Federal magistrate judge for the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. A native \nof Columbia, he was raised in Northern Virginia and received his \ncitizenship in 1993. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, he \nwent on to earn his J.D. from Tulane School of Law.\n  Judge Restrepo brings a strong record as an attorney in both the \npublic and private sector, which helps explain why he merited a \nunanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. \nAfter working as a public defender, he then practiced law at the law \nfirm of Krasner & Restrepo, focusing on criminal defense and civil \nrights litigation. After 13 years in the private sector, Judge Restrepo \nwas selected to be a Federal magistrate judge and has served the public \nin this capacity for 7 years.\n  Aside from his legal duties, Judge Restrepo has devoted significant \ntime to his community. In addition to his involvement with the Make-A-\nWish Foundation, he established the Police/Barrio project, which \nfocuses on improving the relationship between the Police Department and \nLatino Community in Philadelphia.\n  I am very confident that Judge Restrepo's judicial experience, legal \nacumen, and dedication to public service will serve him well should he \nbe confirmed for the Federal bench. I am pleased to support this highly \nqualified nominee and I urge my colleagues to vote for his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask permission to speak for 3 minutes as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Congressman John Robert Lewis\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise proudly today to speak to a \nresolution that I have submitted in the Senate commending John Robert \nLewis, Congressman, from the city of Atlanta, civil rights leader in \nthe 1960s and 1950s, and my personal friend.\n  In 1954, I was 10 years old in the Atlanta public schools when Brown \nv. Board of Education was decided in the U.S. Supreme Court. John Lewis \nwas 4 years older than me. He was born just outside of Pike County, AL, \nand went to the Pike County, AL, segregated public school. He went on \nto Fisk University to get a degree in religion and philosophy and \nvolunteered for sit-ins in Nashville to break the first sit-in on lunch \ncounters in the history of that city.\n  This year marks the 50th anniversary of what is called the Big Six in \ncivil rights. As I am sure the Presiding Officer will remember, it was \n50 years ago this August that Martin Luther King led a march in \nWashington and gave his great speech, ``I Have a Dream'' at the Lincoln \nMemorial. There were six great civil rights leaders then. There is only \none left, and that is John Robert Lewis. He is my friend, he is my \ncompatriot, and our lives have paralleled each other all the way \nthrough.\n  John introduced me when I was first elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and I was honored for that introduction. This year I \njoined John on the 50th anniversary of the crossing of the Edmund \nPettus Bridge in Selma, AL, the historic march, the bloody march on \nBloody Sunday, which turned around the Voting Rights Act, saw to it \nthat every American got equal access to vote, and changed the history \nof our country.\n  It is an honor and a privilege for me to honor John today on this \n50th anniversary of the crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and honor \na career that has been dedicated to liberty and freedom for all \nAmericans.\n  John recently suffered the loss of his beautiful wife Lillian. She is \nsurvived by their son John Miles Lewis. John is a great leader to this \nday on the floor of the House, a great leader for the State of Georgia, \nand one with whom I am pleased to serve as Senator.\n  History has many heroes, as we all know--their pictures and their \ncarvings are all over this Capitol. But none is greater than one who \nhas sacrificed their life for the rights of others and for everyone to \nenjoy the same rights that everyone else in America has. John Lewis is \nsuch a person. I am honored to recognize him with this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield for the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on the question of nominations, I attended \nPresident Obama's announcement of the nomination to the DC Circuit a \ncouple of weeks ago. I have heard some of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side being very critical of the President for not sending \nnominations for judicial vacancies to the Senate, even though when he \nhas, some of them have held them up for 6 months to a year before they \nthen vote overwhelmingly for the person. They hold him up and then say: \nWhy don't you send more people? Frankly, a lot of people say: Why \nshould I spend 6 months or a year waiting while they hold me up? Now \nthe President has sent nominees for the multiple vacancies that \ncontinue on the DC Circuit. So the same Senators who are complaining \nthat he was not sending up nominees now say he is sending up too many. \nMy friends on the other side of the aisle are saying: You are not \nsending up enough, but you are sending up too many. I think maybe the \nAmerican people see the fallacy of that argument.\n  Having been unfairly criticized in connection with the nomination of \nJudge Srinivasan, with some Senate Republicans saying: Why didn't you \nget him up here earlier for a vote, even though Republicans had asked \nus to delay him, I have learned from that that when cooperating and \ndelaying at their request, I am going to get criticized for delaying, \nso going forward I will be making every effort to schedule prompt \nhearings for these impressive nominees, each of whom received the \nhighest possible rating of ``well qualified'' from the nonpartisan ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary. We have three people with \nthe highest possible rating.\n  The last time we had someone for the DC Circuit, even though \nRepublicans kept saying: Let's delay, keep delaying--and I did so at \ntheir request--and they criticized me for delaying, here we are and we \nare going forward with them.\n  Frankly, I voted for a lot of President Bush's nominees. In fact, I \nwould say I voted for 97 or 98 percent of all Republican nominees over \n38 years. I voted for more Republican judicial nominees than any \nRepublican presently in the Senate. There is no Republican in the \nSenate who has voted for more Republican nominees of Republican \nPresidents, nominees for judgeships, than I have. So I do not need a \nlecture about holding things up.\n  I have consulted with the ranking Republican on the committee and \ninformed him that I plan to notice the first hearing for July 10. That \ngives plenty of time for everybody to read all the nominee's materials. \nWe will be on vacation for the Fourth of July week; they can read it \nduring vacation. That will be 36 days since the nominations and on a \nslightly slower timeline than we followed for the more recent \nconfirmation of the nominee to the Eighth Circuit. I am delighted to \ninclude the nomination of Patricia Millett of Virginia, who should have \nbroad bipartisan support, in our July 10 confirmation hearing.\n  It is disappointing that the same Republican Senators who said during \nthe George W. Bush administration that the DC Circuit should have 11 \nfilled judgeships and who voted to confirm President Bush's nominees \nfor the 9th, 10th and 11th seats, now that there is a Democratic \nPresident of the United States in the White House, they say no,\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\nno, they should not be filled. It seems this President has to be \ntreated differently than the previous Presidents. I am not sure why the \ndifference, but that is what they want. It is disappointing as well \nthat Republican Senators I have helped fill circuit vacancies with \nnominees from their home states, over opposition from their own \nRepublican Senate caucus, are ready to tow their party's line when it \ncomes to the D.C. Circuit.\n  Following President Obama's reelection, Senate Republicans are even \nproposing to eliminate those D.C. Circuit judgeships legislatively. \nTheir claims of concern about the caseloads of the Second and Eleventh \nCircuits but not the most overburdened Ninth Circuit are difficult to \nreconcile with their votes for President Bush's D.C. Circuit nominees. \nAs one scholar at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution has said, this \n``fooled no one who was paying attention.''\n  I cannot help but wonder where Senate Republicans' concern about the \ncaseload of the Second Circuit was when they needlessly delayed the \nconfirmation of Gerard Lynch for three months; when they needlessly \ndelayed the confirmation of Raymond Lohier for seven months; when they \nneedlessly delayed the confirmation of Susan Carney for five months; \nwhen they unfairly stalled the nomination of Judge Robert Chatigny and \nthen needlessly delayed the confirmation of the next Connecticut \nnominee, Chris Droney, for four months; or when they needlessly delayed \nthe confirmation of Denny Chin for four months and forced the Majority \nLeader to file cloture to get a confirmation vote.\n  I wonder where their concern about the caseload of the Eleventh \nCircuit was when they needlessly delayed the confirmation of Beverly \nMartin for four months, or when they needlessly delayed the \nconfirmation of Adalberto Jordan for four months and forced a cloture \nvote before his confirmation. I am prepared to help alleviate concern \nabout the caseload of the Eleventh Circuit by scheduling a hearing on \nthe nomination of Jill Pryor, a ``well qualified'' nominee from Georgia \nto the Court, if her home State Senators would return their blue slips \nindicating that they do not object to her nomination going forward.\n  The American people are not fooled. Senate Republicans are now \nplaying by a different set of rules. Politifact has looked at their \nargument that President Obama is trying to ``pack'' the D.C. Circuit, \nand rated it ``false.'' It goes on to note that the Republican bill to \neliminate D.C. Circuit judgeships ``comes closer to the kind of \nstructural meddling typical of court packing than does Obama's \napproach.'' In the last 30 years, Republican presidents have appointed \n15 of the last 19 judges named to the D.C. Circuit. Now that these \nthree vacancies exist during a Democratic presidency, Senate \nRepublicans are trying to use legislation to lock in their partisan \nadvantage, and thwart the will of the American people, who elected \nBarack Obama. Even conservative columnist Byron York has tweeted: ``It \ndoesn't strike me as `packing' to nominate candidates to available \nseats.''\n  The Washington Post's ``Fact Checker'' blog has also looked at the \narguments about the D.C. Circuit's caseload that Senate Republicans are \nusing to justify their attempt to eliminate three seats on that court, \nand has judged them worthy of two ``Pinocchios,'' meaning: \n``Significant omissions and/or exaggerations. Some factual error may be \ninvolved but not necessarily. A politician can create a false, \nmisleading impression by playing with words and using legalistic \nlanguage that means little to ordinary people.''\n  Senate Republicans should know that their argument about the D.C. \nCircuit's caseload is misleading. While they claim expertise in the \nmatter because of a hearing they held in 1995, the fact is that their \ncurrent claims fly in the face of the actual testimony from that \nhearing. They are fond of citing the testimony of Judge Laurence \nSilberman, a Reagan appointee, that he felt the 12th seat was not \nnecessary. What Senate Republicans do not mention is that Judge \nSilberman believed that 11 judgeships was the proper number on that \nCircuit, and that the notion that the D.C. Circuit should have only \nnine judges was ``quite farfetched.'' Judge Silberman also said that \n``the unique nature of the D.C. Circuit's caseload'' means that it is \nnot directly comparable to the other circuit courts. Even though their \nown witness contradicted them, 18 years later Senate Republicans \ncontinue to make their partisan argument. In addition, we eliminated \nthat twelfth seat years ago.\n\n  In its April 5, 2013 letter, the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, chaired by Chief Justice John Roberts, sent us recommendations \n``based on our current caseload needs.'' They did not recommend \nstripping judgeships from the D.C. Circuit but stated that they should \ncontinue at 11. Three are currently vacant. According to the \nAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge for \nthe D.C. Circuit has actually increased by 46 percent since 2005, when \nthe Senate confirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the eleventh seat \non the D.C. Circuit. When the Senate confirmed Thomas Griffith--\nPresident Bush's nominee to the eleventh seat--in 2005, the \nconfirmation resulted in there being approximately 121 pending cases \nper active D.C. Circuit judge. According to the most recent data, there \nare currently 177 pending cases for each active judge on the D.C. \nCircuit, 46 percent higher.\n  Further, concerns about low caseloads did not bother Senate \nRepublicans voting this past February to confirm a Tenth Circuit \nnominee from Oklahoma, giving that Court the lowest number of pending \nappeals per active judge in the country. It did not bother Senate \nRepublicans voting this past April to confirm an Eighth Circuit nominee \nfrom Iowa, giving that Court the lowest number of pending appeals per \nactive judge in the country. Yes, lower than the D.C. Circuit. I do not \nrecall seeing any bills from Senate Republicans to eliminate the \nOklahoma and Iowa judgeships.\n  This falls into a pattern that we have seen from Senate Republicans \nover the past 20 years. While they had no problem adding a twelfth seat \nto the D.C. Circuit in 1984, and voting for President Reagan's and \nPresident George H.W. Bush's nominees for that seat, they suddenly \n``realized'' in 1995, when a Democrat served as President, that the \nCourt did not need that judge. Judge Merrick Garland was finally \nconfirmed in 1997 after President Clinton was reelected but Senate \nRepublicans would not act on his final two nominees to the D.C. \nCircuit.\n  In 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, the D.C. Circuit's \ncaseload had dropped to its lowest level in the last 20 years. During \nthat Republican administration, Senate Republicans had no problem \nvoting to confirm President Bush's nominees to the ninth, tenth and \neleventh seats. These are the same seats they wish to eliminate now \nthat Barack Obama is President, even though the Court's current \ncaseload is consistent with the average over the past 10 years. Even on \nits own terms, it is apparent that this argument has nothing to do with \ncaseload, and everything to do with who is President. When Senate \nRepublicans get serious about ensuring our Federal courts are \nadequately staffed, I am more than happy to work with them on a long-\noverdue judgeship bill. But this selective concern about the D.C. \nCircuit, and the fact that in 2008 the minority blocked a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on ``The Growing Need for Federal Judgeships,'' does \nnot reflect such seriousness.\n  I urge those Republicans who say first that the President is not \nmoving fast enough and then, when he does move, say he is moving too \nfast, to reconsider their approach, work with the President, and let's \nhave fair hearings on these three nominees and go forward with them. If \nwe do, I am confident we will agree that they are well-qualified \njudicial nominees.\n\n\n                   Restrepo and Gonzales Nominations\n\n  Last week the Senate failed to complete action on one of the three \nnominations pending for vacancies in the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. Even though Senate Democrats had expedited three of \nPresident Bush's nominees to that court, confirming them all by voice \nvote just 1 day after they had been reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senate Republicans refused to do the same for President \nObama's nominees. They refused even though all three had the bipartisan \nsupport of their home State Senators and the\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\nunanimous support of all Republicans on the Committee. Two were \nconfirmed last week but one was held back. After waiting 98 days for a \nvote, Judge Alejandro and Judge Schmehl were confirmed unanimously last \nweek. Today, after another unnecessary delay, the Senate will finally \nvote on the nomination of Judge Luis Restrepo, more than 100 days after \nhe was voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously. When the \nSenate is finally allowed to act, we will confirm a judge to fill a 4-\nyear vacancy.\n  The Eastern District of Pennsylvania is a court that needs judges. \nEven with today's vote, it will remain nearly 20 percent vacant. The \nSenate should be taking swift action to fill these kinds of vacancies, \nnot delaying for no good reason. This obstruction does a disservice to \nthe people of Pennsylvania, and to all Americans who depend on our \nFederal courts for justice.\n  I regret that I must correct the Record, again. The recent assertion \nby Senate Republicans that 99 percent of President Obama's nominees \nhave been confirmed is not accurate. President Obama has nominated 237 \nindividuals to be circuit or district judges, and 195 have been allowed \nto be confirmed by the Senate. That is 82 percent, not 99 percent. By \nway of comparison, at the same point in President Bush's second term, \nJune 17 of his fifth year in office, President Bush had nominated four \nfewer people, but had seen 215 of them confirmed, which is 20 more \nconfirmations. The truth is that 92 percent of President Bush's \njudicial nominees had been confirmed at the same point, 10 percentage \npoints more than have been allowed President Obama. That is an apples \nto apples comparison, and it demonstrates the undeniable fact that the \nSenate has confirmed a lower number and lower percentage of President \nObama's nominees than President Bush's nominees at the same time in \ntheir presidencies.\n  I noted at the end of last year, while Senate Republicans were \ninsisting on delaying confirmations of 15 judicial nominees that could \nand should have taken place then, that we would not likely be allowed \nto complete work on them until May. That was precisely the Republican \nplan. So when Senate Republicans now seek to claim credit for their \nconfirmations in President Obama's second term, they are inflating the \nconfirmation statistics. The truth is that only nine confirmations have \ntaken place this year that are not attributable to those nominations \nSenate Republicans held over from last year and that could and should \nhave taken place last year. To return to the baseball analogy, if a \nbaseball player goes 0-for-9, and then gets a hit, we do not say he is \nan all-star because he is batting 1.000 in his last at bat. We \nrecognize that he is just 1-for-10, and not a very good hitter. Nor \nwould a fair calculation of hits or home runs allow a player to credit \nthose that occurred in one game or season to the next because it would \nmake his stats look better.\n  If President Obama's nominees were receiving the same treatment as \nPresident Bush's, today's votes would bring us to 215 confirmations, \nnot 197, and vacancies would be far lower. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service has noted that it will require 31 more \ndistrict and circuit confirmations this year to match President Bush's \n5-year total. Even with the confirmations finally concluded during the \nfirst 6 months of this year, Senate Republicans have still not allowed \nPresident Obama to match the record of President Bush's first term. \nEven with an extra 6 months, we are still 10 confirmations behind where \nwe were at the end of 2004.\n  Luis Restrepo has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania since 2006. Prior to his appointment to the \nFederal bench, he was a founding partner of Krasner & Restrepo, a firm \nthat focused on civil rights and criminal defense work. He has also \nworked as an adjunct professor at Temple University, Beasley School of \nLaw and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Before co-founding \nhis own law firm, Judge Restrepo was an Assistant Federal Defender for \nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania, an Assistant Defender for the \nDefender Association of Philadelphia, and a Law Clerk for the ACLU's \nNational Prison Project. The nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary has unanimously rated Judge Restrepo ``well \nqualified.'' He is supported by both his home State Senators, Senator \nCasey and Senator Toomey.\n  Kenneth Gonzales has been the United States Attorney for the District \nof New Mexico since 2010. He served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in \nthat office for the previous 11 years. Prior to working with the U.S. \nAttorney's Office, Kenneth Gonzales spent 3 years as a Legislative \nAssistant to former Senator Jeff Bingaman and 2 years as law clerk to \nthe Honorable Joseph F. Baca of the New Mexico Supreme Court. He also \nserves in the United States Army Reserve as a Judge Advocate General. \nKenneth Gonzales has the support of his home State Senators, Senator \nTom Udall and Senator Martin Heinrich, and was reported unanimously \nfrom the Judiciary Committee 2 months ago.\n  I want the Senate to make real progress on filling judicial vacancies \nso that the American people have access to justice. In President Bush's \nfirst term, half of his consensus district nominees waited 18 days or \nfewer for a vote, so we know the Senate is capable of swift action on \nnominations. There is no reason consensus nominees like Judge Restrepo \nand Kenneth Gonzales should have to wait 2 or 3 months for a vote. The \nonly reason for these delays is because of Republican refusal to allow \nvotes. These nominees deserve better, and the American people deserve \nbetter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to vote for both judges \ntoday. But today I want to inform my fellow Senators and American \npeople regarding the facts on judicial nominations. Today, we will \nconfirm two more nominees. I would note that we confirmed two judges \njust 4 days ago.\n\n  After today, the Senate will have confirmed 197 lower court nominees; \nwe have defeated two. That is 197-2. That is an outstanding record. \nThat is a success rate of 99 percent.\n  And we have been doing that at a fast pace. During the last Congress \nwe confirmed more judges than any Congress since the 103rd Congress, \nwhich was 1993-94.\n  This year, the beginning of President Obama's second term, we have \nalready confirmed more judges than were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of President Bush's second term. Let me emphasize that again--We \nhave already confirmed more nominees this year than we did during the \nentirety of 2005, the first year of President Bush's second term.\n  After today, only five article III judges remain on the Executive \nCalendar--three district nominees and two Circuit nominees.\n  Two of those were reported out last week, two more about a month ago, \nand one has been on the calendar for about two months. Yet, somehow \nSenate Democrats cite this as evidence of obstructionism.\n  Compare that to the calendar of June 2004, when 30 judicial \nnominations were on the Calendar--10 Circuit and 20 District. In fact, \nfour of those were from Pennsylvania, as is one of our nominees today. \nI don't recall any Senate Democrats complaining about how many \nnominations were piling up on the calendar, nor do I remember \nprotestations from my colleagues on the other side that judicial \nnominees were moving too slowly.\n  Last week, when we confirmed two Pennsylvania judges, there were \nstatements made on the floor that we were treating President Obama's \nnominees very different than those of President Bush. But look at the \nrecord. As I said, there were four Pennsylvania nominees on the \ncalendar in June of 2004.\n  Gene Pratter was nominated in November 2003, had a hearing in the \nfollowing January, was reported in March, and was confirmed in June.\n  Lawrence Stengel was nominated in November 2003, had a hearing the \nfollowing February, was reported in March, and was confirmed in June.\n  Juan Sanchez was nominated in November, had a hearing the following \nFebruary, was reported in March, and was confirmed in June.\n  Those milestones are nearly identical to our Pennsylvania nominee \ntoday who was nominated last November. Just like the ones I mentioned, \nhe had a hearing the following February, was reported in March, and now \nwill be confirmed in June.\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\n  If we have been unfair to this nominee, as it is now claimed, where \nwas the outcry from Senate Democrats on the Bush nominees I just \ndescribed? The fact is there is no difference in how this President's \nnominees are being treated versus how President Bush's nominees were \ntreated.\n  Remember, now there are only five article III judicial nominees \nremaining after today's vote. Yet, as I mentioned, in June 2004 there \nwere 30 nominations pending on the calendar. Some of those nominees had \nbeen reported out more than a year earlier and most were pending for \nmonths. And some of them never got an up or down vote.\n  The bottom line is that the Senate is processing the President's \nnominees exceptionally fairly. President Obama certainly is being \ntreated more fairly in the beginning of his second term than Senate \nDemocrats treated President Bush in 2005. It is not clear to me how \nallowing more votes so far this year than President Bush got in an \nentire year amounts to ``unprecedented delays and obstruction.'' Yet, \nthat is the complaint we here over and over from the other side.\n  Last week it was stated that with this President, ``Republicans have \nnever let vacancies get below 72.''\n  After today's votes there will be 77 vacancies in the federal \njudiciary. But 52 of those spots are without a nominee. How is it the \nfault of the Republicans that the President has not sent 52 nominees to \nthe Committee? Obviously, common sense ought to tell you that we can't \nact on nominees who are not presented to the Senate.\n  Just one example will illustrate this. Last week the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee singled out the vacancies on the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania. We are confirming the third judge to that Court, after \nthe two last week. Four vacancies remain, but there are no nominees \npending in the Senate for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  It was also stated that the seat we are filling today has been vacant \nfor over 4 years, as if Republicans were to blame for that. The fact \nis, this seat went vacant on June 8, 2009. President Obama was the \nPresident then. He waited over 3 years and 5 months before making a \nnomination on November 27, 2012. Why did the President make the people \nof Pennsylvania wait so long? That wasn't the fault of this side of the \naisle. Yet now we are accused of obstruction.\n  So I just wanted to set the record straight--again--before we vote on \nthese nominees. I expect they will both be confirmed and I congratulate \nthem on their confirmations. And as I said at the beginning, I'm going \nto vote to support these nominees.\n  Kenneth John Gonzales is nominated to be United States District Court \nJudge for the District of New Mexico. Upon graduation from the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of Law in 1994, Mr. Gonzales clerked \nfor Chief Justice Joseph F. Baca of the New Mexico Supreme Court. In \n1996 he worked as a legislative assistant to Senator Jeff Bingaman. \nFrom 1999 to 2010, Mr. Gonzales served as an Assistant United States \nAttorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico. \nHis primary responsibility was criminal prosecution including large-\nscale drug trafficking cases with various Federal agencies and a small \nnumber of violent crime cases originating in the Mescalero Apache \nReservation. In 2006 Mr. Gonzales transferred to the Albuquerque \nViolent Crime Section where he prosecuted violent crime occurring on \nIndian Reservations as well as several bank robbery and firearms-\nrelated cases that originated in the Albuquerque area. In 2009 he \ntransferred to the Narcotics section as a designated attorney for the \nDepartment of Justice Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force where \nhis work was primarily long-term and complex narcotics trafficking \ninvestigations and prosecutions. In 2010 he became the United States \nAttorney for the District of New Mexico.\n  Since 2001 Mr. Gonzales has served as a Reserve officer with the \nUnited States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. In November 2008 he \nwas mobilized to active duty and stationed at Fort Bragg, NC with the \n18th Airborne Corps where he conducted legal reviews, official \nresponses to Freedom of Information Act requests, Army Regulation 15-6 \ninvestigations, and property accountability investigations. Currently \nhe fulfills his annual Reserve requirement as an Adjunct Professor of \nCriminal Law at the JAG Legal Center & School in Charlottesville, VA.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a ``Qualified'' rating.\n  Luis Felipe Restrepo is nominated to be United States District Court \nJudge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Restrepo received \nhis B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1989, and his J.D. from \nTulane University Law School in 1986. Upon graduation, he clerked at \nthe ACLU Prison Project in Washington, DC. From 1987 to 1990, he was an \nassistant defender with the Defender Association of Philadelphia where \nhe represented criminal defendants in State and Federal court. In 1990, \nhe became an assistant federal defender for the Federal Community \nDefender for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, appearing at the \ntrial and appellate level.\n  Judge Restrepo was in private practice with one partner from 1993-\n2006. There, he focused primarily on criminal defense, including some \ndeath penalty cases. He defended clients on retainer and as a court-\nappointed counsel. While in private practice the majority of Judge \nRestrepo's civil cases consisted of Section 1983 actions alleging \npolice abuse and mistreatment. Other civil matters included \nrepresentation in workplace accident, medical malpractice, wrongful \ndeath, and fire cases.\n  Judge Restrepo was appointed to be a United States Magistrate Judge \nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2006. As magistrate judge, \nhe manages all aspects of the pre-trial process in civil cases: \nconducting evidentiary hearings, ruling on non-dispositive motions, and \nmaking reports and recommendations regarding dispositive motions.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a ``Well Qualified'' rating.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am proud to stand here today as a \nresident of Georgia and its capital city Atlanta, which is the home of \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in America, a great \ninstitution with which Senator Brown and I are familiar. We want to \ntalk about some of its great achievements today.\n  CDC is the Nation's health protection agency, but it is really the \nworld's health protection agency. What CDC has done is build a strong \nnational public health and disease detection network for working with \nState and local agencies, private partners, universities, and \ncommunities to stop disease and stop outbreaks.\n  By way of example, CDC led a multi-State response to last year's \nfungal meningitis outbreak that resulted in 745 infections and 58 \ndeaths in 20 States. CDC identified and contained dangerous foodborne \npathogen outbreaks, such as hepatitis A found in frozen berry blend; \nsalmonella found in the poultry industry; and E. coli found in frozen \nfood products.\n  CDC puts science into action every day to protect the American \npeople, using breakthroughs such as microbial genomics to find \noutbreaks sooner, stop them earlier, and prevent them better in \nenvironmental hazards, biosecurity threats, and national disaster. CDC \nprovided direct support within hours of Superstorm Sandy to the \ndevastated northeast last year. We need to be able to be ready for this \nyear's hurricane system as it deals with other public threats.\n  The CDC provides crucial information on the status of health risks to \nthe American people. With data it helps determine the best options for \npreventing illness and reducing medical costs. At a time when the U.S. \nGovernment is not looked upon with a lot of favor by the American \npeople, I think it is very interesting to note that a recent Gallup \npoll identified the CDC as the most trusted Federal Government agency \nwith the American people. I think that is something to which we owe a \ntip of the hat.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank Senator Isakson. I am so appreciative of the work \nthe Senator has done with the Centers for Disease Control in his home \nState of Georgia. There is no Federal agency that is quite like the CDC \nin this country or across the world.\n  Our Nation's fiscal health cannot be strengthened at the expense of \nour Nation's public health. In the 21st century it is easy to overlook \nthis country's public health safety net. Too often we take for granted \nthat our children are not being crippled by polio or dying from \nwhooping cough because we have immunizations. We take for granted that \nwe have stronger teeth and less tooth decay because of water \nfluoridation in many of our communities. We take for granted that few \npeople in this country now die of infectious diseases such as cholera \nand tuberculosis because we have made the kind of remarkable progress \nwe have in sanitation, in hygiene, antibiotics, and disease \nsurveillance. We take these advancements for granted because for over \nsix decades the CDC has been doing an extraordinary job of ensuring \nAmericans have basic health protections.\n  The CDC's work, along with that of other public health advocates and \nresearchers, is credited with increasing the average American's life \nexpectancy over the last many decades, increasing the average \nAmerican's life expectancy by 25 years--25 years, a quarter of a \ncentury longer because of our investment in public health.\n  The CDC's reach and responsibility, as intimated by Senator Isakson, \nis not limited by our country's borders. Due to globalization it \nmatters a great deal how other countries respond to health threats. The \nCDC plays an essential role in helping its international partners react \nto these threats.\n  The CDC is the gold standard, the global leader in disease prevention \nand public health preparedness. Other nations follow our lead. Yet the \nCDC's leadership is not guaranteed. Even with its topnotch facilities \nand world-class staff, the CDC faces challenges to this continued \nleadership. The CDC's base budget authority is at its lowest level in a \ndecade.\n  The fiscal year 2013 budget is about $600 million below its fiscal \nyear 2012 level. This reduction undercuts the health security of all \nAmericans, even those who never once think of the existence of the \nCenters for Disease Control. The reduction in the CDC budget has \nharmful, immediate, and long-term consequences across the United States \nand around the world. This reduction affects the ability of our State \nand local health departments to provide on-the-ground services.\n  As my friend from Georgia explained during his discussion of the \ndeadly fungal meningitis outbreak, funding the CDC is critical to the \nfoundation of our public health. When we invest in CDC, we invest in \nthe health of families in Lorain, OH, and Cuyahoga Falls, OH. When we \ninvest in CDC, we support programs such as the Epidemiology Laboratory \nCapacity Program which addresses infectious disease threats.\n  When we invest in the CDC, we ensure that our State and local health \ndepartments on the frontlines are able to detect the first signs of \noutbreak. Without this critical funding, we leave ourselves vulnerable \nto the initial spread of health threats, such as fungal meningitis and \nemerging new diseases such as the MERS coronavirus and the novel H7N9 \navian flu virus, which we read about. Unfortunately, public health \ndepartments across the Nation have already lost thousands of jobs and \nwill lose more if our support of CDC continues to dwindle.\n  Before turning it back over to Senator Isakson, I would like to \nemphasize a point he made. The CDC responds to long-term health threats \nas well as to urgent immediate health dangers. These threats don't make \nthe headlines. So much of CDC's work you never hear about, you never \nread about\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\nbecause of its name, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nPrevention is such an important part of this. CDC continues a \nlongstanding tradition of working in partnership with many \ninternational organizations and global partners to ensure that our \ncountry takes the lead in stopping these threats.\n  I have had the pleasure of seeing CDC's dedicated, expert staff \nworking in Africa, in Atlanta, in communities such as Medina County, \nOH, and all over the world, working to keep these countries and our \ncommunities healthier, safer, and helping to keep all Americans safe as \nwell.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Would the Senator from Ohio yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ran a company for 20 years, and a healthy workforce \nthat was ready, willing, and able to go to work every single day made a \nbig difference.\n  A lot of times when we think of CDC, we think of outbreaks in Africa, \nwe think of ebola, and we think of salmonella. In fact, it is also an \nadvocate for wellness, better health habits, and health care for \nAmericans. Does the Senator think that is important for the \nproductivity of the American people and the American worker?\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from Georgia. I think that is exactly \nthe point. While perhaps those who know CDC--obviously in the State of \nGeorgia people know it more intimately than in my State. They more \nlikely think of CDC doing something in Africa or Asia, not so much what \nit means locally. We know that our hospitals, for instance, are \nsometimes havens for high health care costs and unnecessary illnesses \ndue to infections acquired in the hospital and antibiotic-resistant \nsuperbugs such as CRE--a family of germs with high levels of resistance \nto antibiotics. I wonder if my friend is familiar with CDC's work in \nthese areas and if he would expand on that.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate the focus on that. My friend from Ohio is \nexactly correct. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to our \nNation's health. Many bacteria become resistant to multiple classes of \nantibiotics.\n  I might add a personal note at this point. Three years ago I \ndeveloped a MRSA infection in a hospital in Atlanta and almost lost my \nlife to an antibiotic-resistant disease and infection. I know how \nimportant it is to have a research facility such as the CDC that can \nconstantly stay one step ahead of the evolution of defenses these \nmicrobes bring up themselves.\n  As a recent example, a recent outbreak of drug-resistant CRE where \none in two patients affected with bacteria unfortunately passed away--\nCDC must have resources to quickly track and stop outbreaks and give \nhealth care providers timely information. Without that, there is the \nrisk of contagion.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is certainly right. It seems there are new emerging \nand potentially dangerous health threats. We obviously know of the \ndisease--the acquired infection you just mentioned. We know now of the \nH7N9 bird flu and MERS. How does the Senator see CDC's unique role in \ntracking and attempting to prevent the spread of these threats before \nthey reach our shores, before we in American hospitals such as Grady \nMemorial or at MedCentral of Ohio might be victims of that?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Well, the Senator makes a great point because CDC is \nkind of the crucible where all the partners in health care in the \ncountry come together. You might remember when we were here on 9/11/01, \nshortly after the attack on the Trade Center in New York. Then the \nanthrax letters started to be mailed to Capitol Hill. It was CDC that \nwithin days tracked down the anthrax and helped us develop the defenses \nso we didn't have a problem with the anthrax infection. We got the \nCipro distributed to those who were exposed to keep them from \nsuccumbing to that disease. That is the kind of timely effort we need \nfor an agency like the CDC to be able to quickly respond.\n  Public health security is a component of our national security, as is \nevidenced by the anthrax case. With the potential threat of engineered \nbiological weapons, CDC remains vigilant and ready to act with experts \nand countermeasures to protect the American people. With emerging \ndiseases such as MERS and H7N9, CDC has sent CDC teams around the globe \nto investigate their origin, develop and ship laboratory diagnostic \nkits to the affected areas, and save lives day in and day out around \nthe world.\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator would yield for a moment, MERS was \nidentified recently, and CDC scientists developed and shipped a \ndiagnostic kit to be used in the field. To talk about one--when I talk \nto people about public health and certainly the importance of NIH but \nespecially the focus on public health by CDC, we talk about polio and \nwhat CDC did to address and not quite yet wipe out but in our country \ncertainly wipe out--and in most of the rest of the world--the polio \nvirus. Give us a little bit of history on how important that was and \nwhat we learned from that, if you would, Senator Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. When I grew up in the fifties, I remember taking the \nsugar cube, the anti-polio vaccine, the Jonas Salk vaccine, for the \nfirst time ever. Polio has been a dread disease that has affected the \nAmerican people and people around the world for many years, but now it \nis almost totally eradicated. Why? Because of a worldwide effort by \nmany organizations--not the least of which is the CDC--to see to it \nthat the inoculations are made available. In fact, polio now only \nresides in three countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. We are \nclose to closing the door and having a polio-free world, just as we are \ngetting closer and closer to eradicating measles, which now primarily \nstill has an outbreak in Nigeria.\n  CDC's readiness and ability to deploy at a moment's notice makes all \nthe difference in the world. I don't wish to sell here, but I have to \nmake one note. One of the reasons CDC is in Atlanta and that is such a \ngood location is they can be anywhere in the world in a matter of a day \nby the Hartsfield International Airport.\n  Not a day goes by but somewhere around the world a country or a \ncommunity calls and says: We need help. We have a problem. We don't \nknow what it is, but it has to be identified.\n  CDC scientists and doctors are put on the planes to fly around the \nworld to diagnose, identify, and provide the cure so the disease does \nnot become an outbreak that takes thousands of lives.\n  Mr. BROWN. I wish to close with a personal story about polio. My \nbrother, born in 1947--there are three of us, three boys. My brother is \nthe oldest, my brother Bob. When he was in about the first, second, or \nmaybe the third grade, my father, who was a local family physician in \nMansfield, was asked by--if not the CDC, some national health \norganization to give polio vaccines in Mansfield, OH. There were \ndoctors in other communities who were asked to do that. They chose my \nfather in part because he was a good doctor. They also chose him \nbecause he had son, he had a child who was in second or third or fourth \ngrade at the time.\n  People were afraid. They weren't sure about injecting that vaccine \ninto their arm because a lot of families thought that actually could \ncause polio. There was always that fear. Scientists didn't believe \nthat, but an awful lot of people did.\n  There was a picture on the front page of the Mansfield News Journal \nin the 1950s of my brother getting a polio vaccine. I believe his was \nSalk. Sabin came later with the cube. He got the Salk vaccine, \nadministered by my dad. CDC or one of the other public health groups--I \napologize, I don't know which--made sure that happened all over the \ncountry so people could be more reassured. That was really the \nbeginning, with Salk and then Sabin, of the eradication of polio in \nthis country.\n  It is hard to think back--the Presiding Officer is not old enough--\nSenator Isakson and I can remember with our parents the fear, until the \nend of the 1950s, of parents that their child would go swimming and \nmight come back, as Franklin Roosevelt did, with a case of polio. \nWhatever the causes, that virus spreading scared so many people.\n  In these days of hyper-partisanship consuming Washington, I \nappreciate the work of Senator Isakson, working together with CDC \nbecause this is far and above, far and away more important than any \nkinds of political differences that we might have.\n  I will let Senator Isakson close.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate very much the Senator's focus on CDC. I \nthink it is ironic that we close talking about Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt because in the 1940s, as our President, he\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\nsuffered from polio. He would take the train to Georgia to go down to \nWarm Springs to get the therapy of those warm springs, which then was \nthe only mechanism of treating polio.\n  Today in Georgia, because of the CDC, we have a mechanism of \neradicating polio. That is the type of evolution we want to see in \nhealth care not just for our country but for the world.\n  CDC is the best investment of American tax dollars we could possibly \nmake. I support it wholeheartedly, and I thank Senator Brown for his \nparticipation in the colloquy today.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, like many others, I am \ndeeply disturbed by the current situation in Syria, the appalling \natrocities, the tragic loss of life, the reported use of chemical \nweapons. This deserves the clear condemnation of the international \ncommunity.\n  I am also concerned by the push for intervention in this war, by the \nrush to judgment for the United States to yet again become entangled in \na civil war. The President has decided to send arms to the rebels to \nfight the government of the Bashar al-Asad. The full scope of this \nintervention is not yet clear, but this path is dangerous and \nunnecessary.\n  The Asad regime is cruel and corrupt. We can all agree on that point. \nMany of the groups fighting against him do not share our values and \ncould be worse. They may pose long-term risks to us and our allies. \nAsad's enemies may very well be America's enemies. The fact is that we \ndo not know. A number of experts, including our military brass, have \nsounded alarms warning that the options to intervene in Syria range \nfrom bad to worse and could prove damaging to America's strategic \ninterests. By flooding Syria with weapons, we risk arming those who \nultimately may seek to do us harm.\n  We have been down this road before. Recent history tells a cautionary \ntale. In the 1980s the United States supported a rebel insurgency to \nrepel the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Back then as now, many \nMembers of Congress pushed for arming these rebels. The United States \nsupplied weapons, intelligence, and training, with the goal to defeat \nthe Soviets in Afghanistan.\n  Our short-term victory had tragic consequences for the future. \nRadical members of the insurgency formed the Taliban regime, giving \nsafe haven to terrorist training camps, providing material support to \nOsama bin Laden and his fledgling al-Qaida movement. Through state-\nsponsored terrorism in Afghanistan, al-Qaida thrived and perpetrated \nattacks on the USS Cole and the World Trade Center on 9/11. The \naftermath has been more than a decade of war, with tragic loss of \nAmerican lives and treasure.\n\n  This is history to learn from, not repeat, and yet many who advocated \nfor previously disastrous Middle East interventions are leading the \ncharge to arm groups we know little about and to declare war through \nair strikes on another Middle Eastern country.\n  What little we do know about the Syrian rebels is extremely \ndisturbing. The opposition is fractured. Some are sympathetic to the \nenemies of the United States and our allies, including Israel and \nTurkey. There are reliable reports that some of the rebels even include \nIraqi Sunni insurgents--the same groups who killed many U.S. troops and \nstill target the current Iraqi Army and Government.\n  We know American law currently considers some of the rebel elements \nto be terrorist groups. The United States has designated one of the key \nopposition factions, the Nursa Front, as a terrorist organization for \nbeing an al-Qaida-affiliated group.\n  The Syrian opposition is very unorganized. They lack a chain of \ncommand, they are subject to deadly infighting, and if they are able to \ndefeat Asad, they may turn on each other or worse the United States or \nour allies.\n  Simply put, once we have introduced arms, neither we nor their \nfighters may be able to guarantee control over them. Such weapons could \nend up in the hands of groups and people who do not represent our \ninterests, possibly including terrorists who target the United States, \nour allies, such as Israel and Turkey, and the Iraqi Army and \nGovernment--an Iraq that we spent billions of dollars and thousands of \nAmerican lives to establish.\n  Given this reality, those who are pushing for military intervention \nshould answer three basic questions: Can arms be reasonably accounted \nfor and kept out of the hands of terrorists and extremist groups? Can \nthey assure us those arms will not become a threat to our regional \nallies and friends, including Israel, Turkey, and the Government of \nIraq? And if the answer to the two previous questions is no, can they \nthen explain why transferring our weapons to the rebels, whose members \nmay themselves be affiliated with terrorist and extremist groups, is a \nsensible option for the American people? What national interest does \nthis serve?\n  I do not believe those questions have been answered. I think the \nmajority of the American people agree. They do not see the \njustification of our intervention in this civil war. We need to slow \ndown this clamor for more weapons to Syria and war and take a step back \nfrom this plunge into very muddy and dangerous waters.\n  Stopping radicalism and protecting our allies is of vital importance; \nhowever, we come to the ultimate question, one that has not been \nadequately answered: Will this hasty march to intervene in another \nMiddle East conflict achieve these goals or will it ultimately harm the \ninterests of the United States, leading to yet another bloody, costly, \noverseas conflict and, ironically, worsening the terrorist threat?\n  We should listen to the lessons of history. After over a decade of \nwar overseas, now is not the time to arm an unorganized, unfamiliar, \nand unpredictable group of rebels. Now is not the time to rush headlong \ninto another Middle Eastern civil war. The winds of war are blowing yet \nagain, and we should be ever vigilant before we venture into another \nstorm.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4518-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 744\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, at every confirmation hearing of every \nCabinet position, and probably a lot of other positions as well, a \nCabinet nominee is invariable asked a question similar to this: Will \nyou come when you are called to a committee meeting for a hearing, and \nwill you answer inquiries made by members of the committee to certain \nquestions you might be asked? Invariably--and I don't know an exception \nto this--we get the answer that, yes, they will respond to our \ncommuniques.\n  Well, I come to the Senate today to ask why Secretary Napolitano of \nthe Department of Homeland Security hasn't answered inquiries we have \nmade that ought to have been answered by now. And the answers ought to \nhave been made by now because we are dealing with the legislation to \nwhich the questions refer.\n  On April 23, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing to discuss \nimmigration reform and the bill presented by the Gang of 8. Secretary \nNapolitano was the only witness. The hearing lasted 2 hours and 20 \nminutes, and most members were able to ask her 5 to 10 minutes' worth \nof questions. We also submitted questions for the record, which means \nwe submitted questions to her in writing for her to answer. Committee \nmembers were given just 24 hours to turn around those questions to \npresent to her. But it has been over 7 weeks--that is more than 49 \ndays--since we submitted those questions to Secretary Napolitano, and \nwe have yet to get answers to those questions.\n  The questions I asked were genuine and related to the implementation \nof the bill if it were to be signed into law. I asked questions of the \nSecretary because she will be responsible for carrying out Congress's \nintentions. I wanted to know about costs and feasibility, and I asked \nfor data and specifics. So I am concerned I have yet to receive \nresponses.\n  Keeping information from Congress and the American people is not \nhelpful to ensuring we have the best product coming out of the Senate. \nSince this bill is right now before the Senate, it is important for \nMembers of this body to have the answers to the questions I am going to \ndescribe that I submitted to her.\n  I will take this opportunity to discuss some of the questions I asked \nof Secretary Napolitano, although not all of them. Right now I will \nfocus on nine questions I asked about border security because border \nsecurity is an issue before the Senate as part of this 1,175-page bill. \nI may discuss other questions later in the week.\n  Question No. 1 to Secretary Napolitano: You have emphasized that \napprehensions at the border are down and in doing so praised the \nadministration's record on border security; however, Customs and Border \nProtection has just released numbers showing that apprehensions \nincreased 13 percent over the last year. Does the fact that border \napprehensions are up mean that the border is becoming less secure?\n  That was question No. 1 to Secretary Napolitano.\n  Obviously, is the border more secure or isn't the border more secure? \nThat was the whole basis of the debate over the last week in this body.\n  Question No. 2 to Secretary Napolitano: The bill only calls for \nestablishing an entry-exit system for air and seaports before \nimplementing the path to citizenship. Aside from cost, what impediments \nare there to instituting the system at land ports?\n  Question No. 3: The bill requires your department to establish a \nstrategy to identify where fencing should be deployed along the \nsouthern border. During the hearing, you indicated the administration \nbelieves that sufficient fencing is in place and that you would prefer \nnot to increase fencing along the southern border. So my question: Do \nyou anticipate that your study will call for any additional physical \nfencing?\n  Now that seems to me to be a pretty important question at this time \nwhen border security is very basic to whether there will be any \nlegalization. We have not received an answer yet.\n  Question No. 4: During the hearing we discussed the fact that the \nnorthern border was not part of the trigger and did not need to be \nsecured before green cards are distributed. You said the northern \nborder is a different border but that it is a part of the discussion. \nCan you elaborate? Can you describe how the northern border is \n``different''? Please provide a list of ``other than Canadians'' who \nhave crossed the northern border illegally in the last 10 years, \nincluding their country of origin.\n  Question No. 5. Section 1102 of S. 744 requires the Secretary to \nincrease the number of CBP officers by 3,500; however, it does not \nspecify how many of those agents will be used to secure the physical \nborder versus customs enforcement and other mission requirements. How \ndo you envision this section being implemented and how would the \nDepartment make decisions with regard to determining how many agents \nare hired to secure the physical borders?\n  Talking about border security, that seems to me to be a legitimate \nquestion that ought to have been answered by the Secretary a long time \nbefore we even started debate on this bill but surely before we get \ndone with it.\n  The sixth question: Section 1104 provides funding for only the Tucson \nsector of the southwest border region. Does the administration support \nonly resources to this sector? Are there other sectors that should be \nincluded? If so, please provide details.\n  Seventh question: Section 1105 relates solely to the State of \nArizona. Should this provision be expanded to all of the southwest \nborder States?\n  Question No. 8: Section 1107 provides for a grant program in which \nindividuals who reside or work in the border region and are ``at \ngreater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service'' \ncan apply to purchase phones with access to 911 and equipped with GPS. \nDoes the administration believe the Southwest border region is safe and \nsecure, rendering this grant program unnecessary?\n  Question No. 9, and my last question I will discuss tonight, does the \nadministration have any views on section 1111 on the use of force, \nincluding the requirement that the Department collaborate with the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the \nDepartment of Justice?\n  Those are the nine questions that I think are very pertinent to just \nthe part of the bill we spent the last week debating and we are going \nto spend a few more days debating. Is the border secure? That is very \nbasic to everything else that goes on in this piece of legislation.\n  As I said, the questions I have asked the Secretary are meant to \nensure that we pass the best bill possible. We ought to know how she \nwill carry out the bill if it is signed into law. I hope she will \nprovide answers to these and the other questions I submitted on April \n24.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, on June 12 and 13, 2013, I filed two \namendments, Nos. 1258 and 1282, to S. 744, the Border Security, \nEconomic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.

LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President. I am honored to join my fellow Senators \nas we remember our friend and colleague Senator Frank Lautenberg. A \ndedicated public servant, Frank proudly represented New Jersey almost \ncontinuously from 1982 until his death.\n  Long before reaching the Senate, Frank Lautenberg had proven himself \na patriot. Following his high school graduation, Frank enlisted in the \nArmy and served his country in Europe as a member of the Army Signal \nCorps during the Second World War. A member of the ``Greatest \nGeneration'' and the last World War II veteran to serve in the Senate, \nFrank was a true public servant.\n  Motivated by the desire to give back to the country that provided him \nwith so much, Frank's work in the Senate improved the lives of all \nAmericans and left a lasting impact on our Nation. Through his \nlegislative efforts, Senator Lautenberg helped to safeguard our \nNation's transportation infrastructure, increase access to quality \nhealthcare, and ensure that the brave men and women who serve our \ncountry today will have access to the same benefits and opportunities \nthat Frank frequently credited with his success.\n  Frank's strong moral character often made him a leader on some of the \nmost pressing issues of the day, and his efforts will undoubtedly leave \na lasting legacy. Having cast more than 9,000 votes on the floor--more \nthan any previous Senator from New Jersey--Frank played an influential \nrole in shaping important policies, directing funding, and helping \npeople in need.\n  On a personal note, I will always recall what a privilege it was to \ntravel to Israel and Turkey with Frank in 2009 as part of a \nCongressional delegation. I admired his strong support of Israel and he \nwill certainly be remembered as a tireless friend and advocate.\n  In closing, I am reminded of a quotation from President Kennedy. \nSenator Frank Lautenberg truly was ``someone who looks ahead and not \nbehind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone \nwho cares about the welfare of the people--their health, their housing, \ntheir schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil \nliberties.'' We will miss him in this Chamber but our country and our \nchildren have a brighter future because of his dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4520-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         CORNISH, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and \nhonor the town of Cornish, NH as it celebrates the 250th anniversary of \nits founding.\n  Established in 1763 and incorporated in 1765 by Colonial Gov. Benning \nWentworth, Cornish was named for Sir Samuel Cornish, a distinguished \nvice-admiral of the Royal Navy.\n  This area, located in Sullivan County, was once known as Mast Camp \nbecause it was the shipping point for the tall masts floated down the \nriver by the English for use by the Royal Navy. Forestry and \nagriculture continue to be important components of Cornish's economy \nand lifestyle.\n  Cornish is known as a summer resort for artists and writers. In 1885, \nsculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens sought a summer studio away from the \nheat of New York City and found himself in Cornish. Maxfield Parrish \nand other artists soon followed Saint-Gaudens, transforming the area \ninto a popular artists' colony. In 1964, Saint-Gaudens' home and studio \nwere named a national historic site. Famous authors Winston Churchill \nand J.D. Salinger wrote at homes in Cornish.\n  Cornish is home to four covered bridges, all of which are on the \nNational Register of Historic Places. The Cornish-Windsor Covered \nBridge built in 1866 is the longest two-span covered bridge in the \nworld. The Cornish-Windsor Covered Bridge has been designated a \nNational Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil \nEngineers and still carries daily automobile traffic.\n  Whether it is the Cornish Fair or a summer concert at Saint-Gaudens \nNational Historic Site, Cornish has contributed so much to the rich \nheritage of New Hampshire during its first 250 years. I am pleased to \njoin the citizens across New Hampshire in celebrating this special \nmilestone for the people of Cornish, whose accomplishments, love of \ncountry, and spirit of independence have enriched our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4520-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING QUEST AIRCRAFT\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, a cornerstone of the American \ndream has always been the belief that those individuals with a good \nidea and a strong work ethic can become successful. In these tough \neconomic times, it is inspiring to hear the stories of small businesses \nthat have risen above the challenges they have faced and are making \ntheir dreams come true. That is why during National Small Business \nWeek, I rise today to honor Quest Aircraft located in Sandpoint, ID\n  Quest Aircraft was founded in 2001 by Tom Hamilton and David \nVoetmann. These men saw the need for development of a plane that could \nbe used for humanitarian work in remote areas of the world. Tom and \nDavid brought on Bruce R. Kennedy to chair Quest's board of trustees. \nBruce was a man who had a noteworthy aviation career, holding the \npositions of chairman, chief executive officer, and president of Alaska \nAirlines. Bruce helped bring Tom Hamilton's and David Voetmann's vision \nto fruition, chairing Quest's board of trustees until his tragic death \nin 2007. That same year, Quest started its first production run of the \nKODIAK airplane.\n  The KODIAK airplane is a rugged short takeoff and landing, STOL, \nturboprop aircraft that requires only 1,000 feet of runway, making it \nideally suited for the demanding nature of global humanitarian work. \nThe KODIAK is currently in use around the world. While principally \nmarketed for humanitarian missions, purchasers of the KODIAK include \nthe U.S. Park Service, foreign governments, and private citizens.\n  Despite the impact the global recession has had on the airplane \nindustry, Quest Aircraft has persevered and expanded their company in \nrecent years. Quest Aircraft has expanded from a staff of 14 in 2001 to \ncurrently employing nearly 200 people. Shortly after the first year of \nbusiness, Quest Aircraft moved into its 27,000-square-foot facility at \nthe Sandpoint, ID, Municipal Airport. By May 2007, the KODIAK received \nFAA type certification and began global deliveries that year. Keeping \nin line with the mission put forward by the founders of Quest Aircraft, \napproximately every 10th plane produced is subsidized by the profits \nthe company brings in. This aircraft is then donated to a participating \nnot-for-profit humanitarian organization. This is testament to the good \nthat can be spread from a success story such as this, and serves as an \ninspiration to many who wish to find the successful intersection of \nhumanitarian work and financial success.\n  Small businesses like Quest Aircraft are on the cutting edge of \ntechnology and innovation. These businesses are often at the forefront \nof groundbreaking advances that provide much-needed solutions to the \nmarketplace. Small businesses are the economic engines of our economy \nand critical to the national economic recovery. I have faith in the \nmany small businesses that spring up in Idaho and around the United \nStates today, and success stories such as Quest Aircraft should serve \nas inspiration for the future generation of innovators and \nentrepreneurs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4520-5", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4520-S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4521-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4521-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13219 OF JUNE 26, 2001, WITH \n                 RESPECT TO THE WESTERN BALKANS--PM 13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to allow a \nveterinarian to transport and dispense controlled substances in the \nusual course of veterinary practice outside of the registered location; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Moran and \nKing in reintroducing the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act of 2013. \nThis legislation comes in response to a Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA, interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act, \nwhich requires veterinarians to treat animals with controlled \nsubstances at the location in which they are registered. This \ninterpretation of the law is very burdensome to both farmers and \nveterinarians, and it shows a lack of common sense by the DEA. In many \ncases a sick animal such as a horse, cow or pig cannot be transported \nto the veterinarian's office, and has to be treated on the farm or even \nin the pasture. When a larger animal is ill and needs treatment it has \nbeen common practice for the veterinarian to make a house call to treat \nthe affected animal. The ability for veterinarians to make house calls \nis a key component in the ability to effectively treat livestock \nanimals.\n  I am very concerned about the problems we face in the diversion of \ncontrolled substances especially powerful narcotics. However, efforts \nto control the diversion of controlled substances need to take into \naccount the needs of legitimate patients whether human or livestock. \nForcing a farmer to load a sick animal into a trailer for a trip to the \nveterinarian's office is not a practical solution to ward off the \ndiversion of controlled substances. Rules governing the use and \ntransportation of controlled substances must be practical and not \noverly burdensome. In the case of veterinary medicine the Veterinary \nMedicine Mobility Act of 2013 strikes the right balance.\n  This legislation allows a veterinarian to transport a controlled \nsubstance ``in the usual course of veterinary medicine practice at a \nsite other than the registrants registered principal place of business \nor professional practice.'' The bill also requires the veterinarian to \nonly dispense controlled substances in a State where they are licensed \nto practice veterinary medicine, which will help to eliminate the \ntransportation of controlled substances across State lines. I have \nheard from numerous veterinarians and other stakeholders that this bill \nis needed in order to provide certainty that our veterinarians will be \nable to use the necessary tools available to them without interference \nfrom the DEA. Overly burdensome regulations can have a detrimental \nimpact on businesses in this country. This is an instance of the \nFederal Government not using common sense, and causing unnecessary \nproblems for the people responsible for maintaining the health of our \nNation's livestock herds. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting \nthis commonsense bill.\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4524-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 172--DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEDNESDAY IN SEPTEMBER \n   2013 AS ``NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS DAY'' AND \n    RAISING AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE\n\n  Mr. BLUNT submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 172\n\n       Whereas National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day \n     will raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic \n     kidney disease, one of the most prevalent, life-threatening \n     genetic kidney diseases;\n       Whereas National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day \n     will also foster understanding of the impact polycystic \n     kidney disease has on patients and their families;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a progressive, genetic \n     disorder of the kidneys that causes damage to the kidneys and \n     the cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal \n     organ systems;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease has a devastating impact \n     on the health and finances of people of all ages, and equally \n     affects people of all races, genders, nationalities, \n     geographic locations, and income levels;\n       Whereas, of the people diagnosed with polycystic kidney \n     disease, approximately 10 percent have no family history of \n     the disease, with the disease developing as a spontaneous (or \n     new) mutation;\n       Whereas there is no treatment or cure for polycystic kidney \n     disease, which is one of the 4 leading causes of kidney \n     failure in the United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of patients with polycystic \n     kidney disease reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States as the largest segment of the population \n     of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', continues to age;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease instills in patients fear \n     of an unknown future with a life-threatening genetic disease \n     and apprehension over possible discrimination, including the \n     risk of losing their health and life insurance, their jobs, \n     and their chances for promotion;\n       Whereas countless friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause \n     many patients to live in denial and forego regular visits to \n     their physicians or avoid following good health management, \n     which would help avoid more severe complications when kidney \n     failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression and its resultant consequences of 7 times the \n     national average because of their anxiety over pain, \n     suffering, and premature death; and\n       Whereas the PKD Foundation and its more than 60 volunteer \n     chapters around the United States are dedicated to conducting \n     research to find treatments and a cure for polycystic kidney \n     disease, fostering public awareness and understanding of the \n     disease, educating patients and their families about the \n     disease to improve their treatment and care, and providing \n     support and encouraging people to become organ donors, \n     including by sponsoring the annual ``Walk for PKD'' to raise \n     funds for polycystic kidney disease research, education, \n     advocacy, and awareness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the first Wednesday in September 2013 as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Day to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research to find a \n     cure for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages all people in the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Awareness Day through appropriate ceremonies and activities \n     to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease and \n     to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/17/senate-section/article/S4524-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1287.
