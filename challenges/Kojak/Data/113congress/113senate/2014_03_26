I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 333.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 333, H.R. 3979, a bill to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that \n     emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as \n     employees under the shared responsibility requirements \n     contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Iowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           The Guest Chaplain\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the majority leader yielding.\n  It has been a tradition in the U.S. Senate--usually this time of the \nyear, when various veterans organizations come to Washington, DC, to \ntestify for their membership before Congress about issues dealing with \nthe veterans of all of our wars--for a person who is chaplain to be \nguest Chaplain. This year it is my privilege that person for the \nAmerican Legion be from the State of Iowa.\n  We have just heard Dr. Daniel A. McClure give his prayer this \nmorning.\n  Dr. McClure is a veteran of over 40 years' military service with the \nU.S. Army, Army Reserve, Air Force and National Guard. He retired from \nthe military in 2005. With Vietnam veteran status, he joined the \nAmerican Legion in 2001 and has since served as post chaplain, district \nchaplain, department chaplain, oratorical contest judge, and district \nchairman of the Americanism Commission and Boys State counselor. He is \na member of The American Legion Leon Beatty Post 29 in Washington, IA.\n  Dr. McClure was ordained by the Heritage Baptist Church, Lakeland, \nFL, in 1979 and has pastored churches in Washington State, Montana, \nFlorida and Iowa. He earned his doctorate at Luther Rice Seminary, \nLithonia, GA in 1993. Though he retired from formal duties in 1999, \nMcClure continues to volunteer in all aspects of the ministry.\n  Dr. McClure currently serves his country and community in a number of \ncapacities. He is president and treasurer of the All Veterans \nAssociation, treasurer of the House of Heroes, board chairman of the \nTree of Life Free Clinic, a patron of NRA, past president of the local \nCommunity Chest, past president of Kiwanis, works with the Lake Darling \nYouth Center and is chairman of 1st Baptist Church's deacon board in \nYarmouth, IA.\n  Dr. McClure and his wife Marge have been married 48 years, raising a \nson and a daughter. The McClures are now the grandparents of three boys \nand one girl.\n  I am glad to have the privilege of an Iowan serving as the national \nchaplain of a great veterans organization--the American Legion.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 11 a.m., with the Republicans controlling the first half and the \nmajority the final half.\n\n[[Page S1742]]\n\n  Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive \nsession. At 11 a.m. there will be a series of votes on U.S. District \nCourt judges. We will have four votes before lunch, and we will have \nfour more votes, or thereabout, starting at 2:30 on confirmation of \nthese nominations.\n  We will debate the Ukraine bill during today's session and vote on \nthat legislation tomorrow.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 2157\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 2157 is at the desk and due for a second \nreading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2157) to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the \n     Social Security Act to repeal the Medicare sustainable growth \n     rate and to improve Medicare and Medicaid payments, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I object to any further proceedings at this time on this \nlegislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed upon the calendar.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate took a step in the right \ndirection yesterday. In response to Russia's destabilizing actions in \nUkraine, my colleagues and I came to an agreement to vote on the \nbipartisan Senate foreign relations bill tomorrow. This important \nmeasure not only aids Ukraine but it also punishes President Putin and \nhis cronies for their unlawful aggression. It also sends this message \nto the world: We, the American people, stand with Ukraine.\n  I was happy to hear yesterday the assistant Republican leader--the \nwhip--the senior Senator from Texas, talk about the need to do more. \nAnd I agree; we need to do more. I, of course, was a fan--as was \nSenator Menendez, the chair of the committee; the ranking member, \nSenator Corker; and our senior policy mentor around here, Senator \nMcCain--of having IMF funding. So I hope we can move beyond what we are \ngoing to do tomorrow for the Ukrainian people. Based on what I heard on \nthe Sunday shows, I believe we have bipartisan support to do more for \nUkraine, so I invite my friend, the senior Senator from Texas, to work \nwith Democrats to come up with a package of things we can do in the \nnext few weeks to give the people of Ukraine the understanding and the \nbasis for the fact that America will stand with them.\n  What President Putin did is wrong. It is a violation of international \nlaw. I think it is too bad he is homesick over the Soviet Union. He is \none of the few who looks back with joy at what took place to build the \nSoviet Union. Tens of millions of Russians were killed--purposely--by \nthe viciousness of the leaders prior to Putin. So let us hope he does \nnot look back on all that as being good. We all know he was part of the \nKGB and we would hope he would return to having Russia become a \ncivilized nation rather than what the Soviet Union used to be.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. President, as the Senate finishes its work on the Ukrainian \nissue, we will soon have the opportunity to show millions of American \nfamilies that we also stand by them. It is my sincere hope the \nbipartisan progress we have just made on the Ukraine legislation will \nalso carry us over to work on unemployment insurance. Certainly we have \na bipartisan bill that we have been working on for a long time.\n  President Lyndon Johnson once said:\n\n       The duty of government is to help people who are caught in \n     the tentacles of circumstance.\n\n  That is certainly what we have in Nevada with 26,000 people. Around \nthe country more than 2 million people are caught in the circumstance \nof having lost their job--usually these people are a little bit above \n50--and because of the recession they can't find a job. So they need \nhelp, and that is what this legislation is all about.\n  In our country today you will find no greater example of people at \nthe mercy of unfortunate circumstances than the long-term unemployed. \nIn the 3 months since the Republicans first filibustered a bill to \nrestore emergency benefits, more than 1 million Americans have lost \ntheir benefits. Considering that in the time that was wasted by our \nRepublican filibuster, almost 1 million people in America, in dire need \nof help, have been told that no help is coming, we are here to deliver \na message on a bipartisan basis that help is coming. For people who \nhave worked hard all their lives, worrying about how to pay their rent, \nput gas in the car, and buy groceries while they search for a new job \ncan be demoralizing, especially when they see nothing good over the \nhorizon. For the long-term unemployed, losing a $300-per-week \nemployment benefit can be the difference between keeping a roof over \ntheir children's heads and, as we have heard--because I have read into \nthe record on a number of occasions letters from Nevadans saying they \nare going to become homeless--going out of business as a family, \nliterally.\n  Here is what one Nevada man wrote to me this month as he begged us to \nact. His wife had been out of work for months. With resources scarce, \nthe family will be forced to choose between paying their rent or paying \nfor cancer treatments for their 2-year-old son. But here is what he \nwrote:\n\n       We keep praying you will do everything in your power to \n     bring back emergency benefits to help us in our most \n     difficult time.\n\n  This man, and millions of Americans just like him, have waited too \nlong for action. But the Senate has another opportunity to do our job \nand help those struggling Americans. In the upcoming days the Senate \nwill consider an agreement, negotiated in good faith by a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators, including my colleague from Nevada Senator Heller. \nThis agreement will restore benefits to millions of long-term \nunemployed Americans looking for work.\n  I urge all my colleagues to put philosophical differences aside and \nhelp struggling families get the support they need and deserve. All we \nhave to do is work together, Democrats and Republicans, to do what is \nright for our constituents in their hour of need.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Rochelle Eubanks\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, here on the Senate floor we often speak \nabout numbers of great magnitude. Whether we are speaking of the \nnational debt, jobs, or tax dollars, the numbers can be in the \nthousands, millions, or even billions. Sometimes these numbers are \nenough to numb even the most policy minded to the sheer volume and \namount of people and resources that go into running the Nation's \nCapital City.\n  Today, as I bid farewell to Rochelle Eubanks, a diligent, beloved, \nand loyal staffer for 25 years, there is one number in particular I \nwant to bring to my colleagues' attention. That number is 1,807,181.\n  For a quarter of a century, Rochelle has been the backbone of my \noffice, in charge of the one critical task that all of us honored \nenough to be elected to Congress are charged with: to listen, to \nrespond to, and to act on behalf of our constituents.\n  First as my correspondence mail system, or CMS, operator; and since \n1994, as my CMS production manager, Rochelle has been at the front \nlines of communicating with Kentuckians. CMS is the computerized system \nSenate offices use to keep track of their letters to constituents. And \nthat number--1,807,181--is the number of letters to the Bluegrass State \nRochelle has sent out in her 25 years of service.\n  It is truly remarkable. If every letter were to go to a different \nperson, then Rochelle has mailed a letter to nearly half the State. No \none else on my staff has had more contact with the voters back home \nthan she has. After her retirement on April 4, she will be very much \nmissed by myself and by all of her colleagues in my office.\n  Rochelle started back in March of 1989. But her Senate service \nextends back to April of 1982, when she began work as a mail manager \nfor the Republican Conference. She also worked with Senators John East \nand Jim Broyhill, both of North Carolina, before moving to the House \nside in 1987. I am very glad we were able to lure her back over to the \nSenate side to work in my office beginning in 1989.\n  Most staff offices have two or three staffers working on CMS. But for \nthe majority of her tenure with my office, Rochelle has handled CMS \nduties on her own. How in the world does she do it? Well, ``I just do \nwhat I do,'' Rochelle says, in her usual modest fashion. Perhaps the \nkey to how she does it\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n\nis that Rochelle is always the first to arrive in the office, often by \n5:30 in the morning. I know for a fact Rochelle can be counted on as \nthe first to arrive at work, because I can recall a time or two when \nshe had to let me in my own office.\n  I knew I could always count on, as I have called her, the early bird. \nIn fact, that is how I introduced Rochelle to my wife Elaine: This is \nmy early bird. Rochelle could always be counted on to be there.\n  Because of her long tenure, Rochelle has become almost a den mother \nof sorts to many of the younger staff members and interns in my office. \nRochelle has been with us in three different office locations, all in \nthe Russell Building, and every time her desk has been located near the \nmailroom and the office interns.\n  When new interns or mailroom staffers start their first day, they \nalready know who is looking out for them. ``You must be Rochelle,'' \nmany have been heard to say. ``I've heard so much about you.''\n  One of my longtime staffers who worked with Rochelle for nearly 20 \nyears remembers her fondly.\n\n       She interacted with me the same day I came as a staff \n     assistant, to the day I left as chief of staff. It was the \n     same way she treated everybody. It didn't matter if you were \n     a senator or an intern. She was always sweet and pleasant and \n     positive.\n\n  Another longtime staffer recalls:\n\n       Rochelle has long been the master of mass mail. Regardless \n     of how many bins I brought her, she always had a bright \n     smile, a kind word, a listening ear, and a delightful laugh. \n     All the things that make a colleague a dear friend--that's \n     what Rochelle is truly the master of.\n\n  Yet another former longtime time staffer says in tribute to her:\n\n       Rochelle . . . you were always the sounding board, the \n     moral compass and the reality check for the people you worked \n     with, some of whom you may have forgotten, but who will \n     always count you as a friend. And while your work over the \n     years was excellent, please know that those you have worked \n     with will remember you for much more.\n\n  The fidelity and loyalty Rochelle has shown to my office is exceeded \nonly by her fidelity and loyalty to her family. Rochelle has two \ndaughters: Rochelle and Endyia, and six granddaughters: Nyla, Jermany, \nAlbany, Liberti, Milini, and little Marlei, who was born just this \nMarch 9.\n  Everyone in the office knows how cute Rochelle's granddaughters are \nbecause she proudly displays several pictures of them at her desk. Some \nformer staffers recall years ago when Rochelle would occasionally bring \nher then-school-aged daughters into the office and they would show off \ntheir cartwheels. The tradition continues today with Rochelle's \ngranddaughters. ``Granny, can we come work with you?'' they ask.\n  Family is also the reason that after 25 years, Rochelle is taking her \nwell-earned retirement and moving into the next phase of her life. I \nwas thrilled to learn Rochelle will be marrying her fiance Kevin Perry. \nThey will soon be moving to New York. Of course, she will be missed by \nher family here in the District as well as by everyone in the McConnell \noffice, but our loss is Mr. Perry's gain, and I wish the two of them \ngreat happiness in their marriage.\n  Kevin is a professional musician who plays the guitar, and his genre \nof choice is R and funk music. He and Rochelle have known each other \nsince high school and after 30 years recently reconnected. Now they are \nback in each other's lives and looking forward to starting a new life \nin Queens--``not Manhattan,'' as Rochelle is quick to point out.\n  Rochelle is a native Washingtonian, and of course Rochelle's \ndaughters, granddaughters, and other family here will miss her \nterribly, but Rochelle is reassuring. ``I'm only 4 hours away. And \nwe'll do a lot of Skype,'' she says. ``They don't want me to stop \n[working] and they don't want me to leave DC. But I'm ready for a \nchange.''\n  Quite a change it will be. It is hard to imagine the McConnell office \nwithout Rochelle. She is the fourth longest serving staffer in the \nhistory of my office. When she retires next Friday, she will have 9,140 \ndays of continuous service. In fact, the three longest serving staffers \nstill in my office are all women who have more than 25 years of service \neach; field assistant Sue Tharp, archivist Nan Mosher, and Rochelle.\n  For Rochelle it all comes down to family--her own family and the \nMcConnell family which she has formed and grown close to in her time \nwith us. So it is fitting that she is retiring to start a new chapter \nwith her family.\n  ``It's a very close-knit office,'' Rochelle says of her tenure. \n``Everybody cares. Everybody helps each other out.'' I am glad Rochelle \nfeels that way, and I couldn't agree more.\n  Another longtime staffer and longtime friend of Rochelle's sums up \nthe special place she holds in our hearts this way:\n\n       For Rochelle, it comes down to family. To her, that's the \n     unifier. My nephew is 20 years old; she still asks what he's \n     up to. She's that way with everybody. She's the glue.\n\n  Now the McConnell office is going to have to soldier on without the \nvital glue Rochelle Eubanks has provided for 25 years. It is a great \nloss not only for us but for the people of Kentucky--for all of my \nconstituents she reached out to, for the recipients of 1,807,181 \nletters, each letter representing a vital link between them and their \nelected representative.\n  So farewell, Rochelle, my friend, and thank you ever so much for two \nand one-half decades of tireless service. It is going to be a very \ndifferent office without your welcoming smile and easy laugh.\n  Congratulations and best wishes on your marriage and the wonderful \nnew life you will begin with your husband. You certainly deserve every \nhappiness.\n  It would be such a remarkable turn of events and a genuine pleasure \nto receive a letter from you for a change. I would even settle for a \npostcard. I hope you will send us one from New York.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to start by acknowledging the majority leader's \ndecision to remove extraneous IMF provisions from the Ukraine bill. As \nI noted yesterday, no legislation could have passed with those \nprovisions included. So I think it is a positive step forward. We are \nglad he took our advice, and now Congress will be able to pass an \neffective bill on Ukraine very soon.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, President Obama and his Washington Democratic allies \nare well into their sixth year of presiding over our economy. Yet the \njobs recovery they keep promising us just never seems to materialize.\n  We have to give Washington Democrats at least some credit though. \nThey have tried regulating, taxing, spending, stimulating, just about \neverything their ideology will allow. The problem is their ideology \njust simply doesn't work. Many of their policies just end up making \nthings worse. Of course, the best example is ObamaCare.\n  They promised the Sun and the Moon to sell this thing. They said it \nwould create jobs. They also said it would improve the economy, lower \npremiums, insure the uninsured, without causing Americans to lose their \ninsurance, their doctors or their hospitals--the kind of claims which \nwould have made Billy Mays blush.\n  But now Americans know better. Evidence shows that not only will \nObamaCare encourage less job creation, but it is also making the \neconomy worse, that it is driving premiums higher, and it will not come \nanywhere near insuring all the uninsured, while causing millions of \nAmericans to lose the insurance and the doctors they were promised they \ncould keep.\n  It is also a law which is unraveling before our very eyes. As we read \nthis week, the administration has now handed out so many waivers, \nspecial favors, and exemptions to help out Democrats politically that \nthe heart of the law--the individual mandate--may actually no longer \neven be viable. It has basically become the legal equivalent of Swiss \ncheese.\n  There is a broader point. If Washington Democrats think ObamaCare is \nso bad they need to exempt that many people from its mandates, then why \nshouldn't we remove the hardship for everyone? Doesn't the middle class \ndeserve a break too?\n  Why shouldn't we repeal the 30-hour workweek created by ObamaCare, \nthe provision which reduces take-home pay for the middle class.\n  Why shouldn't we do away with ObamaCare's job-killing medical device \ntax, something even many Democrats would vote to abolish if the \nmajority leader would allow the vote.\n  What I am saying is if Washington Democrats are actually serious \nabout\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\njob creation, then it is time to actually show it. Work with us to \neliminate the things that hurt jobs, that hold Americans back from a \nreal recovery--such as these job-killing ObamaCare mandates--and work \nwith us to enact things which can actually create jobs.\n  Approving the Keystone Pipeline would create thousands of jobs right \naway. Passing trade legislation--legislation President Obama has \nalready endorsed--would help create even more, but Washington Democrats \nneed to work collaboratively with us to make those things happen. Yet \nthis morning's New York Times highlights their strategy for the rest of \nthe year. Here it is summed up in three words, ``political show \nvotes.''\n  Get this.

Madam President, this past Sunday was the fourth \nanniversary of President Obama's health care law.\n  Four years ago Democrats in Washington were confident the law they \nforced through Congress would be extremely popular today. Instead, the \nlaw has broken almost every significant promise President Obama made \nabout the law itself, and Americans regrettably have been left to deal \nwith the consequences.\n  The actual law doesn't even look the same as it did 4 years ago \nbecause President Obama has lawlessly rewritten so much of it. Last \nnight word leaked about the latest change. Now the administration is \ngetting rid of the March 31 deadline for some people to sign up for \ninsurance in the government exchange.\n  According to this morning's Washington Post, if people just check a \nbox on the Web site saying they are having trouble signing up, they \nwill get an extension until at least mid-April--and I wouldn't be \nsurprised if another extension after that and then again beyond.\n  Remember, the Obama administration said 7 million people would have \nto sign up by March 31 in order for this open enrollment period to be a \nsuccess. Those are the administration's words. But with less than 1 \nweek to go, they are 2 million short of their goal. That is why they \nare allowing this extension because they are in a panic, a panic not \nenough people are signing up.\n  The White House may come out and say they have come close to their 7 \nmillion target. They may even claim they were somehow able to find all \nof the 2 million people they needed to buy insurance on the exchanges, \nbut looking at some of the dubious numbers the administration has \nreleased so far, we can predict there will be many unanswered questions \nabout the numbers--whatever numbers the White House claims to now be \nthe new numbers.\n  The first question we should ask about the numbers is, how many of \nthe people signing up actually have insurance?\n  Apparently, it doesn't seem to matter much to the administration how \nmany people who go to the Web site actually have insurance. The Obama \nadministration released a report showing how many people went through \nthe signup process on the Web site through the exchanges. Those people \ndon't actually have insurance until they write a check, pay their \npremiums, and make sure they do have insurance.\n  Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said \nrecently she had no idea in the world--no idea at all--about how many \npeople had paid and how many had not paid, and she is the President's \nSecretary of Health and Human Services--no idea.\n  Insurance companies say they have given Washington plenty of \ninformation to know the answer to that question, but the person in \ncharge has no idea.\n  One industry official told Politico:\n\n       If they have not processed those yet and compiled the data, \n     that is a choice they are making. But they have that data \n     now.\n\n  The White House can say whatever they want--and they tend to do \nthat--but they have the data. They are not admitting the truth.\n  Why isn't the administration playing it straight with these numbers? \nThe point of ObamaCare was to get people insurance, not just register \nthem on a Web site. A recent survey by McKinsey & Company found that \nonly 53 percent of the previously uninsured people who had selected a \nplan actually then went and paid the first month's premium. So only \nabout half of the people that didn't have insurance before, who signed \nup on the Web site, actually went to pay for and buy the insurance. \nThat is question number one.\n  Question No. 2 is: How many people are newly insured? That was the \nmajor goal of the Obama health care legislation. Washington Democrats \nsaid time and time again that we needed a massive overall of the entire \nhealth care system of this country in order to cover the uninsured. \nMany of the people who are signing up today and people who have signed \nup are doing so because the insurance they had, that they liked, that \nworked for them, that they could afford, under the health care law was \ncanceled. The President's health care law forced them to switch.\n  How many people? We don't know that either. One Health and Human \nServices official admitted as much. He said: ``That is not a data point \nthat we are really collecting in any sort of systemic way.''\n  The government officials overseeing this part of the Web site are not \neven collecting the data. The goal of the whole policy plan was to get \npeople that didn't have insurance on insurance. They are not collecting \nthat data point at all. It turns out that the paper application for \nObamaCare included a question--reasonably so--as to whether that person \nalready had insurance because it is information we want to know. But \nthe bureaucrats and the contractors who were apparently overseen by the \nPresident of the United States, who created the healthcare.gov Web \nsite--the Web site that the President said was going to be easier to \nuse than Amazon for insurance and cheaper than your cell phone bill--\napparently they just dropped the question. Why did they do that? Why \ndid they drop the question that was on the paper form and leave it off \nof the Web site to ask if somebody had actually had insurance before? \nThat is what they did.\n  Isn't it something the Obama administration would want to know if \nthey wanted to be honest with the American people. The best estimate \nhas been from this McKinsey survey. They figure that by early February \nonly about a quarter of the people who signed up for ObamaCare \ninsurance were actually newly insured. Three-fourths of them were just \nchanging out insurance, many of whom had their insurance canceled. If \nthat number holds, the exchanges might end up covering fewer than 2 \nmillion previously uninsured Americans this year--fewer than 2 million \npeople who didn't have insurance before covered on the exchange. Think \nabout how much simpler, how much more cost effective health care could \nhave been while still covering that same number of people.\n  Here is the third important question. Who exactly is signing up? The \nadministration is pushing young adults between the ages of 18 and 34 to \nbuy insurance. It is not happening the way the administration wants it \nto happen. Through February, less than 10 percent--less than 1 in 10--\nof the young adults who potentially could enroll\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\nhave actually done so. Insurance companies need lots of young, healthy \npeople to pay premiums--to pay for premiums and then not use much care \nin return. That is the only way this works. Unless more of those young \npeople sign up by the beginning of next week, theoretically--now \nextended by checking a box--premiums are going to jump.\n  Here is the final question. When people buy insurance through the \nObamaCare exchanges, what kind of care will it provide? Just remember \nwhat the President said: If you like what you have, you could keep it; \nyou could keep your doctor--easier than Amazon and cheaper than your \ncell phone. People are losing access to doctors they have known and \ntrusted for years. We have heard from people around the country that \nthis has happened. But for some people having a doctor won't mean they \ncan actually see the doctor. According to the Association of American \nMedical Colleges, we are facing a shortage of about 90,000 physicians \nby the end of this decade.\n  Some patients may be able to get to see a doctor but maybe not the \none they need. According to an Associated Press survey that was \nreported last week, only 4 of 19 leading cancer hospitals--only 4 of 19 \nleading cancer hospitals--said that they accept the plans from all the \ninsurance companies in their State's exchanges. For many other \npatients, the doctor is going to be spending more time looking at the \ncomputer instead of looking at them, even though they are in the same \noffice together because of the burdensome new rules and recordkeeping \nrequirements in the law. Maybe you can keep your doctor, maybe you \ncannot. Do you need special cancer care? Are you worried about whether \nyou are going to be able to get that, and is the doctor going to be \nable to look at you and interact or is the doctor going to be staring \nat his computer screen instead of you in the limited time they have \nbecause of the burdensome requirements? It is going to be bad for \npatients.\n  So patients are going to be getting less care and many will be paying \na lot more than they were paying before. Secretary Sebelius finally \nconceded that the rates will continue to rise in 2015. Now The Hill \nnewspaper that is around--this is what they said on Wednesday, March \n19: ``ObamaCare premiums are about to skyrocket.''\n\n  The President said: cheaper than your cell phone. Reuters ran a \nheadline that said: ``Insurers see double-digit Obamacare price rises \nin many states next year.'' Bloomberg's headline yesterday was almost \nthe same: ``Obamacare insurer WellPoint Sees Double-Digit Rate Rise.''\n  The President said recently the law ``is working the way it should.'' \nThe President of the United States looked into the camera and said it \nis working the way it should. What does he think of the people who are \non the other side watching him on TV? Does he realize how he is losing \ncredibility with the American people when he makes blatant statements \nlike that, when they see how poorly it is working?\n  I believe the President has no idea how the law is working, how \npoorly it is working or what is going to happen next. Does he really \nthink the law is working or is it just a line that somebody wrote for \nhim and that he read? It is hard to know. Does he think that double-\ndigit premium increases are a sign that the law is working? I heard \nfrom one of my constituents the other day, as we were away for the week \ntalking to people around Wyoming, and he put it in writing. He is from \nwestern Wyoming. He said:\n\n       Senator Barrasso, I am sorry for the snide subject of our \n     e-mail but the truth hurts. I know I am preaching to the \n     choir but I just wanted to share our story and frustration.\n\n  Now I know the majority leader has been to the floor and said all of \nthese stories that we tell are all lies. This is a person who lives in \nWyoming. This is what is happening in that person's life. He said:\n\n       We have finally just finished applying for health care \n     through the exchange and found out that our health insurance \n     will double if we sign up. Fortunately for us, we are covered \n     under our own insurance until this December. Our current plan \n     is $505 a month, and it has a $15 thousand deductible after \n     which it is an 80/20 split. The rub for us is the following:\n       Under the construct of the subsidy plan we would \n     theoretically qualify, based on our family size (5 girls) and \n     our income. But since my employer offers health insurance for \n     me and my family, we don't qualify. So we are stuck in limbo. \n     Nonetheless, if we go on my employer's health insurance, we \n     will be paying over $1000 more each month. If we go on the \n     health care market place plan, the least expensive is $1,054/\n     month. This is a significant increase for our middle class \n     family.\n       I thought the affordable health care act was supposed to \n     help us not hurt us.\n\n  The affordable health care act was supposed to help us, he said, not \nhurt us.\n\n       We are panicked on how we are going to pay for this in \n     December? We will be taking all of the money that was going \n     into savings to pay for a terrible insurance plan. Please \n     help us and share our story with people who say this act is \n     helping the middle class.\n\n  I wish the majority leader were here to hear this. Please share this \nstory--our story--a true story about a family in Wyoming, with those \nwho say the act is helping the middle class.\n  Madam President, it clearly is not. Does it sound like the law is \nworking for this man and his family? President Obama says it is working \njust the way it is supposed to work. It is not working for this man and \nhis family.\n  Our health care system needed reform. It needs it now more than ever. \nWe all know that. What Americans got with the Obama health care law was \na monstrous new bureaucracy. It is raising costs for millions of \npeople. It is leading to worse care and other unintended consequences. \nNow these questions are just a small part of what the American people \nwant to know.\n  In fact, as of last night, I can think of another question. How does \nthe Obama administration define the word deadline? Kathleen Sebelius in \nthe House the other day said the deadline is March 31. We are not going \nto extend it. We are not under any circumstances going to extend it. \nThe White House press secretary said the same. Are there any deadlines \nat all for anything in this administration? Is it all on the honor \nsystem?\n  As we start to get answers to these questions, we are going to see \neven more clearly that this health care law has failed patients, it has \nfailed health care providers, and it has failed taxpayers. The \nPresident needs to admit that his law is not working. He needs to \naccept Republican ideas to replace it. Americans need better access to \nquality, affordable health care, not just broken promises, tired \nexcuses, and unanswered questions.\n  Thank you, Madam President.

Madam President, I wish to say a few words about the \nbusiness pending before the Senate; that is, providing aid and \nassistance to the citizens of Ukraine who find themselves invaded by \nthe Russian federation. But before I get to Ukraine, I wish to say a \nquick word about a story that appeared today in the New York Times.\n  This was a remarkable story, remarkable in its transparency but also \nin its cynicism in terms of what some of our friends across the aisle \nhave in mind between now and November. To put it in a word, they have \ngiven up. They have given up legislating and are going to spend the \nnext several months holding a series of show votes which are in essence \nthose designed to highlight poll-tested messages.\n  The New York Times writes this:\n\n       The proposals have little chance of passing.\n\n  Little chance of passing.\n\n       But Democrats concede that making new laws is not really \n     the point. Rather, they are trying to force Republicans to \n     vote against them.\n\n  I would think the American people would expect and certainly they \nwould deserve better than that from the Senate--scheduling a series of \nshow votes, not for the purpose of actually improving the lives of the \nAmerican people or solving the problems that confront our country at \nthis time of low economic growth and high joblessness but, rather, for \nshow votes, for purely partisan political reasons.\n  At a time when millions of people have lost their health insurance, \nwhen millions have been forced to pay higher premiums or deductibles, \nwhen 3.8 million people have been unemployed for more than 6 months, \nwhen the labor force participation rate--the number of people actually \nlooking for work--has fallen to 30-year lows, and when nearly 46.8 \nmillion people are receiving food stamps, it is more than a little \ndisappointing that the leaders of the Democratic Party in the Senate \nare into scoring cheap political points.\n  As I said, the American people certainly deserve better. Again, I am \na little bit surprised that some of the leadership on the Democratic \nside of the aisle would be so transparent and so obvious as to state \ntheir intentions to the New York Times, but that is what it appears.\n  What we need is a Senate and a Congress that is more focused on \ncreating an economic condition where the American people can find jobs \nrather than politicians who are focused solely on saving their jobs, \nparticularly leading up to the next election. Of course, this is the \nkind of stuff that makes people extraordinarily cynical about \nWashington, DC, but with an election coming up, I guess some people \nhave lost all sense of proportion.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  As we continue to discuss the proper response by the United States of \nAmerica to Vladmir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, it is important that we \nstay focused on two overarching realities; No. 1, the Government of \nRussia is much more vulnerable to Western pressure than it might appear \nfrom the outside; No. 2, we have far more leverage today against Moscow \nthan we did 10 years ago or even 5 years ago because of the renaissance \nin American energy, the oil and gas boom we are experiencing in \nAmerica, thanks to the discovery of a man named George Mitchell from \nHouston, TX, who pioneered horizontal drilling, which together with \nfracking has allowed access to natural gas and oil reserves undreamed \nof just 5 or 10 years ago.\n  Let's start with the first reality. As Ruchir Sharma of Morgan \nStanley Investment Management wrote on Monday in the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Russia has become a classic weak-investment, high-inflation \n     economy.\n\n  An economy plagued by massive levels of corruption.\n  According to Mr. Sharma:\n\n       . . . wealthy Russians have been moving money out of the \n     country at one of the fastest rates in two decades--$60 \n     billion a year since 2012--and now foreign investors are \n     pulling out too.\n\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\n\n  So it is worth noting that Russia's economy is currently suffering \nthrough a period of stagnation, despite the fact that oil prices remain \nhigh. As a matter of fact, its government's main source of income is \noil and gas revenue, which has led our friend the senior Senator from \nArizona to say that Russia these days is ``a gas station masquerading \nas a sovereign state.''\n  They depend on the ability to sell that oil and gas to Ukraine and \nEurope. Indeed, they use this as a political tool to work their will in \nEurope and obviously in Ukraine.\n  Sometimes we talk about crony capitalism here in America in which \nprivate individuals and private companies collude with government in \norder to gain special benefits. That is what crony capitalism is. The \nRussian economy represents crony capitalism on steroids. If we could \nsqueeze the oligarchs and the Kremlin advisers who have gotten \nfabulously rich thanks to their collaboration with Vladmir Putin and \nthe Russian Government, many of Vladmir Putin's closest allies will \nbegin to rethink their support. That is an area of vulnerability we \nought to be focused on like a laser.\n  As I said yesterday, I am encouraged by the sanctions the Obama \nadministration announced on Thursday. It is a good start, but I would \nurge the administration to continue imposing serious penalties on high-\nlevel Kremlin officials and the super-rich oligarchs who comprise \nPutin's inner circle. In other words, sanctions are not enough. We need \nto do more to dissuade and discourage Putin and his allies from \nengaging in the current course of conduct, as well as further \nadventures in other parts of Europe and areas of the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  It is time for more robust sanctions that target the financial energy \nsectors of the Russian economy. The cost for Moscow's aggression must \nbe real, and that is not just me saying that, that is what President \nObama said too. With that in mind, I urge the administration to \nsanction the Russian arms exporter known as Rosoboronexport, which has \nbeen tied up in all sorts of corruption scandals and which is also the \nprimary arms supplier for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, who has murdered \nabout 150,000 of his own people in the ongoing Syrian civil war.\n  I cosponsored an amendment introduced by the Senator from Indiana \nthat would end all U.S. Government contracts with Rosoboronexport and \npunish the companies with whom it does military-related business. Once \nagain, I hope that the majority leader, Senator Reid, would reconsider \nand allow the amendment to receive a vote, something he refused to do \nyesterday. I am hoping after a good night's sleep and reconsideration, \nmaybe he would be open to that.\n  I would also call on the majority leader, Senator Reid, to allow us \nto offer another amendment introduced by the junior Senator from \nWyoming, which would greatly expand American exports of liquefied \nnatural gas by granting automatic approval to all applications for new \nLNG terminals that would ship gas to Ukraine and other members of our \nNATO alliance.\n  One may wonder why that is necessary. Just to recapitulate, Putin \nuses energy as a weapon. If he is not getting what he wants out of \nUkraine or Europe, he squeezes off the supply of energy which is \nessential to the economy and to life itself in those vulnerable parts \nof the world.\n  We have been blessed as a result of the innovations of people such as \nGeorge Mitchell with this new renaissance in energy in America through \nshale gas--sometimes called unconventional plays--but the point is we \nare now able to produce much more energy than we can consume \ndomestically, and in North America alone we are fast approaching energy \nindependence. We can afford to be an exporter of some of this energy to \nvulnerable countries such as Ukraine and Europe, so we can get Putin's \nboot off their neck when it comes to the impact he has on their energy \nsupply.\n\n  Before the shale gas revolution, which has just been in the last \ndecade or so, there was very little the United States could do to deter \nEastern Europe's dependence on Russia's LNG. The global energy \nlandscape is much different than it was just a half decade ago.\n  Back in October the House Energy & Commerce Committee held a hearing \nat which several Eastern European diplomats discussed the geopolitical \nsignificance of America's natural gas boom. The Lithuanian Ambassador \nsaid bluntly: ``We need your gas. We want to buy your gas.'' Well, \nLithuania is one of the countries that are in the greatest jeopardy now \nagainst the depredations of somebody like Vladimir Putin and a Russian \nFederation on the march.\n  Meanwhile, the Czech Republic's Deputy Chief of Mission said that \nU.S. LNG exports would increase his country's leverage in future energy \nnegotiations with Moscow. This same Czech diplomat has also urged the \nU.S. Government to treat LNG exports to NATO countries the same way it \ntreats LNG exports to countries with which America has a free-trade \nagreement. This is how he put it: Such a policy shift ``puts us in a \ndifferent league. We are in League B and we would like to be in League \nA.''\n  Passing the Barrasso amendment, of which I am a proud cosponsor, \nwould put all NATO countries in league A, and it would send an \nunmistakable message to Vladimir Putin and his allies in this \naggression against the people of Ukraine and potential aggression \nagainst other countries that this weapon he uses, known as energy, is \nno longer available to him to use to intimidate people and gain their \nterritorial ambitions.\n  It would also demonstrate that Members of both political parties here \nin Congress are committed to breaking Vladimir Putin's energy \nstranglehold over the nations of Eastern Europe. This is going to be \nvery important because if Putin keeps coming--as he may very well do--\nand as Europe considers working with the United States to impose higher \nand higher costs, Europe is going to look in the mirror and say: What \ndo sanctions against Russia mean in terms of our economy?\n  I am afraid they are going to be compromised if they realize their \nengagement with us--and increasingly high sanctions against Russia--has \na negative impact on their economy because it will essentially \njeopardize their energy imports.\n  In addition to sanctions and gas exports, the third prong of \nAmerica's Ukraine strategy should include serious military assistance \nto Kiev. Everyone has said: We are not talking about American boots on \nthe ground, but we are talking about providing military assistance to \npeople who are trying to defend themselves.\n  If our alliance and agreement with Ukraine means anything, it means \nwe are going to help them defend themselves against Russian \ndepredation.\n  Believe me, not only is Ukraine watching but other nations, such as \nNATO--which has a treaty relationship with the United States and a \nself-defense agreement in section 5 of the NATO treaty where aggression \nagainst any single NATO country is treated as an attack against all of \nthem--are watching America's response in Ukraine.\n  In some cases, America might not have to send that military aid \ndirectly. We might only have to facilitate the purchase of certain \nequipment from other sources. But either way, we should be doing \neverything possible to make sure our friends and our allies have the \nresources they need to deter Russian aggression further.\n  It is not just our enemies who are looking to see if America \nretreats--pulling back in the world and creating a vacuum that is being \nfilled by people like Vladimir Putin--it is our friends and our allies \nwho are wondering if America is a dependable friend and ally. If we are \nnot, they are going to make other arrangements all around the world.\n  I have a few final words about what is at stake.\n  When Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear arsenal in the mid-\n1990s, it did so after receiving a U.S. security guarantee. When other \nEastern European nations decided to join NATO, they too were seeking a \nguarantee from America that we would come to their defense and other \nNATO allies would also come to their defense.\n  If Russia's annexation of Crimea is allowed to stand, many of our \nallies, our partners, and our friends will no longer trust American \npromises, and many would-be aggressors, such as China, will be \nemboldened to pursue their territorial claims with much\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\nmore belligerence, and correspondingly the world will become a much \nmore dangerous place. In other words, the outcome in Ukraine is \ncritically important both to U.S. credibility and the future of the \ninternational order. Our policies should reflect that.\n  I am disappointed that the majority leader has seen fit to cut off \nany opportunity for Senators on both sides of the aisle to offer \nconstructive additions for a vote. We are not even asking for assurance \nthat they would pass; we are just asking for a vote on amendments, such \nas military assistance to the Ukraine, expediting the permitting of LNG \nexport facilities to help alleviate the stranglehold Putin has on \nEurope and Ukraine. The majority leader has said no, he is not going to \nallow that, and we do need to get this bill out of here tomorrow--and \nwe will--to send a unified message that this sort of aggression will \nnot be met with silence by the U.S. Government. Even the advocates of \nthis underlying bill have said it is not enough. This is just a start.\n  I would like to hear a schedule from the majority leader of when he \npurports to bring some of these other important issues to the floor--\nparticularly if Putin does what many expect him to do, and that is to \ncontinue rolling on into Western Ukraine and perhaps other countries. \nWhat will be America's response? What will be the bipartisan response \nof the Senate? What we have done so far is a start, but it is nowhere \nnear good enough to exact the kinds of costs President Obama said he \nwants to exact on Putin and Russia for this act of international \naggression and invasion in the country of Ukraine.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I believe Senator McCain is on his way \nto the Chamber. We want to have a colloquy about Ukraine. I ask \npermission to do that when Senator McCain arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, as Senator McCain makes his way to the \nfloor, we are trying to figure out what to do as a nation--along with \nour allies in Europe and throughout the world--about Ukraine and really \nwhat to do with Putin.\n  In my view, this is a symptom of a greater problem. Crimea had been a \npart of Russia for a very long time, but in 1954, I believe it was, \nCrimea became part of a sovereign nation called the Ukraine through an \nagreement. In 1994 the Ukrainians--after the collapse of the former \nSoviet Union, which was the third largest nuclear power in the world--\nagreed to turn their nuclear weapons back over to the Russian \nFederation as part of the Budapest agreement. In return for receiving \nthe weapons, the Russian Government promised to honor the territorial \nintegrity of the Ukraine, and we were part of that deal.\n  I guess no one really fleshed out what honoring the territorial \nintegrity of the Ukraine would mean, but clearly, in 1994 when the \nUkrainian people gave up the nuclear weapons they possessed to the \nRussians--and we were part of the deal where we were going to guarantee \ntheir territorial integrity for the swap--no one envisioned that Russia \nwould move into Crimea because they don't like the political dynamic in \nKiev. If the people of the Ukraine want to move west, that is not a \nreason to basically abrogate the 1994 agreement.\n  What is going on around Russia is the following: As the former Soviet \nUnion collapsed, people who had been in the sphere of influence of \nRussia--the former Soviet Union--have all embarked on a different path \nfor the most part. There are a couple of people who align with Russia \nbut not many.\n  My goal is quite simple: Allow the people of the Ukraine, Poland, and \nthe former Soviet Union to make their decision about how they would \nconstruct their country apart from threats of force or intimidation by \nRussia.\n  It is no surprise to me that all those who could choose to move away \nfrom Russia because of the experience they had in the past have done \nso. Ukrainian people will always have a unique relationship with \nRussia, but they want to be Ukrainian.\n  There are a lot of ethnic Russians in Ukraine. We have everybody in \nAmerica. America is an idea, not an ethnic group or a particular \nreligion. Ukraine is multiethnic. They have ethnic Russians with a \nbunch of other folks--``Ukrainians,'' for lack of a better word.\n  The bottom line is that they have been debating among themselves \nabout how to move forward and in what direction to move. Yanukovych won \nan election. He moved the Ukrainian people away from Europe and toward \nRussia. The President preceding him rode a revolution into power--the \nOrange Revolution, which some would argue did not produce the results \nthe Ukrainian people were hoping for. It took us a long time as a \nnation--and we are still trying--to figure out who we are and where we \nare going. Democracies are messy.\n  The one thing we should all be doing is aligning ourselves around the \nconcept that choosing one's destiny as an individual within the \nconfines of the law and choosing one's destiny as a nation in \ninternational law should preclude having that choice taken away by your \nneighbor through military force and intimidation.\n  Entering into Crimea was a breach of international law. It was a \nbreach of the 1994 agreement. Putin has proven to be an antidemocratic \nforce in the world and in Russia.\n  When you are dealing with somebody, you need to look at their value \nsystem and their agenda and their interest. The value system of Mr. \nPutin is that of a KGB colonel. Most of his adult life he worked for \nthe KGB, so his value system comes from that organization. It is about \nthe ends, not the means. Democracy is about the process. I am not \nsurprised that he snuffed out democracy--as any reasonable person would \nknow it in Russia--and that he has made the Duma almost irrelevant, if \nnot a joke. There is no independent judiciary; if you oppose Putin, you \nare liable to go to jail. I understand where he is coming from because \nof his value system; I just don't agree with it.\n  What we can't do is let him affect those who are living around him \nwho want to go on a different path because the day you begin to do \nthat, it never works out well. In World War II, every time somebody \ngave Hitler a little of this or a little of that, it never worked out \nwell.\n  So what do we do? The European community, along with the United \nStates, has a historic chance to reset what I think is a deterioration \nof world security and order. Having sanctions combined with aid, \nincluding sanctioning the Russians in a fashion they will feel, hitting \ntheir energy sectors, their oil and gas companies masquerading in this \ncountry, and increasing the capability of a gutted Ukrainian Army to \ndefend themselves from further insurgents, would be a combination of \nhitting the Russians and helping the Ukrainians militarily and \neconomically without any boots on the ground from the United States. I \nhope that is what the President will do. That is what we are trying to \ndo here--to some extent, at least--on the sanctions side in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n  I see Senator McCain has arrived. He has been the most consistent \nvoice for the last decade about the role of America, our destiny as a \ncountry, with what we should align ourselves, understanding the Arab \nspring, and he has been a thorn in the side of Putin and Russia for \nquite awhile. So I wish to, if I could, ask a question of Senator \nMcCain.\n  Given what we know about Putin's past and what he has done in Crimea, \nwhat does the Senator expect in the future and what can we reasonably \ndo as a nation to change the outcome?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleagues. The American people should know \nexactly what has happened and what is happening now, and what may \nhappen, unless we show a steadfast and robust response to the active \naggression which\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\nhas just taken place as Colonel Putin has moved and is aggressively \nusing the force of arms, invaded a country and absorbed part of that \ncountry into Russia. A blatant act of aggression, sparked by the age-\nold practice of demonstrations and desire for intervention to protect \nRussian-speaking people has just been enacted by Vladimir Putin.\n  Vladimir Putin's forces, I would say to my friend from South \nCarolina, as he knows, are on the border of Eastern Ukraine right now, \nand they are poised to invade. They even have forces in Belarus. \nVladimir Putin is figuring out the cost-benefit ratio of moving into \nEastern Ukraine, the cost-benefit ratio of moving into Moldova, which \nis not a member of NATO; of inciting the Russians there--there are \n1,400 Russian troops stationed in Transnistria. He is figuring out the \ncost-benefit ratio of inciting violence in the Russian-speaking \npopulation of the Baltic countries, especially Estonia.\n  Vladimir Putin is on the move. A fundamental and naive attitude \ntoward Vladimir Putin by this President and this administration, I \nhope, is shattered for all time. Vladimir Putin is a KGB colonel who \nsaid the greatest mistake of the 20th century was to break up the \nSoviet Union. He is intent on restoring the Russian empire. That is \nwhat Vladimir Putin is all about. And what has been our response? \nFascinating. The President of the United States, in his press \nconference yesterday, basically said, So what I announced and what the \nEuropean Council announced was that we are consulting and putting in \nplace the framework, the architecture for additional sanctions, \nadditional costs should Russia take the next step.\n  How does Vladimir Putin read that statement by the President of the \nUnited States? He reads it by saying, We got away with it. We got \nCrimea back.\n  Both the Senator from South Carolina and I predicted he would not \ngive up Sevastopol and he would invade if he felt it was necessary to \ndo so.\n  So that is where we are today. Does anybody believe that when the \nPresident of the United States says ``the architecture for additional \nsanctions, additional costs, should Russia take the next step''--how \ndoes Vladimir Putin interpret that statement?\n  I wish to digress for a minute. There has been a lot of conversation \nabout what the reaction was to Georgia and the invasion of Georgia and \nwhat the Bush administration did or did not do. I will let people judge \nwhat the Bush administration did or did not do.\n  I will submit for the Record an opinion piece written by Senator \nLindsey Graham and Senator Joe Lieberman dated August 26, 2008, after \nthe invasion by Vladimir Putin into Georgia at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  At that time--this is 2008--Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham \nwrote:\n\n       There is disturbing evidence Russia is already laying the \n     groundwork to apply the same arguments used to justify its \n     intervention in Georgia to other parts of its near abroad--\n     most ominously in Crimea.\n\n  That is what Senator Graham and Senator Lieberman said 6 years ago.\n  They went on:\n\n       This strategically important peninsula is part of Ukraine, \n     but with a large ethnic Russian population and the \n     headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol.\n\n  Then Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham went on to argue for a much \nmore robust response than the Bush administration gave:\n\n       Specifically, the Georgian military should be given the \n     antiaircraft and antiarmor systems necessary to deter any \n     renewed Russian aggression.\n       Our response to the invasion of Georgia must include \n     regional actions to reassure Russia's rattled neighbors and \n     strengthen trans-Atlantic solidarity. This means \n     reinvigorating NATO as a military alliance.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham 6 years ago predicted this. I \nwonder what lesson this President took from that event and their \npredictions. The fact is--and it is with great sadness I tell my \ncolleagues--we will hear a lot of rhetoric, there will be a lot of \nmeetings, gatherings and conversations and threats about what needs to \nbe done. But for a broad variety of reasons, which I do not have the \ntime to go through, I predict to my colleagues now that the sanctions \nthat are in place, which are for a handful of people, will be the \nextent of our reaction to the invasion of Crimea and the further \nviolation of Ukrainian territory from the east.\n  After Hitler invaded Austria in 1938, he gave a speech in Vienna, \nfrom the balcony of a hotel in Vienna. We should look back at that \nspeech--and I will give more quotes from it. It is a carbon copy of \nwhat Vladimir Putin said about Crimea. Hitler said they had to go in \nand protect the German-speaking people and they had to do it with force \nof arms. But guess what. They were going to have a referendum. And they \nhad--they used to call it plebiscites then--they had a referendum--a \nplebiscite--in Austria, and guess what. Ninety-six percent of the \npeople voted that they wanted to be a part of Nazi Germany. This is an \nold playbook Vladimir Putin is operating from.\n  So, tomorrow, fortunately, there is going to be a vote on some \nassistance to our beleaguered friends in Ukraine. I believe military \nassistance is a vital part of the assistance.\n  I ask my friend from South Carolina: Isn't it true the first thing \npeople need once they have been invaded, once part of their country has \nbeen taken over, is the ability to defend themselves? And isn't it a \nfact that the Ukrainian military, because of previous administrations, \nhas been emasculated and they only have about 6,000 troops they can \nrely on? We just saw in Crimea their total inability to resist what the \nRussians did to their fleet and to their bases.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Arizona is absolutely right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I could interrupt to ask unanimous \nconsent that the article entitled ``Russia's Aggression Is a Challenge \nto World Order'' by Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman, dated August 26, \n2008, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 26, 2008]\n\n           Russia's Aggression Is a Challenge to World Order\n\n                 (By Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman)\n\n       In the wake of Russia's invasion of Georgia, the United \n     States and its trans-Atlantic allies have rightly focused on \n     two urgent and immediate tasks: getting Russian soldiers out, \n     and humanitarian aid in.\n       But having just returned from Georgia, Ukraine and Poland, \n     where we met with leaders of these countries, we believe it \n     is imperative for the West to look beyond the day-to-day \n     management of this crisis. The longer-term strategic \n     consequences, some of which are already being felt far beyond \n     the Caucasus, have to be addressed.\n       Russia's aggression is not just a threat to a tiny \n     democracy on the edge of Europe. It is a challenge to the \n     political order and values at the heart of the continent.\n       For more than 60 years, from World War II through the Cold \n     War to our intervention in the former Yugoslavia in the \n     1990s, the U.S. has fostered and fought for the creation of a \n     Europe that is whole, free and at peace. This stands as one \n     of the greatest strategic achievements of the 20th century: \n     the gradual transformation of a continent, once the scene of \n     the most violent and destructive wars ever waged, into an \n     oasis of peace and prosperity where borders are open and \n     uncontested and aggression unthinkable.\n       Russia's invasion of Georgia represents the most serious \n     challenge to this political order since Slobodan Milosevic \n     unleashed the demons of ethnic nationalism in the Balkans. \n     What is happening in Georgia today, therefore, is not simply \n     a territorial dispute. It is a struggle about whether a new \n     dividing line is drawn across Europe: between nations that \n     are free to determine their own destinies, and nations that \n     are consigned to the Kremlin's autocratic orbit.\n       That is the reason countries like Poland, Ukraine and the \n     Baltic States are watching what happens in the Caucasus so \n     closely. We heard that last week in Warsaw, Kiev and Tbilisi. \n     There is no doubt in the minds of leaders in Ukraine and \n     Poland--if Moscow succeeds in Georgia, they may be next.\n       There is disturbing evidence Russia is already laying the \n     groundwork to apply the same arguments used to justify its \n     intervention in Georgia to other parts of its near abroad--\n     most ominously in Crimea. This strategically important \n     peninsula is part of Ukraine, but with a large ethnic Russian \n     population and the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet \n     at Sevastopol.\n       The first priority of America and Europe must be to prevent \n     the Kremlin from achieving its strategic objectives in \n     Georgia. Having been deterred from marching on Tbilisi and \n     militarily overthrowing the democratically elected government \n     there, Russian forces spent last week destroying the \n     country's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, port and \n     security facilities. This was more than random looting. It \n     was a deliberate campaign to collapse the economy of Georgia, \n     in the hope of taking the government down with it.\n       The humanitarian supplies the U.S. military is now ferrying \n     to Georgia are critically\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\n     important to the innocent men, women and children displaced \n     by the fighting, some of whom we saw last week. Also needed, \n     immediately, is a joint commitment by the U.S. and the \n     European Union to fund a large-scale, comprehensive \n     reconstruction plan--developed by the Georgian government, in \n     consultation with the World Bank, IMF and other international \n     authorities--and for the U.S. Congress to support this plan \n     as soon as it returns to session in September.\n       Any assistance plan must also include the rebuilding of \n     Georgia's security forces. Our past aid to the Georgian \n     military focused on supporting the light, counterterrorism-\n     oriented forces that facilitate Tbilisi's contribution to \n     coalition operations in Iraq. We avoided giving the types of \n     security aid that could have been used to blunt Russia's \n     conventional onslaught. It is time for that to change.\n       Specifically, the Georgian military should be given the \n     antiaircraft and antiarmor systems necessary to deter any \n     renewed Russian aggression. These defensive capabilities will \n     help to prevent this conflict from erupting again, and make \n     clear we will not allow the Russians to forcibly redraw the \n     boundaries of sovereign nations.\n       Our response to the invasion of Georgia must include \n     regional actions to reassure Russia's rattled neighbors and \n     strengthen trans-Atlantic solidarity. This means \n     reinvigorating NATO as a military alliance, not just a \n     political one. Contingency planning for the defense of all \n     member states against conventional and unconventional attack, \n     including cyber warfare, needs to be revived. The credibility \n     of Article Five of the NATO Charter--that an attack against \n     one really can and will be treated as an attack against all--\n     needs to be bolstered.\n       The U.S. must also reaffirm its commitment to allies that \n     have been the targets of Russian bullying because of their \n     willingness to work with Washington. The recent missile-\n     defense agreement between Poland and the U.S., for instance, \n     is not aimed at Russia. But this has not stopped senior \n     Russian officials from speaking openly about military \n     retaliation against Warsaw. Irrespective of our political \n     differences over missile defense, Democrats and Republicans \n     should join together in Congress to pledge solidarity with \n     Poland, along with the Czech Republic, against these \n     outrageous Russian threats.\n       Finally, the U.S. and Europe need a new trans-Atlantic \n     energy alliance. In recent years, Russia has proven all too \n     willing to use its oil and gas resources as a weapon, and to \n     try to consolidate control over the strategic energy \n     corridors to the West. By working together, an alliance can \n     frustrate these designs and diminish our dependence on the \n     foreign oil that is responsible for the higher energy prices \n     here at home.\n       In crafting a response to the Georgia crisis, we must above \n     all reaffirm our conviction that Russia need not be a \n     competitor or an adversary. Since the collapse of the Soviet \n     Union, Democratic and Republican administrations have engaged \n     Russia, sending billions of dollars to speed its economic \n     recovery and welcoming its integration into the flagship \n     institutions of the international community. We did this \n     because we believed that a strong, prosperous Russia can be a \n     strategic partner and a friend. We still do.\n       But Russia's leaders have made a different choice. While we \n     stand ready to rebuild relations with Moscow and work \n     together on shared challenges, Russia's current course will \n     only alienate and isolate it from the rest of the world.\n       We believe history will judge the Russian invasion of \n     Georgia as a serious strategic miscalculation. Although it is \n     for the moment flush with oil wealth, Russia's political \n     elite remains kleptocratic, and its aggression exposed as \n     much weakness as strength. The invasion of Georgia will not \n     only have a unifying effect on the West, it also made clear \n     that Russia--unlike the Soviet Union--has few real allies of \n     strategic worth. To date, the only countries to defend \n     Russia's actions in the Caucasus have been Cuba and Belarus--\n     and the latter, only after the Kremlin publicly complained \n     about its silence.\n       In the long run, a Russia that tries to define its \n     greatness in terms of spheres of influence, client states and \n     forced fealty to Moscow will fail--impoverishing its citizens \n     in the process. The question is only how long until Russia's \n     leaders rediscover this lesson from their own history.\n       Until they do, the watchword of the West must be \n     solidarity: solidarity with the people of Georgia and its \n     democratically elected government, solidarity with our allies \n     throughout the region, and above all, solidarity with the \n     values that have given meaning to our trans-Atlantic \n     community of democracies and our vision of a European \n     continent that is whole, free and at peace.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if people are wondering why Senator \nMcCain's name wasn't on that article--he is on everything else Joe and \nI did--it is because he was running for President and just got the \nnomination.\n  We were very much worried then, the three of us, that the Bush \nadministration wasn't doing enough, and we needed to help the Georgian \npeople as a signal not only to those in Georgia but other people in the \nneighborhood.\n  Let's talk about the Ukrainian military. It has been devastated, it \nhas been gutted, because Yanukovych, the Ukrainian President, who won \nthe election by less than 1 million votes--if you take Crimea out of \nUkraine electorally, then no pro-Russian candidate inside Ukraine has \nmuch of a chance to win. So now they have destroyed the balance of \npower inside Ukraine politically. So as those left in Ukraine, the \nUkrainian people move west, they are going to have the ability to align \nthemselves with Europe. Putin is, in my view, very much likely to take \nsome eastern cities that may ask for his help, because the referendum \nby the Ukraine to move west they opposed, but they can't stop because \nof the electoral change.\n  So watch out for a move by Ukraine to integrating the European Union \nin April or May when they have an election, and people in the east \ncreate a fake fight and Russia uses that as a reason to go further into \nthe east.\n  But to Senator McCain's point: President Obama has conceded Crimea. \nThere is just no other way we can say it. Our European allies and our \nPresident have basically said, If you do any more, we are going to get \ntougher with you. The Senator from Arizona nailed this. What does that \nsay to Putin? I got Crimea. Seven people and I may be sanctioned, but I \nhave been given Crimea by Europe and the United States.\n  The sanctions we are talking about get tougher only if he moves \nfurther into his sovereign neighbor.\n  Six thousand troops are combat-ready in Ukraine. Why? Because the \npro-Russian President and their Defense Minister, who got fired \nyesterday, gutted the Ukrainian military, setting up a scenario such as \nthis, making it impossible for the Ukrainians to effectively defend \nthemselves.\n  Here is the question for us: Do we let the Russians get away with it? \nThey have been planning this for a while. Clearly, the pro-Russian \nforces inside Ukraine took on the task of neutering the Ukrainian \nmilitary and they have done a heck of a good job. Should the United \nStates and our NATO partners, at the request of the Ukrainian people, \nsupply them with defensive weapons to rebuild the military, gutted by \npro-Russian elements? To me, the answer is yes. Because if we want to \nmake Putin think twice about what he does next, he has to pay a price \ngreater than he has for Crimea. If he gets away with this and he \ndoesn't pay any price, he is going to be on steroids. But if he thinks \nabout moving and he sees on the other side of Crimea a Ukrainian people \nwilling to fight with some capacity, that will change the equation. \nBecause it is one thing to cheer in Moscow for getting something for \nalmost nothing in terms of effort. It will be another thing to talk \nabout Russian soldiers getting killed to continue to be on the \naggressive path.\n  So if the NATO alliance, along with the United States, doesn't help \nrebuild the Ukrainian military so they can defend themselves without \nour troops being involved, we have made a historic mistake, because \neverybody in the world is watching how this movie ends. The Iranians \nare watching, after Syria, now Russia. Does anybody in their right mind \nbelieve the Iranians take us seriously as a nation when it comes to \nstopping their nuclear program?\n  So I say to Senator McCain, you have been a voice for realism, \nunderstanding Putin for who he is. For years, you have been telling the \nSenate and the country and the world at large: Watch this guy. There \nhave been a series of foreign policy failures that have added up to \nmake it confident to Putin that he can move forward without \nconsequences.\n  So I hope we can convince our colleagues in the Senate and the House \nto honor a reasonable request by the Ukrainian people to help them \nrebuild the military destroyed by pro-Russian forces.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like to make a couple additional \npoints to my friend from South Carolina, and I notice the Senator from \nNew Hampshire is here.\n  In 1994, an agreement, a treaty was reached which divested Ukraine of \nthe world's third largest nuclear inventory. In return for Ukraine \nturning over that inventory of nuclear weapons, there was a pledge made \nby Russia, the United States, and the British that they would respect \nthe territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea. That was a part \nof the treaty. Obviously, Vladimir Putin violated that.\n\n[[Page S1752]]\n\n  The second point is, look, I have no illusions or worry about the \nlong-term future of Russia. Russia is now a gas station masquerading as \na country. Once we get the LNG and other energy to the European \ncountries, it will dramatically reduce and eventually eliminate \nVladimir Putin's influence because there is nothing but corruption and \noligarchs in Russia today. One of the reasons Vladimir Putin wanted the \nCrimea and did not want Ukraine to be independent is because he was \nafraid this ``disease'' may spread to Russia. The Russian people are \nalso sick and tired of the kleptocracy and the corruption.\n  Finally, again we need--and we should have had in this legislation--a \ncommitment to help export our excess energy to the Europeans so they \nthen would be able to reduce their dependency--not just Ukraine but all \nof Europe on their dependency on Russian energy.\n  So I have no doubt about the future of Russia. It will collapse like \na house of cards. But in the short term, what Mr. Putin will do in \ncommitting further aggression--because this has raised his popularity \ndramatically at home. One of the most respected people whom Senator \nGraham and Senator Ayotte and I had to deal with over the years was Bob \nGates. Mr. Gates served this country in a variety of posts, the latest \nof course being as an outstanding Secretary of Defense. This morning in \nthe Wall Street Journal he wrote a piece called ``Putin's Challenge to \nthe West.'' I am not going to read the whole thing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 25, 2014]\n\n                     Putin's Challenge to the West\n\n                          (By Robert M. Gates)\n\n       Russia has thrown down a gauntlet that is not limited to \n     Crimea or even Ukraine.\n       Russian President Vladimir Putin has a long-festering \n     grudge: He deeply resents the West for winning the Cold War. \n     He blames the United States in particular for the collapse of \n     his beloved Soviet Union, an event he has called the ``worst \n     geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.''\n       His list of grievances is long and was on full display in \n     his March 18 speech announcing the annexation of Crimea by \n     Russia. He is bitter about what he sees as Russia's \n     humiliations in the 1990s--economic collapse; the expansion \n     of NATO to include members of the U.S.S.R.'s own \n     ``alliance,'' the Warsaw Pact; Russia's agreement to the \n     treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe, or as he calls \n     it, ``the colonial treaty''; the West's perceived dismissal \n     of Russian interests in Serbia and elsewhere; attempts to \n     bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO and the European Union; \n     and Western governments, businessmen and scholars all telling \n     Russia how to conduct its affairs at home and abroad.\n       Mr. Putin aspires to restore Russia's global power and \n     influence and to bring the now-independent states that were \n     once part of the Soviet Union back into Moscow's orbit. While \n     he has no apparent desire to recreate the Soviet Union (which \n     would include responsibility for a number of economic basket \n     cases), he is determined to create a Russian sphere of \n     influence--political, economic and security--and dominance. \n     There is no grand plan or strategy to do this, just \n     opportunistic and ruthless aspiration. And patience.\n       Mr. Putin, who began his third, nonconsecutive presidential \n     term in 2012, is playing a long game. He can afford to: Under \n     the Russian Constitution, he could legally remain president \n     until 2024. After the internal chaos of the 1990s, he has \n     ruthlessly restored ``order'' to Russia, oblivious to \n     protests at home and abroad over his repression of nascent \n     Russian democracy and political freedoms.\n       In recent years, he has turned his authoritarian eyes on \n     the ``near-abroad.'' In 2008, the West did little as he \n     invaded Georgia, and Russian troops still occupy the Abkhazia \n     and South Ossetia regions. He has forced Armenia to break off \n     its agreements with the European Union, and Moldova is under \n     similar pressure.\n       Last November, through economic leverage and political \n     muscle, he forced then-President Viktor Yanukovych to abort a \n     Ukrainian agreement with the EU that would have drawn it \n     toward the West. When Mr. Yanukovych, his minion, was ousted \n     as a result, Mr. Putin seized Crimea and is now making \n     ominous claims and military movements regarding all of \n     eastern Ukraine.\n       Ukraine is central to Mr. Putin's vision of a pro-Russian \n     bloc, partly because of its size and importantly because of \n     Kiev's role as the birthplace of the Russian Empire more than \n     a thousand years ago. He will not be satisfied or rest until \n     a pro-Russian government is restored in Kiev.\n       He also has a dramatically different worldview than the \n     leaders of Europe and the U.S. He does not share Western \n     leaders' reverence for international law, the sanctity of \n     borders, which Westerners' believe should only be changed \n     through negotiation, due process and rule of law. He has no \n     concern for human and political rights. Above all, Mr. Putin \n     clings to a zero-sum worldview. Contrary to the West's belief \n     in the importance of win-win relationships among nations, for \n     Mr. Putin every transaction is win-lose; when one party \n     benefits, the other must lose. For him, attaining, keeping \n     and amassing power is the name of the game.\n       The only way to counter Mr. Putin's aspirations on Russia's \n     periphery is for the West also to play a strategic long game. \n     That means to take actions that unambiguously demonstrate to \n     Russians that his worldview and goals--and his means of \n     achieving them--over time will dramatically weaken and \n     isolate Russia.\n       Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas must be reduced, \n     and truly meaningful economic sanctions must be imposed, \n     knowing there may be costs to the West as well. NATO allies \n     bordering Russia must be militarily strengthened and \n     reinforced with alliance forces; and the economic and cyber \n     vulnerabilities of the Baltic states to Russian actions must \n     be reduced (especially given the number of Russians and \n     Russian-speakers in Estonia and Latvia).\n       Western investment in Russia should be curtailed; Russia \n     should be expelled from the G-8 and other forums that offer \n     respect and legitimacy; the U.S. defense budget should be \n     restored to the level proposed in the Obama administration's \n     2014 budget a year ago, and the Pentagon directed to cut \n     overhead drastically, with saved dollars going to enhanced \n     capabilities, such as additional Navy ships; U.S. military \n     withdrawals from Europe should be halted; and the EU should \n     be urged to grant associate agreements with Moldova, Georgia \n     and Ukraine.\n       So far, however, the Western response has been anemic. Mr. \n     Putin is little influenced by seizure of personal assets of \n     his cronies or the oligarchs, or restrictions on their \n     travel. Unilateral U.S. sanctions, save on Russian banks, \n     will not be effective absent European cooperation. The gap \n     between Western rhetoric and Western actions in response to \n     out-and-out aggression is a yawning chasm. The message seems \n     to be that if Mr. Putin doesn't move troops into eastern \n     Ukraine, the West will impose no further sanctions or costs. \n     De facto, Russia's seizure of Crimea will stand and, except \n     for a handful of Russian officials, business will go on as \n     usual.\n       No one wants a new Cold War, much less a military \n     confrontation. We want Russia to be a partner, but that is \n     now self-evidently not possible under Mr. Putin's leadership. \n     He has thrown down a gauntlet that is not limited to Crimea \n     or even Ukraine. His actions challenge the entire post-Cold \n     War order including, above all, the right of independent \n     states to align themselves and do business with whomever they \n     choose.\n       Tacit acceptance of settling old revanchist scores by force \n     is a formula for ongoing crises and potential armed conflict, \n     whether in Europe, Asia or elsewhere. A China behaving with \n     increasing aggressiveness in the East and South China seas, \n     an Iran with nuclear aspirations and interventionist policies \n     in the Middle East, and a volatile and unpredictable North \n     Korea are all watching events in Europe. They have witnessed \n     the fecklessness of the West in Syria. Similar division and \n     weakness in responding to Russia's most recent aggression \n     will, I fear, have dangerous consequences down the road.\n       Mr. Putin's challenge comes at a most unpropitious time for \n     the West. Europe faces a weak economic recovery and \n     significant economic ties with Russia. The U.S. is emerging \n     from more than a dozen years at war and leaders in both \n     parties face growing isolationism among voters, with the \n     prospect of another major challenge abroad cutting across the \n     current political grain. Crimea and Ukraine are far away, and \n     their importance to Europe and America little understood by \n     the public.\n       Therefore, the burden of explaining the need to act \n     forcefully falls, as always, on our leaders. As President \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ``Government includes the act of \n     formulating a policy'' and ``persuading, leading, \n     sacrificing, teaching always, because the greatest duty of a \n     statesman is to educate.'' The aggressive, arrogant actions \n     of Vladimir Putin require from Western leaders strategic \n     thinking, bold leadership and steely resolve--now.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is very important for all of our colleagues and the \nAmerican people to know, and they do not have to take Senator Graham's \nand my word for it. Already we are accused of being partisan--politics \nstops at the water's edge, all of that baloney. When they cannot rebut \nthe message, they shoot the messengers. This is former Secretary of \nDefense Gates:\n\n       So far, however, the Western response has been anemic. Mr. \n     Putin is little influenced by seizure of personal assets of \n     his cronies or the oligarchs, or restrictions on their \n     travel.

They have witnessed \n     the fecklessness of the West in Syria. Similar division and \n     weakness in responding to Russia's most recent aggression \n     will, I fear, have dangerous consequences down the road.\n\n  So we are not just even talking about Ukraine. We are not even \ntalking about that part of Europe. We are talking about the lesson that \nbad people--whether they be Kim Jong Un or whether they be the Chinese \nwho want to increase their influence in the South China Sea or whether \nthey be the Iranians who continue to supply weapons to Hezbollah \nfighters to the fight in Syria, which the resistance is losing--in case \nyou missed it, there was an interesting article this morning about how \njihadists will establish a base in Syria with which to export terrorism \nthroughout the Middle East and the world, including the United States \nof America.\n  The President of the United States has to understand Vladimir Putin \nfor what he is and what his ambitions are and what he will do.\n  My friend from South Carolina and I are not sure what he will do now. \nBut I think it is obvious, with his troops amassed on the boarder of \nEastern Ukraine, he is contemplating further action. Whether he does \nso, I am not sure, but I think his calculation has to do with the cost-\nbenefit ratio of further aggression against a sovereign nation.\n  I see my colleague.\n  Could I just make one more comment because my colleague was in \nUkraine recently. These are wonderful people. All they want is what we \nhave. They do not want to be part of Russia. They are tired of their \ncorrupt dictator, Yanukovych, whom they had. They are willing to stand \nfor weeks in freezing weather in Maidan--this huge square in Ukraine. \nMadam President, 110 of them were assassinated by snipers.\n  Can't we at least give them some weapons with which to defend \nthemselves and speak up for them, rather than saying ``additional costs \nshould Russia take [the] next step.''\n  I yield for my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nArizona and my colleague from South Carolina. I was in Ukraine on \nSunday, and I was in Maidan, along with two of my colleagues: Senator \nDonnelly, who represents Indiana in the Senate, as well as \nRepresentative Stephen Lynch, who is a Congressman who represents \nMassachusetts.\n  We had an opportunity, actually, to see and meet Ukrainians. In fact, \nwhen we went down to Maidan, there were 30,000 people there protesting. \nDo you know what they were protesting? They were protesting the Russian \ninvasion and illegal annexation of Crimea. They were standing for their \ncountry, and they were standing against Russian aggression.\n  In fact, one of the experiences we had is that as we walked along, so \nmany people came up to us and said: Thank you, America. Thank you for \nstanding with us. In fact, I met a mother and daughter who had come \nfrom Crimea. They were waiving a flag--a Ukrainian flag--and they gave \nme this, what I hold in my hand, and they put it around me. What they \nwanted me to know is that they were from Crimea and they did not accept \nthe Russian aggression and invasion of their country. What they asked \nus to stand for is to stand for the freedom of the Ukrainian people to \ndecide their future and to not let Russia interfere with their ability \nto decide what they want for their country.\n  They are wonderful people. They are very patriotic. In Maidan there \nwere over 100 Ukrainians who were killed. Many of them were murdered by \nsnipers who were up on the rooftops, who were just killed in cold blood \nby the Yanukovych government, the pro-Russian-backed government, \nbecause they were simply doing what we in the United States of America \ncall coming out and stating their viewpoint, saying: We want a \ngovernment that is not corrupt. We want a government that will allow us \nto have a say in our future. For that they were murdered in cold blood.\n  We are at an important moment for our country right now. What \nhappened in Crimea and what is happening in Ukraine matters very much \nto the United States of America, because if we do not stop Russian \naggression toward Ukraine, then I think this very much threatens the \nNATO alliance. It puts us in a position where our words do not have \nmeaning because we were a signatory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, \nalong with the United Kingdom.\n  Russia violated that memorandum by invading Crimea. They have made \nfurther efforts to amass their troops on the boarder of Eastern \nUkraine. In fact, what they are also doing is sending armed Russian \nagents into Eastern Ukraine to try--they are armed, they have money--\nand they are trying to actually create artificial demonstrations in \nEastern Ukraine so they can use the very same excuse they used in \nCrimea to go over and take more territory of Ukraine in violation of \ninternational law and in violation of all standards among civilized \ncountries.\n  I believe it is time for us to set forth--I appreciate what the \nPresident has done with the sanctions, but we need to do more. If we do \nnot do more now, then Russia--I fear that Vladimir Putin in particular \nwill move into the remainder of Ukraine and that we will undermine our \nagreement on the Budapest Memorandum. But, most important, we have a \nlot at stake.\n  First, as my colleagues have said, if we do not stand with NATO to \nsend a strong message to Vladimir Putin, by not just sanctioning \nindividuals, we should sanction segments of the Russian economy so he \nunderstands there are serious consequences for invading another \ncountry.\n  We should provide military assistance to the Ukraine military so they \ncan defend themselves. We should revisit our decision and reinstate the \nmemorandums of understanding that we have with Poland and the Czech \nRepublic for missile defense systems. We as a country should be looking \nto help Europe reduce their dependency on Russian natural gas and oil, \nand there are steps we can take that will be good for our economy but \nwill also be good for the safety and security of the world.\n  We should be doing all that now so Vladimir Putin, who is a \nschoolyard bully, understands we are very serious.\n  Why does it matter? Not just NATO, but we had Ukraine give up their \nnuclear weapons in exchange for the agreement of the United Kingdom and \nthe United States that we would respect their sovereignty, and they \nfelt they had assurances of security from us.\n  How are we going to deal with nuclear proliferation around the world \nand get other countries to give up their nuclear weapons if we are not \nserious and we do not say now: Vladimir Putin, we are serious--tough \nsanctions, much tougher than have been in place. We are going to \nsupport the Ukrainian military and we are not going to stand for any \nmore aggression against the Ukrainian people--because otherwise why \ngive up your nuclear weapons, again, if you are a country, if the \nUnited States of America does not mean anything they say on an \nagreement they have signed on to?\n  In addition, what will the Chinese do? In the Senkaku Islands they \nhave been very aggressive toward the territory of not only the Japanese \nbut also the Philippines, the Vietnamese, and they are watching. They \nare watching whether we care whether Russia invades another country, \nwhether we care that Vladimir Putin is pushing the Ukrainian people \naround.\n  That is why this matters, not just because we stand in solidarity \nwith the people of Ukraine--we do and we should--so they can decide \ntheir future, not Vladimir Putin--they, the people of their country, \nshould decide their future--but also because it matters for us around \nthe world, not just China, not just nuclear proliferation,\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\nbut what do the ayatollahs in Iran think about how serious we are about \nending their nuclear weapons program.\n  This is an important moment for America, and it is time for our \nPresident to really step forward. The initial steps he took were in the \nright direction, but it is time not to continue saying there will be \nfurther costs. The costs must be rendered now. The Senate will be \ntaking an important step in providing loan guarantees to Ukraine and a \nscheme for sanctions, but ultimately I call on the President of the \nUnited States to say to Vladimir Putin now--to recognize whom we are \ndealing with, the former KGB colonel--to say to him: We are going to \nimpose sanctions on entire segments of your economy. We are going to \nhurt your ability to do business in the world because you have invaded \nanother country. We are going to bolster NATO, and we are going to \nreinstate missile defense systems in the Czech Republic and Poland, \nthat we will not accept this aggression.\n  It is time for the President to say this very clearly and to impose \nthe consequences on Russia now because after they invade Eastern \nUkraine, it will be too late.\n  Vladimir Putin needs to understand now that we are very serious about \nthis, that we will stand by our word under the Budapest Memorandum, \nthat we will stand with the Ukrainian people, and that we will make \nsure that we will not accept aggressions from Vladimir Putin, and that \nthis school yard bully understands, through strength, that the United \nStates of America will not be bullied around, nor will our friends and \nallies.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  There is the Membership Action Plan, MAP--I think that is the \nacronym--where a country gets ready to enter into NATO. Georgia would \nlike that. I think Ukraine now would like that. Here is the basic \ntension; don't you agree?\n  A plurality before Crimea was invaded wanted to move into the \nEuropean Union and Ukraine. Now, I think clearly a majority, if you \ntake the Crimea out, wants to associate with the European Union. Putin \nis saying hell no. So the Ukrainian people in the coming months are \ngoing to make a move toward the European Union and alliances with NATO, \nmost likely, and the Russians are going to try to stop them.\n  I fear the way they will choose to stop them is not to try to \ninfluence the vote but to try to grab some eastern cities where you \nwill have vocal minority Russian populations saying: Come here and help \nyour fellow Russians. We are being absorbed by a bunch of thugs in \nKiev. Senator McCain made a good point while we are talking. The theory \nof the case for Russia is: We have a legitimate right to go into this \narea to protect native Russians, ethnic Russians. That has no limit in \nthat region.\n  If we adopt the theory of the case, ignore international law, let him \nbreak the 1994 agreement with no punishment for taking the Crimea, then \nI hope you understand what comes next. The theory of this case can \napply to many countries in the region, not just Crimea and the Ukraine. \nSo we need to reject this theory of the case.\n  We need to make him pay a price for what he has done, not what he \nmight do. If he does not pay a price for what he has done, I can assure \nyou what he will do. He will do more. The last thought is that Senator \nMcCain and I and Senator Ayotte have been talking about the Al Qaeda \nbuildup in Syria.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has testified before the \ncountry as a whole, before the Congress, that the Al Qaeda elements in \nSyria are representing a direct threat to our European allies and to \nour own homeland. There was a press report yesterday: What is your \nCongress and your Commander in Chief doing about it?\n  We have been told as Members of the Senate that the 26,000-plus Al \nQaeda fighters, many of them European, some American, are amassing in \nSyria. Al Qaeda leaders from the tribal regions in Afghanistan and \nPakistan are moving into Syria to organize this cabal. One of the goals \nthat they would like to achieve is to take this force that is in the \nfight in Syria and disperse it back to Europe and the United States.\n  What are you doing about this threat, Mr. President? Members of the \nSenate, you have been told--11, 12 years after 9/11--that Al Qaeda is \nthinking about hitting us again. They exist in a certain part of the \nworld. They are amassing capability. Their leaders are moving in to \nhelp organize this group. What is our response? What are we doing?\n  It is just not Ukraine. The whole world is melting down. I would end \nwith this thought. Ronald Reagan had a great slogan. It was not a \nslogan. It was a world view: Peace through strength. Here is what I \nwill say to the times in which we live, and I will talk about this more \nlater. I want to come with my colleagues and talk about the Al Qaeda \nthreat in Syria and elsewhere.\n  Peace is an illusion when it comes to radical Islam. It can never be \nachieved. But here is what can be achieved: security through strength. \nWe need to have as a Nation security policies, national security \npolicies that will deter aggression from nation-states and radical \nIslamic organizations who do not fear death. We have no such policy. We \nneed to have security through strength. We are cutting our military. We \nare gutting our ability to defend ourselves through reducing \nintelligence capabilities at a time when the threats are on the rise.\n  This is the most dangerous time in American history--since the end of \nthe Cold War, in many ways since the end of World War II--because the \nenemies of this Nation are getting stronger and we are getting weaker. \nSomebody needs to change that calculation before it is too late.\n  So to Senator McCain and Senator Ayotte, both of you have been to the \nUkraine in the last couple of weeks. You have done the hard work of \ntraveling away from your constituents and your families to find out \nfirst hand what is on the ground. I hope that people in the body will \nlisten to their experiences. There are a lot of Democrats who seem to \nhave the same experience.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague, and I appreciate his longstanding \nsupport for freedom and democracy throughout the world, but also for a \nvery prescient piece that he and Senator Lieberman wrote 6 years ago \npredicting the likelihood of the events that we have just observed \ntaking place. There is an article in the Washington Post: ``Three ways \nNATO can bolster Ukraine's security,'' by Ian Brzezinski. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2014]\n\n             Three Ways NATO Can Bolster Ukraine's Security\n\n                         (By Ian J. Brzezinski)\n\n       NATO's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has drawn a \n     red line, but it is one that leaves Ukraine militarily \n     isolated, fending for itself. If the West's economic and \n     diplomatic sanctions are to deter Moscow from further \n     military aggression, they must be complemented by a robust \n     defensive strategy to reinforce Ukraine's armed forces.\n       When Russia invaded Crimea, it mobilized 150,000 troops \n     along Ukraine's eastern frontier. Most of those forces still \n     menace Ukraine, with some 20,000 troops still occupying the \n     peninsula while provocateurs sent by Moscow continue to stir \n     unrest in the country's eastern regions.\n       NATO's response has, by contrast, been underwhelming. The \n     United States and Britain reinforced the air space of \n     Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with a handful of fighter jets, \n     and AWACs patrols fly over Poland and Romania. The United \n     States deployed about a dozen F-16s to Poland and sent an \n     additional ship to the Black Sea. No ally appears to have \n     mobilized any ground forces.\n       When Ukrainian Prime Minster Arseniy Yatsenyuk met with \n     President Obama this month, his request for weapons that \n     would enable his military to better defend against Russia's \n     massed forces was politely declined. Instead, the Obama \n     administration offered uniforms and military meals.\n       In a similarly negative move, Vice President Biden visited \n     Warsaw and Vilnius, Lithuania, last week to reassure them of \n     the U.S. military commitment to their security, but he \n     bypassed Kiev. This was surely noted by Moscow, as was \n     Obama's recent statement that he would not allow the United \n     States to get involved in a ``military excursion'' in \n     Ukraine.\n       These U.S. and alliance actions constitute a red line that \n     depicts Kiev on the outside and on its own. This must be \n     deeply disillusioning for Ukrainians who in recent months \n     have so courageously expressed their desire for freedom and a \n     place in Europe--and whose forces participated in a NATO \n     collective defense exercise as recently as November. This red \n     line can only reassure Vladimir Putin and his military \n     planners, whose use of unmarked military personnel--and the \n     plausible deniability they provided--in Crimea reflected at \n     least initial concern about potential responses from the \n     West.\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\n       There are prudent defensive measures the United States and \n     NATO can and should take to bolster Ukraine's security. \n     First, Yatsenyuk's request for military equipment should be \n     immediately approved, and anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons \n     should be included. Equipment and weapons could quickly be \n     transferred from prepositioned U.S. military stocks in \n     Europe.\n       If NATO cannot attain the consensus to initiate such \n     assistance, then Washington should forge a coalition of the \n     willing or act on its own. These weapons would complicate \n     Russian military planning and add risk to its operations \n     against Ukraine. U.S. equipment in particular would bring \n     back unpleasant memories of when Soviet forces encountered \n     Western weapons in Afghanistan.\n       Second, the alliance or a U.S.-led coalition should back \n     that assistance with the deployment of intelligence and \n     surveillance capabilities and military trainers to Ukraine. \n     This would provide not only needed situational awareness and \n     help the Ukrainian military maximize its defensive \n     capacities, but it would also force Moscow to consider the \n     potential political and military repercussions of any actions \n     that affect that presence. The deployment of military \n     trainers to Georgia was one of the more effective elements of \n     the U.S. effort to bolster Georgia's security after it was \n     invaded by Russia in 2008.\n       Third, NATO allies and partners should soon conduct a \n     military exercise in Ukraine as part of the effort to train \n     the Ukrainian military. The alliance's plan to wait until its \n     next scheduled exercise in Ukraine, this summer, could \n     incentivize Russia to take additional military action before \n     then.\n       The NATO Response Force, created to deploy on short notice \n     a brigade-level force backed by combat air support, is well \n     suited for such an exercise. The force offers a means to \n     demonstrate Western resolve prudently and rapidly. It has the \n     potential to significantly reinforce Ukraine's defense \n     against a sudden Russian offensive, but it is not big enough \n     to jeopardize Russia's territorial integrity.\n       Each of these initiatives would complicate Putin's \n     ambitions regarding Ukraine and could be executed in the near \n     term. None would present a threat to Russia. They would, \n     however, amend the red line the alliance has mistakenly \n     created, assure Ukrainians that they are not alone and force \n     Moscow to consider the possibility of a much more costly and \n     prolonged military conflict. The absence of a firm Western \n     response will only encourage Putin to act aggressively again, \n     be it to drive deeper into Ukraine, make another attempt to \n     seize Georgia, expand Russia's occupation of Moldovan \n     territory or grab other areas that were once part of the \n     Soviet Union.\n       NATO's response to this crisis is critical to both \n     Ukraine's security and the alliance's long-term future. A \n     NATO summit planned for September is to focus on the \n     alliance's way forward in a new world. But what it does to \n     assist Ukraine today and in the coming weeks will have a far \n     more profound influence on its future and transatlantic \n     security.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. It goes on to say:\n\n       These U.S. and alliance actions constitute a red line that \n     depicts Kiev on the outside and on its own. This must be \n     deeply disillusioning for Ukrainians who in recent months \n     have so courageously expressed their desire for freedom and a \n     place in Europe--and whose forces participated in a NATO \n     collective defense exercise as recently as November. This red \n     line can only reassure Vladimir Putin and his military \n     planners, whose use of unmarked military personnel--and the \n     plausible deniability they provided--in Crimea reflected at \n     least initial concern about potential responses from the \n     West.\n\n  One of the more remarkable returns to the days of the Soviet Union \nwas when Vladimir Putin had the press conference and was asked if those \nwere Russian military in Crimea, and he said: Well, they can buy old \nuniforms from most any store in the region.\n  He not only denied that Russian troops were there, but he added to \nthe flat-out lie with a statement so ridiculous that he must have known \nthat we knew that he was absolutely lying through his teeth. Let me \njust say to my colleagues what we need to do is we must recognize the \nreality that President Putin is not, and will never be, our partner. He \nwill always insist on being our adversary and working to revise the \nentire post Cold War vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace--and \nthe security architecture that supports it. Our policy must begin with \nthe reality of what Vladimir Putin is, what his ambitions are, and what \nhe is willing to do.\n  We have to support Ukraine's emergence as a successful democracy with \na thriving economy, fighting corruption, and with a strengthened \nnational unity. We must ensure that the March elections in Ukraine \noccur on time, freely, and fairly. We must meet Ukraine's request for \nimmediate military assistance as part of a larger, long-term initiative \nto help the Ukrainian armed forces rebuild and reform into an effective \nforce that can deter aggression and defend their nation; support \ncountries such as Moldova and Georgia in deepening democratic, \neconomic, and military reforms that can hasten their integration into \nthe Euro-Atlantic community; expand sanctions under the Magnitsky Act; \nincrease targeted sanctions against Putin's sources of power, \nespecially for corruption; push for an arms embargo against Russia; \nprevent defense technology transfers; use the upcoming NATO summit to \nenlarge the alliance; move Georgia into the Membership Action Plan; \nexpand NATO cooperation with Ukraine; conduct significant contingency \nplanning within NATO to deter aggression and defend alliance members, \nespecially along the eastern flank; strategically shift NATO military \nassets eastward to support deterrence.\n  We must take these actions. None of them, by the way, entail the \ncommitment of American troops. I also want to make one additional \ncomment. I hope that the Senator from New Hampshire would comment as \nwell. Whenever I see a news story--no matter which network it is on--\nthe overwhelming majority of American people do not want to have \nanything to do with Syria.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans do not want to have anything \nto do with Ukraine. We do not even want to assist the people of \nUkraine. We do not want to assist the people of Syria that are fighting \nand struggling--140,000 of whom have been slaughtered already in the \nmost atrocious fashion. I say to my colleagues and to the American \npeople: We cannot ignore the lessons of history. We cannot revert to \nthe 1930s when isolationist impetus in this country kept us out of \nbeing prepared for a conflict.\n  If it had not been for Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the actions he \ntook in the late 1930s, we would have had an even worse time after \nPearl Harbor. It is up to the President of the United States to inform \nthe American people of what our vital national security interests are. \nThat does not mean involvement in another war.\n  But we cannot leave the world because the world will not leave us. So \nthe President of the United States--rather than announcing that if the \nRussians go any further there will be punishment for it, the President \nof the United States needs to go before the American people and say: \nHere is what we are facing. We are facing what Senator Graham just \ntalked about: the rise of Al Qaeda across the Middle East; the failure \nin Syria, which is now becoming a breeding ground for Islamic \nextremism; the Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea; the \nIranian talks which are ``failing;'' and of course this latest and most \noutrageous aggression committed by Vladimir Putin.\n  The world is a dangerous place. It cries out for American leadership. \nAs Lindsey Graham said, there was a guy, in the words of Margaret \nThatcher, who won the Cold War without firing a shot. It is called \npeace through strength. It is through being steadfast.\n  Right now, when the Chinese announced that they are increasing their \ndefense spending by 12.2 percent, we are announcing that we are cutting \nour defense dramatically. That is a long series of cuts in defense, \nwhich can put this Nation's national security interests further in \ndanger.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for going to Kiev. It is an \nuplifting and wonderful experience to see how much they want to be like \nus, how much they appreciate what little we do, how much it matters to \nthem to be able to be part of Europe and free, and to have an economic \nsystem that is not beset with the corruption and kleptocracy that \ndevastated their economy.\n  They need our help. I hope tomorrow we will be passing legislation \nwhich will be the first step in providing that assistance to this \nNation. I say to my colleagues, the people of Ukraine will be watching \nus. They are watching what we do. The sooner we guarantee $1 billion of \nloan guarantees to them, the sooner we impose these sanctions which are \nembodied in this bill in a bipartisan fashion, the better it will be \nfor the people of Ukraine to know that we stand with them.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I want to thank the senior Senator from \nArizona for his leadership and to really frame what Ronald Reagan said. \nIt is\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\nso important at this moment. He said: Of the four wars in my lifetime, \nnone came about because the U.S. was too strong. So when we talk about \npeace through strength, we are talking about ensuring that we do not \nhave to get involved in another conflict. Before I went to Ukraine I \nwas in Afghanistan. One of the commanders that I was speaking with in \nAfghanistan said to me: You know, Senator Ayotte, I worry about \nAmerica's span of attention. I am worried. I have fought here. I have \ndone multiple tours here. We sacrificed here. I am really worried. I \nunderstand how people at home view where things are in Afghanistan. But \nfor us just to throw our hands up right now and what that will do--I am \njust worried that we are forgetting the lessons of what happened on \nSeptember 11, when we thought that we did not have to be engaged, when \nwe thought that the fight could stay over here and that this country \nAfghanistan, which was a haven for Al Qaeda, that they would just leave \nus alone.\n  Unfortunately, in this fight with Al Qaeda, they won't leave us \nalone. Now we are facing a situation in Syria where our Secretary of \nHomeland Security or our Director of National Intelligence has said the \nthreat of Al Qaeda in Syria is a threat to our homeland.\n  As we look at events unfolding around the world, what is happening in \nUkraine does matter to the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say in order that we don't have to deal with wars \nhere and that we hopefully don't have to send our men and women in \nuniform to war, we have to maintain a strong position in the United \nStates and Ukraine using the strongest sanctions we can, having a \nprepared military, and supporting our allies to ensure that we don't \nfall back into forgetting the lessons we have seen. When America \ndisengages, it becomes dangerous for America. That is what this is \nabout.\n  I am pleased we are going to pass bipartisan legislation to support \nUkraine. I ask the President to issue even stronger sanctions against \nRussia, Vladimir Putin, and to ensure we stand with the people of \nUkraine, because when we stand with them we stand for ourselves as well \nand what we believe in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Yesterday, healthcare.gov saw about 1.2 million visits to \nthe site. The call centers, which are busy enrolling people at a pace \nthat is now exceeding 50,000 to 100,000 people a day, saw 390,000 phone \ncalls.\n  A new poll just came out suggesting that a full 60 percent of \nAmericans want the Affordable Care Act to stay in place, and if they \nwant changes, they only want minor changes. Only 11 percent of people \nin this poll said they want to repeal and replace the law, and only 18 \npercent said they wanted to repeal it completely.\n  It is not rocket science to figure out why we have hundreds of \nthousands of people lining up as we approach the deadline for \nenrollment seeking to get care. It is not rocket science why there are \nover 1 million people only yesterday alone going to the Web site trying \nto find out what their options are.\n  The simple fact is that even today, as we stand on the brink of the \nenrollment deadline, there are still millions of Americans who remain \non the outside of the best health care system in the world. There are \nstill millions of families who are waking up today, as they have week \nafter week, year after year, wondering how they are going to pay the \nmedical bills that are piling up for a sick father and worrying what \nwould happen if their child were diagnosed with a disease, having no \nway to pay for it. That is a reality still today for millions of \nfamilies. Many of them, frankly, have stayed away from the Web site \nbecause of the misinformation that has been spread by opponents of the \nhealth care law.\n  Now as we are coming to the enrollment deadline, we are seeing a \nsurge of interest, much of it from families who are desperate to \nfinally get access to health care insurance that will allow them to \navoid the fate of millions of other Americans who have fallen into \nbankruptcy, have lost their homes, have lost their cars, and who have \nlost their savings simply because of a mistimed illness.\n  I was pleased today to see the President make a very simple \nannouncement. What he said is that people who are in line trying to \napply for health care insurance when the deadline hits on Monday are \ngoing to get a shot to complete their application.\n  For very complex cases, for instance, women who are in a situation of \nextreme domestic violence who don't want to apply jointly and have to \napply themselves, they are going to be able to have a little extra time \nas well. For most of the people I represent, that is just common sense.\n  If someone is desperately in need of health care and if they have \ngone months, years, and maybe even decades without health care and they \nhave this chance--a chance that will expire Monday this year--then if \nthey are in line trying to fill out an application, they should be able \nto get through that application even if the midnight clock hits.\n  I heard my friend from Wyoming speak on the floor earlier today and \ncriticize this announcement from the President. I thought it was \nworthwhile to come to the floor and make it clear that if someone is \ncriticizing a simple decision to allow people a little bit of extra \ntime, they are essentially rooting for people to stay outside of the \nranks of those who are insured. They are essentially guaranteeing that \npeople who could get insurance, because they have the ability now over \nthe course of the next few days to sign up, aren't going to be able to \nget it.\n  Of course, I think people understand this concept because there is \nplenty of precedent. When folks rush home from work late on election \nday to go vote, they often see very long lines outside of the polling \nplace. But we don't shut down the polls at 8 o'clock when there is a \nline outside. We allow people who are in line to vote because they \nworked hard to get there, to get in line. They deserve a chance to \nexpress their choice in an election. That is essentially what the \nPresident has announced today, that individuals who are in line on \nMarch 31 are going to get a chance to sign up, because why on Earth \nwould we deny people the ability to get insurance? I get it that there \nare people who oppose this law, who want it repealed, and many people \nof good faith who want it replaced with something else. But the reality \nof here and now is that there are millions of people who are going onto \nthe Web site every day. There are hundreds of thousands of people who \nare calling, and they deserve a chance to get health care insurance, to \nbe able to treat their loved ones for the diseases that they have today \nor may incur.\n  I would note that there is precedence to this. When President Bush \nwas managing the enrollment process for Medicare Part D, he did, in \nfact, the same thing. He extended the enrollment deadline for people \nwho were in process and for complex cases. People who were trying to \nsign up for Medicare Part D at the enrollment deadline received extra \ntime, and there were plenty of Republicans who supported that effort.\n  I come to the floor today to make it clear that for a lot of folks it \nmakes sense that if people are so desperate for health care and they \nare in the process of filling out these applications, they should get \nthe chance to finish the job.\n\n  I am continuing to receive letters and emails from people who have \ngone through the process and whose lives have been transformed. I \nsimply want to make sure that on Monday, if people are in the process \nof signing up, they don't get foreclosed from the possibility of \nexperiencing a reality such as one of my constituents, Sean Hannon, \nfrom Weston, CT. I will finish by reading a letter he sent to our \noffice.\n  Speaking for himself and his wife he said:\n\n       As working freelancers, my wife and I are not covered by \n     company health plans and we have had to buy private health \n     insurance out of pocket. It has been our largest financial \n     burden. Last year, our monthly premium for Golden Rule was \n     $1,216. That came to $14,592 annually. This plan also came \n     with a huge deductible that needed to be met completely \n     before any payout.\n       This year, Golden Rule increased our premium to $1,476 a \n     month, or $17,712 annually.\n       On February 1, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we were \n     able to switch from Golden Rule to Connecticare on the CT \n     Exchange.\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\n     It wasn't easy to go through enrollment, but we had great \n     assistance from a woman at the enrollment center in New \n     Haven, and she stuck with us until we got it right.\n       Let me tell you what the new healthcare plan has done for \n     us . . .\n       First and foremost, we lowered our monthly premium of \n     $1,475 to $309. Let me spell that out so you know it wasn't a \n     typo: three hundred and nine dollars. That is a savings of \n     nearly 80%!\n       So now I am sure you are thinking that we must have made a \n     huge sacrifice in quality of care or services. Just the \n     opposite. We have lost none of the benefits we previously \n     had. We were able to keep all of our doctors, our primary GP \n     and specialists. They all accept the insurance.\n       While we still have a high deductible, unlike the previous \n     plan that didn't pay anything until the deductible was met, \n     we now have co-pays for doctor visits of $30, and procedures \n     such as CAT scans and MRIs are $75 for each visit, and the \n     remainder of the expense is covered COMPLETELY, even before \n     the deductible is met.\n       And we have the peace of mind of not being dropped or \n     penalized for pre-existing conditions.\n\n  They finish by saying:\n\n       Despite the messed up rollout and the attendant growing \n     pains of a massive program, ObamaCare has been a Godsend, and \n     we are overwhelmed and ecstatic over the dramatic difference \n     this has made in our family budget.\n       We are sharing all of this personal information here \n     because there is an aggressive campaign underway to dismantle \n     this valuable program. The misinformation being put out there \n     is skewing public opinion and this must not happen. . . . \n     This treasure is ours to lose if we do not speak up now.\n\n  Yesterday 1.2 million people went to the Web site and 400,000 people \ncalled in to seek help. I imagine those numbers will continue to \nescalate as we move through the weekend. They deserve to be able to get \nto a reality that Sean Hannon and his family are experiencing now. They \ndeserve to have a chance at paying lower premiums, 80 percent savings, \nfor some individuals, to finally get insured for the diseases, \nillnesses, and conditions that have plagued these families for years.\n  I applaud the President for allowing these families the ability to \ncomplete their applications, and I hope that many of them get to see \nthe same final reality that the Hannons of Weston, CT, have.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, having heard my \ncolleague's concerns and story of a family who was helped by the \nPresident's health care law. We want people in this country to be \nhelped. My concern is there are a lot of people who are actually being \nhurt by the President's health care law. We shouldn't have to hurt \npeople, specifically people who have had insurance, to try to help \npeople who haven't had insurance. That is the big concern that my \nfriend from Connecticut referred to as I came to the floor this morning \nto discuss.\n  I have grave concerns about the impact on the people of Wyoming and \nall around the country as we are getting letters and concerns. We were \ntold on the floor that all of these stories--nine of us were reading \ndifferent stories--that all of these are lies.\n  These are not lies. These are people hurt by the President's health \ncare law. We see them in States all around the country.\n  We don't know how many people have signed up, how many have gone to \nthe Web site. The White House can't even tell us if they know how many \nhave insurance.\n  Sure, they may have had a lot of people visit the Web site. I wonder \nhow many people have actually paid to have insurance? What the \nPresident asked for is he said: We are going to get 30 million people \nwho didn't have insurance to have insurance.\n  It looks as if there may be fewer than 2 million who go through that. \nWe know that fewer than 1 in 10 young people--the people who are \nsupposed to pay for this program--young people paying more so that \nolder, sicker people will pay less, those people aren't signing up. \nOnly 1 in 10 of those eligible at that age is signing up.\n  That is what we are seeing across the country, and that is why the \nworry is that there is going to need to be a big bailout of this \nprogram because the money that is being spent by the taxpayers is not \ngetting the job done. They are not doing it in a way to actually help \nthe people who need help without hurting so many other people, the 5 \nmillion people who received letters of cancellation.\n  I hear my friend and colleague from Connecticut. It is not only \npeople--one person who may have gotten insurance in Connecticut who may \nhave been helped in that situation. The impact on jobs and communities \nhas been dramatic. When I looked at the State of Connecticut, there was \na story in the New York Times only last month about the impact of this \nlaw that my colleague and friend has voted for that has now been \nchanged over two dozen times. They are interviewing a superintendent of \nschools in Meriden, CT.\n  We just heard a story of somebody who was helped by the health care \nlaw. Now let's look at what has happened to the superintendent of \nschools in Meriden, CT, Mark Benigni. He is also a board member of the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators.\n  In an interview with the New York Times, he said that the new health \ncare law was having ``unintended consequences for school systems across \nthe Nation.''\n  We have a letter from somebody in Connecticut, but let's see what \nhappened to school systems across the country. Maybe they have children \nin school, I don't know.\n  The article states:\n\n       In Connecticut, as in many States, significant numbers of \n     part-time school employees work more than 30 hours a week and \n     do not receive health benefits.\n\n  We know the health care law defines a workweek as anything above 30 \nhours. They have people who are working part time with more than 30 \nhours, and  according to the health care law those are full-time \nemployees. So they have workers with more than 30 but who do not \nreceive health benefits, and he says:\n\n       Are we supposed to lay off full-time teachers so that we \n     can provide insurance coverage to part-time employees?\n\n  That is a question asked by the superintendent of schools in a town \nin central Connecticut. He says:\n\n       If we have to cut five reading teachers to pay for the \n     benefits for substitute teachers, I'm not sure that would be \n     best for our students.\n\n  The impact of this health care law and the mandate and the costs go \nway beyond the health care of an individual or a family or a community. \nIt goes to so many other things, including the education of our young \npeople. And those are some of the tradeoffs and the unintended \nconsequences that have developed since passing a 2,700-page health care \nlaw.\n  Whether they delay the signup date to allow more people to sign up, \nas a doctor, my concern is for those people who do sign up, what kind \nof care are they going to get. Are they going to be able to keep their \ndoctor, which the President promised. The deadline date is less \nimportant than the kind of care people can get with the insurance they \nare mandated to buy as a result of the health care law, and pay a lot \nmore than they would have paid had the law not been passed. Will they \nbe able to keep their doctor? Will they be able to see a doctor?\n  We know there is a shortage coming of about 90,000 physicians, half \nof them specialists, half of them primary care physicians around the \ncountry. This is coming in the next 5 or 6 years. We know the things \nthat are happening along those lines with not enough nurses, not enough \nphysician assistants, not enough EMTs, paramedics--across the board not \nenough people to take care of the population of this country. Having \ninsurance is not enough to provide care.\n  The President made promises that are not being kept. That is a \nconcern I have when I hear the deadline is extended. My concern is what \nhappens after they sign up. Will they be able to get the care they \nneed?\n  Last week, the Associated Press reported the results of a poll of all \nthese different cancer hospitals. My wife is a cancer survivor, so I \nknow how important it is for people to have the peace of mind to get \nthe care they need. Of the 19 hospitals that responded to the \nAssociated Press, only 4 of the 19 said, yes, they will be able to \naccept all of the plans of the people who are signing up on the Web \nsite in those States where those hospitals are located. So it is not \njust a matter of keeping your own doctor, but it is getting the doctor \nyou need at a time of family crisis, personal family concern--the time \nwhen people are most vulnerable. Will the\n\n[[Page S1758]]\n\nfact they have some coverage bought through a Web site actually help \nthem get the care they need? And will the doctor who happens to see \nthem--even if they are able to keep their own doctor--be able to spend \nthe time interacting with the patient or, with all the additional \npaperwork and time-consumption activities, will the doctor have to cut \nthe visit short, spend time looking more at the computer screen than \nlooking at the patient? There are complaints in every State of the \nUnion from patients who are complaining either to their doctor or the \nnurse at the office or at the checkout area of the office saying, you \nknow, I would have liked to have had the doctor look more at me and not \nso much at the computer screen.\n  There are many components of this health care law that are harmful to \nhealth care delivery and to patient care in this country, and so the \nPresident decides to unilaterally delay a part of the law that this \nlast week or the week before the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nsaid will not be done; this is the deadline; this is it. When is the \nlaw not the law anymore? When it is just Swiss cheese? When do you \ntrust somebody, take them at their word? Words have meanings.\n  It is time for this President and this administration to actually \nrealize the American people see what is happening. Each time they do a \ndelay or do a change or do this or that, it has a huge impact on \npeople's lives as they try to decide what to do and what matters and \nwhat doesn't matter under this administration. People are very \ndisappointed as a result of the health care law. Those who were looking \nfor something better haven't found it.\n  We still don't know how many people actually have paid for insurance. \nWe may know how many went to the Web site, but we don't know how many \nof those who bought insurance through the Web site actually had their \nown insurance and got one of those letters--of the 5 million people who \ngot letters of cancellation--canceling their insurance or how many were \nuninsured.\n  It looks as though the Web site doesn't even want to look into that. \nOn the paper application there is actually a box to check off. It says: \nI didn't have insurance but now I am going to get it. The Web site left \nthat off. I don't know if that was ineptitude on the part of the \ndesigners of the Web site or if it was left off or fell through the \ncracks in the disastrous rollout. I don't know, but it wasn't there. So \nthe administration, which said our goal is that of the 30 million \npeople who do not have insurance, getting them insured, will never know \nthe answer to that. Then there is the question of who are these folks, \nin terms of young or old, sick or not sick. And we know of those \neligible, only about 1 in 10 has signed up.\n  But the big concern is--regardless of some of these things the \nPresident is doing to delay this and let others sign up or not sign up \nfor a bit of time--what kind of care are they going to get? Whether \nthey are insured through the Web site this week, next week, or the week \nafter, what kind of care is going to be available to them? And what \nhappens when they find the cost of the care--as for so many people I \nhear from in Wyoming--is much higher than they were paying before? And \nif they had a policy they liked--or are still finding, if they didn't \nhave insurance--many of them still think the rates are unaffordable.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous consent Request--H.R. 3521\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor again to try to move \nforward on a bill with near unanimous support. In fact, with regard to \nthe actual substance of the bill, within the four corners of the bill, \nit has unanimous support because it would advance 27 community-based \nhealth care clinics for veterans in the VA system immediately, around \nthe country, which would serve hundreds of thousands of veterans in \ncommunities that absolutely need this type of expanded community-based \nclinic. Two are in my State--one in Lafayette, one in Lake Charles, LA.\n  All of these community-based clinics--including the ones in Lafayette \nand Lake Charles--have been fully authorized by the VA and throughout \nthe process. They have been on the books. We have been planning on them \nand moving forward with them for some time. But they have hit a series \nof bureaucratic glitches.\n  For the Lafayette and Lake Charles facilities in particular, first \nthey hit a big VA glitch when the VA just screwed up--and those are \ntheir words, not mine--just screwed up in the letting process to put \nout contracts to locate land and to build or lease these facilities. \nBecause of that bureaucratic mistake, the VA lost a whole year in the \nprocess in terms of moving forward with these clinics that are fully \napproved, fully authorized.\n  During that year of delay, out of the blue CBO decided to score how \nthese clinics are financed differently than it ever did before. I won't \ngo into the weeds, but suffice it to say that under this new scoring \nmethod, it created a scoring issue, which it never did before. Well, \nthat was an additional hurdle and additional point of delay to which we \nhad to respond. We overcame it with a proposal that ensures the VA \nfunds and handles this correctly so there is no scoring issue. The bill \npassed the House nearly unanimously. In fact, the vote in the House was \n346 to 1. As the Presiding Officer knows, not much passes either body \nnearly unanimously, but this did with very widespread bipartisan \nsupport, 346 to 1. This is the bill which has come over here to get \nfinal approval.\n  With the addition of an amendment to help pay for any costs \nassociated with the bill--and the amendment has been fully vetted and \nis supported in a bipartisan way--with the addition of an amendment, we \nhave no opposition here in the Senate on the actual substance of my \nproposal, on moving forward with these 27 important VA clinics around \nthe country, two of which are in Louisiana.\n  Unfortunately, the only objection that appears to reside here in the \nSenate is from the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, who does not \nobject to this bill as amended, who does not object to the substance \nwithin the four corners of this bill, but who simply wants his much \nbigger, much broader VA bill passed. I applaud his passion to advocate \nfor it, but there is significant concern with that much bigger, much \nmore complicated proposal. There are 43 Senators, including myself, who \nhave very significant concerns about that proposal.\n  I think it is really unfortunate for him to block something where \nthere are no concerns--it has been vetted, it has bipartisan support, \nand every conceivable substantive issue has been worked out--simply to \nhold that as hostage for a much broader bill that has concerns and \nopposition from almost half of the Senate, 43 Senators. So I hope we \ncan avoid that, and I come to the floor to ask for unanimous consent.\n  I think the American people want us to work together. I think the \nAmerican people want us to agree on things we can agree on. There is a \nlot to fight about, there is a lot to wrestle with, there is a lot to \ndisagree about, and we should work on that stuff too, toward an \nagreement. I am open to doing so with Senator Sanders. But in the \nmeantime, I firmly believe the American people want us to agree where \nwe do agree. Don't create disagreements that don't exist. They want us \nto move forward where we can move forward. They want us to make \nprogress where we can and keep working on the rest.\n  In that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of my bill, H.R. \n3521, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that my \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object.\n\n[[Page S1759]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I appreciate the interest my colleague \nfrom Louisiana has on this very important issue. I agree with him that \nwe want to expand VA health care, that we have run into a bureaucratic \nmorass, and there are 27 facilities in 18 States that can and should be \napproved. If the Senator from Louisiana is prepared to join with me, we \ncan pass his concern today or within the next couple of weeks, along \nwith many other provisions the veterans community is deeply concerned \nabout.\n  During the last government shutdown, it is not widely known but the \ntruth is that we were 7 to 10 days away from a situation where \nveterans--disabled veterans, veterans who have pensions--were not going \nto get their benefits. The comprehensive bipartisan legislation that \nreceived 56 votes here on the floor--unfortunately, not the vote from \nmy colleague from Louisiana but 56 votes, and we are working to get the \n60 votes we need to overcome a Republican point of order, and we are \ngoing to get those 60 votes--makes sure we do have advanced \nappropriations so no disabled veteran will not get a check in the event \nof another government shutdown.\n  My colleague from Louisiana may or may not think that is an important \nissue. I don't know. I think it is an important issue. And I can tell \nhim the reason the legislation I introduced has the support of the \nAmerican Legion--and, by the way, 500 of them were here this morning at \na very interesting hearing--has the support of the VFW, the DAV, the \nVietnam Veterans of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica, Gold Star Wives of America, and virtually every organization \nis because they understand that the veterans community has very serious \nproblems we have to address.\n  My friend from Louisiana may or may not have concerns about making \nsure that every veteran gets their benefits in an expedited way and \nthat we don't have this backlog. Our legislation addresses that. My \nfriend from Louisiana may or may not be concerned that there are \nveterans who want to take advantage of the post-9/11 GI bill--which \nover 1 million people are now having advantage of--and are having \nproblems with getting instate tuition. Our legislation addresses that. \nOur legislation for the first time makes sure dental care will be part \nof VA health care. Our legislation addresses the reprehensible \nsituation faced by many women and men in the military who had to deal \nwith sexual assault. We think they should get the care they need. And \non and on and on.\n  So we have a comprehensive piece of legislation which is supported by \nvirtually every veterans organization in this country. We received 56 \nvotes--1 person was absent who would have voted for it--57 votes, and \nwe are now working with some of our Republican colleagues to make sure \nwe get the 60 votes. And I say to my colleague from Louisiana, work \nwith us. Bring some of your other colleagues on board. Please don't \ntell me this is too expensive. If it is too expensive to take care of \nour veterans, then let's not go to war in the first place.\n  So I give my colleague from Louisiana the opportunity now to do \nsomething really extraordinary, to do something the veterans' committee \nwants.\n  I object to the proposal from my colleague from Louisiana, and in its \nplace I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 297, S. 1950; that a Sanders substitute \namendment, the text of S. 1982, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and \nBenefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act, be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  If we pass this right now, we deal with the Senator's concerns and a \nlot of other concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request of the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I object on behalf of 43 Senators, \nincluding myself.\n  Reclaiming the floor and reclaiming my time, I would say we all want \nto work very hard to help veterans. We all acknowledge that the health \ncare and work claim backlog issues are extremely important. That is why \nI am very involved in all of those issues across the board. That is \nwhy, for instance, I am an active member of the claims backlog working \ngroup, working with the VA to improve that situation and proposing \nfocused legislation. We all care very much about that.\n  But right now Senator Sanders' comprehensive bill has significant \nconcerns in opposition--43 Senators, over 40 percent of the whole body. \nI do object on behalf of myself and the rest of those folks. I do \ncommit to continuing to work on those issues, but I also express real \nregret that when this body is very divided on the important details of \nthat bill--and the details do matter--we don't come together on \nsomething we agree on, and we can't accomplish a few important steps at \na time.\n  Perhaps Senator Sanders thinks that if we do this, somehow it takes \naway momentum for his larger bill. I think that is nonsense. These 27 \nclinics in 18 States are important, but they are a trivial part of that \nbroader bill. They are a trivial part of all of the proposals in that \nbroader bill. I don't think it takes away any momentum in any way, \nshape, or form for that broader bill. I will continue to be just as \ncommitted and just as interested in VA health care issues and working \ndown the claims backlog and everything else. These clinics are a tiny \npart of that. So he doesn't lose any advantage. He doesn't lose any \nmomentum. We could move forward on something we do agree on and build \nfrom there. I think that is more reasonable and more constructive.\n  There is literally no disagreement among any of us in this body about \nthese clinics. I have worked hard with several other colleagues to \naddress every question and every concern out there. The amendment at \nthe desk erases some of those concerns. We have covered the waterfront \non this clinics issue in particular.\n  I am very disappointed that we can't move forward as a first step and \nagree on what we agree on. We disagree on enough. Let's agree on what \nwe agree on. Let's move forward on what we agree on and pass these 27 \nclinics and start that progress and certainly continue to work on \nimportant compromise on the much bigger piece represented by the \nSanders bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use leader time \nfor a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Wyoming has come to \nthe floor several times recently talking about the fact that examples \nhe and other Republicans have given dealing with ObamaCare, examples \nthey think are bad, I call lies. That is simply untrue. I have never \ncome to the floor, to my recollection, and said a word about any of the \nexamples Republicans have given regarding ObamaCare and how it is not \nvery good. But I have come to the floor--I think my friend, the junior \nSenator from Wyoming, must be getting mixed up about what I have said \nabout the Koch brothers and what they have done regarding health care. \nBut it is easy to get mixed up because I think it is hard to separate \nthe Koch brothers from the Republican caucus, anyway.\n\n  Mr. President, I have asserted and I will continue to assert that the \nKoch brothers are trying to buy America, and they are doing it in a \nnumber of different ways. They don't believe in Social Security. They \ndon't believe in minimum wage. They don't believe in benefits--\nunemployment benefits. They don't believe in environmental laws. As you \nknow and read in the paper, they have a chemical plant. They were fined \nabout $400,000 over the last week or 10 days and ordered to pay about \n$50 million to bring it up to standard because it was deleterious to \nthe health of people in the area.\n  The Koch brothers are running false and misleading ads all around the \ncountry against Democratic Senators dealing with health care. Do they \ncare about health care? Of course not. These are false and misleading \nads, and they have gone so far as to have actors there pretending they \nare from the States,\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\nand they not only have done that in one State; they used the same actor \nin different States. So the record should be very clear. Yes, I have \ncalled many, if not most, of the anti-Obama ads by the Koch brothers \nfalse and misleading because they are.\n\n\n                       Vote on Cooper Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Then he came back and \nwas head of the political science department at Oklahoma State \nUniversity--kind of an unusual combination.\n  Joe Westphal is one who has had a career in academia--and I don't \nreally care that much about that, except for his two exposures in \nOklahoma--but he also was the chancellor at the University of Maine, he \ntaught public policy as the adjunct professor at Georgetown University, \nand he has been a Capitol Hill professional staff member for a long \ntime. He actually was on the House Budget Committee for a long period \nof time. He was also a special assistant to our Senator Thad Cochran, \nalthough this has been some time ago.\n  In the executive branch, Joe served as the Army assistant secretary, \nthen the Acting Secretary of the Army--that was 2001--and then as the \n30th Under Secretary of the Army for the past 5 years.\n  As I say, he is a good friend of mine. What is different about him \nis, there are a lot of people who have a career, have a background in \nacademia, but then there are the ones who have shown they also have a \nheart--they have a reason for what they are doing and they have a love \nfor using the position they hold to help other people, and that is what \nJoe Westphal has done for a long period of time.\n  When Joe was Under Secretary--I think he was actually Acting \nSecretary of the Army--we were together in southern Oklahoma at Fort \nSill. Fort Sill is outside of Lawton, OK, in the southwestern part of \nthe State, and we had two schools down there, one called Geronimo and \nthe other was Sheridan. Not Sheraton, like the hotel chain, but the \nSheridan Indians, and we all know who Geronimo is. These were old \nschools. They are public schools, but the roofs leaked, and they had \nbeen around for a long period of time. The majority of the kids who \nwent to school there are the sons and daughters of our military people. \nAnd because of his heart, for them, we went down together and we looked \nat this and saw something could be done to help these kids. So we put \ntogether--and he did through the Army--using it, perfectly \nlegitimately, for the percentage of the population in the school who \nwere actually the sons and daughters of military people, and we built a \nschool that is now a model for schools and establishments that are in \nconjunction with large cities. It is something that now a lot of kids \nare very happy as they graduate from the Freedom Elementary School at \nFort Sill, OK. Oklahoma has at this school 1,000 servicemember \nchildren. So we replaced the old one for them.\n  I also remember when we had a request--and I am sure the Chair knows, \nbecause he has made requests of the bureaucracy before, and sometimes \nit takes longer than it would be otherwise, longer than it should \ntake--because we had a need in my State of Oklahoma for a museum to \nhave an old Huey helicopter that had been used in the military many \nyears ago. We tried everything we could to get that done, and one phone \ncall from this guy named Dr. Joseph William Westphal, and it was done.\n  I probably shouldn't say this to my Democratic friends over here, but \nI have been such a good friend of his, I was afraid to express myself \nfor fear President Obama might change his mind. But nonetheless he is \nnow up for confirmation--I understand we are going to do that by voice \nvote--and I can't imagine anyone wouldn't take advantage of the \nopportunity to vote for Dr. Joseph Westphal to be U.S. Ambassador to \nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Joseph W. Westphal to be Ambassador Extraordinary and \nPlenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/26/senate-section/article/S1761-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1761-S1770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT OF \n                   2014--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will resume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                         Remembering Kate Puzey\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the fifth \nanniversary of the tragic murder of a Georgia citizen who volunteered \nfor the Peace Corps, who traveled to West Africa to the nation of Benin \nand lost her life. She lost her life because she did the right thing--\nshe reported the abuse of children in a village school where she \ntaught.\n  The reason I have recently returned from Benin is that I have taken \nthis case on as a personal passion, to see to it that justice and some \nclosure comes to the family of this wonderful young lady. Her name was \nKate Puzey. Kate Puzey was top of her class, valedictorian, outstanding \nstudent, and she wanted to go out and save the world, to help the world \nand fulfill the dream John Kennedy professed in 1961 when he created \nthe Peace Corps.\n  So Kate Puzey went to Benin and she found that one of the village \nnatives in the village where she was teaching was abusing children in \nthe school where she was teaching. In this very remote area, she took \nthe only communication mechanism she had to report the violation of \nthese children to the appropriate authorities in Cotonou, Benin. \nUnfortunately, because those communications were not secure, a relative \nof the person she reported notified the person she had reported that he \nhad been reported. That night, in her hut in the Nation of Benin, her \nthroat was cut and she died. She died because she did the right thing.\n  This Senate, 2 years ago, joined me and Senator Boxer in passing the \nPeace Corps Protection Act, which is now named the Kate Puzey Peace \nCorps Volunteer Protection Act. This provides a mechanism and a way \nwhere Peace Corps volunteers can report violations or trauma of a \nsexual nature, gender-based violence, or any other type of violence \nagainst themselves or in any other place where they might be as a \nservant of the Peace Corps. Because of that, there are now ombudsmen \nand ways and mechanisms where\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\nour Peace Corps volunteers can safely report violations and damage and \nhave the protection not only of the United States but of the nation \nwhere they serve.\n  But back to the point of my trip to Benin, which took place this last \nweek. This was my second visit to Benin, because what I want to see is \na continuation of the investigation of the death of this young lady \nuntil there is a trial and closure available for her and her family, \njust as any of us would want were we the parent of a young lady who had \nlost her life on behalf of the United States of America.\n  I rise to pay particular tribute first to Secretary Kerry; to the \nUnited Nations' Samantha Power; to the State Department of the United \nStates of America; to Michael Raynor, the Ambassador in Benin; to Todd \nWhatley, the Deputy Chief of Mission; to Kevin Armstrong, the USAID \nDirector; to Billy Alfano, to Marilyn Gayton, and to Robert Freedom--\nBob Friedman--the Peace Corps representative in Benin, all of whom have \nmade the investigation and the fulfillment of bringing this case to a \nreality their top priority.\n  Three years ago, when I went to Benin for the first time, it was to \nencourage President Yayi of Benin to allow the United States to come in \nand assist in the investigation and the prosecution of the case--a rare \nthing to happen in a French colony which is governed by French law. To \nour credit and to President Yayi's credit he allowed the United States \nand Jennifer Dent, the FBI agent in charge in Lagos, to come in to \nBenin and begin assisting the investigation.\n  I went back last week during our break because it looked as though \nthe case was dying. It looked as though the intensity of the interest \nwas dying. And it was so important to me and for the family in my home \nState of Georgia to see to it we in some way finally bring closure, \neither right or wrong, for the terrible things that happened. I am \nhappy to report the visit was successful.\n  President Yayi spent over 4 hours with the family members and myself. \nHe committed the judiciary and the investigatory body in the Nation of \nBenin to accept the assistance of the U.S. FBI and our technology. \nDuring the course of our visit, he removed and separated the prisoners, \nas had been requested by the FBI, to see to it those who are being held \nand thought to be guilty in this case could no longer communicate in \nthe prisons where they were held.\n  I don't know what the ultimate result will be, and I want justice to \nbe done. I want the right person to be persecuted and prosecuted, and \nthe right person to pay the price, but I want closure for this family.\n  I want to thank the American Embassy, the State Department, and \nSamantha Power at the U.N. for the intensity they have put into this \ninvestigation, as well as the U.S. FBI, and in particular Victor Lloyd, \nspecial agent in Lagos, Nigeria, for all the time he has dedicated. We \nseem to be at a point where everything is coming together toward a \nprosecution and, ultimately, a trial. When that happens, it will happen \nprimarily because the U.S. Government, the people of the United States \nof America, both President Bush and President Obama, and all in this \nCongress have dedicated themselves to the interest of one child's \nlife--Kate Puzey.\n  It is important the people of this country know that we as a body \nwill come together behind any injured American, any loss of life, \nanybody who has deployed themselves on behalf of this country in the \nservice of peace and prosperity. They deserve to know the U.S. Congress \nand this U.S. Senate are standing ready to help.\n  But I am here in particular to pay tribute to the Embassy of Benin, \nto FBI Special Agent Victor Lloyd, and to all those who have helped and \nassisted in seeing to it the prosecution of the case in the murder of \nKate Puzey comes to a final conclusion. I am grateful for their service \nto America, grateful for what they have done for the Puzey family in \nGeorgia, and grateful that I live in a country that protects and loves \nthose who have represented our interests wherever it may be, on \nwhatever shore it may be, and in whatever country it may be.\n  May God bless America, may God bless the Peace Corps, and may God \nbless the family of Kate Puzey.\n  I yield back, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as I speak, all over the country \ntelephones are ringing. When the recipient of the call picks up, they \nare greeted by the friendly voice of a college recruiter from a for-\nprofit college or university. It is easy to go back to school, this \nrecruiter will tell those who answer the phone. In fact, we can sign \nyou up for Federal loans right now.\n  That is the key. These for-profit colleges and universities target \nindividuals who qualify for easy Federal money. Pell grants and GI bill \nbenefits are preferred. And all the promises sound so good to those who \nare receiving these phone calls. After all, going back to school is \nsupposed to be the path to success and more money in your life. But \nbefore they know what has hit them, these people who answered the phone \ncall from for-profit schools and universities find out they are taking \non more debt than they can even understand and may end up with a so-\ncalled education that is worthless.\n  That is what happened to Jaqueta Cherry from North Carolina. After \ntrying a community college, Jaqueta was lured by the kind voice on the \nother end of the phone and the fancy commercials on TV. She saw them in \nNorth Carolina. You see them across the United States. Get on a bus in \nChicago and look around at all the signs trying to lure young people on \nthose buses into for-profit colleges and universities.\n  Jaqueta said: The schools blew up my phone.\n  She enrolled at Everest College, which is part of the Corinthian \nCollege chain. The California attorney general is currently suing this \nchain of schools, and the Department of Education is investigating \nallegations that they lied to the Federal Government about their job \nplacements.\n  In the meantime, Jaqueta's living situation changed, and she had to \ndrop out and couldn't continue her studies at Everest. It wasn't long \nbefore she was tracked down by another for-profit school through a pop-\nup ad she clicked on, on the Internet. If someone is college age and \ngets on the Internet, they will see these ads bombarding them from for-\nprofit colleges and universities. She got a call the next day from the \nEducation Management Corporation's The Art Institutes and signed up for \nan online program.\n  After taking out more loans, Jaqueta found herself unable to continue \nher courses. Her roommate had moved out, left her with unpaid bills, \nand her only access to the Internet was a phone that was turned off 2 \ndays prior to her final exams. At that point she was thousands of \ndollars in debt with nothing to show for it. Guess what. The calls kept \ncoming. DeVry--the second or third largest for-profit school in the \nUnited States, based in Chicago, currently being investigated by the \nFederal Trade Commission for their advertising and marketing policies--\ncalled her, and then ITT Tech called her as well. They are being sued \nby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for pressuring students \ninto high-cost private loans.\n  The calls she gets from Everest and The Art Institutes these days are \nnot the kind voices they used to be. ``They're very mean and \nthreatening,'' she says. Not surprising. You see, Jaqueta is no longer \nan ATM machine from which they can draw Federal dollars.\n  For many years for-profit schools were allowed to operate relatively \nfreely and often one step ahead of the regulators. I am hopeful that \nwith the investigations I mentioned and the many others that are \noccurring State by State, we may be turning a corner. We need to hold \nthese schools--all schools but especially for-profit schools--\naccountable to taxpayers, who often subsidize up to 90 percent of their \noperations, and to students, who ultimately are their victims.\n  If we take all the Federal money that goes to for-profit colleges and \nuniversities and total it up, it is around $20 billion. This private \nsector group would be the equivalent of the ninth largest Federal \nagency in Washington. They\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\nsurvive on Federal money. The only thing different is, of course, their \nemployees aren't Federal employees and their CEOs make more money than \nany employee of the Federal Government could ever dream of.\n  There are a lot of agencies involved in looking at these for-profit \ncolleges and universities--Department of Education, Securities and \nExchange Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal \nTrade Commission, Department of Defense, and others. It is important \nthat they work together.\n  This morning I held a hearing in my Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. In front of me was the Secretary of the Navy, the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, and the Chief of Naval Operations, and \nwe talked about these schools. I can tell you in private what they told \nme. They are saddened at how many military families are lured into \nthese schools and waste their GI benefits, going online to places \ncalled the American Military University--boy, doesn't that sound \nofficial. That sounds like the real thing. It is another for-profit \nschool that just happened to pick a name which appeals to a lot of \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\n  A nephew of mine was a doorman right up here. Then he served in the \nArmy and was sent overseas to Afghanistan. I was so proud of him. He \ngot home safely. Then he was sent to Korea. He came home safely. Now he \nis out of the Army. He contacted me once and said: I have good news for \nyou. I avoided all those for-profit schools you warned me about, and I \nsigned up with the American Military University.\n  He didn't know any better. He thought for sure that this was real. It \nis really not. I advised him that there is one university from his home \nState, the University of Maryland, which has been offering courses to \nthe military for decades--and their hours are transferable when he \ncomes home.\n  Oh, he said. I should have thought of that.\n  What the Navy told us this morning is they are now sitting down with \nthe sailors and their families and saying: Think twice before you sign \nup for these for-profit schools. You are wasting your GI benefits on \nschools that could be worthless. Think twice about whether those hours \nare transferable when you get out of the service.\n  Sadly, there are too many American citizens--young people primarily \nand even members of the military--who were lured into these awful \nschools before anybody warned them.\n  Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and I are working on a bill we will \nintroduce next week to ensure that the agencies currently investigating \nall of these for-profit schools are coordinating their efforts. He and \nI teamed up on this issue a long time ago. It is going to be a shame \nwhen Senator Harkin retires from the Senate this year, but the for-\nprofit schools should know that the spotlight Tom Harkin turned on with \nhis committee hearings is going to continue even after he leaves.\n  An industry that receives more than $25 billion in Federal dollars \nand has such a terrible record needs aggressive oversight. We don't owe \nit to just the taxpayers who are coming up with $25 billion for these \nschools; we owe it to the students who are lured into these schools, \nlured into debt, and end up many times with nothing to show for it.\n  We need to keep three numbers in mind when we think about the for-\nprofit colleges and universities, and I always warn people that these \nthree numbers will be on the final, so listen closely.\n  Ten percent of the students who graduate from high school go to for-\nprofit colleges and universities; yet they receive 20 percent of all \nthe Federal aid to education because they cost twice as much. For-\nprofit colleges and universities account for 46 percent of all student \nloan defaults. So 10 percent of the students, 46 percent of the \ndefaults. Why? They charge too much, they lure these students deep into \ndebt, and the students can't finish school or end up with worthless \ndiplomas when they graduate.\n  The sad reality is that the Federal Government is complicit. We are \ncomplicit because we don't blow the whistle on these schools, which \nshould never, ever--never--qualify for Pell grants and Federal student \nloans.\n  There is a kicker. Unlike virtually every other debt you can incur in \nlife, student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. I have had \nstudents $150,000 in debt after 4 years in school and their lives are \nvirtually ruined. They had no idea what they were getting into. When \nthey were private loans, those loans grew geometrically whenever they \nfailed to pay. Where are those students today? They are living in their \nparents' basement. They cannot afford to get married, they cannot buy a \ncar, and if they get married, they cannot afford to have children. They \ncertainly cannot afford to borrow money to go to a real college or \nuniversity. They are stuck, and we ought to do something about it.\n\n  Student loans in this country are exploding. They are trapping \ngenerations of students such as Jaqueta in poverty, and they are \nhurting their opportunities for being full members in our society and \neconomy. We have to address head-on these for-profit colleges which are \na scourge on education. There are a few exceptions, but by and large \nthis industry with 46 percent of the student loan defaults is shameful.\n  Chairman Harkin is going to hold a hearing in the Senate HELP \nCommittee this week on the student loan programs. I am going to work \nwith him and submit some testimony. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island \nand Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and I are putting \ntogether a package of bills. We are going to address this issue from a \nlot of different perspectives. There is no reason a college student \nshould sign up for a private loan with higher interest rates and worse \nconditions for payback when they are still eligible for government \nloans which are more flexible and have lower interest rates. Yet some \nof these irresponsible schools steer their kids into private loans. The \nkids don't know any better, neither do their parents. Secondly, they \nend up loaning money to these students and to their families that they \nwill never, ever be able to pay back. Senator Reed says they ought to \nhave some skin in the game. At some point if they have been \noverextended in loans, they ought to have to eat some of those losses \nwhen the students cannot pay it back.\n  Senator Warren is tackling an even bigger issue about refinancing \ncollege loans. What is it all about? It is about giving a fair shot to \nthese families and these students. We are going to talk a lot about \nthis.\n  When I think of where I am today, it is because of my mother who \nchecked my report card every 6 weeks and told me I could always do \nbetter and because of that I ended up in college and law school and \nhere I stand. I borrowed money from the government to do it and \ncouldn't have done it otherwise. So I believe in education, and I \ncertainly believe kids from lower and middle-income families, when they \nneed to borrow money, should have that opportunity. What is happening \ntoday is out of hand. The debt we are piling on students and their \nfamilies is unconscionable, not just the for-profit schools but across \nthe board.\n  On this side of the aisle we believe these students deserve an \nopportunity, and they shouldn't be saddled with a debt that can \nliterally ruin their lives. We are going to be working on this issue as \npart of our effort this year to define what Congress can do to make \nthis a better nation for working families across the board to make sure \neveryone--everyone--has a fair shot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  We are 5 days away from the deadline to begin enrolling for health \ninsurance under the Affordable Care Act--5 days for folks who don't \nhave insurance now or want to see if they can find a better deal under \ntheir local marketplace or Federal marketplace under the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  We have heard the stories about the trouble with the Web site last \nOctober, but there are so many stories we haven't heard of people \nsuccessfully signing up now for health care coverage. Those are the \nstories we want to talk about, in terms of the millions of people who \nare finding, in fact, for the first time they can have peace of mind, \nknowing they can find affordable health insurance and not only from a \ncost standpoint.\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\n  Every woman who is able to get insurance now knows she is not going \nto be rated differently and have higher costs from the insurance \ncompany just because she is a woman--being a woman previously was \nsomehow a preexisting condition--or if she is wanting to have a baby, \nshe knows she can have her maternity care covered, which was not true \nfor millions of women. In fact, going to the private marketplace prior \nto health care reform, about 60 percent of the insurance policies \ndidn't cover something as important and basic as maternity care, \nunbelievably. So we are talking about people who are getting covered \nand people who have peace of mind, knowing they have affordable \ncoverage and they can't get dropped if they get sick.\n  In fact, now going forward, if anyone has a policy, they cannot get \ndropped just because they get sick. Anyone who has cancer or diabetes--\nchildren with juvenile diabetes or heart disease--all of the various \nconcerns and chronic diseases people have, knows they can find \ninsurance; that they will not be blocked from getting medical care and \nhealth insurance because of a preexisting condition.\n  So far over 5 million people have already enrolled in private health \ninsurance plans through the new marketplaces, including over 144,000 in \nmy home State of Michigan, people who are finally in a position where \nthey have peace of mind at night, knowing they have health insurance \nfor themselves and their families if somebody gets sick. If they need \npreventive care, they are not going to have out-of-pocket costs to get \nthe cancer screening, the mammogram, and other preventive care.\n  In Michigan 144,000 individuals have signed up for health care, which \nis nearly 16,000 more people than was actually predicted at this point \nin time, because people want and need affordable health care. This is \nnot a frill. We cannot control whether somebody in the family gets \nsick. Now there are things we can do to do our best to stay healthy, \nbut we never know when something is going to happen, no matter our age \nor our circumstance. We all understand. We all want to make sure our \nchildren are covered, whether they are 3 years old or 30 years old. We \nwant to make sure our moms and dads are covered, and we want to make \nsure we have coverage as a small business owner, that there is access \nto affordable coverage. People are signing up because this is personal \nfor them and for their families.\n  I wish to share success stories of three of my constituents today. \nThe first story is about LaNika, a 34-year-old volleyball coach from \nFlint, MI, who lived without health insurance for years while she \nfocused on developing her career path. She didn't think she needed \nhealth insurance because she was healthy. One day she had an accident. \nShe was playing volleyball, and she and another woman collided, leaving \nher with a concussion. We all know head injuries are serious. So she \nhad no choice but to go to the emergency room without having health \ninsurance.\n  By the way, we all know that people who go to the emergency room \nwithout health insurance get treated, as they should, and then \neverybody with insurance--this is the way we have done it for decades--\neverybody with insurance sees their rates go up to pay for folks going \ninto the emergency room, getting care in the most expensive way \npossible, which is going to the emergency room for care, rather than \nseeing a doctor.\n  In this particular case LaNika said this was her aha moment. After \ngoing to the ER, LaNika logged on to healthcare.gov to see if she could \nget covered. She entered her information, she compared plans, and she \nselected the best plan for her. She ended up selecting a silver plan \nfrom Michigan's largest health insurance company for less than $100 a \nmonth because of her income level.\n  The whole process, she said, took an hour. She said that getting her \ninsurance card was like a breath of fresh air because she knew that if \ndisaster struck again she would be covered. Peace of mind, as they say \nin the commercials, is priceless. Now she can go see a doctor without \nworrying about a bill she cannot afford to pay.\n  Another constituent, Jim, from Shelby, MI, shared his story too. He \nhad seen all the bad press, he said, on the Affordable Care Act on TV \nand social media and thought it wasn't worth it to sign up. He planned \nto sign his family up for COBRA coverage because he had worked and was \ngoing to sign up for COBRA to keep his former employer's coverage going \nbut found out that wasn't an option. He decided to give healthcare.gov \na try. After filling out his basic information, he saw how low his \ncosts for good coverage would be and he signed up his family. Because \nhe had such a positive experience, he began sharing it on Facebook so \nother people could see how easy it was to get covered. A recent post of \nhis read: ``There are only a few days left to sign up. Don't let this \nopportunity pass without taking a look,'' which is our message today. \nDon't let this opportunity pass without taking a look.\n  Another constituent, Bryan, from Okemos called my East Lansing office \nbecause he was upset that his health plan had been canceled. The \nreplacement plan he was offered by his insurer wasn't affordable. He \nlet us know how upset he was. He then asked what he was supposed to do.\n  We suggested he go to healthcare.gov to see if he could find a more \naffordable option that would meet his needs. He said he didn't have a \ncomputer. So we gave him the 1-800 number to call. He was skeptical, of \ncourse, that he would find a good plan. He expected to have to wait on \nthe phone for hours to talk to somebody, but we encouraged him to give \nit a try.\n  He called the office back shortly with some good news. He had called \nthe 1-800 number and someone answered right away. They were very \nfriendly and helpful, he said. They helped Bryan find a plan that had \nbetter coverage than his old plan. On top of that, it was $60 per month \ncheaper than his old plan, and he was able to add dental coverage too. \nHe apologized for his first call.\n  We certainly understand that when people get those kinds of notices \nthat the insurance they have has been canceled, of course everyone \nresponds with panic and being upset with what is going on, what is \ngoing to happen to me. But the good news is that he was able to call \nthe 1-800 number and, in fact, find better coverage that was lower \npriced and he is now also covered for important dental care. He said he \nis extremely happy with the Affordable Care Act.\n  LaNika's, Jim's, and Ryan's stories aren't unique. They are very \ntypical. Despite all of the hype and all of the efforts that have gone \non, they are very typical. It is important that people get beyond all \nthe politics of health care, which for the life of me I don't know why \nwe are not all working together to make sure people have the health \ncare they need and the information they need--for all the politics that \nhave come before, for people to get beyond that and just find out for \nthemselves if it will work. Hopefully, it will and they will have the \nsame kind of results that LaNika and Jim and Ryan had.\n  To everyone in America who doesn't have health insurance right now \nand needs to sign up but hasn't yet, there is less than 1 week to begin \nthe process. Once you have begun, I want to make sure you complete it.\n  I appreciate the President's willingness to allow more people time to \ncomplete that process because health care is an essential in life that \nliterally can be about life or death for a person or their family. I \nwould suggest that folks not get left behind but get covered as LaNika, \nJim, and Bryan did. It is quick, it will give you peace of mind, and we \nare hopeful you will find it to be something that is very good for you \nand your family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank Senator Stabenow not only for her statement, but \nshe has talked a lot about people she meets in her State and they say \nto her: Senator, all we want is a fair shot. Before Senator Stabenow \nleaves the floor I wanted to say I hear the same thing at home as well. \nWhen it comes to insurance all people want is a fair shot at affordable \ninsurance. That is why we are here today. We are here to celebrate the \nfourth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  I say for the record, we have millions of reasons in California to \nsay thank you for the Affordable Care Act, and I will go through some \nof the numbers. We have exceeded our goals. We have\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\nnow signed up 1 million, and that is 300,000 over our goal. We now know \nPresident Obama has extended the signup period for those who are \nsigning up on the national exchange. We are not sure yet whether \nCalifornia is going to extend its time. Anyone within the sound of my \nvoice--those in California--need to know that we have not yet extended \nthe time, so join the millions of Californians who have signed up \nthrough the exchanges.\n  Let's be clear: This is a real partisan battle. The House Republicans \nhave been bragging about the 54 times they voted to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, but I have to tell them before they vote again to \ntear this law down and vilify this law for the 55th time: Pay attention \nto the people in my State and all over the country.\n  I will go through the math of what is happening here. In addition to \nthe 1 million people in California who have signed up on the exchange, \nwe have 400,000 young adults who are staying on their parents' \ninsurance policies and 1.8 million people on Medicaid. When I say we \nhave more than a million reasons to say thank you for this law, we \nreally do.\n  I have some other numbers to add to this. Eight million Californians \nnow have access to free preventive care, including mammograms, birth \ncontrol, and immunizations; 16 million Californians with preexisting \nconditions, such as asthma, cancer, and diabetes are guaranteed \ncoverage--including 2.2 million children. California seniors and people \nwith disabilities are saving money on prescription drugs--350,000, \nthanks to the work we did to close that doughnut hole, and 12 million \nCalifornians have new insurance protections and no longer have to worry \nabout hitting annual limits on their health care.\n  I say to the Republicans: Wake up and see what is happening in your \ncommunities. Don't take my word for it. Listen to some of my \nCalifornians:\n\n       Just got my Obamacare Covered CA insurance plan. I'm \n     ecstatic. Saving $400 a month.\n\n  Another Californian said: ``Loving my new health coverage, way to go \nCalifornia.''\n  Another person wrote:\n\n       Just paid my first premium for Covered CA healthcare. A 42% \n     reduction for a nearly identical plan.\n\n  Bobby Dutta from Sacramento writes:\n\n       I was being crushed by the heavy burden of health insurance \n     premium costs. I had a PPO plan with Anthem Blue Cross and \n     was paying $1,324 per month for a family of two. Now, for a \n     comparable plan through ACA, my premiums are $61 per month.\n\n  Earth to Republicans: People are saving so much money because of the \nAffordable Care Act. They are getting peace of mind. Why would \nRepublicans want to repeal a law that is helping so many people in \nCalifornia and across the country? I have never seen a law so vilified.\n  Today I went back to the Congressional Record--and I want to share \nthis with Senator Murphy, who has organized this today. I thought this \nwas the only law Republicans vilified, but I went back to take a look \nat when Social Security was debated and passed.\n  In 1935, on the floor of the House during the debate on Social \nSecurity, a Republican Congressman from Ohio said:\n\n       This is compulsion of the rankest kind.\n\n  That was how he talked about Social Security. He called it rank.\n\n       Do not be misled by the title. The title says ``Old Age \n     Benefits.'' Shame on you for putting such a misleading and \n     unfair title on such a nefarious bill. Old-age benefits? \n     Think of it! What a travesty! . . .\n\n  Another Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania said:\n\n       . . . security for the individual, whether worker or aged, \n     will be a mockery and a sham if . . . [we] allot to our \n     people the role of puppets of a socialistic state . . .\n\n  Doesn't this sound familiar? If you do anything for people, \nRepublicans will call you a socialist. They call Social Security \nsocialist.\n  He says:\n\n       We cannot provide a sense of security by programs for the \n     destruction of wealth . . .\n\n  That is how he described Social Security. Listen, people pay into \nSocial Security. It is an insurance plan. People pay premiums for their \nhealth care.\n  I have to say it: The Republicans are vilifying the Affordable Care \nAct just as they vilified Social Security and they vilified Medicare.\n  Let's look at what Republicans said about Medicare. In 1965 a \nRepresentative from Missouri said:\n\n       . . . we cannot stand idly by now, as the Nation is urged \n     to embark on an ill-conceived adventure in government \n     medicine, the end of which no one can see, and from which the \n     patient is certain to be the ultimate sufferer.\n\n  I say to my colleagues: This is unbelievable. In 1965, the \nRepublicans said that government medicine, which they called Medicare, \neven though you have a private doctor, would lead to patients \nsuffering. If you ask patients who have Medicare now if they like it, \nthey love it. Even the rightwing tea partiers who came to Washington \nhad signs that said: ``Hands off my Medicare.'' The Republicans \nvilified Medicare.\n  How about another one? A Republican from Wyoming had this to say \nabout Medicare:\n\n       I am disturbed about the effect this legislation would have \n     upon our economy and upon our private insurance system . . .\n\n  In 1995, Dick Armey, the Republican House majority leader, said that \nMedicare is ``a program I would have no part of in a free world.''\n  I want people to understand that when the Republicans vilify the \nAffordable Care Act, they are doing exactly what they did on Social \nSecurity and Medicare. They were on the wrong side of history then and \nthey are on the wrong side of history now. And, of course, Newt \nGingrich said Medicare was ``going to wither on the vine.'' Well, it \nwould, if Republicans controlled this place.\n\n  Senate Majority Leader Dole said in 1996, ``I was there, fighting the \nfight, voting against Medicare . . . because we knew it wouldn't work \nin 1965.''\n  Folks, there is a big difference between the parties. When you see \nthe Republicans start to vote again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, \nthat is what they wanted to do to Social Security and that is what they \nwanted to do to Medicare. We stopped them then, and we will stop them \nnow. All they want to do is repeal all of these great benefits that are \nhelping millions of people, and I say to them: Enough already. Enough. \nWork with us. Let's make sure everyone in America has that sense of \nsecurity that they can handle whatever health impacts hit their \nfamilies.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we are here to point out that there \nare an awful lot of Americans who are winning because of the Affordable \nCare Act--whether it is a mom with kids who have gotten out of college \nbut couldn't get health care on their own who can now stay on mom and \ndad's policy. That is one less thing for her to worry about--her 22- or \n23-year-old children; that is a pretty big win.\n  Olive, who has been in touch with me, is a Rhode Islander from \nWoonsocket. She used to go into the doughnut hole every year because \nher husband has Alzheimer's and needs expensive medication. She saved \n$2,400 in the first year alone. That is a significant benefit for \nOlive.\n  We have people who are trapped in their jobs because they couldn't \nget away. They were chained to their jobs because of the need of \ninsurance. Alana, from Warwick, was one such person. She was working at \none of our universities. She liked her job, but she really wanted to be \na Web entrepreneur. She was tied to her job by employer-supplied health \ncare. She went to HealthSource Rhode Island back in December and found \na plan that worked for her. The plan's premium was so low she told me \nit sent her ``over the moon.'' She has become the proud owner of her \nown Rhode Island small business because she had the confidence she \ncould go forward. Stories such as Alana's abound not just in Rhode \nIsland but across the country.\n  When I first came into our Rhode Island health exchange, the first \nperson I saw who was ahead of me in line had boxes of Dunkin' Donuts \nand two big boxes of coffee. They had been there earlier in the \nafternoon, and the people who worked there were able to help them sign \nup for health insurance for the first time for their family. They were \nso thrilled they brought in doughnuts and coffee as a thank-you. That \nis the story we see.\n  I have to say that we have to look at what the problem was with \nhealth care. This is where we should be working together. Look at where \nthe costs are\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\ngoing; that is health care costs. In 1960, $27 billion, and $2.7 \ntrillion in 2011. This was out of control. This was not going to be \nsustainable. Something absolutely, positively has to be done to get \nhealth care under control.\n  The unsung part of the Affordable Care Act is the part that begins \nthe change in our delivery system reform so we can make our system \naffordable. Do we do it by taking things away from people? No. We do it \nby making the system better. How do we know that will work?\n  Here is a graph of all the major countries that are various kinds of \ncompetitors with us: Switzerland, Norway, Netherlands, Great Britain, \nJapan, and basically the rest of the major industrial nations. If you \nplot their life expectancy in years and their population against how \nmuch they spend per capita on health care, you get a pretty solid \ngrouping through here, and you get a pretty clear curve that can be \ndrawn through that.\n  Well, here is the U.S.A. We are way more per capita than the most \nexpensive country--better than $2,000 per person more per capita than \nthe other most expensive countries in the world. Look at us for life \nexpectancy. We come in around Chile and the Czech Republic, and we are \nbelow all of our competitors.\n  There is huge room for improvement--better health care at lower costs \nthat will extend our lives and reduce the costs. If we just move back \ninto this pack, we would save $1 trillion a year in health care in this \ncountry--not just the government, but across the country. It would help \nbusinesses, it would help taxpayers, and it would help everybody.\n  There are different ways to do it. Here is one little example. This \nis people who are readmitted after they have gone into the hospital. \nWhat was happening was that after people got out of the hospital and \nwent back to their nursing home or back to their house, their discharge \nplan was not very good. Their doctor may not have even known they were \ngetting out, and they didn't know what to do with their medications. So \nwhat happens? Two weeks or a month later, they are back in the hospital \nagain. We decided to do something about it in the Affordable Care Act.\n  This is the readmission rate. It was rocking along around 19 percent, \nand then along comes our bill in 2011, and it starts to drop. It starts \nto drop pretty dramatically. If we can keep that up, we save the money \nof all of those readmissions. You don't pay for a readmission that \nnever happens. It is an absolute economic savings. Plus, the family \ndoesn't have to worry about grandma going back into the hospital again \nand picking up a hospital-acquired infection or some other cost like \nthat.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, for organizing \nus on the floor today.\n  I want to summarize that there is a great human interest story to \ntell about the Affordable Care Act that is helping families not only in \nRhode Island but across the country; and moreover, it is a great tool \nfor us as I hope we can work together to improve our delivery system of \nhealth care so we are delivering better health care to Americans for a \nlower cost. We know we can do it. For crying out loud, if Greece and \nthese other countries can do it, then by God so can the United States \nof America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse, who is an \nextraordinary leader on the issue of trying to control costs and \nimproving quality. Senator Stabenow and Senator Boxer have been down \nhere talking about the importance of the Affordable Care Act long \nbefore I got to this body, and I thank them for being with us as well.\n  Our message is pretty simple. Our message is that the Affordable Care \nAct is working. We know that because just yesterday we had record \nnumbers of people who went onto the Web site to try to sign up for \ncoverage. They placed calls into the call centers. We had 1.2 million \npeople who went on the Web site yesterday looking for coverage. About \n390,000 people placed a call.\n  We are seeing extraordinary levels of signups day after day. It looks \nas though we are on pace to achieve the goal to help those 6 million \nindividuals sign up. That is not surprising because folks have been \ncrying out in desperation for a better way for years and years. People \nsuch as one constituent of mine, Sean Hannon, from Weston, CT--I talked \nabout him earlier on the floor today. He had a plan for him and his \nfamily that cost about $1,400 a month. Under the Affordable Care Act \nand the Connecticut Exchange, he is now paying $309. He wrote a really \nwonderful letter talking about what that means to him and his family, \nand he ended with this. He said:\n\n       We are sharing all of this personal information--\n\n  His family is sharing this personal information--\n\n     because there is an aggressive campaign underway to dismantle \n     this valuable program. The misinformation being put out there \n     is skewing public opinion and this must not happen.\n\n  Part of the reason why we have decided to come to the floor week \nafter week is because Republicans who are spreading mythology about \nthis law not working for people are chilling interest all across the \ncountry in signing up. Part of the reason why we are here on the floor \nis because there are Governors and State legislatures all around the \ncountry that are working to undermine the law rather than to implement \nthe law. But in States such as California and Connecticut, that are \nactually working to make the law work, we are seeing record numbers of \npeople sign up, and we are seeing story after story such as the \nHannons.\n  In Connecticut, we had a goal of signing up about 100,000 to 120,000 \npeople between Medicaid and the health care exchanges. Right now we \nhave 170,000 people signed up. I don't know what our final number will \nbe, but I imagine it will likely be double, if not more, of what our \noriginal estimate was. Why? Because we are actually going out and \nmaking it easy, simple for people to sign up. When we go out and make \nit easy for people to get affordable insurance, guess what. They want \nit.\n  Now that we are celebrating the 4-year mark of this law's being \nsigned by President Obama, it is worthwhile to talk for a second about \nwhat the reality was before the law was passed and what the reality of \nthe law is today because that explains why we are seeing this overflow \nof interest in this final week of signup.\n  Before the passage of this law, there were 3.4 million seniors who \nwere Medicare Part D enrollees--that is the prescription drug benefit--\nwho were falling into the doughnut hole. There was about 15 percent of \nthose using drugs in that doughnut hole who were skipping or stopping \nmedications when they reached that gap in coverage. The average senior \ncould be paying out as much as $160 in cost-sharing for certain \nprocedures such as colorectal cancer screenings, paying lots and lots \nof money in preventive health care copays that had effectively stopped \na lot of seniors from getting that wellness coverage they so badly \nneeded.\n  So what has happened after the passage of the law? There are 7.9 \nmillion seniors who are now in the doughnut hole and saving, on \naverage, about $1,200 in drug costs. That is $9.9 billion being saved \nby seniors because of the Affordable Care Act. Thirty-seven million \nseniors all across the country have taken advantage of the free \npreventive care, getting at least one free preventive service now that \nthe law is in effect.\n  Let's look at the other end of the age spectrum. Before this law was \npassed, 31.4 percent of young adults between ages 19 and 25 lacked \ncoverage. That was nearly double the national rate. We are seeing young \npeople flock to sign up for these health care exchanges, but even \nbefore that, about 3 million young adults all across the country had \ngained coverage because the health care law allows them to stay on \ntheir parents' coverage until age 26.\n  Before the law, women often paid 50 percent more in premiums because \nof gender rating--the idea that one could be charged more as a woman \nsimply because she is a woman. Put another way, being female was listed \nby many insurance companies as a preexisting condition. After the law, \ngender rating was banned, and women are on equity with men in terms of \nthe rates they pay.\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\n  For middle-class families that have been struggling with health care \ncosts because of a crippling illness, they now never have to worry \nabout losing coverage simply because someone gets sick or not being \nable to afford coverage in the first place because of a preexisting \ncondition. A world in which 60 percent of all personal bankruptcies \nwere reported to be related to medical costs will be history in this \ncountry.\n  Four years after the passage of the law, that is the reality of what \nlife was like before: Seniors paying thousands of dollars more in \nprescription drug costs, young adults unable to get coverage, women \npaying more for health care simply because they are women. The new \nreality is much different.\n  I imagine that is also why a new poll out this week tells us that 60 \npercent of Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act in place. \nThey may entertain some minor changes to the law, but less than 20 \npercent of Americans want to see this law repealed.\n  There is a total incongruity between what people out there believe, \nwhat they are experiencing, and what we are hearing as the reality from \nour Republican colleagues. That is why we are going to come down to the \nfloor week after week and talk about how the Affordable Care Act is \nworking for millions of Americans.\n  Finally, I wish to share one story because Republicans are very good \nat coming down and telling stories about people who have disagreements \nwith the law. We are beginning to see an overflow of stories and \nanecdotes from people whose lives are being transformed.\n  Anne Masterson, from Norwich, CT, writes this:\n\n       Because of a minor preexisting condition, I was unable to \n     get health insurance as an individual. I could get it through \n     my business, my own law practice. I've always opted for good \n     coverage, but I paid dearly for it. My premiums this year \n     increased $965 a month--equivalent to a second mortgage \n     payment.\n\n  Let's just break that down. What she is saying is she could get \ncoverage through her business, but she couldn't get coverage as an \nindividual, and that was the real story for decades when it came to \nindividuals who had a preexisting condition. For many of them, it \nwasn't a matter of just having to pay more for health care; they \ncouldn't get insurance at all because of a preexisting condition, and \nthat was the real world for Anne Masterson.\n  She further goes on to say this:\n\n       Part of my practice is representing children and the \n     elderly in local probate courts. While not very lucrative, \n     it's one of the most professionally satisfying things I \n     do. I feel like I make a difference. However, with the \n     increased premiums, I don't know how I could continue to \n     pay for my health insurance.\n\n  Let's break that down for a second. Think of all the people all \nacross this country who are stuck in a job simply because they have to \nget health care for them and their family. Think of all of the \ninnovation that is being stymied because people can't go out and start \na business because it would involve taking the risk of going for a \nperiod of time without health care.\n  Anne was contemplating giving up work she loved, work she was good \nat, representing children and the elderly--maybe one of the most \nimportant jobs we have in our legal system--because she couldn't afford \nto pay the premiums on that salary.\n  She finishes by saying:\n\n       Under the Affordable Care Act silver plan, I'll have the \n     exact same Anthem policy I have now--and pay nearly $600 less \n     per month. Not only will I have the peace of mind of having \n     good health insurance, but I'll also be able to continue \n     representing our most vulnerable citizens.\n\n  We should step back and try to think about what our job really is \nhere. We get consumed with studies and numbers and data, but really our \njob is to protect the security of this country and to try to increase \nthe quality of life for the people we represent. It is hard to \nsometimes measure whether we are doing a good job at increasing the \nquality of life, but it is really about trying to make sure the people \nwe represent are happy.\n  Happiness comes in all sorts of different ways, but happiness had \nbeen stolen from millions of families across the country because every \nmorning they would wake up thinking about how sick they were or how \nsick their child was or how sick their husband or wife was and their \ninability to pay for it.\n  We hear those words ``peace of mind'' come up over and over when \npeople talk about the Affordable Care Act. Yes, they are getting better \ncoverage. Yes, they are healthier, but they just feel better about \ntheir existence in this world because they no longer have to worry \nabout being part of the 60 percent of bankruptcies caused by medical \ndebt. They no longer have to worry whether their child is going to have \nto have their life dictated by the terms of their illness.\n  We can talk about the 5 million people who have signed up in \nexchanges all across the country or the fact that, as Senator \nWhitehouse says, the Federal Government is slated to save $1.2 trillion \nas compared to previous estimates on health care costs. We can talk \nabout the $9 billion that seniors are saving because of the Affordable \nCare Act when it comes to prescription drug costs. But if we really \nwant to talk about the transformation in the Affordable Care Act, if we \nreally want to read into all of these letters we are getting in \nincreasing volumes, it is about the fact that people don't have to wake \nup every day worrying about health care, worrying about getting sick, \nworrying about how they are going to pay for an illness.\n  Maybe, in the end, when this law is fully implemented and ultimately \nRepublicans come to this floor and defend it, just as they do Medicare, \nthat will be the true measure of how the Affordable Care Act works.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to have an \nopportunity to vote on S. 2124, and I am pleased to learn that it looks \nas if there is going to be overwhelming support in the Senate for the \npassage of S. 2124. This is the legislation that helps Ukraine in \ndealing with the invasion by Russia.\n  Russia's illegal actions of using its military to overtake Crimea, a \npart of Ukraine, violate numerous international obligations that Russia \nhas committed to.\n  I have the honor of chairing the U.S. Helsinki Commission. The \nHelsinki Accords were entered into in 1975. Russia was one of the \nleading forces for forming the OSCE.\n  Russia's taking over of Crimea violates its commitments it made under \nthe Helsinki Final Act. It violates the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which \nwas signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and \nRussia, that guaranteed basically Ukraine's integrity of its land. It \nviolates the 1997 Ukraine-Russia bilateral treaty. It violates the U.N. \nCharter. The list goes on and on and on.\n  So I believe it is absolutely essential that we have a strong voice \nin standing with the people of Ukraine. There was absolutely no \njustification whatsoever for Russia's action. There was no threat to \nany of the ethnic communities in Ukraine. All the rights of the people \nwere being protected. The country was in transition from a corrupt \ngovernment to a government that respected the rights of its citizens. \nIf there was any provocation whatsoever of any unrest, it was caused by \nRussia's presence in Ukraine.\n  We got reports from the chief rabbi in Kiev that Russia was staging \nanti-Semitic provocations in Crimea, and the list goes on and on as to \nwhat Russia was doing in order to try to give some justification for \nits actions.\n  Russia's thinly veiled landgrab, cloaked in the cloth of self-\ndetermination, must not go unchallenged. Here is what I think is \ncritically important: This is a dangerous precedent. We saw Russia use \na similar action in Georgia, and now in Crimea in Ukraine. There are \nother territorial issues involved\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\naround the world. If this goes unchecked, if we do not speak with a \nunified voice, it just encourages more irresponsible action by Russia \nin other countries.\n  We know that we have concerns about the South China Sea. We know we \nhave concerns about Moldova. There are many other areas where Russia \ncould be involved in its border areas.\n  So all of these issues are matters for us to speak with a strong \nunified voice. S. 2124 does that. It does it in two principal ways.\n  First, it imposes the sanctions against those responsible for \nRussia's invasion into Crimea, Ukraine. It provides sanctions so that \nthese individuals are not permitted to come to the United States. There \nare economic sanctions in regard to the use of our banking system. \nThese are similar sanctions to what are now being imposed by our \nEuropean allies.\n  We need to isolate Russia. As we all know, the G8, which included \nRussia, is now a G7 without Russia. Russia needs to know that there \nwill be sanctions imposed, and they will be stronger sanctions unless \nthey stop this aggressive action.\n  In addition, the legislation provides economic assistance to the new \nGovernment of Ukraine. Just 2 weeks ago the Prime Minister of Ukraine \nwas here and met with Members of the Senate. I tell you, it was \ninspirational to listen to his vision for Ukraine as a democratic, \nindependent state, with full integration into Europe. That is \nimportant. He is preparing for a May 25 election for the Presidency of \nUkraine.\n  These are all very, very positive steps. But if Ukraine does not have \nthe economic foothold to be able to develop the type of economy and \nstrength in their country, it will be difficult for Ukraine to be \nmaintained as a viable independent state.\n  Here is where the United States and our European allies, and I hope \nthe global community, come together, as we have in this legislation, to \nprovide economic help on a restructured economic plan for Ukraine that \nwill help them move forward in a very constructive way.\n  Mr. President, I must tell you I am disappointed, though, that the \nreforms of the IMF will be eliminated from this legislation. I think \nthat is regrettable. We are entering into a plan for Ukraine that very \nmuch depends upon the IMF's--the International Monetary Fund's--plan to \nmake sure that the moneys we are spending, Europe is spending, and \nother countries are loaning and providing to Ukraine are based upon a \nsound economic plan that will work. That is why the IMF is there. And \nthey will be there. But the United States needs to be a full \nparticipant in the IMF. We are out of compliance, and here is another \nopportunity lost for us to be in full compliance with the IMF. I am \ndisappointed about that.\n  But as I said as I took the floor, we must speak with one voice--the \nObama administration; the House, the Senate; the Congress--as we stand \nwith the people of Ukraine for their integrity, for their independence, \nand for the adherence to international principles, which Russia has \nclearly violated.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, on October 16, 1936, President Roosevelt \nvisited the then-largest city in Ohio, the town my wife and I live in, \nCleveland, OH. He spoke about why the ``trickle down'' theory does not \nwork--this whole view that has been tried a number of times in our \ncountry: trickle down economics--that trickle down economics does not \nwork. That is when you give major tax breaks to the wealthiest people \nin the country.\n  President Roosevelt called them ``economic royalists''--a term that \nsounds a little out of date but maybe fairly descriptive. But President \nRoosevelt said when you help the wealthy get wealthier and wealthier--\nmy Republican colleagues call them the ``job creators,'' but it just \ndoes not work that way; the hope then is that some of that wealth they \naccumulate--and we do not resent their wealth, we do not envy their \nwealth; we just do not think it is good economic policy for Toledo or \nGallipolis or Chillicothe or Cleveland--that when the wealthiest people \nget richer and richer, it does not really trickle down and create jobs.\n  Forget Franklin Roosevelt for a minute. Look at two decades in very \nrecent memory--the 1990s during the Clinton years and the 8 years \nduring the Bush years. From 1993 to 2000, the Clinton years, we \nactually reduced the budget deficit to the point where there was a \nsurplus. There was an increase in taxes on upper income people and some \nbudget cuts. But what happened during that 8 years is that 21 million \nprivate sector jobs were added to our economy between 1993 and 2000--21 \nmillion private sector jobs.\n  Then President Bush took office. Twice--once in 2001 and once in \n2003--with the assistance of kind of a bought-and-sold special interest \nCongress in those days, President Bush gave major tax cuts to the \nwealthiest people in this country. You know the theory, ``trickle \ndown.'' You give tax breaks to the rich and it trickles down to \nmoderate-income, middle-class people and creates jobs. Well, the middle \nclass shrank during those 8 years. President Bush gave major tax cuts \nto the rich twice. Do you know how many jobs were created during those \n8 years? Under 1 million private sector jobs.\n  So from 1993 to 2000 when we did not follow trickle-down economics, \nthere were 21 million private sector jobs. During the 8 years of the \nBush administration, there were big tax cuts for the rich--twice. There \nwas essentially no real job creation in the private sector.\n  A number of my colleagues want to continue that policy. But let's \nlook at it the other way. The real job creation is not tax breaks for \nthe richest people, it trickles down, and maybe some jobs will be \ncreated for the middle class and for low-income people. Let's look at \nit the other way. Let's look at it as the real job creation is from the \nbottom up. One of the ways to do that is a minimum wage increase. It \nwill not mean everything, but look at this. The minimum wage today is \nworth $7.25 an hour nationally, in some States a little bit higher. My \nState is 90 cents higher than that, I believe. But the minimum wage \ntoday has one-third less buying power than it did in 1968. In 1968 a \ncouple with minimum wage jobs--a husband and wife--actually had an OK \nstandard of living. They were not doing great, but they were making it. \nThey could afford to pay their rent. They could afford a car. They \ncould afford some things. They were doing sort of OK.\n  The minimum wage today--again, a minimum wage job--has one-third less \nbuying power than it had in 1968. But think about this: The minimum \nwage for tipped employees--I imagine a number of the pages who are \nsitting here today are not indicative; it is really older people \ngenerally who have had minimum wage jobs and have had jobs where they \nrely on tips. It is a myth that minimum wage jobs are held by mostly \nteenagers. They are not. Minimum wage jobs are often held by people \nsupporting themselves, and they are supporting kids sometimes on \nminimum wage jobs. They are not teenagers or mostly in their twenties \nand thirties.\n  But get this. Do you know how much the tipped minimum wage is? It is \n$2.13 an hour. That means when you see a valet at an airport--if you go \nto Cleveland Hopkins Airport and you see someone pushing a wheelchair \nwith an often older disabled person in it, those are tipped jobs. Those \npeople do not even make $7.25 an hour. But they can make as little as \n$2.13 an hour. Do you know the last time they got a raise, the last \ntime the tipped minimum wage was raised? It was 1992. For 20-plus years \nthe tipped minimum wage has been $2.13 an hour. It has been that for 20 \nyears. That means that the waitress in the diner, the server in the \ndiner, the valet in front of the restaurant, the person pushing the \nwheelchair or driving the cart at the airport, the person working in \nthe hotel, their minimum wage is $2.13 an hour.\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\n  The people opposed to this minimum wage increase--to me, some of the \nmost self-absorbed interest groups in this country and some of the best \noff--say: Well, nobody really makes that because people get these tips.\n  Well, if they work at a really high-end restaurant where the average \npatron will spend $75 or $100, buy a few drinks, where there is an \nexpensive menu and all of that, the waiters do a little better. They \nmake $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year if they are busy enough and \nif they are working enough hours, some even more than that. But in the \ndiner where three retirees will come in on a Tuesday morning and drink \ncoffee and sit there for 2 hours and take up a table, that waitress is \nusually a woman who is a sub-minimum wage tipped employee. The people \nmay leave $1 on the table, and she has worked for 2 hours. All they buy \nis coffee, and she keeps filling it up and filling it up. Think about \nthe wear and tear on her body. She is standing on her feet all the \ntime. She is working hard. You know, we like to think we work hard in \nthe Senate. We do, but we do not do that and it is not so hard on our \nbodies.\n  When I think about this minimum wage--I am never angry about \npolitics. One of my heroes was Hubert Humphrey. They called him the \n``Happy Warrior'' because he always fought for justice but he was not \nangry. But there are some things that make me angry about this job, \nsuch as when I see some of my colleagues--and there are a number of \nthem--vote for pay increases for themselves and then vote against the \nminimum wage. They may tell you they work hard. They are not working \nharder than that person pushing the cart at the airport. They are not \nworking harder than the woman in the diner who is filling the coffee \ncup.\n  I urge my colleagues to do something that Pope Francis mentioned. \nPope Francis exhorted his parish priests to go out and smell like the \nflock. You think about the Biblical allegory of that, the sheep and the \nOld Testament and the shepherd. When he said ``go out and smell like \nthe flock'' to his parish priests, what he was saying is pretty \nobvious: Go out and find out how they live. Go out and try to live \namong them. Go out and do what they do. Go out and understand their way \nof life.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about it. I am not asking them to live \non a minimum wage job. I am not asking them to wait tables. But I do \nask them to spend some time talking to people about the hopes and \ndreams for their children and in their lives, people who are minimum \nwage workers, people making $7.25 an hour and working hard, people who \nare making less than that and rely on tips that may or may not be \nthere.\n  It is justice. Are we going to reward work? If so, we ought to \nincrease the minimum wage. At the same time, we ought to expand the \nearned-income tax credit. It actually rewards work. If you are a \ntrickle-down economics guy--and most of them are guys--and you believe \nthat you reward people by cutting their taxes so they will work harder, \nmaybe we ought to think about rewarding hand-working lower income \npeople with tax breaks. For someone making $28,000 a year, that extra \nthousand dollars really means they can maybe put a little aside for \ntheir kid's community college or maybe they can actually go out to eat \nonce in a while or maybe they can occasionally buy a really nice dinner \nfor their kids or maybe they can buy school supplies or whatever with \nthat extra thousand or two thousand dollars from the earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  We need to increase the minimum wage and the earned-income tax \ncredit. It will not only be better for those families, it will help the \neconomy because you put money into the economy. The unemployed worker \nor a minimum wage worker is going to spend that money. They are not \ngoing to invest it in a Swiss bank account the way some wealthy people \nmight; they are going to spend that money, and that is going to create \njobs in the local community. So increasing the minimum wage and \nexpanding the earned-income tax credit is good for those families, it \nis good for those communities, and it is good for our economy. It is \nsomething we ought to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I would ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Extension\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you very much.\n  I rise tonight to speak about emergency unemployment compensation. We \nknow by the acronyms around here people refer to unemployment insurance \nas UI. What we are talking about in the real world are literally \nmillions of Americans affected in one way or another because they have \nbeen out of work, unemployed for long periods of time.\n  By one estimate the number of Americans who have been out of work for \n6 months or longer--and many of these individuals have been out of work \nfor a lot more than 6 months, but when the line is drawn of 6 months or \nlonger, it is more than 4 million Americans. It is a big number. I will \ntalk a little bit more about the Pennsylvania impact and walk through \nsome of those numbers.\n  This legislation that is finally coming together after many weeks is \ngoing to be, and I think must be, a bipartisan compromise. That is the \nonly way to move forward. It is an effort to provide an essential \nlifeline--that is not an overstatement and may be an understatement--an \nessential lifeline to middle-class families who rely upon the program \nto stay afloat as they are actively seeking work. I think what is \nsometimes lost in the discussion is these are folks who are trying to \nwork, trying to find a job again.\n  I would have preferred a much longer extension than the one that is \nbeing discussed and worked on. I also would have hoped that people \nrelying upon this type of compensation--emergency unemployment \ncompensation--would not have to see their benefits lapse. Extending \nthis program has always been bipartisan, and we need to make sure we \nkeep it in that vein. While our economy has made substantial \nimprovements, we have a long way to go. Families are still hurting and \nthey need help.\n\n  Unfortunately, when families read the business page of their local \nnewspaper, some of the numbers look pretty good. But if you are out of \nwork for any period of time, especially 6 months or longer, it doesn't \nreally matter what is on the business page or what the overall \nassessment is; it is very difficult for that individual or family \nbecause they are not working, and because they are not working they are \nnot able to help their family.\n  We know that in addition to being the lifeline for families--an \nessential connection to any kind of economic security--the other reason \nit is important to have the emergency unemployment compensation passed \nis because of the economic boost it provides. Emergency unemployment \ncompensation provides an economic jump start.\n  Just by way of example, in 2012, Mark Zandi, one of our more \nrespected economists on both sides of the aisle, found that for every \ndollar of emergency unemployment compensation there was a $1.52 \neconomic impact--or new economic activity resulted. That is the old \nspend a buck, and what do you get for spending the buck? You spend a \nbuck on this, you get a buck fifty-two in return. That is a substantial \nreturn on that investment.\n  Recent analysis specifically focusing on the extension of benefits in \n2014 has also found a large economic boost. The Economic Policy \nInstitute has estimated that extending unemployment benefits in 2014 \nwould generate $37.8 billion in economic activity. We know that this is \nan issue--unemployment, emergency unemployment or long-term \nunemployment--that varies depending on the State, but we know every \nState has been affected and almost every community has been affected in \na very substantial way.\n  Pennsylvania is a big and diverse State with more than 12 million \npeople. In some ways it tends to broadly reflect what is happening in \nvarious parts of the country. In Pennsylvania 73,300 people immediately \nstopped receiving unemployment benefits when the emergency unemployment \ncompensation expired on December 28, 2014.\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\nThat was kind of the beginning of the current crisis for these \nfamilies. They have been living through a very difficult economy for \nyears now. They have been out of work for many months, and in some \ncases more than a year or two, but the current crisis started for them \non December 28.\n  I can't even imagine what it is like for them. You are at the end of \nthe holiday season, you are out of work, you have been robbed of your \ndignity and your ability to contribute to your family's well-being, and \non top of all of that--in the middle of the holiday season when it is \nsupposed to be a time of hope and optimism and gift giving and all \nkinds of family time--you, and perhaps another member of the family, \nlose your emergency unemployment compensation. That is where it \nstarted.\n  Because Congress didn't have a bipartisan consensus until recently, \nthe days and weeks started to add up. So when you go from December 28 \nto March 1--and we can take another look at the numbers--unfortunately, \nand not surprisingly, those numbers went up. As of March 1, 105,000 \nPennsylvanians lost their benefits. It gets worse than that. If it \ncontinues, and there is not some relief provided through May--and this \nis the period that would be covered by the bill--it is estimated that \n158,400 Pennsylvanians and some 2,795,300 Americans who could benefit \nfrom this bill will lose their unemployment compensation.\n  It is very simple in terms of the choice we have to make. We need to \ndecide in the very near future--we hope starting this week so we can \nbegin the process of finally getting this done--whether we will help \nalmost 2.8 million Americans and almost 160,000 Pennsylvanians. It is a \nvery simple choice. We are going to take either one path or the other. \nI hope and pray we take the path that helps those almost 3 million \nAmericans and almost 160,000 Pennsylvanians.\n  Earlier I mentioned the economic impact of passing this kind of \nlegislation. We know that in Pennsylvania, for example, one estimate \nshows that extending benefits would provide a boost to consumption and \neconomic activity which would save an estimated 15,000 jobs. That is \nanother way to measure the impact of this program.\n  It is my hope that the Senate can swiftly pass this bipartisan \nlegislation to extend emergency unemployment compensation and that the \nHouse will take it up and pass it without delay. We can't allow \npolitics to stand in the way of helping families in need.\n  This is a basic and fundamental issue. These families and individuals \nhave waited far too long. I will conclude with just one example. A \ncouple of Sundays ago--maybe 3 weeks ago--I was walking out of church \nin our neighborhood and a woman came up to me. I didn't know her, but I \nrecognized her from the neighborhood. She asked me about this issue. \nShe said: I'm out of work; when do you think it will pass? She asked me \nthe same question a couple of weeks before that. I said: I think we are \ngetting to the point where there is a consensus. On that particular \nSunday--just a couple of weeks ago--she asked me again. When she \nstarted to ask the question, she asked it with a seriousness and an \nearnestness and a kind of worry in her voice that caught my attention. \nI said something like: I think we are starting to get there, but I \ncan't say for sure when. When I gave that answer, she looked at me and \nshe started to become very emotional and said: I hope you are reaching \nthe point where you can pass something because it is going to be very \ndifficult for me to hang on any longer.\n  This is very tough. I felt at that moment--as an elected official who \nwas given power by the voters to vote and represent them--if not \npowerless, I was not doing nearly enough for her. I am part of an \ninstitution that has not come together yet--in the Senate and in the \nother body as well. We have not come together to answer her question \nwith full confidence and to say: Yes, we understand. We understand what \nyou are up against to the extent we can--not having lived through this \nourselves--and we are going to act this week or tomorrow or the next \nday.\n  Not having a specific answer for her gave me a sense of not just \nfrustration but a sense of failure. There was a sense of urgency that \nshe brought to my attention, and I believe almost every Member here \ncould probably tell a similar story.\n  We have to act. We have to get this done, and we have to make sure we \nundertake every effort in the next few days--and I hope we are talking \ndays now--to get this done so we can finally provide a measure of \nrelief which is short term but will have the effect of providing a \nmeasure of relief to families who have suffered in ways I can't even \nimagine.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I had the privilege of chairing a \nfield hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in Rutland, VT. The \ncommittee received powerful testimony about community solutions to \nbreaking the cycle of addiction to heroin and other opioids. The \nhearing marked the fourth time in the past 6 years that the Judiciary \nCommittee traveled to Vermont to explore issues related to drug abuse. \nAs in many States, opioid addiction has ripped through parts of \nVermont. Overdoses have reached record levels, while communities have \nstruggled to keep pace with the demand for treatment. Sadly, this story \nis not unique. We are confronting a localized problem with regional \nechoes and national implications. Some of what we face is similar to \nthe addiction outbreaks in large cities, and other aspects are \nparticular to rural areas.\n  What struck me in Rutland last week is how Vermonters have worked \ntogether--and are continuing to work together--to get ahead of this \nproblem, with innovative prevention, treatment, and law enforcement \nstrategies.\n  The city of Rutland has an important story to tell. Its addiction \ncrisis has received national attention. But I brought the Judiciary \nCommittee to Rutland not to explore the horrors the city once faced; \nrather, I wanted us to learn how the people of Rutland are reclaiming \ntheir community, block by block. One effort that has shown great \npromise is Project VISION--Viable Initiatives and Solutions through \nInvolvement of Neighborhoods--developed by city and community leaders \nto address the many issues related to opioid abuse: addiction and \ntreatment, prevention, quality of life, and crime and safety issues.\n  The chief of the Rutland Police Department, James Baker, testified at \nthe hearing. Chief Baker explained that the police department for the \nfirst time is housing social workers, a domestic violence advocate, a \nmental health specialist, an early intervention coordinator, an \nassistant attorney general, a school resource officer, a crime analyst, \nand a building inspector. All are working in concert toward one goal: \n``Not on our streets; not in our town.'' When Chief Baker asked how \nmany in the audience were connected with Project VISION, over half of \nthe standing-room-only audience raised their hands. Project VISION has \nproven adept at pursuing emerging, community-driven strategies. Just \nthis week, community leaders and police in Rutland are considering \nimplementing drug market intervention. This is a promising tactic \ndesigned to clear neighborhoods of nonviolent street-level dealers by \nbringing them in front of community leaders and giving them a stark \nchoice: Stop selling today or go to jail tomorrow. Rutland has clearly \nrisen to the challenge of combatting heroin and opioid abuse.\n  Other witnesses at the hearing described communities in action, \nworking together to find inventive and tailored solutions. The U.S. \nattorney for Vermont, Tristram Coffin, who has had remarkable success \nleading enforcement efforts in the State, described how he has taken \nthe message of prevention to Vermont schools, partnering with the \nfather of a young man who tragically died of a heroin overdose. Dr. \nHarry Chen, the Vermont Department of Health commissioner and a career \nemergency room physician, described what it means to recognize \naddiction as a public health issue, expanding access to prevention and \ntreatment services to all corners of the state. Mary Alice McKenzie, \ndirector of the Boys & Girls Club in Burlington, made clear how \nimportant it is to provide young people early and safe alternatives to \ndrug use. The director of the Vermont State Police, Colonel Tom \nL'Esperance, described how State police will soon carry naloxone, a \ndrug that immediately reverses the effects of a heroin overdose. \nAddicts in Vermont now know that police are not just there to arrest \nbut to save lives.\n  It is important that the Judiciary Committee hear about a range of \nexperiences, as opioid addiction has plagued communities large and \nsmall, rural and urban. This is why I encouraged all Vermonters to \nsubmit testimony on strategies to curb addiction, which will be \nincorporated into the permanent record of the U.S. Senate. The response \nwas remarkable. We received testimony from law enforcement officers, \nfirst responders, substance abuse counselors, doctors, public health \nofficials, mental health practitioners, professors, school counselors \nand teachers, concerned parents, Governor Peter Shumlin--who is sharply \nfocusing his administration on these problems--and many, many others.\n  Taken together, the testimony submitted to the committee offers a \nblueprint for communities ready to get ahead of addiction. It is clear \nthat success requires community investment. Only after a community \nidentifies addiction as a problem can it commit to defeating it. This \nis where Vermont is ahead of the curve. We tend to come from close-knit \ncommunities in Vermont. When we hear about victims of overdoses, and \nconcerns about a growing problem, nearly all Vermonters can name \nsomeone who is affected. I suspect that is why we have had a number of \nexcellent initiatives already enacted--it did not take long for heroin \nand opioid abuse to affect all Vermonters. And it did not take long for \nVermont to take steps to resolve the problem. Nowhere is this more \nevident than in Rutland.\n  It is equally clear from the submitted testimony that success \nrequires close collaboration among prevention, treatment, and law \nenforcement efforts. From my years as a Vermont prosecutor, I recall \nhow important such collaboration is, but never have I seen a law \nenforcement community as committed to prevention and treatment efforts \nas I do now. We know we cannot arrest our way out of this problem. If \nthe underlying cause of criminal behavior is an addiction, treatment is \noften a more humane and cost-effective alternative to arrests and \nprison.\n  As we continue to review testimony submitted to the committee, I look \nforward to working with other members of the Judiciary and \nAppropriations Committees to ensure that these community-driven \nresponses receive the support necessary to succeed. I will continue to \nwork to fund youth mentoring and prevention organizations on the front \nlines, like the Boys & Girls Clubs, and I will continue to work to \nfully fund Byrne-JAG and COPS grants to enable law enforcement agencies \nto devote the necessary time and resources to develop durable solutions \nwith community partners. We also need to continue to support drug court \nand diversion models to substitute treatment for prison when \nappropriate. Many programs funded through the Second Chance Act provide \noffenders a real opportunity to succeed once released from prison by \nensuring they have the resources to become productive members of their \ncommunity.\n  I also look forward to discussing effective law enforcement \nstrategies and partnerships with Michele Leonhart,\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nAdministrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency, when she comes before the \nJudiciary Committee next month.\n  We all understand that the ability of the Federal Government to \nprovide any assistance is increasingly challenged in light of our \nburgeoning prison population, which is largely driven by inflexible and \nunfair drug mandatory minimums. Federal prison and detention costs have \nrisen to account for nearly one-third of the budget for the Department \nof Justice. This unsustainable growth in our prison costs siphons \nresources from other crucial law enforcement priorities every year. It \nis vital that Congress pass our bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act, \nwhich would make modest reductions to mandatory minimums for nonviolent \ndrug offenses and help preserve funding for assistance to state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies and to victim services.\n  Addiction to heroin and other opioids is a community problem, \ndemanding community solutions. I can report that Vermonters have \nstepped up to this challenge. Obstacles remain, but Vermont communities \nhave rallied to develop lasting solutions and get ahead of addiction. \nAfter seeing this commitment firsthand, I left Rutland hopeful. And \nvery proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/26/senate-section/article/S1772-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEVELOPING EUROPE'S ENERGY SUPPLIES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to call for new aid to Eastern \nEurope to strengthen our allies in the face of Russia's annexation of \nCrimea.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that we can do this by \nimmediately increasing our export of domestically produced and \nprocessed liquefied natural gas. I have been cautiously optimistic on \nthe domestic production of this energy source, relying heavily on the \nneed for the environmental regulation of such activities. But in the \ncase of Eastern Europe there is little that we can do domestically to \nquickly help their situation.\n  For more than a century, America's real power has been exporting the \nkeys to economic growth and security. Therefore, it is time to do \nsomething real to bolster Europe's energy security by helping them \ndevelop Eastern Europe's substantial natural gas reserves and reduce \nthe leverage Russia has over its energy dependent neighbors.\n  The most powerful tool the United States can give Eastern Europe is \nnot exported natural gas that will not get to Europe for years, if \never. It is empowering our European allies to develop their own energy \nresources, like the major shale gas deposits in Poland.\n  It is clear that energy--and natural gas in particular--is at the \nvery heart of Russia's influence over that part of the world. Europe is \ndependent on Russia for nearly one-third of its natural gas. And while \ncountries in Western Europe have had some success in diversifying their \nenergy supplies, as former State Department Special Envoy and \nCoordinator for International Energy Affairs David Goldwyn testified \nyesterday, Eastern Europe is still heavily dependent upon Russia for \nenergy.\n  Russia is not above using that dependence as a hammer and has been \neager to remind us of that fact. For instance, Moscow shut off the gas \nlines in 2006 and again in the winter of 2009, leaving millions \ntemporarily without heat. In 2013, when the country of Moldova sought \nto pursue stronger ties with Europe, Russia's deputy prime minister \nissued a barely veiled threat to the Moldovans, saying ``we hope you \nwill not freeze.''\n  As I noted, some have suggested the answer to this problem is to \nautomatically approve natural gas exports from the United States.\n  This position simply ignores the facts about how the gas market \nactually works.\n  U.S. LNG facilities are not slated to come online until the end of \nnext year, at the earliest, while any new approvals would not provide \nany natural gas exports for at least several years. Further, unless \nCongress directed exports to go to Ukraine, the gas would go to the \ncountry paying the highest price, which would likely be in Asia.\n  I support the Energy Department's current, measured process for \nconsidering export requests. The Energy Department has already approved \nmore than 9 billion cubic feet per day of exports, which exceeds what \nmost analysts believe is the current international market for U.S. \nnatural gas. It is helping our European allies bolster their energy \nsecurity by developing the major shale gas deposits in Poland and \nelsewhere.\n  United States entrepreneurs triggered the shale revolution with a \ncombination of innovation and technical know-how. This created tens of \nthousands of jobs and produced stable energy supplies that are 50 \npercent cleaner than traditional fossil fuels. It helped us with our \nenergy security and it can do the same for Europe.\n  That is exactly what we should be doing to help NATO allies that are \njustifiably worried following Russia's illegal actions in Ukraine.\n  So what I am proposing today is to increase funding for a State \nDepartment program that helps spur natural gas development abroad. My \ncommonsense amendment would direct $10 million within the Economic \nSupport Fund toward the Unconventional Gas Technical Engagement Program \nto help Eastern European countries develop the regulations and \ntechnical expertise they need to access their own gas.\n  Let me be clear--this assistance would go to countries, like Poland, \nthat have asked for American help to harness their own gas reserves. I \nam aware that Europe is having its own debate about shale gas, and this \namendment would not force any nation to participate. In doing so, it \nwill help our European allies throw off the yoke of dependence on \nRussian gas.\n  I want to be clear that this amendment cannot free Eastern Europe \nfrom Russian influence. Russia has other ways of bullying its neighbors \neconomically. Moscow temporarily banned imports from Ukraine, for \nexample, and it also banned imports of Moldovan wine--a very \nsignificant part of Moldova's economy.\n  This is clearly only one step of many needed to send a message to \nPresident Putin. But as the former chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee I know that a stable energy supply is the lifeblood \nof any economy and a very important component to a secure nation.\n  I believe there is bipartisan support for America to give our allies \nthe tools they need to become more secure and less dependent on the \nwhims of Mr. Putin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/26/senate-section/article/S1772-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

At the \nend of this month, Dr. West, a family physician, will retire from \nclinical practice after more than 30 years.\n  Born in Washington, DC, on September 11, 1954, Murray West moved to \nPhiladelphia at age 10. From 1975 to 1976, he attended Queen Mary \nCollege in London, and he was awarded a bachelor of science degree from \nAntioch College in 1977.\n  A 1981 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, \nDr. West completed his residency in family practice at the Georgetown \nUniversity Department of Family Medicine here in Washington, DC. After \n3 years with the Indian Health Service in Yuma, AZ, Dr. West moved to \nMaryland, where he earned a master of public health degree from the \nJohns Hopkins School of Public Health in 1993. Since 1986, he has \ntreated patients exclusively at nonprofit health centers in our State--\nArundel Village, Washington Village, Peoples Community, and the Belair-\nEdison Family Health Center, where he served as medical director from \n2001 until 2007.\n  On Thursday, March 28, family members, colleagues, and friends will \ngather to celebrate this committed practitioner whose career epitomizes \ndedication to public health and quality care.

Johnson on the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. \nAir Force.\n  Chief Johnson has given much to this Nation through his dedicated and \nselfless service. His Air Force career started in the great State of \nGeorgia on December 21, 1984, following his graduation from Echols \nCounty High School near Statenville. When Chief Johnson began his \ncareer, he got exactly what he asked for--the ability to see the world. \nHis first assignment took him to the United Kingdom, where he laid the \nfoundation for a tremendous career as a security policeman. His career \nwould take him to the ICBM fields of Wyoming, followed by his first \ntour in the Republic of Korea. Chief Johnson would end up in the United \nKingdom once again, then to the Emerald Coast of Florida, followed by \nhis first tour in Texas. He would spend a couple of years in our \nNation's Capital before heading back to Korea. He would then return to \nthe States, landing himself his first tour in south Georgia. Long from \nending his travels, Chief Johnson would take one more assignment to \nTexas, followed by a year in Qatar. Finally, Chief Johnson landed back \nin south Georgia for his second assignment there, which would be his \nlast assignment in the Air Force. During his career, along with all of \nthe aforementioned permanent duty station changes, Chief Johnson \ndeployed in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, \nOperation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New \nDawn. Chief Johnson sewed on his final stripe, earning him a spot in \nthe top 1 percent of all enlisted members of the military allowed by \nlaw, on September 1, 2009.\n  Chief Johnson is the recipient of the following major medals and \ndecorations for his service and accomplishments: two Bronze Star \nMedals, five Meritorious Service Medals, four Air Force Commendation \nMedals, four Air Force Achievement Medals, the Air Force Combat Action \nMedal, the Air Force Combat Readiness Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Southwest Asia \nService Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Korean Defense \nService Medal, and the NATO Medal.\n  Throughout his distinguished career he has represented our country \nand the Air Force with dignity and honor. On behalf of the Senate and \nthe United States of America, I thank CMSAF Samuel L. Johnson for his \nservice and sacrifices over the past 30 years. I wish him Godspeed and \ncontinued happiness as he starts a new chapter in his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/26/senate-section/article/S1773-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LIHEAP ACTION DAY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, today is National LIHEAP Action Day. \nAdvocates from many different States are here to make the case for the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. This \nimportant initiative helps low-income Rhode Island families and \nmillions of vulnerable Americans across the country pay their energy \nbills. Simply put, access to affordable home energy is a matter of \nhealth and safety for many low-income households, children, and \nseniors.\n  In Rhode Island this year, LIHEAP provided roughly $24 million, which \nallowed the State to deliver assistance to 27,700 households. However, \ndespite bipartisan efforts that I have led with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to press for robust support for the program, \nfunding reductions in 2011 and 2012, along with sequester cuts, have \nled to a decrease in the number of households served. As a result, \nnearly 1.5 million vulnerable households have lost access to this vital \nlifeline.\n  With one of the harshest winters in decades and the high cost of \nenergy experienced in some regions of the country, including high \nnatural gas and heating oil prices in New England, the importance of \nthe LIHEAP program is even more pronounced. According to the Energy \nInformation Administration, the average cost of home heating this \nwinter will rise to nearly $1,000 on average, a 6 percent increase over \nlast year. These cost increases are happening at a time when households \nare receiving lower benefits. The average LIHEAP payments have been \nreduced by more than $100 since 2010, dropping from $520 in fiscal year \n2010 to $406 in fiscal year 2013.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the need to provide access to \naffordable home energy for the most vulnerable households in our States \nand join me in support of LIHEAP. This assistance is an indispensable \nlifeline, helping to ensure that recipients do not have to choose \nbetween paying their energy bills and affording other basic necessities \nsuch as food and medicine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/26/senate-section/article/S1773-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n  H.R. 2824.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish a deduction for married couples who are both employed and \nhave young children and to increase the earned income tax credit for \nchildless workers, and to provide for budget offsets; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, our workforce has changed a lot in the \nlast few decades. Thirty years ago the majority of families with \nchildren had only one parent working outside the home. More of the \ncountry's low-wage workers were teenagers earning some extra spending \nmoney. Today two-thirds of families with children rely on earnings from \nboth parents, and millions of low-wage workers in our country are far \nless likely to be teens supplementing their allowance and far more \nlikely to be adults struggling to support their families. It has also \ngotten a lot harder for young people just starting out to find work \nthat puts them on a strong path. There is a very concerning pattern of \nyoung people dropping out of the labor force rather than keeping up \ntheir search.\n  These are the kinds of trends we need to be thinking about as we look \nfor\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\nways to help today's workforce succeed in today's economy. There are \nmany steps we can and absolutely should take to tackle the barriers our \nworkers and our families are facing. We should start with raising the \nminimum wage because no one working full time in the United States \ntoday should live in poverty. Low-wage workers in today's economy, who \nare putting in very long hours while raising their children, paying \ntaxes, and trying to pay the bills, deserve a better shot at success.\n  But that is not the last step we should take. As we are looking for \nways to expand opportunity for struggling workers and families, we \nshould be using every tool in the box--including our Tax Code. Policies \nsuch as the earned-income tax credit have succeeded in helping millions \nof households lift themselves out of poverty, which is why Republicans \nand Democrats have come together to strengthen the EITC so many times \nin the past. But today too many struggling workers and families are \nleft behind under our outdated Tax Code.\n  It is time to build on these efforts to support work, including the \ncritical expansions of the EITC in 2009, which should be made \npermanent, and we need to update our Tax Code so that it reflects the \nneeds of today's workforce.\n  I am proud to be here today to introduce the 21st Century Worker Tax \nCut Act. It is a bill that would complement critical reforms, such as \nraising the minimum wage, by providing targeted tax cuts designed for \ntoday's workforce. It is paid for by closing wasteful loopholes that \nboth Democrats and Republicans have proposed eliminating.\n  The 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act would put in place a new tax \ndeduction to help struggling families with two workers keep more of \nwhat they earn. The way our Tax Code is currently structured, the \nsecond earner in a household often pays a higher tax rate on his or her \nearnings. Making matters worse, when a second earner decides to enter \nthe workforce, the family usually faces many new costs, such as \nchildcare or transportation, and the family can lose eligibility for \ncredits, such as the EITC and other benefits.\n  Add it all up, and many struggling two-earner families today end up \ntaking home a smaller percentage of their paycheck than many of the \nwealthiest households in America. These realities often discourage a \npotential second earner, such as a mother who is considering reentering \nthe workforce to return to her professional career.\n  Struggling families face a lot of challenges to getting ahead today. \nThe very least we can do is keep our Tax Code from forcing families to \ntake a half step backward for every step forward, and that is exactly \nthe problem the 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act will help to solve.\n  This bill will give our working families a 20-percent deduction on \nthe second earner's income. A mom or dad who goes back into the \nworkforce and brings home an extra $25,000, for example, would get a \n$5,000 deduction. For a family in the 25-percent bracket, that means \n$1,250 back in their pocket for groceries, childcare, transportation, \nor retirement savings.\n  The bill also reflects the reality that workers without dependent \nchildren and young workers who are just starting out are being left \nbehind under the current EITC. My colleague Senator Brown has been a \nleader on this issue. He is a cosponsor of the bill I am introducing \ntoday.\n  Unlike low-income workers with kids at home, workers without \ndependent children receive little or nothing from this credit. As \nworkers file their 2013 tax returns this spring, a single worker with \nno dependent children is eligible for a maximum credit of only $487. \nShe is entirely phased out of the credit once her income reaches \n$14,340, which is about what a full-time minimum wage worker would earn \nin a year. Young, childless workers under 25, who are starting out in a \ntough labor market, are not eligible at all. In an economy today where \nmore low-wage earners are middle-aged and where young people are \nstruggling to gain a toehold in the job market, it doesn't make any \nsense.\n  Our bill, the 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act, would increase the \nEITC for workers without dependent children to about $1,400 next year \nand expand the income range over which workers are eligible for the \ncredit. It would also lower the eligibility age for the childless \nworker to qualify for the EITC from 25 years old to 21 so that young \nworkers without dependents get the same incentives that have helped so \nmany others get on their feet. The Treasury Department estimated that \nEITC changes similar to these would help more than 13 million \nstruggling workers climb the economic ladder.\n  As we expand the EITC, we have a responsibility to do everything we \ncan to make sure this credit is going straight to the workers and \nfamilies who need it, and part of that responsibility is to make sure \nthat the EITC claims are filed correctly. Professional tax return \npreparers complete 70 percent of these EITC claims. Under our bill, the \n21st Century Worker Tax Cut, they would receive twice the current \npenalty if they don't follow due diligence requirements put in place by \nthe IRS.\n  Workers and families are playing fair, and the biggest corporations \nshould too, and that is why this bill would be paid for by closing \nloopholes that the biggest corporations take advantage of. The 21st \nCentury Worker Tax Cut would draw on a proposal from my colleague \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, who is also a cosponsor of this bill. His \nproposal closes a loophole that lets corporations claim outsized tax \nbreaks by paying their executives stock options instead of regular \npaychecks. This bill would also stop multinational corporations from \nshifting profits into tax havens such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands \nto avoid paying their fair share.\n  There is bipartisan support for closing those loopholes. Both \nDemocrats and House Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp have proposed \neliminating each of them. Updating our Tax Code to give tax breaks to \nour struggling workers instead of big corporations is the right thing \nto do.\n  As we continue this important debate about how to expand opportunity \nto those who are struggling today, we need to make sure we are giving \ntoday's workforce the best shot in today's economy. We should increase \nour outdated minimum wage to give millions of workers a raise, and then \nDemocrats and Republicans need to come together to update our Tax Code \nand give today's struggling workers the tax relief they deserve. The \n21st Century Worker Tax Cut would be a strong, fiscally responsible \nstep toward that bipartisan goal, and I am hopeful we can get this done \nfor our workers as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/26/senate-section/article/S1777-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1777-S1778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 399--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE AMERICAN GI FORUM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An American Fighter Ace is a fighter pilot who has \n     served honorably in a United States military service and who \n     has destroyed 5 or more confirmed enemy aircraft in aerial \n     combat during a war or conflict in which American armed \n     forces have participated.\n       (2) Beginning with World War I, and the first use of \n     airplanes in warfare, military services have maintained \n     official records of individual aerial victory credits during \n     every major conflict. Of more than 60,000 United States \n     military fighter pilots that have taken to the air, less than \n     1,500 have become Fighter Aces.\n       (3) Americans became Fighter Aces in the Spanish Civil War, \n     Sino-Japanese War, Russian Civil War, Arab-Israeli War, and \n     others. Additionally, American military groups' recruited \n     United States military pilots to form the American Volunteer \n     Group, Eagle Squadron, and others that produced American-born \n     Fighter Aces fighting against axis powers prior to Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       (4) The concept of a Fighter Ace is that they fought for \n     freedom and democracy across the globe, flying in the face of \n     the enemy to defend freedom throughout the history of aerial \n     combat. American-born citizens became Fighter Aces flying \n     under the flag of United States allied countries and became \n     some of the highest scoring Fighter Aces of their respective \n     wars.\n       (5) American Fighter Aces hail from every State in the \n     Union, representing numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural \n     backgrounds.\n       (6) Fighter Aces possess unique skills that have made them \n     successful in aerial combat. These include courage, judgment, \n     keen marksmanship, concentration, drive, persistence, and \n     split-second thinking that makes an Ace a war fighter with \n     unique and valuable flight driven skills.\n       (7) The Aces' training, bravery, skills, sacrifice, \n     attention to duty, and innovative spirit illustrate the most \n     celebrated traits of the United States military, including \n     service to country and the protection of freedom and \n     democracy.\n       (8) American Fighter Aces have led distinguished careers in \n     the military, education, private enterprise, and politics. \n     Many have held the rank of General or Admiral and played \n     leadership roles in multiple war efforts from WWI to Vietnam \n     through many decades. In some cases they became the highest \n     ranking officers for following wars.\n       (9) The extraordinary heroism of the American Fighter Ace \n     boosted American morale at home and encouraged many men and \n     women to enlist to fight for America and democracy across the \n     globe.\n       (10) Fighter Aces were among America's most-prized military \n     fighters during wars. When they rotated back to the United \n     States after combat tours, they trained cadets in fighter \n     pilot tactics that they had learned over enemy skies. The \n     teaching of combat dogfighting to young aviators strengthened \n     our fighter pilots to become more successful in the skies. \n     The net effect of this was to shorten wars and save the lives \n     of young Americans.\n       (11) Following military service, many Fighter Aces became \n     test pilots due to their superior flying skills and quick \n     thinking abilities.\n       (12) The American Fighter Aces are one of the most \n     decorated military groups in American history. Twenty-two \n     Fighter Aces have achieved the rank of Admiral in the Navy. \n     Seventy-nine Fighter Aces have achieved the rank of General \n     in the Army, Marines, and Air Force. Nineteen Medals of Honor \n     have been awarded to individual Fighter Aces.\n\n     SEC. 3.
