Mr. President, more than a century ago, a small drugstore \nopened for business in Barrett's Hotel in Chicago, IL. The pharmacist, \nnot yet 30 years old, and a veteran of the Spanish-American War, \nborrowed $6,000 to open this drugstore. His name was Charles Walgreen. \nThis was his first store but certainly not his last. As his chain grew, \nthe pharmacies became a fixture in American culture--you know, the \nvintage image of a soda fountain, milk shakes, a drugstore counter. \nThey would mix their own drugs to give pain medication and other \nproducts to people who came in that drugstore. This is how Walgreen's \nstarted.\n  Now, 113 years later, the Walgreen family no longer heads the \ncompany. But there are over 8,200 Walgreen's drugstores around the \ncountry. They still bear the Walgreen name. That company Charles \nWalgreen started is reportedly strongly considering a renunciation of \nits American citizenship and a move to Switzerland. Why? To avoid \npaying their fair share of taxes.\n  Reestablished as a foreign corporation, Walgreen's would pay a \nsmaller share of taxes. This practice is called ``inversion.'' It is a \ntax trick, a loophole. Of course, Walgreen's will not actually move to \nSwitzerland. Instead, they plan to acquire a European company and \nofficially make Switzerland home to their new headquarters, but in \nreality they will stay in Chicago right where they are now. That is \nbecause Walgreen's does not want to actually leave America. Why would \nthey? Why would they want to leave America? We have the most \nsophisticated workforce in the world. Why would they give that up? \nAmerica has the infrastructure that, although in need of updates, is \nstill the most extensive in the world. It provides Walgreen's with the \nroads and transportation it needs to supply its stores. Why would \nWalgreen's give that up?\n  Why would they give up the fact that we have a legal system we can \ntrust, that enforces business contracts and upholds intellectual \nproperty protections they need? They would not turn their heads and \nwalk away from that. America has a Medicare system that pays for \nseniors to buy pharmaceuticals at Walgreen's. I am sure Walgreen's will \nnot be turning away that cash; that is what it is, cash.\n  Let's not forget that Americans enjoy a law enforcement apparatus \nthat protects the company's assets. Why would Walgreen's want to give \nthat up? Our military, which is second to none, will continue to \nprotect the country where all of those Walgreen's stores are located. I \nam sure Walgreen's would not want to give that up. Not to mention the \nfact that America is a pretty good place to live.\n  So why would Walgreen's executives ever want to move their families \nacross the world? That would be foolish, would it not? Walgreen's \nleadership will probably stay right where they are now in their fancy \nhomes in America. While they remain here, Walgreen's will still expect \nAmerican tax credits, even as it dodges as much as $4 billion over the \nnext 5 years in taxes. That is what inversion is all about.\n  Essentially what Walgreen's is saying is we love America. We love \nbeing in America. But we are not going to pay for it. The dictionary \ndefines the word ``exploitation'' as ``the fact of making use of a \nsituation to gain unfair advantage.'' What a perfect explanation of \nwhat Walgreen's is going to do. What the Walgreen's company is doing \nsure seems like exploitation to me. After all, this is a corporation \nthat made $16.7 billion from Medicare and Medicaid last year--$16.7 \nbillion--and they are going to move overseas.\n  But, sadly, Walgreen's is not the only corporation jumping ship. \nMajor American companies such as Medtronic and others have already \nannounced plans to give up their corporate citizenship. Who will be \nnext? A decade ago, the senior Senator from Iowa warned of \n``unpatriotic companies that dash stash their cash.'' Now we are seeing \nthis dash-and-stash scheme become common practice for corporations that \ndo not want to pay their fair share of taxes.\n  In fact, the two largest transactions to move American companies \noverseas in history have taken place within the last month. When these \ncompanies reincorporate overseas, it is, simply put, unfair. It is \nunfair to the American taxpayer, to the American Government, and to \nmany companies that refuse to engage in this deceptive practice.\n  Why should other American pharmacy chains such as CVS Caremark and \nRite Aid be disadvantaged because Walgreen's balks at paying its fair \nshare of taxes? To uphold our free enterprise system and ensure that \nAmerican businesses are competing on a level playing field, Congress \nmust close this loophole.\n  We have a new chairman of the Finance Committee. The senior Senator \nfrom Oregon is known to be a man who is fair and will make sure that \npeople do not take advantage of others. He has made a commitment to me \nand anyone who will listen to him that this must change. It is going to \nstart with the Finance Committee and start very soon. I have been \nencouraged by his statements. He has indicated he will work to close \nthis loophole for these runaway companies.\n  The chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the \nsenior Senator from Michigan, has also been leading on this issue. He \nhas been talking about it for a long time. Two strong leaders--the \nsenior Senator from Michigan, the senior Senator from Oregon--have \nlocked arms and are going to do something about this.\n  Senator Levin's legislation, the Stop Corporate Inversion Act, puts a \n2-year moratorium on inversions by U.S. companies. This moratorium will \ngive Congress time to thoroughly and thoughtfully consider the issue. I \ndo not need a lot more thought on it. I am ready to roll on this one. \nWe need to get this done, and quickly. I will settle for the 2 years. I \nam frankly, though, open to all ideas. What I am not open to is the \nidea that this corporate exploitation of the American taxpayer \nis somehow acceptable, because it is not.\n\n  Today we are considering legislation that would amend the U.S. Tax \nCode to fight outsourcing, protect American jobs, and create job \ncreation within our borders. The Bring Jobs Home Act, which ends \nsenseless tax breaks for outsourcers, will offer companies a 20-percent \ntax credit to help with the cost of moving jobs back to America. Much \nlike the Bring Jobs Home Act, ending this corporate citizenship scam \nwill encourage American companies to pay their fair share. It will also \nlet corporations know that cheating the American people with their tax \ntrick is not a viable business plan.\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\n  Benjamin Franklin said this: ``Tricks and treachery are the practice \nof fools, who have not wits enough to be honest.'' If corporations want \nto leave America, it is their right. But American taxpayers should not \nbe forced to foot the bill when U.S. companies want all the benefits of \ncommerce in this country without having to pay their fair share.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4723-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

There is a lot we can get done in Washington when \nDemocrats are willing to put the politics aside and work together for \nbipartisan results.\n  We saw an example of that yesterday when the President signed a \nbipartisan workforce training bill into law, legislation I and others \nproudly supported. Unfortunately, though, we have rarely seen such \nbipartisanship from Washington Democrats these days. Working toward \nbipartisan solutions and helping the middle class, it always seems like \nsuch a chore for them. Just look at what President Obama and the \nmajority leader have planned for the coming days.\n  The President is off campaigning for a workforce training bill he \nalready signed. It makes no sense, but this is a man who just can't \nstop campaigning. And apparently the majority leader is suffering from \na similar condition. He is busy turning the Senate into a campaign \nstudio. He wants to spend more of the Senate's time on a designed-to-\nfail campaign bill that he loves to trot out before every national \nelection. We have seen this proposal a couple of years ago before the \nelection. Then, of course, for political purposes they pray that it \nwill fail.\n  Look, this is time that would be a lot better spent helping the \nmiddle-class families who are struggling in our country. Instead of \nworrying about design-to-fail legislation, we could be addressing \nthings like the highway bill, which already passed the Republican-led \nHouse with massive bipartisan support, or addressing the humanitarian \ncrisis on the southern border. That is where our focus should be. That \nis what the American people expect.\n  The Border Patrol estimates that as many as 90,000 unaccompanied \nchildren will have crossed our border by fall. It is a dangerous \njourney to the border, and many have suffered heartbreaking treatment \nand abuse. That is why anyone who wants to help these children should \nbe working overtime to spare them from this journey.\n  A few weeks ago the President made some modest policy recommendations \nthat should be a part of any legislation that deals with this crisis. \nUnfortunately, the far left objected and the President has since \nwobbled.\n  That has led to top Democrats in Congress balking at even the most \nmodest of reforms. They all seem to prefer a blank check that would \npreserve the status quo instead, and the President will barely lift a \nfinger to encourage his own party to support these simple reforms.\n  Remember, now, this is the same President who keeps telling us about \nthis mythical phone he plans to use. So what we are saying is use it. \nCall the Members of your own party who object to what you said you \nwanted and what we all know is needed.\n  Call the leadership of your party in the Senate who, despite the \nfootage on the evening news, pronounced our southern border to be \nsecure. Get them to support the policies that you told us would address \nthis crisis. Frankly, it would be a much better use of your time than \ncampaigning for a workforce bill you have already signed. Sending these \nchildren all over the country for indeterminate periods of time just \nisn't an answer.\n  We need to humanely return them to their homes as soon as possible, \nand President Obama needs to show some leadership to help us get a \nlong-term credible plan in place to do just that. He owes the country \nat least that much.\n  Remember, news reports suggest the President could have intervened \nlong ago to address this problem before it turned into a full-blown \nhumanitarian crisis. But according to the Washington Post, he \nprioritized politics over helping these children.\n  The paper cited a Congresswoman who admitted that her fellow \nDemocrats recognized the urgency of this crisis, but they kept mostly \nsilent because they didn't want to cause problems for the \nadministration's political priorities in Congress.\n  Democrats didn't want others to be able to point out that the \nPresident's policies had failed. It is really quite shameful. The Post \nalso cited one source who said the administration staff was concerned \nabout the growing number of children, but that they too were \neffectively overruled by White House political concerns.\n  Here is what the source said:\n\n       Was the White House told there were huge flows of Central \n     Americans coming? Of course they were told. A lot of times. . \n     . . Was there a general lack of interest and focus on the \n     legislation? Yes, that's where the focus was.\n\n  In short, it appears the Obama administration knew about this problem \na long time ago, did almost nothing, and the country is now faced with \nthis crisis.\n  So the President needs to get serious about this--not some other \ntime--now.\n  What we are saying is cut out the campaigning, tell your party's \nleadership in the Senate to get serious and work with Members of both \nparties to get this addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4723-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

What is this measure that is the \nsource of such a mystery on the floor of the Senate?\n  Well, it is an effort by Senator John Walsh of Montana and Senator \nDebbie Stabenow of Michigan to bring good-paying manufacturing and \nother jobs back home to America. Wouldn't you think that would be worth \na comment from the Republican leader or perhaps from one of the \nRepublican Senators? I hope it means they are going to join us in a \nbipartisan effort in a little over 1 hour to bring this measure to the \nfloor.\n  What does it say? Simple. We will give a tax break to companies that \nbring jobs home from overseas. We will reduce the current tax \nincentives for companies to ship American jobs overseas. There it is--\nstraightforward, clear--bring the jobs home.\n  I would think this would be so bipartisan it would get a unanimous \nvote at 11 o'clock. But the fact is, despite the support of all \nDemocratic Senators, we are still struggling to find five Republicans \nwho will join us so we can move to this measure and do something in the \nTax Code to help bring American jobs back home instead of shipping them \noverseas.\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\n  Senator Reid, our majority leader, spoke this morning about another \naspect of this issue. Sadly, in my home State of Illinois, a major \ncompany, AbbVie, which was formerly part of Abbot Laboratories, the \neighth largest pharmaceutical company, just announced last week they \nare going to relocate their corporate base of operations to an island \noff the U.K.\n  The U.K. is a beautiful country, but to think that American companies \nsuch as Abbot--now AbbVie--are prepared to desert America, is worth a \nlittle reflection.\n  Senator Reid raised an important point. Pharmaceutical companies in \nAmerica depend on tax-supported organizations and agencies. The \nNational Institutes of Health, the leading biomedical research agency \nin the world, is supported by American tax dollars. Pharmaceutical \ncompanies like AbbVie, with blockbuster drugs such as Humira, which has \nearned them over $1 billion so far this year, rely on the NIH for \nresearch and then rely on the taxpayer-supported U.S. Patent Office to \nprotect their legal rights.\n  They also count on the Food and Drug Administration, supported with \nU.S. tax dollars, to do the testing necessary to bring this drug to \nmarket. It is said the approval by the FDA of a drug in the United \nStates is really the gold standard--more than any other country.\n  So here is a pharmaceutical company which is very profitable, with \nover 4,000 employees, based in the United States, based in the State of \nIllinois for virtually its entire existence, now picking up and \nleaving. Why? They are leaving to avoid paying taxes in the United \nStates.\n  What is the definition of a corporate ingrate? I think it would start \nwith a company that has become immensely profitable because of the \nUnited States of America and the agencies of its government that \nsupport that company which is now turning its back on the United \nStates.\n  Across the street the Supreme Court tells us with regularity we have \nto view corporations now as persons. They are no longer legal \ncreations. They have some personhood under the Constitution, according \nto five of our Supreme Court justices--personhood that entitles them to \nfreedom of speech under the Citizens United decision, personhood which \nentitles them under the Hobby Lobby decision to have religious freedom \nas a corporation.\n\n  So if we are going to give personhood to corporations, what can we \nsay of this decision to renounce their American citizenship to get a \ntax break?\n  I think what we can say is these inverters are deserters, to quote \nAllan Sloan and others who have written about this issue in the past.\n  I am troubled by this, and I am troubled there isn't a sense of \noutrage on both sides of the aisle.\n  Senator Reid has spoken about this issue, I have spoken to it, \nSenator Levin of Michigan has been a leader on this issue, and yet the \nRepublicans are strangely silent. Do they believe it is in the best \ninterests of the United States for our major corporations to pick up, \ncut and run, go to some foreign land, claim this is now their new \nheadquarters, and avoid paying taxes in the United States?\n  This process, known as inversion, is a clever tax dodge. At the end \nof the day, who loses? Well, I can tell you. The taxpayers in this \ncountry lose because valuable revenue and resources are no longer there \nto sustain our great Nation, whether it is the defense of this country, \nthe building of infrastructure, great agencies like the National \nInstitutes of Health--the list goes on. There will be money lost.\n  Who are the winners? The winners are those investment bankers, folks \nwho are buying up these corporations and coming up with these tax \ndodges and incentives to raise stock prices at any cost.\n  I often wonder, as I look at the list of members of the boards of \ndirectors of AbbVie and Walgreens, if there wasn't in their boardroom \none person who held up their hand and said: Does anybody else feel a \nlittle sick about this--that we would give up on America, that AbbVie \nwould renounce its American citizenship; that we would listen to those \nwho say stock price is more important than loyalty to the country we \nlive in, the country we have prospered in? Was there one hand in the \nair dissenting from this corporate desertion of the United States?\n  I think this is worth a debate. I think it is worth bringing this \nbill to the floor, S. 2569. In a little over 1 hour we will have a \nchance to decide whether it should come to the floor. There aren't many \nthings that we do around here that have an impact on the lives of \nAmericans. This one will. This bill will bring jobs home from overseas.\n  Senator Reid has suggested we move into the inversion--a change in \nthe Tax Code. I support that. I am a cosponsor of Senator Levin's bill. \nThat, to me, is overdue. Last week Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew \nissued a statement about this warning us this was just the beginning; a \ndozen corporations are now working on this.\n  One of the corporate leaders on the street, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan \nChase, said in Fortune magazine: We shouldn't moralize about this \ndecision.\n  He characterized it as largely a protest against the Tax Code--the \nunfair Tax Code.\n  I wish to remind Mr. Dimon and the CEOs and members of the boards of \nthese corporations, this Tax Code, which certainly should be reformed, \nis the same Tax Code that has generated record-breaking corporate \nprofits and record-breaking CEO salaries.\n  I didn't hear complaints about that so-called unfair Tax Code when \nthese corporations were making record-breaking profits or getting \ncompensation at record-breaking levels. It troubles me too that many of \nthe corporations that are now rationalizing abandoning the United \nStates not that long ago were counting on this government and taxpayers \nall across the United States to bail them out.\n  When the Wall Street banks were failing, when AIG was flat on its \nback, did they turn to Ireland or Switzerland for help? No. They turned \nto Washington and the United States of America and to the taxpayers who \ncame through with billions of dollars to save them from their perfidy.\n  That is the reality of history, a reality which many of these \ncorporate deserters are now ignoring. I have trouble with this--\nclearly, a great deal of trouble. I am going to offer an amendment, \nshould we get on this bill, called the Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act.\n  Very simply, here is what it says: If you have a corporation in the \nUnited States, headquartered in our country, and you have not moved \njobs overseas; if you pay your employees at least $15 an hour, which \nmeans they don't qualify for most Federal benefits, just their \npaycheck; if you will give them quality health insurance as required by \nthe Affordable Care Act; if you will provide at least 5 percent of \ntheir income as a contribution by the company toward their retirement; \nand if you will give a preference for the hiring of veterans, you will \nbe entitled to the patriot employer tax credit, a credit for each of \nyour employees. I think that is the proper incentive--incentivizing and \nrewarding companies that are making a positive difference in the lives \nof their employees, staying in the United States, committed to this \ncountry.\n  How would I pay for that? Well, I have an idea. It would end the \ndeductions currently available for corporations that want to move their \njobs overseas. To me, that makes perfect sense. Encourage the payment \nof Americans in good-paying companies and discourage sending jobs \noverseas.\n  Why won't the Republicans discuss this with us? Why isn't this a \nbipartisan issue? Do they honestly believe only Democrats object to \nshipping American jobs overseas? Everyone objects to it. We want to \nkeep good-paying jobs at home. We want to be able to walk into stores \nand see the label ``Made in the U.S.A.'' more often. We want to \nencourage our companies to stay in America, to set the standard in \nAmerica, to lead in the world. Let's have a tax code that helps us \nreach that goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time of\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nthe quorum call be equally divided between Democrats and Republicans \nfor the remainder of the debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the unanimous \nconsent request? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Bring Jobs \nHome Act. There has been some discussion on the floor about this act \nalready, but I wish to lend my voice to that. This is a commonsense \nbill to bring good-paying middle-class jobs back to America.\n  When we look at the terrible recession this Nation went through a few \nyears ago, we have seen that our recovery has been sluggish. One of the \nreasons it has been sluggish is because these good middle-class jobs in \nmany cases just aren't here anymore. They have gone overseas. They have \ngone to China, Mexico, Vietnam, and other countries around the globe. \nThey are not here.\n  We need to grow this economy from the middle. We have the statistics \nto see that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting \npoorer. That should concern everyone in this Chamber. I know it \nconcerns economists and it concerns people all over the country. These \nare kitchen-table issues for people. We need to grow our economy from \nthe middle. That is what this proposed act is all about.\n  My home State of Arkansas is a good example. We have seen good \ncompanies, such as Levi Strauss, Whirlpool, Fruit of the Loom--these \nare name-brand companies. Everybody knows these companies. We have seen \nthem, one after the other, leave Arkansas, abandon our State and our \nNation to go find cheap wages overseas.\n  To rub salt in the wounds, through their hard-earned tax dollars, \nthese very same workers have helped pay for the companies to move their \njobs overseas because the companies are able to write off the move \noverseas as a business expense. In effect, the U.S. taxpayer ends up \nhelping to export jobs out of the United States. It is a policy that \ndoes not make sense. It is a policy we need to change. That is one part \nof the Bring Jobs Home Act that is critically important that we pass as \nquickly as possible. I think most of my colleagues will agree with me \nwhen they say this tax giveaway is counterproductive. In fact, it is \noutrageous that we continue to allow this to happen.\n  Fortunately, even though my State has lost some jobs, we have some \nvery good job replacements as well. Last week I had the good pleasure \nand fortune of meeting with a man in Rogers, AR, named Bill Redman, the \nfounder and CEO of a small toy company. This toy company has moved its \noperation from China to Rogers, AR, in the northwest corner of the \nState, because the economics of manufacturing now favor ``Made in the \nU.S.A.'' That is very positive.\n  We are seeing this with companies all over the country, and we would \nsee even more of it if we passed the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  A study shows that the $18.55-an-hour average wage created by this \ntoy company I was talking about--created by his company in Arkansas--\nwill pump $3 million back into the local economy. So if he pays his \npeople $18.55, the stimulative effect of that is $3 million into the \nlocal economy. It also shows that each job he creates will support four \nother jobs that provide services to what he is doing. These may be \ntruckdrivers, they may be people who print the boxes or the labels or \nmake the containers or whatever it is, but for every job he creates, \nthere are four other jobs that are created. So there is a huge \nmultiplier effect in bringing jobs home to America.\n  If we see that in Rogers, AR, we know we see that in the other 50 \nStates of the Union. So if we want to keep America as a nation of \nmakers--and that is in our DNA as a nation. We make things in this \ncountry. We have always done it. We have always done it better than \nanybody else in the world. If we want to keep America a nation of \nmakers, we need more companies like Redman & Associates in Arkansas, \nbut this will only happen if we tip the scale in the right direction, \nand that is what this Bring Jobs Home Act is all about.\n  The policy that we make here in the Senate or that we don't make here \nin the Senate has a huge bearing on what the future of the Nation will \nlook like. So let's do the right thing. Let's end this tax giveaway for \nthe companies that ship their jobs overseas to places such as Mexico \nand China and many other countries. Let's instead provide meaningful \ntax incentives for those jobs to come back home, to create these good-\npaying middle-class jobs right here in the good old U.S.A.\n  From my standpoint, this is good commonsense policy, it is good \ncommonsense economics, and I hope my colleagues will join me as well as \nmany others of us here in this Chamber in supporting this Bring Jobs \nHome Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to speak for a few minutes and \nstart by talking about these court cases yesterday that create more \ncomplications particularly for the President's health care plan.\n  The idea that the law is specific, which is what the Washington, DC, \nFederal Court of Appeals said--the law specifically says, in the case \nthey dealt with, that people can only get the taxpayer subsidy if they \nwork through the State exchanges. There is no question that the law, in \ndealing with this issue, in clear language makes that case, and the \njudges agreed that was the case made.\n  What happened was that not only did many States decide not to set up \nthe exchanges because of the expense involved and the problems involved \nand the complications of the law, but even the States that did set up \nthe exchanges couldn't get them to work. I don't know that any State \nspent more money than Oregon did--certainly they spent a lot of money--\nand in the first 6 months did not sign up anybody--nobody. Not a single \nperson was able to sign up through the exchange they set up.\n  Massachusetts--a State which actually had experience with its own law \nand which I would have thought would have been the easiest possible \nexchange to set up--also admitted they failed. Massachusetts has to go \nthrough the Federal exchange.\n  I think 36 States have either not set up the exchange or tried to and \nfailed. So in 36 States the only option people have to get insurance in \nan exchange as an individual--many of their policies were previously \ncanceled because of the law--is to go to the Federal exchange. Now, \nthrough a ruling in the DC court, they say you can go to the Federal \nexchange. We should understand this.\n  I have been on record saying I think people should try their best to \nhave insurance. If the insurance people need is what the Federal \nGovernment prescribes people should have--and that is insurance people \ncan afford--obviously the exchange can be a place to get it, and it is \na place to get insurance whether it is subsidized or not. But many \npeople will find that those new higher rates at the exchange, without \ntaxpayer assistance, just don't work for them.\n  The law was poorly written. It was poorly structured. It was crammed \ndown the throats of the minority in both the House and in the Senate \nand, in my view, the health care providers and people who want \ninsurance in this country, in the way it was passed.\n  There are many lessons to be learned from the Affordable Care Act, \nand one is never pass a piece of legislation this way because the \nRichmond court said yesterday that there are other places in the law--\neven though they surely said it was clear where the law refers to \nsubsidizing people to get insurance\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\nthrough the exchange, and they surely knew that was clear, they said \nthere are other places in the law that indicate maybe that is not the \nway it was.\n  Why is that? Why wasn't that debated on the floor of the Senate and \non the floor of the House? It wasn't debated because one side decided \nthey were going to do this exactly the way they wanted to do it and \nthey were going to do it by themselves. There was that brief moment \nwhere there were 60 Democrats in the Senate. They passed the current \nlaw that I fully believe nobody expected would be the health care law.\n  The way we used to pass laws in the Congress, through the entire \nconstitutional history of the country, was that the Senate would pass a \nbill, the House would pass a bill, and then we would go to conference \nand figure out, No. 1, how the two bills came together and, No. 2, what \ndidn't make as much sense--when we had time to step back and look at \nit--as it seemed to make in the heat of the floor debate.\n  That didn't happen with this law. Why didn't it happen with this law? \nBecause by the time the Senate passed the bill and it was time for the \nHouse to deal with it, there were suddenly 59 Senators on the \nDemocratic side in the majority of the Senate. We remember the Scott \nBrown election in Massachusetts. Everybody was surprised except maybe \nScott Brown, but he was elected, so there were no longer 60 votes in \nthe Senate, which is what it takes to do whatever the majority wants to \ndo.\n  So apparently the message to the House of Representatives, controlled \nby the Democrats and Speaker Pelosi, was the only way we are going to \npass a health care bill that goes anywhere near this floor is to pass \nthe bill the Senate passed. There will be no conference. There will be \nno cleaning up this piece of legislation. There will be no discussion \nas to what we can do to actually make this work. We are going to pass \nthis bill.\n\n  Not a single Republican in the Senate voted for it, and not a single \nRepublican in the House would vote for it.\n  What is the unintended consequence of that? How do we go back and \nclean up the bill? People decided, if they participated in that \nprocess, that their momentary power was so important they were not \ngoing to involve anybody else's ideas in a way that would get a single \nvote from the other side.\n  One of the great lessons to learn is if we are going to mess with \neverybody's health care and we are going to impact 16 or 18 percent of \nthe entire economy, they better have buy-in from more than just one \ngroup of Americans who represent one political party or one point of \nview.\n  So now we have this confusion that will go on until I assume the \nSupreme Court determines the difference in these two Federal courts of \nappeal decisions, but it will be months before that happens. We will \nsee if taxpayers subsidize others getting their insurance. We will see \nwhat happens to people who got a subsidy if the subsidy turns out to be \none that was inappropriately given. And we will see how we move \nforward.\n  Then there is also this discussion going on--some of which we had on \nthe floor last week--about religious freedom as it relates to that law. \nThere is a so-called accommodation for religious groups who don't \nbelieve they should have to pay for certain things. The Little Sisters \nof the Poor--who, by the way, were listed on one advocacy group for the \nlaw as it was being applied--the Little Sisters of the Poor were listed \nas one of the 100 dirty employers in America because they worked with \n100 church groups and others who tried to take this idea to court that \npeople could be forced to do things that violate their faith \nprinciples. If we have come to a point that the Little Sisters of the \nPoor are one of the evil employers in America, we better think about \nhow we got to this point.\n  Actually, Justice Sotomayor gave, on her own--the Little Sisters of \nthe Poor said: Not only do we not want to do that, we don't agree with \nthe so-called accommodation that if we sign a paper saying we don't \nwant to do this but our insurance company will--what did the Little \nSisters of the Poor think was wrong with that? What could possibly be \nwrong with that? All they are asked to do is to sign a piece of paper \nthat says they believe it is wrong but it is OK with them if somebody \nelse pays for it. That is obviously not right. Justice Sotomayor, on \nher own, gave the relief the Little Sisters of the Poor asked for, but \nthen only a few weeks later she is outraged when the rest of the Court \ngives the exact same relief to Wheaton College.\n  Wheaton College--a Christian college near Chicago and the President's \nhome State--has a long-term commitment to their faith principles, and \nthey basically said: We are just like the Little Sisters of the Poor. \nWe don't believe this is right, and we don't want to sign a piece of \npaper that says we think it is wrong but it is OK with us if somebody \nelse pays for it.\n  Then, in a story I just read today, there was the constant concern \nthat the health care plan narrows one's ability to get health care \nbecause it restricts the network one can go to. In at least one State, \nhalf of the hospitals in the State don't participate in anything people \ncould get access to through the Affordable Care Act as an individual or \na family. So people have to drive by their old hospital, drive by their \nold doctor's office to get to a doctor or a hospital that may or may \nnot see them. I think the hospital has to see you; I don't think the \ndoctor does. But people have to drive by the old to get to the new.\n  We just had this big discussion. I had the great opportunity to speak \nat the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday, \nand obviously, as did everybody else there, I had on my mind what was \nhappening with the Veterans' Administration. At the same time we are \ntalking about how to give veterans more choices, we are talking about \nhow to give everybody else fewer choices.\n  This is a great quote: Networks help to contain costs. Well, of \ncourse they do. If a person can't get to see the doctor or it is \ninconvenient to go to the hospital, of course it contains costs.\n  Then we have the bill on the floor this week about economic \nopportunity, economic advancement. One of the great attacks on economic \nopportunity has been the attack on the 40-hour workweek. What happened \nto the 40-hour workweek for many people working in this country? The \nFederal Government, for the first time ever, said employers have to \nprovide insurance and this is what it has to look like. Whether you can \nafford it as an employer or not, whether your employees want to take it \nor not, you have to provide insurance. This is what it is supposed to \nlook like for everybody who works 30 hours or more.\n  Actions have consequences. No matter what the administration might \nthink about EPA rules on water, EPA rules on the utility bill, HHS \nrules on health care, actions have consequences, and a lot of people \nwho used to work 40 hours now may be working 50 hours, but they are \ndoing it at two different jobs, neither of which has benefits. The 40-\nhour job that in more cases than not had benefits that both the \nemployer and the employee thought were good--and 85 percent of \neverybody who got health insurance at work thought it was good, thought \nit met their needs--85 percent. Most people had insurance at work, but \nnow many people go to work without insurance, while the only people at \nthe place they go to work who get insurance are the managers and the \nlongtime employees or the people who work more than 30 hours.\n  The chances to advance if you are in a part-time job are a lot less \nthan the chances to advance if you are in a full-time job. I suggest if \nwe were really trying to get people to work here this week, instead of \nmaking political points, we would be talking about the 40-hour \nworkweek, we would be talking about the advanced manufacturing bill the \nSenator from Ohio Mr. Brown and I have that others are very interested \nin--and it is bipartisan interest--we would be talking about the BRIDGE \nAct that allows more infrastructure building that Senator Warner and I \nhave--another bipartisan piece of legislation--we would be talking \nabout the Build America Act that helps State and local governments with \ninfrastructure by allowing companies--the very companies, apparently, \nthat are being talked about this week in a piece of legislation \neverybody knows cannot pass that has no bipartisan support--we would be \ntalking about companies that would be allowed to bring profits they \nhave made overseas--they pay taxes on it overseas--that they would\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\nbe allowed to bring those profits here in a way that would encourage \nState and local governments to expand their infrastructure and maintain \ntheir infrastructure, making their sewer system, their water system, \ntheir road and bridge system all work better.\n  The unintended consequences of not thinking through what is the \nconstitutional responsibility of the House and the Senate are \nsignificant. We need to understand the impact of what we do and the \nimpact of what we fail to do. Failing to have a health care system that \nmeets people's needs, failing to have a 40-hour workweek where we \nfigure out how to encourage rather than discourage--failing to get \npeople into that first job is a failure that lasts for a long time. If \nyou do not advance in your twenties at work as you should, when you get \nto be 30, somebody else in a better economy in their twenties is likely \nto pass you because the opportunity you had was disrupted by \ncircumstances that the government could not control or in many cases \ntoday circumstances the government could control and actually works in \na way that makes those circumstances worse, not better.\n  I would like to see us do the kinds of things that get people to \nwork, talk about the kind of legislation that is bipartisan, that could \npass both Houses of Congress. There are plenty of them out there. I \ncontinue to hope we figure out how to get to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  If nobody is prepared to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, in a few minutes we are going to have \nthe opportunity to make it clear to the American people that we get it, \nthat we understand, that we need to be bringing jobs home to America, \nthat it is not acceptable we have lost 2.4 million manufacturing jobs. \nIn fact, as we see more companies coming back to the United States, we \nneed to reward them. We need to say: We are open for business. Come on \nback. And we are going to make sure we have a Tax Code that supports \nthose decisions.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act, which Senator Walsh is leading--and I want \nto commend him. I know he has talked to me about how important it is to \nhis State of Montana. It certainly is to my State of Michigan as well. \nWe have this opportunity, through Senator Walsh's Bring Jobs Home Act, \nto show that we are going to begin the process of making our tax system \nwork for American workers, American businesses, and communities.\n  So we have a vote in a few minutes on whether to proceed to this \nbill. It is not the final vote. The question is, is this an important \nenough topic that we would actually proceed to the bill? That is the \nquestion. Because there has been objection to just proceeding, as we \nknow, we have to get 60 votes, a supermajority, to proceed. I would \nhope this is something we would see 100 people--everybody in the U.S. \nSenate--agree that, yes, we should be debating this issue of how we \nbring jobs home to America. I cannot imagine a more critical issue for \neveryone whom we represent.\n  This bill is very simple. First of all, if you are packing up and \nleaving this country, you should not be able to write off the cost. The \nworker who helps pack the equipment that is going to be going overseas \nshould not be paying the bill through the Tax Code. The community that \nsees the factory empty once the business leaves should not be paying \nthrough the Tax Code for the costs of the move. So this bill says no \nmore writeoffs if you are leaving the country.\n  On the other hand, if you want to bring jobs home, you can write off \nthose costs that our Tax Code will allow you to take as a business \nexpense and--because we think it is so important--we will add another \n20-percent tax credit on top of it.\n  So, very simply, if you want to come home, we are all in. We want to \nsupport you doing that. We congratulate those businesses that are \nmaking the right business decision right now--for a lot of good \nreasons: low energy costs, a high-skilled workforce. There are a lot of \nreasons why folks are coming home. But if you want to leave, you are on \nyour own. That is what the bill is all about. I hope everyone will vote \nto proceed to the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I rise today regarding an issue that is \ncrucial to our country's economic future. In recent decades we have \nseen too many multinational corporations close factories in the United \nStates while at the same time opening new plants in other countries, \ngetting rid of American jobs and creating jobs overseas. It is wrong, \nand it strikes the heart of American competitiveness.\n  Too many big businesses are engaged in this harmful race to the \nbottom. They are moving their business operations out of America to \ncountries with lower wages and fewer worker protections, and they are \ncosting Americans jobs.\n  Businesses make decisions in order to make profits, which is usually \ngood for jobs and growing our economy. But it is outrageous that \nAmerican workers are forced to subsidize decisions that send American \njobs overseas.\n  Under our current Tax Code, corporations can claim a deduction for \nexpenses associated with closing operations in the United States and \nmoving them overseas. This is a fundamentally wrong policy that \nencourages multinational corporations to send jobs abroad.\n  I believe that leveling the playing field for American workers should \nbe a nonpartisan issue. That is why I have sponsored the Bring Jobs \nHome Act. I would like to thank my fellow sponsor, Senator Stabenow, \nfor her tireless effort and work on behalf of American workers. I say \nto Senator Stabenow, you are respected around the country for your \nservice and what you are doing.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act is a straightforward bill. First, companies \nwill no longer be able to claim a tax deduction for the costs of moving \njobs overseas. This just makes sense. I imagine most Americans would be \nshocked to learn that multinational corporations are allowed to claim \nsuch a tax break. I am also sure that most small business owners, who \ncannot take advantage of this tax break, would also be outraged.\n  Taxpayers should not be asked to continue to foot the bill for the \ncosts associated with shutting down factories in the United States in \norder to move jobs to countries such as China or Mexico.\n  Second, the Bring Jobs Home Act will create a new 20-percent tax \ncredit for companies that bring jobs back to the United States.\n  It is time we set new priorities for American job creation. We should \nbe doing everything we possibly can to encourage job growth and \ncreation here in the United States.\n  In Montana, where I am from, Montanans believe in American workers \nand the power of American industry and innovation. We believe that \nAmerican workers are essential to America's economy. But they need and \ndeserve a level playing field.\n  Since the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, many of our constituents \nhave been trapped in a vicious cycle of instability and uncertainty \nthat comes with long-term unemployment. We want to see more job \nopportunities for Americans. It is our responsibility as leaders to \nbring our jobs back home. So today I urge my colleagues to stand with \nAmerican workers and vote for this bill.\n  There are companies out there right now that are considering bringing \nbusiness activities back to the United States. We must do everything we \npossibly can to help those companies create jobs and grow our American \neconomy right here at home.\n  In Montana people take pride in producing quality products here at \nhome. I recently toured a company in Manhattan, MT--Blackhawk--that \nmanufactures top-of-the-line outdoor gear and sporting goods for \nsportsmen and women, military, and law enforcement. It is an example of \nAmerican ingenuity, putting Montanans to work on American soil.\n  It is time for Congress to show true leadership and put partisan \npolitics\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\naside. So today I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting \nbringing American jobs back to America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The general \ncounsel fulfills key responsibilities in these efforts, including \ninvestigating and prosecuting allegations of unfair labor practices.\n  Ms. Clark has served in this position for almost five years, and has \nfulfilled her responsibilities effectively and with distinction.\n  However, her term expires on August 7--just 15 days from today. If \nthe Senate allows her term to lapse without reconfirming her, the \nposition will become vacant and, by law, no one else can fulfill the \nfunctions of her office. Our inaction will cause a backlog of \ncomplaints and appeals to form.\n  This has happened before, and Ms. Clark spent much of her first year \nas general counsel clearing a backlog that developed because of a \nprevious vacancy.\n  Ms. Clark is highly qualified, and we must fulfill our constitutional \nduty and confirm Ms. Clark today in order to allow her to continue \ndoing her job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4728-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JULIA AKINS CLARK TO BE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE FEDERAL \n                       LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF ANDREW H.

The Senate will resume legislative session.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I am pleased that today we \nwere able to put aside the partisan politics and vote for what was \nright for the American people. I hope my colleagues will also vote for \nthe final bill. We must protect American jobs and eliminate tax \nloopholes for corporations that move jobs overseas. Creating and \nsupporting well-paying American jobs should be our top priority.\n  The debate about jobs in America and New Mexico is not about \npolitics; it is about people. This past weekend I visited with some New \nMexicans who are facing a very real and personal\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nchallenge as far as their future and their livelihood.\n  In Questa, NM, miners have worked for nearly a century. But that mine \nis now closing--less than 2 weeks from today--and 300 people will lose \ntheir jobs. For the workers, for their families, and for local \nbusinesses, it is a hard time, with tough questions and uncertain \nanswers.\n  Just this past Sunday I met with the miners to talk with them and, \nmost importantly, to listen about what has happened in Questa and the \nfuture of a great community.\n  This is about more than Chevron Corporation's decision to close the \nmine; it is about workers who feel they were kept in the dark, who \nworry that help will be too little and too late. My office is working \nclosely with the community for trade adjustment assistance to get the \ntraining and help they will need.\n  Folks there are struggling, but they are committed to mapping out a \nnew future for Questa, a post-mining economy, including ecotourism and \nrenewable energy.\n  Families have lived and worked in Questa for generations. They know \nhard work, grit, and determination. No one needs to tell them about \nthat. They helped build our country. They support their community, and \nthey follow the rules. They ask for one thing in return: a fair \nchance--that is all, just a fair chance.\n  Let's be clear. For the Supreme Court, for those who seem to be \nconfused on this point, these miners are people, their families are \npeople. Corporations are not people. Super PACs buying our elections--\nthey are not people. They are special interests with a lot of money and \na lot of demands, such as special tax breaks--tax breaks that make no \nsense to real people with real problems who are looking for real jobs.\n  We need to be doing all we can to create jobs, to keep building our \neconomy. The Bring Jobs Home Act would help--a tax policy that brings \njobs home, not one that rewards sending them away. Almost 2.5 million \njobs have gone over the past 10 years, shipped overseas and paid for by \nthe American taxpayers, by families such as those in Questa footing the \nbill.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act would do two important things: First, it \nwould end the tax loophole for outsourcing jobs. If corporations want \nto send a job overseas, they can do so but at their own expense, not at \nthe expense of the American taxpayers. Second, it would create the \nright incentives, giving a tax credit for companies that bring jobs \nback home. This is a pretty simple idea. Let's reward what helps and \nstop rewarding what doesn't.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act will do something else too. For the middle \nclass in this country, for workers and families, it will say: We hear \nyou. Your voice matters too. And all the super PAC dollars can't change \nthat.\n  We can create jobs right here at home. We can keep growing our \neconomy and help communities with a tax policy that builds them up and \ninvests in the future. That is something to fight for. That is the kind \nof fairness folks want and deserve in Questa, in my State and in our \ncountry.\n  The mine will close in Questa. We can't change that. We can't bring \nit back. Some folks say that it will feel like a death the day that \ndoor closes, that it almost feels like a funeral, as if a part of them \ndies with the mine. And I am sure it does. It has been the lifeblood of \nthe community for so many years and for so many generations of \nfamilies. But folks there said something else too: When bad things \nhappen, friends and family show up to do what they can to help.\n  We need to start showing up for the American worker, for the middle \nclass, for towns all across our Nation where the factory closed, where \nthe jobs went away. The Bring Jobs Home Act is a start to create jobs, \nto build our economy here at home, and to help communities in a world \nthat is changing awfully fast. It is a step in the right direction, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico \nfor his compelling remarks about the importance of passing the Bring \nJobs Home Act.\n  I am here to echo the need to pass this critical legislation, and I \nam certainly pleased we had such a strong vote to end debate on this \nlegislation. I hope we can now come to some agreement and get the same \nkind of support for moving the bill forward. I am an original cosponsor \nof this commonsense bill.\n  As Senator Udall said, this legislation would end incentives for \ncompanies to send American jobs overseas, and it would instead \nencourage companies to move jobs back to the United States.\n  Believe it or not, when a company moves jobs offshore, it can write \noff those expenses on its taxes. That doesn't make sense. The Bring \nJobs Home Act would stop forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for \ncompanies when they ship jobs overseas. In addition, to encourage \ncompanies to move production back to the United States, the bill \nprovides a tax credit for the costs associated with bringing jobs back \nhome.\n  Not only is this legislation the right thing to do, but it also comes \nat a critical time as our economy struggles to recover. In New \nHampshire and across the country--as Senator Udall pointed out, in New \nMexico with the closing of the mine and in that community--we are still \nfeeling the effects of the great recession. Millions of Americans lost \ntheir jobs, and too many middle-class families are still struggling to \nmake ends meet.\n  But sadly, even before the recession hit, the American middle class \nwas finding it hard to pay their bills, to pay their mortgage, to find \nthe good jobs that allowed them to have opportunities. A big reason for \nthat was the loss of so many good-paying American jobs that supported \nthe middle class. Too many of those jobs were shipped overseas. Over \nthe last decade, 2.4 million jobs were shipped overseas, and those 2.4 \nmillion families supported by those jobs had to find other ways to \nsupport themselves, and often they were in jobs that didn't pay as \nwell.\n  Well, it doesn't have to be this way. In fact, many companies are now \nlooking to move jobs back to the United States. As production costs \nrise overseas, these companies want the advantages provided by our \nAmerican workers--the most productive workers in the world--and the \nease of doing business in the United States.\n  I have heard from several companies that have already moved jobs back \nto the United States, and there are many more that are hoping to bring \njobs back home if we have the right policies in place.\n  Let me give an example. Last year I met with Doug Clark, who is the \nCEO of a footwear manufacturing company, New England Footwear. When we \nthink footwear manufacturing or shoe factory jobs, we don't think the \nUnited States anymore because while there are still some very good \ncompanies that manufacture footwear here, most of those jobs were sent \noffshore a long time ago.\n  I know that story very well because my father was in shoe \nmanufacturing. The whole time I was growing up, I watched him struggle \nwith the loss of those shoe manufacturing jobs that were being sent \noverseas and imports coming in to take the place of shoes made here in \nAmerica and the jobs that workers here in America held.\n  Today about 99 percent of shoes sold in the United States are made \nabroad. But New England Footwear executives, who have years of \nexperience in the shoe industry, are looking to bring those jobs back \nhome--back to New Hampshire. The company currently manufactures in \nChina, but as costs rise there, Doug believes he can bring higher \npaying jobs to the United States thanks to innovative technology that \nreduces manufacturing costs.\n  New England Footwear isn't alone. A Boston Consulting Group survey \nfrom last September showed that more than half of large U.S.-based \nmanufacturers are planning or considering right now bringing production \nlines back to the United States from China. That is up 17 percent from \njust 2 years ago--17 percent. That is a big increase, a lot of jobs. \nThe Boston Consulting Group projected that production reshored from \nChina and higher exports due to improved U.S. competitiveness in \nmanufacturing could create 2.5 to 5 million American factory and \nrelated service jobs by 2020. So by 2020 we could replace more than the \njobs we lost in the\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\nlast decade. That is the kind of behavior we should be encouraging. \nThat is exactly what the bill before us does.\n  We know it will work because a 2012 MIT forum on supply chain \nmanagement found that providing tax credits for bringing American jobs \nback to the United States would be one of the most effective ways to \naccelerate that process, along with other commonsense measures such as \nenacting tax reform, which we all agree we have to do, providing \nresearch and development incentives, ensuring a highly educated \nworkforce, and improving American infrastructure. Again, these are all \nchallenges which I think the majority of us in this body understand \nhave to be done.\n\n  I am very glad the Senate moved to this bill because our priority in \nWashington must be creating jobs and restoring the American middle \nclass. Over the past few decades too many Americans have seen their \njobs disappear or their incomes fall. The Bring Jobs Home Act is an \nopportunity to support those families by creating good-paying jobs in \nthe United States and by helping our economy regain its competitive \nedge.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The HUMANE Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in recent days I have come to the floor \nseveral times to talk about the humanitarian crisis on our southwestern \nborder where a veritable flood of unaccompanied children, from Central \nAmerica mainly, is appearing on our border and turning themselves in to \nthe Border Patrol because they realize that ultimately they will be \nreleased to a relative in the United States with a notice to appear at \na future court date. The vast majority of them will fail to appear for \nthat court date and successfully end up staying in the United States, \nnotwithstanding the fact that it does not comply with our law.\n  But in recent days a curious division has emerged from our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle on a fundamental issue that I want to \nhighlight. On the one hand, more and more Democrats are calling on \nCongress to reform this 2008 law that inadvertently has become a magnet \nfor illegal immigration by Central American minors. On the other hand, \nSenate Democratic leadership is refusing to consider any such reforms. \nThey just want the cash. They wanted the money the President has asked \nfor. So they are asking Congress to simply throw more money at the \nproblem. The figure they have now settled on is $2.7 billion. The \nAssociated Press has called this ``problematic.''\n  If you have a humanitarian crisis and you need more money to deal \nwith it, we all understand that. But if you are unwilling to take the \nstep to fix the basic problem that has created the crisis, that strikes \nme as problematic, as the Associated Press says.\n  What is President Obama's position? Well, I am afraid the President \nhas shown a complete lack of leadership on something that he himself \nhas called a humanitarian crisis. But there have been prominent members \nof his administration who have publicly expressed support for the type \nof reforms contained in the HUMANE Act, which is a bipartisan, \nbicameral piece of legislation I have introduced with my colleague \nHenry Cuellar from Laredo, TX.\n  For example, you will see on this chart Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Jeh Johnson has said the administration wants to change the \n2008 law at the center of the crisis so that U.S. authorities can \n``treat unaccompanied kids from Central America the same way as it does \nfrom a contiguous country''--in other words, from Mexico.\n  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, you can see on this next \nchart, has confirmed that the administration would support ``changing \nthe 2008 law'' if it is necessary to resolve the crisis, as Secretary \nof Homeland Security Jeh Johnson says it is.\n  As tens of thousands of children continue to flood across our border, \nsuch changes are absolutely necessary. In fact, the cartels, the \ncriminal organizations that are smuggling children into the United \nStates, discovered this flaw and they have changed their business model \nto exploit it, because they are making money off of it.\n  The HUMANE Act, which we have offered as a solution is not the only \nsolution. If other people have good ideas, we would love to hear them, \nbut doing nothing is not an option.\n  The HUMANE Act would equalize the treatment of all unaccompanied \nminor children, regardless of where they come from. Treat them all the \nsame. If it is good enough for children coming from Mexico unattended \nby parents, then it ought to be good enough for others.\n  All of our colleagues essentially voted for that proposition in 2008 \nwith that law. This proposal we have would also expedite the removal \nprocess for those without a valid claim for legal status. In other \nwords, there are claims for legal status in the United States that some \nof these children might qualify for. We do not touch any of those \npreexisting laws. In other words, if you are a victim of human \ntrafficking, for example, you can qualify for something called a T visa \nwhile you cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.\n  If you have a credible fear of persecution in your home country based \non certain other criteria, you could qualify for asylum or as a \nrefugee. But finally, we would end the policy of catch and release by \nwhich these children or other immigrants are not detained pending a \nhearing in front of a judge. We know from experience, given the surge \nof Brazilians who came in 2005 and 2006, that additional detention and \nspeedy hearings and reprocessing back to the home country are essential \nto deter people from coming in the first place.\n  The HUMANE ACT would bring order and clarity to a situation currently \nmarked by chaos and confusion. You would think that Members of \nCongress, Democrats and Republicans alike, would want to bring some \nclarity and end the chaos and confusion. But so far we have not seen \nthat sort of bipartisan desire to embrace a solution. So I am happy to \nnote that a number of Democrats do agree with us about the need to \nreform the 2008 law and establish an expedited removal process.\n  For example, Senator McCaskill, the senior Senator from Missouri, has \nreportedly said: I think we should have the same law on the books for \nCentral America as we have for Canada and Mexico.\n  That is precisely the point. She and I agree with each other 100 \npercent on that. That is what the HUMANE Act would do.\n  Meanwhile, the senior Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper--the chairman \nof the Homeland Security Committee, someone with a lot of knowledge \nabout this, and somebody who I know has been in close consultation with \nSecretary Johnson--has argued that any supplemental funding should be \npaired with significant policy changes, saying, ``the two should go \ntogether.'' I agree with Senator Carper.\n  So if the administration agrees with prominent Senate Democrats, as \nJeh Johnson has said they do, and as Josh Earnest has said they do, if \nthe administration agrees with these prominent Senate Democrats about \nthe urgency of passing something like the HUMANE Act, and if plenty of \nSenate Republicans agree as well, why are we not having a vote? What is \nthe holdup?\n  Well, as usual, the majority leader seems to be more concerned about \ngood politics than good policy. He, incredibly to most ears, certainly \nto mine, declared that the border was ``secure'' a couple of days ago. \nI was shocked to hear him say that. In the midst of a humanitarian \ncrisis, he says the border is ``secure.'' With 414,000 detained coming \nacross the border last year alone from 100 different countries, the \nmajority leader says the border is ``secure.''\n  Here is what he said on Monday. He said: We need to get resources to \nour Border Patrol agents and others who are caring for these children.\n  This is at the same time he said the border is ``secure.'' I do not \nquite understand that tension between his positions. But this is what \nhe said. He said: ``We need judges to hear those kids' cases and decide \nwhether they need protection or need to be sent back home.'' So here is \nmy confusion. The majority leader has said he understands what needs to \nhappen. The press\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\nsecretary for the President says he understands what needs to happen. \nSecretary Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, says he knows \nwhat needs to happen. Prominent Democrats such as the Senator from \nMissouri and the Senator from Delaware say they understand what needs \nto happen. Yet nothing is happening.\n  The HUMANE Act, which would do everything the majority leader \nmentioned, is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation that would \nalleviate a national emergency and a humanitarian crisis. It has \nreceived support across the political and ideological spectrum.\n  I would add that some on the left and some on the right have \ncriticized it. Some have not bothered to read it or understand it. But \nif you are being criticized on both sides of the extremes, then you \nmust be doing something that is actually doable and may be at least 80 \npercent part of the solution.\n  So I would urge the majority leader, the majority whip, the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, to heed the message conveyed by Secretary \nJohnson. I would urge all of us, particularly at a time of humanitarian \ncrisis, to forget the politics and let's solve the problem. We have an \nopportunity to address a genuine crisis. I urge them to remember, as \nMr. Charles Lane of the Washington Post has written recently:\n\n       The rule of law is one of the benefits immigrants seek in \n     the United States. Step one in dealing with the border crisis \n     should be to reestablish it.\n\n  Those are wise words.\n  In contrast, if we simply write the administration a blank check for \n$2.7 billion without fixing the problem, we will find ourselves back \nhere again and again as the numbers escalate from the 57,000 so far \nsince October to the projected 90,000 the administration says could \ncome across this year alone to the 145,000 who are projected to come \nnext year.\n  I am, frankly, flabbergasted. Why can't we do this? Why can't we do \nit? Democrats agree with the need. Republicans agree there is a need. \nThere is an escalating crisis on the border that is not going to go \naway with the change of the news cycle. We have the ability to deal \nwith it so we should.\n  I actually agree with this statement by Senator Reid: We need to get \nthe resources to our Border Patrol agents and others who are caring for \nthese children. We need judges to hear these kids' cases and decide \nwhether they need protection or need to be sent back home.\n  I agree with the majority leader when he said that. So let's do it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today because \nDemocrats in Washington continue to put out misleading information \nabout the President's health care law.\n  Last week the Senator from Connecticut came to the floor and said \nRepublicans have, in his words, gone silent when it comes to talking \nabout the health care law. He claimed there was a quiet acceptance that \nthe law is working.\n  Well, I just want to correct the record and make it perfectly clear \nRepublicans have not gone quiet because the health care law is not \nworking.\n  The American people are not going quiet either. They are not going \nquiet when it comes to talking about the devastating side effects they \nare feeling from the health care law.\n  I hear it from people when I go home to Wyoming every weekend. I \nheard it last weekend. I heard it last night on a telephone townhall \nmeeting, and when I travel I hear about it--even just passing through \nthe airport in Denver on the way home, which I do each week.\n  As chairman of the Republican policy committee, one of my \nresponsibilities is to study how policies that come out of Washington--\nlike the President's health care law--affect people all across America, \nincluding States such as Colorado, where I change planes each week.\n  Last week the Denver Post had an op-ed written by Dr. Cyndi Tucker, \nan obstetrician/gynecologist who practices medicine in Thornton, CO, \noutside Denver. Her op-ed was published in the Denver Post, which is, \nof course, the statewide newspaper in Colorado.\n  The headline on the column in the Denver Post was: ``Red tape isn't \nhealth care reform.''\n  Now, remember the amount of regulations ObamaCare has created is a \nredtape tower of paper over 7 feet tall. Dr. Cyndi Tucker, from one of \nthe suburbs of Colorado, wants us to know about the health care law \nfrom her perspective as a practicing Colorado physician. What she has \nto say is that the prognosis isn't good. She writes:\n\n       At my practice, I've found that the ACA disrupts the \n     doctor-patient relationship by drowning us both in paperwork.\n       ObamaCare authors--and the politicians . . . who voted for \n     it--promised that it would provide quality, affordable health \n     care to Coloradans. Yet it does exactly the opposite. For \n     doctors, it makes health care more and more complex, more \n     expensive, and increasingly more impersonal.\n\n  Not more personal, which is what we want as doctors, as somebody who \npracticed medicine for 25 years. She says it makes it more impersonal.\n\n       And for patients, it makes finding a cheap health plan or \n     finding a doctor more difficult--not less difficult as the \n     President promised, not cheaper, but more difficult, as the \n     doctor points out. For me, that is a very damaging and maybe \n     even life-threatening side effect of the President's \n     health care law.\n\n  President Obama was in Colorado earlier this month. This week he is \ndoing the same thing in Seattle and California. Instead of meeting with \nmore campaign donors--which is what the President is doing--the \nPresident should meet with doctors and patients--and, specifically, \ndoctors such as this obstetrician-gynecologist in Colorado. He should \nsit down with some of the women who are patients of this doctor. I \nthink they would like to ask the President about these devastating side \neffects of his health care law and explain to him about how it is \nhurting them and hurting their families.\n  The disruptive impact the law is having on care is drowning patients \nand doctors in red tape. But that is not the only side effect of the \nlaw that is hurting American families. A recent Gallup poll earlier \nthis month found that only 8 percent of Americans are spending less \nmoney on health care than they did a year ago.\n  President Obama promised the American people they would save $2,500 a \nyear per family under his health care law. Nancy Pelosi, the former \nSpeaker of the House, was on ``Meet the Press'' at one point and said \nthat everyone's rates would go down.\n  Well, Democrats in the Senate who voted for the law promised the same \nthing, and it just didn't happen. People are paying more all across \nAmerica. People are paying more in Washington State and in California, \nwhere the President is visiting. Why is he there? He is meeting with \ncampaign donors. He is collecting campaign money.\n  People are paying more all across the country. They are paying more \nfor health care insurance in Wyoming. People are paying more in \nColorado, where the doctor who wrote in the Denver Post is and where \nshe sees patients.\n  There is a recent study that found health insurance premiums for an \naverage 40-year-old woman in Colorado are 20 percent higher this year \nthan last year. That was before she was forced on to the ObamaCare \nexchange.\n  President Obama says Democrats who voted for the law should \n``forcefully defend and be proud'' of the health care law. When he was \nin Colorado a couple of weeks ago, did President Obama forcefully \ndefend these premium increases because of the law? When he is traveling \nthis week, is the President going to forcefully defend patients and \ndoctors experiencing the exact opposite of what the Democrats promised? \nAre Democrats in the Senate proud that only 8 percent of Americans are \nspending less on health care this year than they did before? Costs are \ngoing up so fast that last month State regulators in Colorado decided \nto add another tax on every insurance policy in the State in order--get \nthis--to bail out the State ObamaCare exchange. They added an extra tax \non every insurance policy in the State in order to bail out the State \nObamaCare exchange.\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\n  Now, that is not just on people buying the policy in the exchange. \nThey are charging this new tax on every person in Colorado who buys \nhealth insurance just to cover those who buy it through the exchange. \nWell, that is a very expensive side effect for the families of Colorado \nas a result of the President's health care law.\n  So this health care law is bad for patients, bad for providers, the \nnurses, and the doctors who take care of those patients, and it is \nterrible for taxpayers. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for this \nhealth care law. Where are the Democrats willing to forcefully defend \nthese costly and damaging side effects of their health care law?\n  People in Colorado and all across America received letters telling \nthem their plans were being cancelled because of the law. People lost \naccess to their doctors, like this OB/GYN physician who wrote her op-ed \neditorial for the Denver Post.\n  She says she has had to stop seeing Medicare patients because of the \nnew redtape in the health care law. So people in Colorado lost their \nright to choose the health plan that works for them and their families.\n  Republicans are not going to quietly accept the terrible side effects \nof the President's health care law. We are going to keep coming to the \nfloor. We are going to keep standing for American families who are \nbeing hurt by this law. We are going to keep offering new solutions--\nreal solutions--for better health care without all of these tragic side \neffects.\n  That means patient-centered reforms that get people the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at lower costs. It means giving people \nchoices, not Washington mandates. It means allowing people to buy \nhealth insurance that works for them and their families because they \nknow what is best for them.\n  Democrats who voted for this health care law have failed to answer \nthe real concern of the American people, which was affordable quality \ncare.\n  American families will not go quiet about the harm Democrats have \ndone to them with this health care law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Tenth Anniversary of the 9/11 Commission\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise to commemorate the 10th \nanniversary of the final report of the National Commission on Terrorist \nAttacks Upon the United States, also known as the \n9/11 Commission Report.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee--a committee on which I proudly serve with the \nPresiding Officer--I can tell my colleagues that this report has been \nand continues to be incredibly important to the work we do in the \ncommittee that Dr. Coburn and I are privileged to lead in this \nCongress.\n  Nearly 13 years ago, as we will recall, our Nation suffered the most \ndevastating attack on U.S. soil since Pearl Harbor. Almost every \nAmerican alive will remember where they were on the day the Twin Towers \ncollapsed, when the Pentagon was hit, and when they saw the wreckage in \nthe fields of Shanksville, PA.\n  We asked ourselves at that time, Why would anybody want to do this? \nHow did this happen? What could have been done to prevent this tragedy?\n  In the months after this horrific attack, Congress and the President \nendeavored to answer these questions. Together they established an \nentity we call the 9/11 Commission.\n  Led by former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean--our neighbor across the \nDelaware River--a Republican, and by former Indiana Congressman Lee \nHamilton, a Democrat--one of my mentors in the House of \nRepresentatives--the Commission was charged with preparing a full and \ncomplete accounting of the circumstances surrounding these horrific \nattacks and recommending ways to make our Nation more secure.\n  This proved to be no small task. The Commission interviewed more than \n1,200 people in 10 countries, including every single relevant senior \nnational security official from not one but two administrations, and \nreviewed more than 2.5 million pages of documents. Despite the \npolitical tensions and partisan climate that engulfed our Nation at the \ntime, the Commission put aside their own political differences and \nissued their final report 10 years ago today.\n  The 592-page report contained a full accounting of what happened \nbefore and after the attacks and included no less than 41 \nrecommendations on how we could prevent another tragedy such as the one \nvisited upon us on September 11. The report went on to sell more than 1 \nmillion copies and it was at the top of the national best seller list--\nnumerous national best seller lists. Imagine that, a report--a Federal \nreport--a best seller. It was a remarkable achievement, not only \nbecause of the depth and breadth of the Commissioners' findings but \nbecause all 10 Commissioners--5 Democrats and 5 Republicans--came to \nagreement on every single word of this report. Around here some days we \ncan't agree if it is Wednesday, much less agree on every single word of \na 592-page report.\n  In the months and years following the report's release, Democrats and \nRepublicans in Congress worked together with the Bush administration to \nenact not one but two major laws to implement the report's \nrecommendations. These laws were championed in part by our good friends \nJoe Lieberman of Connecticut and Susan Collins of Maine, both of whom \nserved as chair and as ranking member of the committee I now chair.\n  Among other things, these two historic bills created a new Director \nof National Intelligence to coordinate and oversee all information \nsharing and intelligence activities. These laws implemented a passenger \nprescreening system that has helped to ensure that terrorists aren't \nable to fly on aircraft, while also establishing a fully staffed \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n  When we think about all of these accomplishments and more, I think it \nis safe to say that the 9/11 Commission report has proven to be one of \nthe most important and influential efforts of its kind in recent \nhistory. We as a nation owe a real debt of gratitude to the \nCommissioners for their determined and clear-eyed approach to improving \nthe security of our Nation.\n  We might ask ourselves: How did they do this? The Commission's \nleadership--Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton--wrote in their own \nwords on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks about why the \nCommission was so special and so effective. Here is what they had to \nsay:\n\n       First, because of the great damage and trauma the 9/11 \n     attacks produced, the American public demanded action and had \n     high expectations for measures and reforms that would improve \n     the nation's security.\n       Importantly, the statutory mandate for the Commission was \n     limited, precise, and clear--the Commission was authorized to \n     investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the \n     attacks and to make recommendations to keep our country safe;\n       The Commission had an extraordinary non-partisan staff--\n\n  They truly did have an excellent staff--\n\n     the members of which possessed deep expertise and conducted \n     their work with thoroughness and professionalism; the \n     Commissioners--\n\n  Many of them I am privileged to know--\n\n     had deep experience in government and political credibility \n     with different constituencies;\n       The final report was unanimous and bipartisan; families of \n     the victims of 9/11 provided solid and sophisticated support \n     throughout the life of the Commission and in the years since; \n     and following the Commission, the Commissioners and staff \n     continued to work closely with Congress and the executive \n     branch to implement and monitor reform.\n\n  That is what they had to say.\n  In other words, they had the will to act. They had the authority and \nthe responsibility to act. They had the support of great staff and of \nthe Americans most directly affected by the tragedy; that is, the \nfamilies who were affected. They had extraordinary leadership from \nGovernor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, both of whom put aside partisan \ndifferences and built a trusting relationship for the betterment of our \nNation.\n  Once, after having a hearing in Dirkson 342, where our committee \nmeets now and where they were testifying before us, the Chair and Vice\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nChair, Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, and I asked them: In a \nday and age when it is hard for us to agree on much of anything around \nhere, how were you able to agree, the two of you and your Commission, \non the entire almost 600 pages of this report?\n  I will never forget what they both said.\n  They said: Well, we didn't really know each other, but we were thrust \ninto this and asked to serve in this capacity, and we got to know each \nother.\n  They said: We got to know each other very well, and out of all the \ntime we spent together grew a trust that was almost without bounds and \na very strong friendship--a real bond.\n  Sometimes we think about why we are so dysfunctional here. That is, \nin my judgment, a very big part of what is missing--a lack of trust and \nunderstanding of one another and having those kinds of personal \nfriendships that go across all kinds of boundaries.\n  After 10 years, I still marvel at the trust developed between the \nCommissioners, and especially the Chairman and Vice Chairman. Perhaps \nmost importantly, no other large-scale, 9/11-type attack on U.S. soil \nhas occurred over these past 13 years. The improvements made to our \nintelligence, our law enforcement, and our security agencies as a \nresult of the 9/11 Commission's work have undoubtedly contributed to \nthat good fortune.\n  The response to the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013--just \nlast year--was a shining example of how the investments we have made as \na nation in training and equipment for our first responders have made \nus more capable, more resilient, and more secure than ever. But that \nattack itself showed us we cannot grow complacent. We must maintain our \nresolve and our commitment to the security of our Nation.\n  The Boston bombing, new threats to aviation, foreign fighters in \nSyria coming home--these are all stark reminders that we continue to \nface persistent and evolving terrorist threats.\n  Of course, one of the biggest threats our country faces is in \ncyberspace. That is why Dr. Coburn, our staffs, members of our \ncommittee, and I worked so hard to move three bipartisan cyber bills \nout of the committee this year and they now await action by the full \nSenate in this Chamber. These are just a few of the challenges our \nNation continues to face.\n  We know there is still work to be done to fully implement the \nCommission's recommendations. So today, as we commemorate the release \nof this report, I think we would be wise to revisit and attempt to \nrecapture the spirit of unity that made this bipartisan achievement \npossible by the 9/11 Commission.\n  As we seek to confront and to overcome the challenges before us on \nthis day, we would be wise to consider again the example set by \nGovernor Kean, Congressman Lee Hamilton, and the other eight \nCommissioners, and we should be inspired by their example.\n  The people we are privileged to represent across the Nation are \npleading with us to set aside what separates us--pleading with us--\nremembering what binds us together and do the hard work we need to do \nto keep our homeland secure in an evermore turbulent world.\n  Let me close by thanking once again the 9/11 Commissioners not only \nfor their important work that they did all those years ago but for the \nenduring example they set for us a decade ago. Let's be inspired by \nthem. Our country and its people are counting on us on so many \ndifferent fronts. Let's not let them down.\n  I note the absence of a quorum. Thanks so much.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak immediately following the remarks of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nUtah because I got here late and I am intruding on his time, but he has \nbeen kind enough to patiently wait for me to make a few points. So I \nwill try to be brief, but I think it is really important that we \naddress this issue, which is a very serious problem happening in \nAmerica.\n  We see increasing numbers of what we call corporate inversions--\nAmerican corporations establishing their headquarters overseas--\ntypically through the mechanism of purchasing a company overseas and \nestablishing that as the headquarters.\n  First of all, I just hate to see any American company choosing to not \nbe an American company. It is very offensive to me at a deep level, \nmost especially if it were to be a Pennsylvania company--but any \ncompany. Secondly, whatever little shred of faith any Americans have in \nour tax system is further undermined by seeing this. And, most \nimportantly over time, this dynamic that is happening, if unaddressed, \nI think poses a very serious risk that we are going to lose jobs, we \nare going to lose corporate headquarters and all of the very \nsubstantial and good-paying jobs that are always associated with an \nAmerican corporate headquarters, from senior executives, to secretarial \nfolks, to the janitorial staff, and everyone in between. There are a \nlot of jobs that go along with where people decide to establish their \ncorporate headquarters, and I want it to be in America. That is my \ngoal. That is my motivation.\n  So it is useful to start with posing the question: Why is this \nhappening, that American companies that have subsidiaries overseas are \ndeciding they had better be headquartered somewhere other than America?\n  I will tell you why it is happening. There is no mystery here. It is \nhappening because we have a Tax Code that is driving them to do this. \nWe have chosen to inflict on our workers and our businesses the highest \nmarginalized tax rate in the industrial world, so we are systematically \nless competitive than any of our trading partners, the nations against \nwhich we compete.\n  In addition to having such a high marginal rate, we have chosen, \nquite foolishly, in my view, to adopt a system of taxation with respect \nto overseas subsidiaries that no one else in the world--virtually no \none else in the world--adopts.\n  Let me drill down a little bit into this. Specifically, the \ndifference between a high marginal rate and a low rate is pretty \nobvious. We have the highest. Other countries have much lower rates. \nIncreasingly, they are reducing their rates. We used to be in the \nmiddle of the pack. Twenty years ago the American business tax rate was \nabout the same as most of our trading partners and competitors. Today \nit is much higher. We stand pretty much alone with a very high rate. \nThat is obvious. That is pretty straightforward.\n  The other piece, though, is how we deal with the tax--with the income \nof subsidiaries. That is very different. Here is what happens. \nBasically imagine that an American company has a subsidiary in Ireland. \nThat subsidiary makes some profits. The profits are taxed by the Irish \nGovernment. They happen to use a 12\\1/2\\-percent tax rate, because they \nwant to attract business. It is working, by the way, for them.\n  But be that as it may, the first layer of tax an American subsidiary \noperating in Ireland pays is the tax to the Irish Government, 12\\1/2\\ \npercent. Then here is what we do in America: We say, now if you want to \nbring that money home to America and invest it in America and build a \nnew factory in Pennsylvania or in Delaware and hire lots of workers, if \nyou want to bring the money home to do that, well, we have a punishment \nin store for you. We are going to look at our rate, which is among the \nvery highest in the world at 35 percent. We will give you credit for \nthe 12\\1/2\\-percent that you paid to the Irish Government. We will soak \nyou for another 23 percent. That is the price we will charge you for \ninvesting in America. That is what we do. That is what our current tax \nsystem does.\n  Now what if this Irish company, this subsidiary operating in Ireland, \nwhat if instead it was owned by a company that is headquartered in \nSweden or Switzerland or any other number of\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\nEuropean countries? Do you know what they do? What they do is say: \nWell, after you have paid your tax to the Irish Government, if you then \nwant to bring it home to one of those countries, there is almost no \nadditional charge. There is a very nominal toll, if you will, on \nbringing that money back to those countries.\n  What is the effect of this? The effect of this is that we put our \nmultinational companies at a huge competitive disadvantage. It is an \nunsustainable competitive disadvantage. The other effect is that we end \nup trapping money overseas that would be invested in America but is \nnot.\n  So what is the rational response of the corporate management and the \nboard of directors of a business which has this Irish subsidiary that \nhas made this money, it has paid its tax to the Irish Government? \nUnfortunately, the response typically is: Well, I cannot defend to my \nshareholders why I should bring that money home and get whacked another \n23 percent. So instead, I would rather not do this, but I am forced to \nlook at investing somewhere else in the world where I will not have to \npay this tax. This is what I am being told--this is what is happening. \nThe way to avoid all of this is to be headquartered somewhere other \nthan America.\n  This is terrible. This is outrageous. We are doing this to ourselves. \nIt is madness.\n  I have to say, I am very disappointed with how we are responding in \nthis body. We know this is a problem. This is very real. It is growing. \nWe are not taking it seriously. What we are going to vote on later this \nweek, I think, or whenever the vote comes up, is not a serious attempt \nto solve this problem. It is a completely political show vote, the \nWalsh-Stabenow bill. It will do nothing to stop these ongoing \ninversions. It does nothing about the fundamental underlying cause that \nis driving these inversions. It does nothing to encourage the \nrepatriation of all of this money.\n  By the way, it is attached to a vehicle that is unconstitutional. We \ncannot originate a tax bill in the Senate. The Constitution forbids \nthat. So if you are even pretending to be serious about tax reform, you \ntake up a House-passed vehicle so it is at least constitutionally \npossible. Our Democratic friends chose not to even bother with that \nformality, so blatant is the fact that this is not a serious \ndiscussion. That is a shame. We ought to be having a serious discussion \nabout this.\n  There is a more serious alternative bill that some of our friends on \nthe other side are advocates for. That is a bill that basically would \nmake it harder for you to achieve the inversion a company is attempting \nto achieve. It would require the number of foreign shareholders be \nquite high at the end of the transaction in order to qualify for it. So \nit sounds on the surface like: Oh, that might work and make it harder \nto do this.\n  But the problem still goes to it does not deal with the underlying \nfundamental driver of this problem, which is a Tax Code that makes it \nuncompetitive to be American. So if the Levin bill, which is the one I \nam referring to, were to be adopted, which I certainly hope it would \nnot be, it continues to make it untenable for shareholders of a \nbusiness to justify being headquartered in America. We will continue to \nsee increasing numbers of startups and spinoff and growth overseas \nwhere the governments choose not to punish their businesses the way we \npunish ours.\n  I think the answer is to deal with the underlying cause, not the \nreaction to that underlying cause. I do not want to see any more of \nthese inversions.\n  We are going to do that by lowering the marginal corporate tax rates \nso there is not a huge advantage in being anywhere else other than \nAmerica, and to adopt a territorial system, a system where once a \ncompany pays the tax it owes to the country in which it is located, we \ndo not punish them for bringing that money home and investing it in \nAmerica. That is the answer. That is the solution. This is no great \nmystery. The rest of the world has figured this out. They are ahead of \nus on this.\n\n  If we would get serious about this very real problem and we made \nthese reforms, what would the net result be? Up to maybe over $1 \ntrillion of money that is trapped overseas would be invested back in \nAmerica. Can you imagine what that would do to our economic growth \nalmost immediately--the surge in job creation, the surge in expansion \nof existing businesses.\n  You know, we have this tremendous renaissance in manufacturing that \nwe are on the edge of, because we have such low-cost energy. It is an \nenormous advantage we have. We could release this pent-up demand and \ntake advantage of this enormous opportunity if we had a Tax Code that \nmade it rational.\n  I am standing here very frustrated, because I am watching us eke out \nthis miserable sort of 1, maybe if we are lucky, 2-percent economic \ngrowth. Employment levels are way too low. Workforce participation is \nnowhere near where it should be. I know we could be booming. We could \nbe growing at 4 percent. We could be creating many hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs every month. We could be bringing people back in \nthe workforce. We could have the kind of strong economic expansion we \nhave always had in the past after a severe recession.\n  But we are not getting there right now. It is partly because we have \na Tax Code that is hampering us. It is driving up transactions that \nnone of us want to see. So I hope after we get through the political \nexercise we are going to go through this week, we will get serious \nabout solving the underlying problem: lowering the marginal rate so we \ndo not stand out as the worst place in the world to establish a \nbusiness, and moving to a territorial-based system so that we stop \npunishing businesses that want to invest in America. That is my hope. I \nhope we will get to this soon, because, unfortunately, we are seeing \nthe unfortunate consequences of this bad policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be in the same Senate with \nthis wonderful Senator from Pennsylvania who does a very good job on \nthe Senate Finance Committee and is, frankly, one of the brighter \nlights in the Senate. I appreciate him. I appreciate his efforts. I \nappreciate his leadership. I appreciate what he just got through \nsaying.\n  Mr. President, soon we will begin debate on the so-called Bring Jobs \nHome Act. There are a number of serious problems facing our country. \nFor example, our national debt currently exceeds $17.5 trillion. That \nis trillion with a T. Our economy continues to struggle. In fact, the \neconomy shrunk last quarter. We have an entitlement crisis that \nthreatens to swallow our government and take the country down with it.\n  Of course, as has been widely discussed, we are seeing a parade of \nU.S. multinationals opting to move their legal domiciles to countries \noutside of our country, outside of the United States. During these \ndifficult times what we are hearing from my friends on the other side \nof the aisle is not very good.\n  What are we hearing from these friends on the other side of the \naisle? We are hearing talk about ``economic patriotism.'' I did not \nmake up that term. It is the latest catchphrase coming from the Obama \nadministration as they try to malign business models and investments \nthey do not like during an election year.\n  Last week I received a letter from the Treasury Secretary calling for \n``a new sense of economic patriotism'' as the administration pushed for \nlegislation that would punitively and retroactively seek to limit \ncorporate inversions. The President has repeated the line in some of \nhis recent speeches. Of course, ``economic patriotism'' is not a new \ncatchphrase. It was trotted out by the President during the 2012 \nelection campaign. Now it appears to be making a comeback. Not \nsurprisingly, this comeback is taking place in the midst of another \nelection year. Apparently, as part of this recycled campaign, we are \ngoing to have to once again debate and vote on the Bring Jobs Home Act, \nthe same bill the Senate rejected during the last election cycle.\n  If enacted, this legislation would deny the deduction for ordinary \nand necessary business expenses to the extent that such expenses were \nincurred for offshore outsourcing. That is, to the extent an employer \nincurred costs in relocating a business unit from somewhere inside the \nUnited States to somewhere outside the United States,\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nthe employer would be disallowed a deduction for any of the associated \nbusiness expenses. Wow. How antibusiness can you be? There are other \nways of solving this problem.\n  The bill would also create a new tax credit for insourcing. That is, \nif a company relocated a business unit from outside the United States \nto inside the United States, the business would be allowed a tax credit \nequal to 20 percent of the costs associated with that relocation. As I \nsaid, this is a recycled bill.\n  The political talking points surrounding the bill are also recycled. \nThis bill and the related talking points are based on the oft-repeated \nlie that there are special incentives or loopholes in the Tax Code that \nencourage businesses to move jobs overseas. No such loopholes exist.\n  As the Joint Committee on Taxation noted in its recent analysis of \nthis bill:\n\n       Under present law, there are no targeted tax credits or \n     disallowances of deductions related to relocating business \n     units inside or outside the United States. Deductions \n     generally are allowed for all ordinary and necessary expenses \n     paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year in \n     carrying on any trade or business. These ordinary and \n     necessary expenses may include expenditures for the \n     relocation of a business unit.\n\n  The truth could not be plainer. Yet the supporters of this bill still \ntalk as though this legislation will end some kind of special tax \ntreatment or deduction for companies that outsource. There is no \nspecial treatment. Under our Tax Code, relocation expenses are treated \nthe same whether a company is relocating from a high-tax State in the \nUnited States to a lower tax State or if a company relocates some \noperations offshore.\n  As the nonpartisan congressional scorekeeper has made clear, there \nare no targeted tax benefits related to relocating business units \noutside of the United States. No credits. None. Zero.\n  As the Joint Committee on Taxation said:\n\n       There has always been a deduction allowed for a business's \n     ordinary and necessary expenses. Expenses associated with \n     moving have always been regarded as deductible business \n     expenses.\n\n  That being the case, allowing a deduction for these expenses is not \nall that remarkable. It is the general rule. Disallowing or putting \nexceptions on this deduction, on the other hand, would be an \nextraordinary deviation from long-standing tax policy and would \nneedlessly add yet another level of complexity to our already overly \ncomplex Tax Code.\n  Still, let's pretend for a moment this deviation is, in terms of tax \npolicy, justified. It is not, but there is no harm in pretending, I \nguess. Even if we were justified, in terms of policy, the revenue \ngenerated by this proposal is minuscule.\n  According to JCT, the Joint Committee on Taxation, preventing \nbusinesses from deducting expenses relating to outsourcing would raise \nabout $140 million over 10 years. That is about $14 million a year--not \n$14 billion with a ``b,'' but $14 million with an ``m.''\n  To put the puny amount of this proposal in context, we should compare \nthis revenue number against the volume of business U.S. companies \nconduct overseas.\n  According to the latest available IRS statistics of income, in 2010 \nU.S. companies conducted about $1.085 trillion in business abroad, and \nthat is probably low, given the sluggishness of the economy at that \ntime. On an annualized basis, the Bring Jobs Home Act would curtail \ndeductions representing about $40 million in expenses.\n  That represents four-thousandths of 1 percent of all overseas \nbusiness conducted by American companies. Let me repeat that, four-\nthousandths of 1 percent--hardly perceptible.\n  As I said, we are talking about minuscule sums here. We are also \ntalking about politics as usual in the Senate. Instead of facing these \nproblems and facing them realistically, some prefer to play politics \nwith it, and it is total BS.\n  Yet over the last few years we have heard countless claims from my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle that ``closing loopholes for \nbusinesses that move jobs overseas'' will pay for all kinds of things.\n  Earlier this month, for example, President Obama claimed that part of \nhis infrastructure plan could be paid for by making sure corporations \nshipping jobs overseas ``pay their fair share of taxes.''\n  Well, if this bill is representative of this particular effort, the \nPresident doesn't plan on paying for very much. I would bet the $14 \nmillion wouldn't even be enough to pay for a single high-speed rail car \nor a round of IRS bonuses. It is amazing to me what people will do for \npolitical advantage that is shameless. They should be ashamed.\n  Of course, all of this discussion only focuses on one section of the \nbill. When you add in the other part of the bill--the 20 percent credit \nfor expenses associated with insourcing--the Bring Jobs Home Act \nactually loses revenue--loses revenue--adding $214 million to the \ndeficit over 10 years.\n  So why are we debating this bill? It is obviously not about raising \nrevenue to pay for anything. It is clearly not about impacting business \neconomic decisionmaking, and it is not about improving or simplifying \nour Tax Code.\n  Instead, this bill is about politics, pure and simple. It was all \nabout politics the last time we debated this bill in 2012, and it is \nabout politics this time around.\n  I, for one, am getting sick of it. I am so sick of this body not \ndoing its job.\n  The Democrats, both in the Senate and the White House, think they \ngain some traction by talking about ``economic patriotism'' and trying \nto paint Republicans as the party of outsourcing. Give me a break. The \nbill is yet another election-year gimmick, pure and simple, and they \nought to be ashamed.\n  Quite frankly, the American people are tired of gimmicks.\n  What they want are serious solutions to the problems ailing our \ncountry. Sadly, they are not getting that from the Senate majority \nleadership these days.\n  If we are serious about bringing jobs home, we should try working on \nlegislation that will actually make the United States a better place to \ndo business. Let's make our country more attractive to do business.\n  We should try working on legislation that will actually grow our \neconomy. But we don't do much of that in the Senate these days. In \nfact, we don't do much of anything in the Senate these days other than \nto continue to overbalance the Federal courts with this \nadministration's suggestions.\n  Yes, we don't do much of that in the Senate these days. Instead, what \nwe are seeing is an endless series of showboats designed to highlight \nwhatever Democratic campaign theme is popular that week.\n  We have seen votes designed to highlight the supposed ``war on \nwomen.'' We have seen votes designed to make it appear the Republicans \nare indifferent to the plight of the middle class. Give me a break. Now \nwe are seeing votes designed to demonize Republicans for their supposed \nlack of ``economic patriotism.''\n  What a fraud. When does it end? From the looks of things, not any \ntime soon.\n\n  I suspect as we debate the so-called Bring Jobs Home Act, the \nRepublicans will offer a number of amendments that, unlike this bill, \nwill actually create jobs in the United States. I plan to offer some \namendments along those lines, and I am sure many of my colleagues will \ndo the same.\n  This will be an opportunity to show whether the Senate Democratic \nleadership is serious about creating jobs and helping American workers \nand businesses as they claim to be. If, in fact, that is the aim of \nthis legislation, then we should have a full and fair debate on it, \nincluding an open amendment process that will allow the Senate to \nexplore alternative approaches and to discuss different ideas and how \nbest to create jobs in this country. But I wouldn't hold my breath, \nwatching how this Senate is being run these days.\n  Let's talk about actually fixing our Tax Code. Let's talk about \ngrowing our economy. Let's talk about real solutions to the real \nproblems facing our Nation.\n  I hope that is the kind of conversation we will have on this bill. Of \ncourse, I am not naive. I know how the Senate operates these days. I \nhave come to the floor numerous times--only yesterday, in fact--to \nlament the deterioration of this body under the current leadership. I \nam not under any illusions that things are simply going to change \novernight.\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\n  I might add that the Senate leadership--these are friends of mine. I \nam just disappointed in the way they are running the place, and I think \nmy disappointments are correct and accurate. But make no mistake, \nthings need to change. For the good of our country, things need to be \ndone differently around here.\n  Like I said, the American people are tired of political gimmicks. \nThey are tired of the endless campaign. They want to see the Senate act \nin a way that will produce results.\n  Sadly, with this legislation before us this week, it looks as if we \nare in for yet another round of partisan gamesmanship.\n  We can do things differently and, once again, I hope we will. But as \nI have said many times before, I am not going to hold my breath. I just \nwish we could get together and work in the best interests of not only \nthis body but our country.\n  I don't see the leadership at the White House either, nor do I think \nSecretary Lew's letter on this issue was a justifiable letter. In fact, \nI think it was pathetic, and I am very disappointed in him as a person \nand as a leader in this country for that letter.\n  Of course, I wrote one back to him, certainly, expressing my \nviewpoint.\n\n\n                         U.N. Disability Treaty\n\n  Yesterday the Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 6 again to \nreport the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  This was similar to the committee vote 2 years ago. On December 4, \n2012, the Senate voted 61 to 38 on the treaty, less than the two-thirds \nthe Constitution requires for ratification.\n  I expect a similar result if the Senate takes up the treaty again. \nYesterday afternoon the senior Senator from Iowa--a friend of mine, and \na person for whom I have a lot of regard--spoke on the floor about the \ntreaty, and as he has done many times, urged its ratification. I don't \ndoubt his sincerity at all, and I admire him personally for the long \nservice he has given to this country.\n  He called the concern that this treaty would undermine American \nsovereignty and self-government imaginary, hypothetical, and unreal. In \nfact he said:\n\n       Anyone who is hiding behind that issue does not want to \n     vote for this treaty for some other reason. But it can't be \n     the reason of sovereignty.\n\n  I will not speculate about what the Senator from Iowa meant by some \nother reason. He and I have worked hard together to promote the rights \nand opportunities of all persons with disabilities. I feel deeply about \nthat issue. I feel as deeply as he does.\n  We were partners in the development and passage of both the original \nAmericans with Disabilities Act in 1990 and the ADA Amendments Act in \n2008.\n  I take a back seat to no one when it comes to legislation to help \npersons with disabilities.\n  But since I gave a speech on the floor 1 year ago explaining my \nconcerns about this treaty's effect on American sovereignty and self-\ngovernment, I have to respond to the charges by my friend from Iowa. I \ncan only speak for myself, of course, but I am not hiding behind \nanything, including the sovereignty issue.\n  That issue is neither imaginary nor hypothetical, and it is certainly \nnot cover for some hidden, unexpressed reason for opposing this treaty.\n  As I explained on July 10, 2013, this is a treaty not with other \nnations but instead with the United Nations itself. Ratifying it would \ncreate obligations across at least 25 different areas of social, \neconomic, cultural and even political life. Article 8, for example, \nwould even regulate the United States to ``raise awareness throughout \nsociety, including at the family level, regarding persons with \ndisabilities.''\n  If this is all the treaty did, if it simply stated obligations, I \nmight support it. It would then be generally similar to the treaty \nregarding child labor the Senate ratified in 1999. That treaty states \nthat ratifying nations shall ``take immediate and effective measures to \nsecure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child \nlabor.''\n  But these two treaties are radically different and the difference is \nthe very reason why the disability treaty threatens American \nsovereignty and self-government and the child labor treaty does not.\n  The difference between these treaties is who has authority to \ndetermine whether ratifying nations are in compliance. The child labor \ntreaty leaves that up to the ratifying nations themselves.\n  The disability treaty, however, gives authority to determine whether \nratifying nations were meeting their treaty obligations to the United \nNations. That is considerably different and very dangerous. Each nation \nmust submit compliance reports to a U.N. committee of experts which \nuses its own criteria and standards to determine compliance and makes \nwhatever recommendations it chooses.\n\n  Treaty advocates say this U.N. committee will not have actual legal \nauthority to require changes to domestic laws and that even if it did, \nwe would not have to change a thing.\n  I have three responses to that. First, as I explained in my speech \nlast year, American sovereignty and self-government are not so narrow \nthey can only be undermined by the United Nations literally assuming \nlegal and political control of our country. America is a republic under \na written constitution, and in this system of government the people \nmust have the last word on everything because the people are sovereign \nover everything.\n  The American people and their elected representatives, not a U.N. \ncommittee, must have the last word not only on our laws and regulations \nbut also on our priorities, our values, and our standards.\n  Ratifying this treaty would endorse a formal, ongoing role for the \nUnited Nations in evaluating virtually every aspect of American life. \nIt would say that the U.N.--not the American people--has the last word \nabout whether the United States is meeting its obligations in these \nmany areas.\n  That undermines American sovereignty and self-government. The United \nNations hardly needs a legally binding treaty to opine on aspects of \nAmerican life and public policy. It does so all the time. Ratifying \nthis treaty, however, would formally endorse the right of the United \nNations to do so and, even worse, subject ourselves to their \nevaluation. That is serious. We should think twice before we allow \nsomething like that to happen.\n\n  Second, we may already have the world's most expansive disability \nlaws and regulations--and I know because I helped bring them about--but \nthis treaty goes far beyond that.\n  The U.N. Web site says this treaty legally binds any nation ratifying \nit to adhere to its principles, and the treaty spells out what that \nadherence will require. Ratifying nations agree to enact, modify, or \nabolish laws and regulations at all levels of government--federal, \nstate, and local--that are inconsistent with the treaty's principles, \nbut the treaty also requires evaluating and changing any social customs \nand cultural practices that are inconsistent with those principles. \nAnyone who has followed the United Nations knows that a U.N. committee \nis not likely to look as favorably on American customs and practices as \nit might on our laws and regulations.\n  Third, even though the U.N. disability treaty appears to have been \nmodeled after the Americans with Disabilities Act, it utilizes a very \ndifferent concept of disability.\n  For more than four decades, American laws in this area have defined a \ndisability as an impairment that substantially limits a major life \nactivity. The disability treaty, however, states that ``disability is \nan evolving concept'' involving barriers that hinder ``full and \neffective participation on an equal basis with others.'' In other \nwords, the U.N. committee would use a subjective fluid concept of \ndisability to evaluate compliance with the treaty of U.S. laws that \nutilize an objective, functional definition of ``disability.''\n  I am pleased to note that, even without U.S. ratification, no less \nthan 34 nations have ratified the U.N. disability treaty since it was \nsent to the Senate on May 17, 2012--15 of them since I last spoke here \non the treaty a year ago.\n  Yesterday the senior Senator from Iowa asked for someone to explain \nto him why the disability treaty before us today raises concerns about \nsovereignty but the 1999 child labor treaty did not. Well, I think I \nhave done that here today. The disability treaty gives\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\nthe last word on whether a nation is in compliance to the U.N.; the \nchild labor treaty leaves that entirely up to each nation.\n  I understand Senators have different understandings or concepts about \nsuch things as American sovereignty and self-government, but it is \nwrong to say that if I take a different view on that than the senior \nSenator from Iowa, I must somehow be hiding my real reason for opposing \nthis treaty. In our system of government, legislation and treaties are \nprofoundly different ways of addressing public policy issues with \nprofoundly different effects on sovereignty and self-government.\n  I will continue to be a champion for disability legislation, but I \ncannot support this disability treaty. I will support those who have \ndisabilities, who have difficult times, as I did back then.\n  Frankly, I still remember my great friend from Iowa and myself \nwalking off the floor to a whole reception room filled with persons \nwith disabilities, all of whom were crying and happy that we had done \nthis in America.\n  America leads the world in our quest toward disabilities issues. In \nall honesty, I don't want to lose our sovereignty in this issue, nor do \nI want to turn over our rights and our own self-interests to the United \nNations, as good as it may be from time to time. But I have also seen \nwhere it hasn't been so good from time to time as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act, which is the bill that would stop big \ncorporations from getting a tax break for sending jobs overseas while \nrewarding businesses that invest in bringing jobs here, back home.\n  I thank my colleagues Senator Walsh and Senator Stabenow for leading \nthe way on this important legislation, and I am glad we now have the \nopportunity to debate it. I hope our Republican colleagues will take a \nserious look at the Bring Jobs Home Act and work with us in the coming \nweeks and months on other efforts to create jobs and long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  Our economy has changed a lot over the last few decades. Prices have \nrisen for everything from college tuition to health care, and the \nshifting realities of the global economy have really made it harder to \nfind the kinds of jobs on which workers used to raise their families.\n  As we all remember, for far too many families the financial crisis \nand the recession that began in December of 2007 was the last straw. It \npulled the rug out from under workers and small businesses across the \ncountry. We have come a long way since then, but it is clear there is \nmuch more we need to do to create jobs and broad-based economic growth \nso that hard-working families in our country get a fair shot.\n  At a time when too many families are still struggling to make ends \nmeet, there is absolutely no reason taxpayer dollars should go toward \nhelping big corporations send jobs overseas. That is why I was very \nproud today to vote in support of the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  I think most Americans would agree they don't want their taxpayer \ndollars spent on helping corporations outsource jobs. It really should \nbe a no-brainer.\n  Unfortunately, over the last few years we have spent far too much \ntime avoiding crises rather than legislation like the Bring Jobs Home \nAct that would help our workers and businesses. Government shutdowns, \ndefault threats, and last-minute deals took up a lot of oxygen here in \nWashington, DC, and made workers and families really question whether \ntheir government could get anything done.\n  So when Chairman Ryan and I were able to reach a 2-year bipartisan \nbudget agreement, I was hopeful we would be able to move beyond the \ncycle of governing by crisis, and I hoped we could build on that \nbipartisan foundation established in that 2-year budget deal and work \nacross the aisle to create jobs and grow our economy. The Bring Jobs \nHome Act is exactly the kind of legislation I wanted to see us debate \nand work together on.\n  While we all know Republicans and Democrats have very different views \non the best ways to encourage economic growth, we have taken some \nbipartisan steps that show we should be able to work together on this \nand other job-creating legislation. The Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act, which Senator Isakson from Georgia and I were able to \nwork together to finish, is a great example. That bipartisan \nlegislation shows what is possible when Members from different parties \nand different States and different Chambers come together to get things \ndone for the American economy. I have heard from countless businesses \nand families in my home State of Washington who have told me how much \nthey rely on effective workforce programs. So I was really thrilled \nyesterday to stand next to President Obama as he signed more than a \ndecade of hard work and negotiation into law when he signed that \nlegislation.\n  I am glad we were able to go beyond governing by crisis and reach a \nbipartisan agreement to thoroughly and responsibly improve our \nworkforce development system. We need to do the same thing--go beyond \nsimply avoiding crises when it comes to commonsense steps such as the \nBring Jobs Home Act.\n  I would also note that this is true for the highway trust fund. I \nhope we will be able to not only avoid a construction shutdown short-\nterm but that we will work together to strengthen our transportation \ninfrastructure in a comprehensive way.\n  Construction workers and businesses absolutely deserve the certainty \nof knowing we are going to avoid the shortfall in the highway trust \nfund and keep our critical transportation projects moving forward. But \nthey actually deserve more than that. They, along with every other \nAmerican family and business that uses our roads and bridges, deserve a \nlong-term solution--one that not only shores up the highway trust fund \nbut also provides a plan for smart investments throughout our entire \ntransportation system.\n  My colleagues Senator Wyden and Senator Boxer have been leading the \nway on avoiding this unnecessary crisis and addressing our \ntransportation infrastructure challenges not just for next year but for \nyears to come, and I thank both of them for their efforts.\n  I know conventional wisdom is that Congress will not be able to get \nanything done from now until November, but I don't see any reason at \nall why that ought to be the case. Families and communities rightly \nwant us to solve problems. Just avoiding crises isn't enough.\n  I am very hopeful that in the coming weeks and months we can not only \navoid a construction shutdown but also lay the groundwork for smart \ninvestments in our country's roads and bridges and waterways.\n  I am glad my Republican colleagues are making it clear that they \ndon't want another fight over keeping the government open. I think we \nshould build on that by working together to replace more of the harmful \nsequestration cuts we are going to face in 2016.\n  Instead of simply avoiding self-inflicted wounds to jobs and the \neconomy, we should be taking important steps, such as the Bring Jobs \nHome Act, that encourage our companies to invest and hire right here at \nhome.\n  Of course, there is much more to do as well, and I never meant to \nsuggest that any of this would be easy. As we all know, compromise is \nnot easy. But legislation such as the bipartisan Budget Act and the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act show us that when both sides \nare ready to come to the table and make tough choices, we can make real \nprogress.\n  We have a lot of work to do over the next weeks and into the fall, \nand I hope we will take the bipartisan path that leads us to real \nsolutions and goes beyond just simply avoiding the next crisis. That is \nwhat our constituents rightly expect, it is what they deserve, and it \nis what I hope we can all work together on to deliver.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Veterans' Affairs\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\nVeterans' Affairs, I want to take a few minutes to update Members of \nthe Senate as to where we are on some very important issues that impact \nveterans all over this country.\n  The first point I want to make is some good news. The committee had a \nhearing yesterday to hear testimony regarding the confirmation of \nRobert McDonald to be the new Secretary of the VA. I think I can speak \nfor the whole committee in saying we were very impressed by what we \nheard from Mr. McDonald both in terms of his passion for the needs of \nveterans and also his administrative knowledge, his management skills, \nas the former head of one of the large corporations in America. I think \nhe left us with a very strong impression. The result was that today, a \nfew hours ago, by a unanimous vote, the Senate committee voted to \nconfirm Robert McDonald as our new Secretary of the VA, and I hope very \nmuch his nomination will get to the floor as soon as possible. I think \nthat is good news because the VA needs stable leadership. Sloan Gibson, \nwho has been Acting Secretary, is doing an excellent job. He has \nalready accomplished a lot. But it is important that we have a new \npermanent Secretary on board, and I hope the Members here see fit to \nconfirm him as soon as we possibly can.\n  On an additional issue, I think as all Members of the Senate know, \nabout a month or so ago we voted by a vote of 93 to 3, almost \nunanimously, to make sure the veterans of our country get quality \nhealth care in a timely manner, that we bring a new level of \naccountability to the VA, and I am very proud of the support that \nlegislation, which was introduced by me and Senator John McCain, \nreceived. I thank again Senator McCain for his very strong efforts to \nmake that happen and for his continued support of the veterans \ncommunity.\n  Senator McCain made a statement the other day--I think it was \nyesterday--published in CQ, which I personally could not agree with \nmore. He spoke in terms of the conference committee that we are in \nright now trying to merge the Senate bill and the House bill and come \nup with something that can pass in both bodies. He said and I quote: \n``We've got to sit down and get this done, because we cannot go out for \nrecess in August without having acted on this bill.''\n  I think he is exactly right.\n  Let me, picking up on that theme, relay to my colleagues what the \nVFW, which is having their annual convention in St. Louis, said:\n\n       The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States is \n     demanding that Congress immediately pass a compromise bill to \n     help fix the Department Of Veterans Affairs before they \n     adjourn for five weeks at the end of the month. ``Pass a bill \n     or don't come back from recess,'' said VFW National Commander \n     William A. Thien of Georgetown, IN. ``America's veterans are \n     tired of waiting--on secret waiting lists at the VA and on \n     their elected officials to do their jobs.''\n\n  I could not agree with the VFW more on that issue.\n  There was a bill a month ago that passed here. The CBO said that bill \nwould cost $35 billion, and we voted for that for emergency funding \nbecause the Members here understood that taking care of veterans is a \ncost of war as much as spending money on tanks and guns and missiles--\n$35 billion in emergency funding. The House passed its bill which was \nlater assessed by the CBO at $44 billion. But here is the good news--\nand without divulging the kinds of negotiations we are having with \nChairman Miller in the House--and Chairman Miller is a serious man. I \nthink he wants to get a bill passed. I don't want to go into all the \ndetails here, but I think it is fair to say the cost of that bill will \nbe significantly less than what the CBO originally estimated.\n\n  A few minutes ago I and others received a letter from the major \nveterans organizations on an issue of important consequence. Again, \nwithout going into great detail about the nature of the negotiations \nwhich the House and Senate are having on the veterans bill, I think it \nis fair to say one of the stumbling blocks is that I agree and the \nHouse agrees it is imperative we pass funding to make sure that \nveterans who are in long waiting lines right now get the quality care \nthey need now, and that means if the VA cannot accommodate them in a \ntimely manner, they will go out to private doctors, community health \ncenters, or whatever, and the VA will pay that bill. That is what we \nhave to do because it is unacceptable that veterans remain on long \nwaiting periods and not get health care. There is a general agreement \non that. There is debate about how much that is going to cost over a 2-\nyear period, but I think we can reach some resolution.\n  Here is where the difference of opinion lies--without divulging \nanything, and this has been in the newspapers--Sloan Gibson, the Acting \nSecretary, came before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee last week \nand he made it very clear that while we have to deal with the emergency \nof long waiting periods and get people the contracted care they need, \nsimultaneously, we must make sure the VA has the doctors, the nurses, \nthe medical personnel, the IT, and the space they need in order to deal \nwith this crisis so that 2 years from now we are not back in the same \nposition we are, and he came forward with a proposal that, in fact, \ncosts $17.6 billion. I think we can lower that amount of money, because \nsome of that request is not going to be spent this year or even next \nyear.\n  But the issue here is we have to strengthen the VA, their capacity, \nso that veterans do not remain on long waiting periods and that we can \nget them the quality and timely care they need.\n  Now, what I wanted to mention was an hour or so ago I received and \nChairman Miller, who is chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, got the letter, Richard Burr, who is the ranking member on the \nSenate committee, Mike Michaud, the ranking member at the House--we \nreceived a letter from a variety of veterans organizations, virtually \nevery major veterans organization, and they are the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the VFW, the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America, the Military Officers Association of America, the \nU.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, and many other \norganizations.\n  I want to take a moment to read what they say, because this is \nterribly important. What they are saying in essence is yes, we need \nemergency funding to make sure that veterans tomorrow get the health \ncare they need from the private sector or anyplace else, but we also \nneed to strengthen the VA so that over the years they can provide the \nquality and timely care veterans are entitled to. I am going to read \nthis letter because it is important that Members of the Senate and the \nHouse understand where the major veterans organizations are coming \nfrom.\n\n       Last week Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson appeared before the \n     Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to discuss the progress \n     made by the Department of Veterans Affairs over the past two \n     months to address the health care access crisis for thousands \n     of veterans. Secretary Gibson testified that after re-\n     examining VA's resource needs in light of the revelations \n     about secret waiting lists and hidden demand, VA required \n     supplemental resources totaling $17.6 billion for the \n     remainder of this fiscal year through the end of FY 2017.\n       As the leaders of organizations representing millions of \n     veterans, we agree with Secretary Gibson that there is a need \n     to provide VA with additional resources now to ensure that \n     veterans can access the health care they have earned either \n     from VA providers or through non-VA purchased care. We urge \n     Congress to expeditiously approve supplemental funding that \n     fully addresses the critical needs outlined by Secretary \n     Gibson either prior to, or at the same time as, any \n     compromise legislation that may be reported out of the House-\n     Senate Conference Committee. Whether it costs $17 billion or \n     $50 billion over the next three years, Congress has a sacred \n     obligation to provide VA with the funds it requires to meet \n     both immediate needs through non-VA care and future needs by \n     expanding VA's internal capacity.\n\n  And I continue. Again, this is a letter from almost every major \nveterans organization:\n  Last month, we wrote to you--\n  They wrote to the chairmen of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittees--\n\n     we wrote to you to outline the principles and priorities \n     essential to addressing the access crisis, a copy of which is \n     attached. The first priority ``must be to ensure that all \n     veterans currently waiting for treatment must be provided \n     access to timely, convenient health care as quickly as \n     medically indicated.'' Second, when VA is unable to provide \n     that care directly, ``VA must be involved in the timely \n     coordination of and fully responsible for prompt payment for \n     all authorized non-VA care.'' Third, Congress must provide \n     supplemental funding for this year and additional\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n     funding for next year to pay for the temporary expansion of \n     non-VA purchased care. Finally, whatever actions VA or \n     Congress takes to address the current access crisis must also \n     ``protect, preserve and strengthen the VA health care system \n     so that it remains capable of providing a full continuum of \n     high-quality, timely health care to all enrolled veterans.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 2014.\n     Chairman Bernie Sanders,\n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Richard Burr,\n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.\n     Chairman Jeff Miller,\n     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Mike Michaud,\n     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Sanders, Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Burr, \n     Ranking Member Michaud: Last week, Acting Secretary Sloan \n     Gibson appeared before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee \n     to discuss the progress made by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) over the past two months to address the health \n     care access crisis for thousands of veterans. Secretary \n     Gibson testified that after re-examining VA's resource needs \n     in light of the revelations about secret waiting lists and \n     hidden demand, VA required supplemental resources totaling \n     $17.6 billion for the remainder of this fiscal year through \n     the end of FY 2017.\n       As the leaders of organizations representing millions of \n     veterans, we agree with Secretary Gibson that there is a need \n     to provide VA with additional resources now to ensure that \n     veterans can access the health care they have earned, either \n     from VA providers or through non-VA purchased care. We urge \n     Congress to expeditiously approve supplemental funding that \n     fully addresses the critical needs outlined by Secretary \n     Gibson either prior to, or at the same time as, any \n     compromise legislation that may be reported out of the House-\n     Senate Conference Committee. Whether it costs $17 billion or \n     $50 billion over the next three years, Congress has a sacred \n     obligation to provide VA with the funds it requires to meet \n     both immediate needs through non-VA care and future needs by \n     expanding VA's internal capacity.\n       Last month, we wrote to you to outlining the principles and \n     priorities essential to addressing the access crisis, a copy \n     of which is attached. The first priority ``. . . must be to \n     ensure that all veterans currently waiting for treatment must \n     be provided access to timely, convenient health care as \n     quickly as medically indicated.'' Second, when VA is unable \n     to provide that care directly, ``. . . VA must be involved in \n     the timely coordination of and fully responsible for prompt \n     payment for all authorized non-VA care.'' Third, Congress \n     must provide supplemental funding for this year and \n     additional funding for next year to pay for the temporary \n     expansion of non-VA purchased care. Finally, whatever actions \n     VA or Congress takes to address the current access crisis \n     must also ``. . . protect, preserve and strengthen the VA \n     health care system so that it remains capable of providing a \n     full continuum of high-quality, timely health care to all \n     enrolled veterans.''\n       In his testimony to the Senate, Secretary Gibson stated \n     that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has already \n     reached out to over 160,000 veterans to get them off wait \n     lists and into clinics. He said that VHA accomplished this by \n     adding more clinic hours, aggressively recruiting to fill \n     physician vacancies, deploying mobile medical units, using \n     temporary staffing resources, and expanding the use of \n     private sector care. Gibson also testified that VHA made over \n     543,000 referrals for veterans to receive non-VA care in the \n     private sector--91,000 more than in the comparable period a \n     year ago. In a subsequent press release, VA stated that it \n     had reduced the New Enrollee Appointment Report (NEAR) from \n     its peak of 46,000 on June 1, 2014 to 2,000 as of July 1, \n     2014, and that there was also a reduction of over 17,000 \n     veterans on the Electronic Waiting List since May 15, 2014. \n     We appreciate this progress, but more must be done to ensure \n     that every enrolled veteran has access to timely care.\n       The majority of the supplemental funding required by VA, \n     approximately $8.1 billion, would be used to expand access to \n     VA health care over the next three fiscal years by hiring up \n     to 10,000 new clinical staff, including 1,500 new doctors, \n     nurses and other direct care providers. That funding would \n     also be used to cover the cost of expanded non-VA purchased \n     care, with the focus shifting over the three years from non-\n     VA purchased care to VA-provided care as internal capacity \n     increased. The next biggest portion would be $6 billion for \n     VA's physical infrastructure, which according to Secretary \n     Gibson would include 77 lease projects for outpatient clinics \n     that would add about two million square feet, as well as \n     eight major construction projects and 700 minor construction \n     and non-recurring maintenance projects that together could \n     add roughly four million appointment slots at VA facilities. \n     The remainder of the funding would go to IT enhancements, \n     including scheduling, purchased care and project coordination \n     systems, as well as a modest increase of $400 million for \n     additional VBA staff to address the claims and appeals \n     backlogs.\n       In reviewing the additional resource requirements \n     identified by Secretary Gibson, the undersigned find them to \n     be commensurate with the historical funding shortfalls \n     identified in recent years by many of our organizations, \n     including The Independent Budget (IB), which is authored and \n     endorsed by many of our organizations. For example, in the \n     prior ten VA budgets, the amount of funding for medical care \n     requested by the Administration and ultimately provided to VA \n     by Congress was more than $7.8 billion less than what was \n     recommended by the IB. Over just the past five years, the IB \n     recommended $4 billion more than VA requested or Congress \n     approved and for next year, FY 2015, the IB has recommended \n     over $2 billion more than VA requested. Further corroboration \n     of the shortfall in VA's medical care funding came two weeks \n     ago from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which issued \n     a revised report on H.R. 3230 estimating that, ``. . . under \n     current law for 2015 and CBO's baseline projections for 2016, \n     VA's appropriations for health care are not projected to keep \n     pace with growth in the patient population or growth in per \n     capita spending for health care--meaning that waiting times \n     will tend to increase . . .''\n       Similarly, over the past decade the amount of funding \n     requested by VA for major and minor construction, and the \n     final amount appropriated by Congress, has been more than $9 \n     billion less than what the IB estimated was needed to allow \n     VA sufficient space to deliver timely, high-quality care. \n     Over the past five years alone, that shortfall is more than \n     $6.6 billion and for next year the VA budget request is more \n     than $2.5 billion less than the IB recommendation. Funding \n     for nonrecurring maintenance (NRM) has also been woefully \n     inadequate. Importantly, the IB recommendations closely \n     mirror VA's Strategic Capital Investment Plan (SCIP), which \n     VA uses to determine infrastructure needs. According to SCIP, \n     VA should invest between $56 to $69 billion in facility \n     improvements over the next ten years, which would require \n     somewhere between $5 to $7 billion annually. However, the \n     Administration's budget requests over the past four years \n     have averaged less than $2 billion annually for major and \n     minor construction and for NRM, and Congress has not \n     significantly increased those funding requests in the final \n     appropriations.\n       Taking into account the progress achieved by VA over the \n     past two months, and considering the funding shortfalls our \n     organizations have identified over the past decade and in \n     next year's budget, the undersigned believe that Congress \n     must quickly approve supplemental funding that fully meets \n     the critical needs identified by Secretary Gibson, and which \n     fulfills the principles and priorities we laid out a month \n     ago. Such an approach would be a reasonable and practical way \n     to expand access now, while building internal capacity to \n     avoid future access crises in the future. In contrast to the \n     legislative proposals in the Conference Committee which would \n     require months to promulgate new regulations, establish new \n     procedures and set up new offices, the VA proposal could have \n     an immediate impact on increasing access to care for veterans \n     today by building upon VA's ongoing expanded access \n     initiatives and sustaining them over the next three years. \n     Furthermore, by investing in new staff and treatment space, \n     VA would be able to continue providing this expanded level of \n     care, even while increasing its use of purchased care when \n     and where it is needed.\n       In our jointly signed letter last month, we applauded both \n     the House and Senate for working expeditiously and in a \n     bipartisan manner to move legislation designed to address the \n     access crisis, and we understand you are continuing to work \n     towards a compromise bill. As leaders of the nation's major \n     veterans organization, we now ask that you work in the same \n     bipartisan spirit to provide VA supplemental funding \n     addressing the needs outlined by Secretary Gibson to the \n     floor as quickly as feasible, approve it and send it to the \n     President so that he can enact it to help ensure that no \n     veteran waits too long to get the care they earned through \n     their service. We look forward to your response.\n           Respectfully,\n         Garry J.

Blum, National Executive \n           Director, Marine Corps League.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Essentially what the letter goes on to talk about is \nthat many of these organizations have been looking at this issue for \nyears, and in their independent budget have noted that the VA needs \nmore space, because you have many hospitals where there are not enough \nexamination rooms and that slows down the ability of doctors and nurses \nto treat patients, and we need more doctors and nurses. So for many of \nthese organizations this is not new news. They have known it for years.\n  Here is where we are. The good news is that I think we can bring \nforth a bill which deals with emergency contracted-out care for \nveterans today on long waiting periods. I think we can deal with the \nissue that Senator McCain feels very strongly about and that is making \nsure that veterans who live 40 miles or more away from a VA facility \nwill be able to go to the private physician of their choice, and I \nthink we can also strengthen the VA in terms of doctors and nurses and \ninformation technology and space so that we don't keep running into \nthis problem year after year. It is going to take the VA time in order \nto bring in the doctors and nurses and do the construction. I don't \nwant to get into the details of the discussions we are having with the \nHouse, but I did want to make veterans, and, in fact, Members of \nCongress aware of where I believe we are at this moment.\n\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the legislation we are \ndebating, the Bring Jobs Home Act, but before I do so, I wish to note \nhow much I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Vermont in \nfighting for quality care and quality programs for our U.S. veterans. \nThis is incredibly important. Our sons and daughters and husbands and \nwives are coming home from Iraq and now from Afghanistan. They have \nstood for us and we need to stand for them. Bernie Sanders is leading \nthat effort, and I appreciate him for doing so.\n  I wish to address the legislation we are debating, the Bring Jobs \nHome Act. Earlier today the Senate voted on whether to debate this \nlegislation to help bring manufacturing jobs back to America--to \nonshore these jobs. I was very heartened to see a 93-to-7 overwhelming \nbipartisan majority say: Yes, let's turn to this bill and work on \nincreasing manufacturing jobs in America. This is a much better result \nthan we had just 2 years ago when some of my colleagues combined to \nthwart the ability to close debate on the motion to proceed and we were \nunable to get on to this bill.\n  We are in an economy where jobs have been returning, but quality \nliving-wage jobs remain elusive. Indeed, 60 percent of the jobs we lost \nin 2008 and 2009 were living-wage jobs, and of the jobs we are getting \nback, only 40 percent of those are living-wage jobs. The difference \nbetween those two numbers means that millions of families who had a \nstrong foundation just a few years ago, while they may have employment \ntoday, do not have a strong foundation because they are chasing part-\ntime jobs, minimum-wage jobs, near-minimum-wage jobs, and jobs with low \nto no benefits, and that is not a foundation on which a family can \nthrive.\n  This bill is important. The Bring Jobs Home Act does two simple \nthings: It closes tax loopholes that ask the American people--\ncurrently--to subsidize the costs for corporations to ship jobs \noverseas; second, it creates a new tax incentive to encourage companies \nto bring jobs home with a tax credit that covers 20 percent of the \ncosts of relocating those jobs back to the United States.\n  I am an original cosponsor of this legislation because this is an \nitem of huge importance to my home State of Oregon. Manufacturing is a \ntremendous driver of Oregon's economy. In fact, if we look across the \nNation and we look at what share of the State economy is driven by \nmanufacturing, Oregon is often first or second. Manufacturing matters a \ngreat deal. When manufacturing thrives, the Oregon economy is going to \ndo well, and when it dies, the Oregon economy is not going to do well.\n  If we look at this from yet another perspective, we can see that \nStates have been losing manufacturing jobs over the last 10-plus years \nin sizeable numbers. In the period of about 2001 to 2011, that 10-year \nperiod, we lost approximately 5 million manufacturing jobs. To put it \ndifferently, we lost 50,000 factories. Well, what would we do today to \nhave those 5 million living-wage, family-wage, good-paying jobs? One is \nwe should pass this bill and to quit subsidizing the export of our jobs \noverseas.\n  These tax breaks, which were put through by powerful special \ninterests for the benefit of a few multinationals, have done enormous \ndamage to the United States of America and to our families, and this is \nour chance to reverse that.\n  One study--the Economic Policy Institute study of 2012--looked at the \nnumber of jobs that were created in this dynamic between additional \nsales overseas versus additional imports. Those additional imports, of \ncourse, reflected jobs lost. In their estimate, Oregon gained about \n9,100 jobs from additional exports and we lost about 59,000 jobs. That \ndifferential of 50,000 jobs has an enormous impact on the State of \nOregon. We can put it this way: It is about 2 to 3 percent of the \nnumber of jobs in our State economy, so it is an issue which really \nhits home.\n  I know Oregon is not alone. For every single State--West and East, \nurban and rural, and, yes, Democrat and Republican--this has been the \nstory in which jobs lost have exceeded jobs gained. That is why I \nstrongly hope this body of folks--representing the West and East and \nNorth and South and urban and rural, the blue and red--can come \ntogether to get this job done for the American people.\n  Think about it this way for a moment. Under our current Tax Code, we \nare asking working families who are paying income taxes to subsidize \nthe exportation of their own jobs. That makes no sense. If you went out \non the street in Eugene or Pendleton or Medford--cities across my \nState--and asked people what they think about that, you would probably \nhear a common theme. One person might say: That is absurd. Another \nperson might say: That goes against our own economic self-interest. A \nthird person might simply say: That is wrong and it hurts families. All \nof them would be right. Let's right this wrong, this inflicted wound on \nliving-wage jobs and on our families.\n  Over the last few years we have started to see a bit of improvement \nin that manufacturing jobs have started to grow. But we need to nurture \nthat trend. We need to encourage that direction. I know that for the \nOregon families who are at the heart of the manufacturing economy, \nwhether or not their jobs stay here in the United States of America \nmeans everything. It will affect the quality of life they will have as \nadults, and it also affects the quality they will bring to their jobs \nas parents and raising their children to seize opportunities of the \nfuture.\n\n  Let's continue to work together to keep jobs here in Oregon and here \nin America. Let's take on this issue of offshoring that has deeply \naffected millions of Americans. This is a problem that is within our \npower to fix, and we are now on the bill that starts us down the path \nof fixing it. Let's not get stalled. Let's make sure we have the \nmajority to close debate, to get to a final vote.\n  If anyone has anything to say and you don't feel you have had time to \nsay it, come and say it tonight, say it tomorrow, say it tomorrow \nevening, but get down here and make your notions known so that you \ndon't have to say that you need more time when it comes time to shut \ndown debate and actually vote on this bill.\n  Paralysis has been the practice that has so hurt this Chamber's \nability to address major issues affecting America, and that is not \nright.\n  I encourage my colleagues, whatever you have to say, come down here \nand say it. Don't once again obstruct the ability of this Chamber to \ntake on a major issue affecting families across this land.\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time and opportunity to speak \non this bill. I know the Presiding Officer has been championing a whole \ncollection of bills designed to nurture manufacturing. That collection \nof bills could do great work and would be a logical additional step as \nwe take on these provisions to stop offshoring and increase onshoring.\n  We should turn to some of the other bills the Senator from Delaware \nhas put together. One of the bills he has put together is a bill I \nsponsored. It is called the Build Act. I have gone on a manufacturing \ntour in my State of Oregon and visited a large number of manufacturers, \nand the common issue I hear from those who are managing the factory \nfloor or from the CEOs is this: We need more folks coming out of high \nschools and community colleges who have both the aptitude for using \ntools and the desire to use tools.\n  It used to be, when I was growing up--this simply came because we had \na habit of building things in our garages. Our garages were full of \ntools in a working-class community. My garage is still full of tools, \nbut I can tell you that my children are not likely to find themselves \nout in the garage making things because that is not the culture today. \nIf they are going to learn the joy of making things, they are going to \nhave to have the opportunity of shop classes. It has a fancy name now--\n``career technical education.'' I think ``shop classes'' gives a better \nvisual impression--metal shop and woodshop and bringing items home \nwhere you can say, hey, I made this dustpan or this carving or this \nmask.\n  I have been to some shop classes in Oregon where the students are not \nmaking the simple things that I made. They are making some of the most \nincredibly gorgeous furniture you have ever seen, with sophisticated \nskills in using tools. We need more of those shop classes to help feed \nand nurture the manufacturing economy. It is a win-win for our \nchildren, it is a win-win for our economy, and it is a win-win in terms \nof creating living-wage jobs that are a strong foundation for families \nto thrive.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the time until 4:30 p.m. will be controlled \nby the Republicans.\n\n\n                          LNG Export Approval\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I come to the floor to offer a compromise on the LNG export issue. I \nwill put up my first chart. I think this is both a solution and a \ncompromise to LNG exporting.\n  The reality is we need to be able to construct LNG export facilities. \nThere has been debate in this body as to how that approval process \nshould work. Some want to take the Department of Energy completely out \nof the process and just allow companies to build LNG facilities--let \nthe market work--and that is actually an approach I advocate and I have \njoined with others on that type of legislation. That legislation has \nbipartisan support. I think we could get it to the floor and we would \nhave more than the 60 votes it needs to pass. Others have advocated a \nmore cautious approach, which is essentially continuing the current \nstate of play wherein DOE can take years before they make a decision on \nthese LNG export terminals. So what I offer today is the LNG Certainty \nAct, which I believe is a compromise between those two points of view. \nIt would provide for an expedited process but would do it in a way \nwhere we keep the Department of Energy in the equation.\n  Why is it so important that we act now? This is a bill that is very \nmuch about jobs. Right now we are on a motion to go to a bill that \npurportedly would create jobs. I don't think that bill will create \njobs; I think it will create more regulation and more costs for \ncompanies that are trying to create jobs. So instead why don't we bring \nup some of these energy bills that will not only create jobs but \naccomplish much more as well, such as economic growth--economic growth \nthat will generate revenues to reduce the deficit and the debt without \nraising taxes or increasing regulatory burdens? Why not pass some of \nthese energy bills that will provide better environmental stewardship? \nLNG production certainly would provide job growth, economic growth but \nalso better environmental stewardship, and it will also help provide \nnational security--national security for us and for our allies. That is \na very big reason it is so important that we act now.\n  We have a President who is talking about what Vladimir Putin and \nRussia should do and what they shouldn't do. He is talking about it, \nbut we need to go beyond talk to action. What is that action? We need \nto impose stronger sanctions on Russia. I think there is broad \nbipartisan support in this Senate to impose stronger sanctions on \nRussia, but for those sanctions to be truly effective, we need the \nEuropean Union to join with us in imposing those sanctions. We can have \na meaningful impact on what Putin and Russia do, but we have to act and \nwe have to get the European Union to act with us.\n  So why aren't they acting with us? The reality is Vladimir Putin has \nthem over a barrel--literally. European countries are dependent on \nRussia for their energy. So they are very reluctant to impose sanctions \nwhen they have to get their energy from Russia.\n  Here is a graph that shows how much all of these different European \ncountries get in terms of their energy, their natural gas from Europe. \nWe can see in some cases it is 100 percent, 60 percent, 50 percent. For \nsome obviously it is less. But for many European countries, they are \ndependent on Russia for this natural gas.\n  Here is the pipeline network coming in from Russia. Here we see \nRussia and all of these pipelines coming into Europe through the \nUkraine supplying natural gas. Obviously, these countries are very \nworried about imposing sanctions which, of course, would create \ndifficulty for them from an economic perspective as well as Russia, but \nthey are very concerned about energy supply. That is why we have to act \nand we have to act now to make sure they have another supply of energy \nso they can join with us in meaningful sanctions against Russia.\n  So how does the LNG Certainty Act work? Quite simply, it provides \nthat the Department of Energy must make a decision on whether to \napprove an LNG export application within 45 days of that company \ncompleting its preliminary application to the FERC--the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission. So understand, right now companies have to apply \nto both the Department of Energy and to the FERC--the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission. They have to apply to both in order to get \napproval to build an LNG facility.\n\n  When we talk to these companies we learn that the FERC has a fairly \nrational process that they know they can step through in an orderly \nfashion. It is pretty dependable, pretty certain. It takes a certain \namount of time, covers all the bases, but they know they can get \nthrough it. The DOE--the Department of Energy--on the other hand, \ndoesn't have any specific timeframes or criteria on how or whether they \nwill give approval to these companies, so it creates uncertainty and it \ncreates real delay.\n  As I said, some people want to take the Department of Energy out of \nthe equation completely; others want to continue just as it is. That is \nwhy this act truly is a compromise in that we keep the Department of \nEnergy in the mix, but we require that within 45 days after the \npreliminary application to the FERC is approved, which takes about 6 \nmonths, up to as much as 1 year--within 45 days after that preliminary \napplication is filed with the FERC, the DOE then has 45 days to make a \ndecision. So we still have whatever safeguards some people feel need to \nbe in there, as far as the DOE. The DOE is still in there. They still \nhave that safeguard, but we have a reasonably expedited process and a \nreasonably certain process for these companies that are applying to try \nto get approval.\n  Right now we have on the order of 13 different companies--1 has \nconditional approval but 13 different companies--\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\nseeking approval to build LNG facilities. Many of these companies have \nbeen waiting for over 1 year--some 1 to 2 years--and they are not even \nthrough the Department of Energy process yet. So while we need to start \nmoving natural gas to Europe, since Europe needs that source of supply \nso they can stand with us in sanctions against Russia, these \napplications continue to sit in limbo. How does that possibly make \nsense? Why aren't we acting? Why is it adequate or satisfactory for the \nPresident to just talk about what should be done instead of doing \nsomething? This is action we can and must take.\n  I will give my colleagues an example of a project showing what we are \ntalking about. I am showing my colleagues 13 different projects that \nare in limbo.\n  Here is one right here where we take a specific example. This is the \nGolden Pass project. It is a project ExxonMobil wants to build. They \nare ready to invest $10 billion--$10 billion--today and save these \ntaxes to build an export facility that will move liquefied natural gas \nfrom this country to Europe. Why would we want to sit and hold them up?\n  Here you see a timeline. They have been in this process already for \nmore than 1 year. It looks to me as though they do not even figure they \nare halfway done yet, and there is no certainty from the Department of \nEnergy when they will be done. Yet here is a $10 billion project that \nis sponsored by a company--ExxonMobil--that certainly has the ability \nto build it, that will take LNG, liquefied natural gas, to Europe.\n  What is the rationale for holding them up, for just making them wait? \nAren't we moving to a so-called jobs bill? How many jobs do you think \nwill be created in building a $10 billion facility? A lot of jobs.\n  This is just 1 example of the more than 13 I just showed that are \nsitting in limbo.\n  That is exactly why I have joined with Senator McCain, Senator \nMurkowski, and Senator Barrasso and we proposed the North Atlantic \nEnergy Security Act. The whole focus of this act was to streamline oil \nand gas production, to build the gathering systems we need, move it to \nthese LNG facilities, and give companies the approval and the authority \nto build those LNG facilities so they can move that gas to our allies.\n  All of these steps create jobs. They all create jobs. We create jobs \nin all of these steps: producing more gas, building the gathering \nsystems, and building the LNG facilities. But instead of doing this--in \nthis picture we have an oil well, which is flaring off gas, meaning \nburning it off. This picture is an example in my State of North Dakota \nwhere we are flaring off $1.5 million worth of gas a day. So instead of \njust burning up that gas, we would actually have a market for it, so we \ncan capture it, move it to the LNG facilities, and export it to our \nallies, not only strengthening our national security and their national \nsecurity but creating a market for our gas.\n  Right now we produce 30 trillion cubic feet of gas a year in this \ncountry, and we use 26 trillion. So gas is flared off instead of \ncaptured and sent to market.\n  If we want to talk about job creation, if we want to talk about \neconomic growth, if we want to talk about environmental stewardship, if \nwe want to talk about working with our allies to actually do something \nin response to Russian aggression, do we want to actually do something \nor just keep talking about it?\n  So while we are considering jobs bills, why don't we consider this \njobs bill? Why don't we consider the LNG Certainty Act. The reason I \nhave introduced this compromise bill is so we can do this: move natural \ngas from the United States, through facilities, to our allies to deter \nRussian aggression. It is that simple. That is what it is all about.\n  That is why, again, I joined with Senators McCain, Murkowski, and \nBarrasso to introduce the North Atlantic Energy Security Act. But if \nthat is too heavy a lift--if that is too heavy a lift--then let's take \nup the LNG Certainty Act and just approve the ability to build these \nfacilities. Let's at least take that first step.\n  There are other bills we can take up as well that are true job \ncreators, real job creators, where we empower companies across this \ngreat Nation, large and small, to create jobs, to create more energy, \nto create better environmental stewardship, and to strengthen national \nsecurity--energy bills that myself and others have introduced: the LNG \nCertainty Act which I am talking about right now, the North Atlantic \nEnergy Security Act which I have referenced as well, Keystone--the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. Why aren't we building that right now to make \nsure, with Canada, we produce more oil than we consume so we can tell \nthe Middle East we do not need any oil, we have it covered or the \nDomestic Energy and Jobs Act, which is a whole series of bills that \nhave been passed in the House that I have introduced in the Senate that \nwould cut the regulatory burden, increase the amount of energy we \nproduce in this country both onshore and offshore or the Empower States \nAct, where we give States the ability to take a primary role in \nregulating hydraulic fracturing so we have the certainty to continue \nthe investment that is producing an energy renaissance in this country.\n  All of these acts have been filed. All of these acts create jobs. Why \nare they being held up so we can consider a bill that increases \nregulation, increases taxes on companies in the country, and will have \nthe impact of reducing jobs and reducing economic growth rather than \naccomplishing all of the things we are talking about--not just jobs, \nnot just economic growth but national security and actually working \nwith our allies to accomplish something instead of just talking about \nit, making Putin tow the line rather than just telling him he should.\n  With that, I know my colleagues are here to propose additional job-\ncreating ideas as well, and at this time I yield for the outstanding \nSenator from the State of Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from the Dakotas for \nyielding the floor to me. Before he leaves, I wish to say something \nabout what the Senator just said. In fact, I was sitting here listening \nto him. I am going to prove I was actually listening to his speech. I \ndon't think we always do--sometimes I think we don't--but I did that \nbecause he was right on target.\n  But my thought process went back to the 1970s. In the 1970s, OPEC and \nthe Arab oil embargo basically held the United States of America \nhostage. I remember lines where we would wait for an hour and a half to \nget $10 worth of gasoline because we had a limited supply.\n  Now we sit here in a country, some 40 years later, that has unlimited \nresources available to us if we will just take the political moves and \nthe regulatory moves and the practical moves to exhibit our power and \nextract those resources.\n  For example, the Keystone Pipeline that the Senator talked about--not \na single molecule of carbon will be generated by bringing that \npetroleum underground through a pipeline from Canada to Houston. We \nwill refine it more soundly and more environmentally than the Chinese \nwould or anybody else would, and then we will have an almost infinite \nsupply to take care of our own country internally and also use it as a \npart of our soft power around the world.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct about Germany and about the Ukraine \nand about Russia. If we become the surrogate and we replace Russia in \nterms of supply of natural gas to that part of the world, we take away \nthe only asset Russia has. As Senator McCain has so often said, Russia \nhas relegated itself to being a gas station with a flag. If we become \nthe competitive gas station down the line, we can lower our price by \nnine-tenths of a cent, we can sell more gas than they can, and we can \nuse the soft power of our natural resources to bring back what we need \nin terms of peace and stability in that part of the world. The \nbyproduct of doing that is not just energy security, it is not just \nbetter diplomatic and international policy, but it is jobs for \nAmericans--jobs to build the pipeline, jobs to operate the pipeline, \njobs to extract or frack the natural gas out of Haynesville and \nMarcellus.\n  We are sitting on a ham sandwich, starving to death as a country with \nour assets because governmental policy will not let us do some of what \nwe ought to do.\n  So I came to the floor to talk a little bit about job creating and \nbringing\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\njobs home. The bringing jobs home bill is a $214 million bill, which is \na rounding error in terms of the way we do business around here, and \nwill do nothing except penalize companies for doing what they have to \ndo and offer a reward that is not a carrot at all to bring jobs back.\n  I thank the Senator from the Dakotas for his speech and for his \ncontinuing and persistent emphasis on our energy and our energy power \nand our energy independence. It is voices such as his that need to be \nheard more and more in this Chamber so we can create jobs for the \nAmerican people and solve the economic problems we have.\n  I commend the Senator from South Dakota--thank you--from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I apologize. I am a southerner, so I slipped up on that.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the good Senator and I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to talk for a minute about the \nissue of the day that is before us, the bring jobs home bill. I \nappreciate any effort to bring jobs home and to create new jobs at \nhome, but I want to talk about how we are making a false promise and \ngiving idle hope to people about bringing jobs back because we are not \ndoing the things we should be doing.\n\n  If you ask me to make my choice, what should we do in the Senate, on \nthe floor of the Senate, in this body as legislators to create as many \njobs as we can as fast as we can, a tax credit for bringing jobs home \nwill not do it and a tax penalty for taking jobs overseas will not do \nit, but approving the Keystone Pipeline will do it and giving the \nPresident of the United States trade promotion authority will do it. \nBoth of those are pending on the floor of the Senate right now before \nus. We could take them up tomorrow. If we did, we could make a massive \nimpact on job creation in America and further empower our economy.\n  I happen to be the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee's \nsubcommittee on trade. We have two major trade agreements pending in \nthe United States of America that we are a part of current \nnegotiations--one of them is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one is the \nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, called TTIP.\n  Those two trade agreements are free-trade agreements with our biggest \ntrading partners--Asia and Europe and Scandinavia--but the Asians and \nthe Scandinavians both ask me, when I talk to them in meetings \ndiscussing trade: When are you going to give your President trade \npromotion authority? Because we know until the U.S. Congress gives the \nPresident that authority, you are not serious about negotiating trade \ndeals.\n  I first came to the Congress of the United States in 1999, 1 year \nafter we gave President Bill Clinton trade promotion authority. Then we \nhad a plethora of free-trade agreements that passed at that time \nbecause of the negotiation power we gave the President. Trade promotion \nauthority just means we give the President the authority to negotiate \nthe trade agreement, and then the Senate gets an up-or-down vote on the \nagreement. But we do not get to vote on amendment after amendment after \namendment, we get a vote on the totality of the agreement. In other \nwords, we give sincerity to our foreign trading partners that what we \nsay is what we mean and that we are going to give our President the \nauthority to negotiate those deals, and we will make them subject to \nour ratification in the Senate. Trade promotion authority is important \nfor America, for jobs, for our economy, and it is, quite frankly, \nimportant for bringing jobs home to the United States of America.\n  The Keystone Pipeline, which I mentioned a minute ago in talking \nabout Senator Hoeven's remarks, is a job creator. The unions are for \nit. Business is for it. Most Americans are for it. It only takes the \nsignature of the President to let it go. The State Department has \nsigned off on it. There is only one reason, I suppose, we are not \nbuilding the Keystone Pipeline; that is, because of environmental fear \nof the Keystone Pipeline generating some kind of an environmental \nproblem.\n  Think about it for a second. If we do not put it in a pipe and bring \nit underground, we can put it on a truck that burns gasoline or diesel \nfuel and bring it to Texas and create a whole lot of carbon molecules. \nWe are trying to reduce carbon in the air, so building a pipeline is \nenvironmentally friendly. It is safer than putting it on the roads or \nrailcars or trucks or tractors. It is the way to do it. I do not \nunderstand why the President will not do it. But I think we need to \ncontinue to talk about it because the energy independence Senator \nHoeven talked about is exactly what America is on the cusp of having. \nWe suffered when we were energy dependent in the 1970s and 1980s. We \npaid a big price for it. We paid the price of inflation, reduced \nauthority around the world, and we lost our position and stature in \nbusiness. We now have a chance to secure it not just for this decade \nbut for this century in the United States of America, and I hope the \nPresident will reconsider his unwillingness to sign the Keystone \nPipeline and do so.\n  On the jobs issue and on the inversion issue, which has brought about \nthis entire discussion--and for those who might be listening and \nwatching, inversion is where American corporations decide to acquire a \nforeign company and invert to where their headquarters are in the \nforeign country rather than in the United States of America to take \nadvantage of a better corporate tax rate.\n  We have now the highest corporate tax rate in the world--the highest \nin the world. Japan, which used to be up there above us or right with \nus, has now lowered theirs. Canada has lowered theirs. Ireland has \nlowered theirs.\n\n  Jobs are going offshore because the cost of taxes is lower, because \nit is a tax code that promotes growth, promotes business, and promotes \ndevelopment.\n  We need a progrowth tax policy in the United States. We need a \nsimpler tax code. We need a fairer rate of taxation. We need to get rid \nof corporate welfare. A lot of my friends on the other side are always \ntalking about corporate welfare. They are right. We did it on ethanol \nsubsidies when we were subsidizing people to make ethanol. That was an \nintent, through a tax incentive, to cause something we thought would be \nthe right thing to happen for the environment, which did not work. \nThose are the types of things we ought to stop doing--those types of \ncorporate welfare. But what we should do is give a progrowth tax code \nto the American businesspeople, whether they are C corps or S corps--\nand I am going to talk about that for a second--so they know what kind \nof tax rate they can count on, they know it is simple, they know it is \nfair, and they know it is predictable for the future.\n  I find it interesting, when the old Soviet Union fell, when the \nSoviet satellite states such as Estonia and Latvia became independent \ncountries, if you go back and study that--and that was not too long \nago--if you go back and study what they did to separate themselves from \nthe Soviet Union--take Estonia, for example. The new President of \nEstonia, after they became independent, did three things. He gave the \nstate-owned apartments to each person who rented them and let them own \nthem as a home and then created a housing market instantaneously.\n  That was No. 1. No. 2, they cut the tax rate from 50 percent to 25 \npercent and revenues went up and not down, because people thought 25 \npercent was a fair rate and they did not cheat--because there was a lot \nof cheating going on under the 50-percent rate. Then on the corporate \ntaxes in Estonia, they went to businesses and said: We are not going to \ntax your profits as long as you reinvest those profits in jobs or in \nresearch and development. The rest of it will be taxes. So they \nincentivized research and development. They incentivized employment. \nThey made corporate Estonia feel as though they had a fair tax system.\n  What happened? If you fly into a town in Estonia today, it is similar \nto flying into Dallas or Atlanta. There are cranes everywhere. There is \neconomic development and improvement everywhere. Why? Because they have \nwhat people perceive to be a fair code. They do not have a junk code. \nThey have a good tax code, and they incentivize people to do business \nand make money.\n  You raise revenue in America by raising prosperity, not by raising \nrates of taxation. We have proved that every time we have lowered the \ncapital gains tax. Every year following the lowering of the capital \ngains tax, revenues from capital gains went up and not down.\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\n  Why? Because people who had a mature investment were incentivized to \npay the lower tax rate, sell the investment, and reinvest in a \nmaturing, developing investment rather than just hold onto it because \nthey did not want to pay what they considered was a confiscatory tax. \nTax policy drives economic decisions. There is not one of us in this \nroom who does not make decisions every single day on our own personal \nfinances where we do not consider--in some part or in whole--the tax \nconsequence of it.\n  That is why you have a tax code. But we all look at fair and \nequitable corporate tax relief. We ought to do it for S corporations \nand for C corporations. I want to talk about that part for just a \nminute. C corporations are the major corporations and dividend-paying \ncompanies in America. Their tax rate is 35 percent. S corporations are \ncorporations where they file as partners. The profits of the company \nflow through on what is known as a K-1 statement. It flows through as \nordinary income.\n  Today the ordinary income tax rates for people making more than \n$450,000 can go up to 39 percent. It is already higher than the 35 \npercent C corporations have. If we lower the C corporation rate from 35 \nto 28 percent through comprehensive tax reform, then there will be a \nbig disparity between the S corporations and the C corporations. The S \ncorporations employ a lot of Americans. They are the mom and pop Main \nStreet businesses. They are 72 percent of the jobs that are created in \nAmerica. So we ought to take the whole enchilada. We ought to reform \nboth the corporate tax rate, the C corporation rate, the S corporation \nrate, and the individual tax rate and modernize them together and make \nthem fair, equitable, less complex, and more productive.\n  If we incentivized American business to invest and to grow, we will \nraise revenues, we will raise prosperity, and we will raise hope. If we \ncontinue to pass bills that say: If you doing something, we are going \nto tax you or if you do something, we are going to give you a benefit--\nif we think that is going to cause people to bring jobs back to the \nUnited States of America, we are dead wrong.\n  What would cause them to bring jobs back to America is a fair tax \ncode and to take our strong investments and our strong assets, such as \npetroleum and liquid natural gas, which we were talking about, and use \nthem to our advantage through the soft power of economic power. So my \nmessage today is very simple. If you want to create jobs, build the \nKeystone Pipeline and give the President Trade Promotion Authority and \ndo it now.\n  If you want to really stop corporate inversions, just modernize the \nAmerican Tax Code like every other country in the world has done. There \nare a lot of people who are talking about offshore profits who are \nstranded in the Cayman Islands in these secret bank accounts because \nthey do not come back to America. We created the Cayman Islands secret \nbank accounts when we passed a tax code that was confiscatory in \nnature.\n  When it is better off for your company and your stockholders to keep \nthe money you make offshore--somewhere else offshore--so it is not \nsubject the second time to taxes, we created those Cayman Islands tax \nhavens. We will do it again if we do not get our Tax Code fixed. So my \nmessage is simple: Build Keystone, explore our natural resources, give \nthe President Trade Promotion Authority, and make a fair equitable \nchange in S corporations, our C corporations, and our individual rate. \nLet's incentivize prosperity and hope and not penalize and punish \nAmericans for doing business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                      Lawful Ivory Protection Act\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Georgia \non his remarks. As usual, they are eloquent and elucidate the issue \nbeautifully. I am glad I had a chance to hear them.\n  I come to the floor to speak about an effort to expand regulations \nthat will have a damaging effect on thousands of Americans. For those \nwho are concerned this administration is trying to take away our guns, \nthis regulation could actually do that. If this regulation is approved, \nwhen you decide to sell a gun, to sell a guitar or anything else that \ncontains African elephant ivory, the government would actually take \nthem away, even if you inherited the item or bought the item at a time \nwhen the sale of ivory was not illegal.\n  In February the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced a plan to \nprohibit the interstate commerce of African elephant ivory. This was \npart of President Obama's National Strategy for Combating Wildlife \nTrade. The plan is intended to stop the poaching of African elephants \nand to help preserve that species. But the impact will be something \nvery different.\n  The impact of this plan will be to change a policy that has been in \nplace since 1990, which prevents the importation of ivory for \ncommercial purposes, with the exception of antiques. But it did not \nrestrict interstate or intrastate commerce of legal ivory.\n  Now, let me be clear. I support stopping poachers. I support the \npreservation of these magnificent, regal animals, the elephant. I \nstrongly support stopping the trade of illegal ivory. But what I do not \nsupport is treating Tennessee musicians, Tennessee antique shops, and \nTennessee firearms sellers like illegal ivory smugglers for selling \nlegal ivory products, many of which are decades old, if not over 100 \nyears old.\n  Banning the buying and selling of products with ivory found in \nlegally produced guitars, legally produced pianos, legally produced \nfirearms, could prohibit musicians from buying or selling instruments \nthat contain ivory, prevent firearms and family heirlooms containing \nivory from being sold, and pose a significant threat to antique \nbusinesses.\n  Even though the ban has not yet gone into effect, the confusion and \nuncertainty created by the Fish and Wildlife Service's action to ban \nthe interstate commerce of ivory and any item that contains ivory are \nalready having a significant impact on businesses and families alike. \nLet me give you the example of John Case, who owns and operates a small \nantique family business with four employees in Knoxville, TN, near my \nhome. He says he could see his business devastated by this proposed \nregulation. This is what John Case says:\n\n       The impact of President Obama's Executive Order expanding \n     the buying and selling of antique ivory and other endangered \n     species has been significant on our auction and appraisal \n     business. If one looks at the number of antique objects we \n     have sold and are selling at auction just for 2014, the total \n     exceeds $156,000. This amount is more than 11 percent of our \n     revenues for 2013 and does not include the number of antique \n     objects we turned away from selling because of these new \n     regulations and the loss of appraisals of those objects.\n\n  John Case continues:\n\n       This would easily total an additional $25,000 in revenues. \n     This total loss in revenues of $181,000 equates to one full \n     time salaried employee in addition to hours for part time \n     employees.\n\n  Here is one more example of a new regulation, which on a small \nbusiness will equate to the loss of a job of one full-time salaried \nemployee, in addition to hours for part-time employees. We wonder why \nthe economic recovery has been worse than the great recession? You \ncannot be pro-jobs if you are antibusiness and if you keep dumping this \nbig wet blanket of regulations on every effort an entrepreneur has to \ncreate a new job. Americans who create jobs--one told me the other day \nin Tennessee: I'm sorry to say that I'm beginning to look at a new \nemployee as a liability instead of an asset. He said: I hate that. I \nwant the employee to be an asset. But when I look at the employee, I \nthink about what new costs does that employee bring to my business \nbecause of government regulations, because of ObamaCare, because of \nthis or that. Now, in John Case's case, it is about legal ivory.\n\n  Mr. Case goes on to say:\n\n       Further, the loss of revenues for our business is \n     significant, as it encompasses a wide range of antique \n     objects, including 18th and 19th century American portraits \n     on ivory, music boxes and furniture with ivory inlay, silver \n     tea services with ivory insulators, weapons with ivory grips \n     and inlay. If these new regulations go into full effect, I \n     anticipate the reduction of staff and intern programs.\n\n  That is fewer jobs.\n\n       The impact of these new regulations has a significant \n     impact on our customers as well.\n\n  According to Mr. Case:\n\n       I just fielded calls this past week of two local consignors \n     who had holdings of antique\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\n     ivory with values exceeding $200,000. For one of those \n     consignors, his antique ivory was by far the most available \n     personal property he owned. It had been inherited from his \n     grandfather. For many of my consignors such as these \n     gentlemen, they will see a complete devaluing of one of their \n     greatest personal assets.\n\n  Mr. Case is not alone. The music industry--and we have a lot of that \nin Tennessee, in Nashville and in Memphis and East Tennessee as well--\nis concerned. The National Association of Music Manufacturers, whose \nmission is to promote the pleasures and benefits of making music, says, \nof the proposed regulation:\n\n       [The] Problem with the Fish and Wildlife Service's plan is \n     many post-1914 instruments containing ivory are still in use. \n     Many famous artists perform with vintage guitars, violin bows \n     or pianos which contain small amounts of ivory. It is worth \n     noting that the music products industry had generally stopped \n     using ivory by the mid-1970s. A ban on the interstate sale of \n     items containing ivory would prohibit musicians from buying \n     or selling instruments. Replacing ivory with other materials \n     could adversely affect the total quality of those \n     instruments.\n\n  Instruments are not bought because they contain ivory but because of \ntheir playing characteristics. The proposed ban has already resulted in \nanecdotal reports of Fish and Wildlife Service agents investigating \npiano transportation companies to see if any instruments are containing \nivory--even though these companies do not own the instruments.\n  Here is another example from the National Rifle Association about the \nproposed ban of legal ivory:\n\n       The effects of the ivory ban would be disastrous for \n     American firearms owners and sportsmen, as well as anyone \n     else who currently owns ivory. This means that shotguns that \n     have an ivory bead or inlay, handguns with ivory grips, or \n     even cleaning tools containing ivory, would be illegal to \n     sell.\n\n  My office has heard from businesses and individuals from all \ndifferent sectors of our economy. The examples go on and on about this \nmisguided policy. Let me repeat. I support stopping poachers. I support \npreserving these magnificent, regal animals, the elephant. I strongly \nsupport stopping the trade of illegal ivory. What I do not support is \ntreating Tennessee musicians, antique owners, and gun owners like \nillegal ivory smugglers if they sell products that contain legal ivory.\n  I call on the Fish and Wildlife Service to abandon their current \nefforts and take a more commonsense approach, an approach that will \npreserve elephants, while not turning law-abiding citizens and \nbusinesses into criminals. In the absence of a more commonsense \napproach, I have introduced legislation, S. 2587, the Lawful Ivory \nProtection Act of 2014, to stop this misguided policy from going \nforward. My bill simply stops the Fish and Wildlife Service from \ncontinuing down this unwise path.\n  It keeps in place the same regulation that prohibited the illegal \nivory trade regulation before February 25, which is the date the Fish \nand Wildlife Service began rolling out new regulations to ban the \ninterstate commerce of ivory and any item that contains ivory. I urge \nmy colleagues to take a look at this issue, and cosponsor my bill, S. \n2587, the Lawful Ivory Protection Act of 2014, to stop the \nadministration from taking away our legal guns, from taking away our \nlegal guitars, and from taking away our legal items which contain legal \nivory if we try to sell them.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Refugee Crisis\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, when Congress unanimously passed the \nbipartisan William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act back in 2008 to strengthen Federal trafficking laws \nand ensure that unaccompanied and undocumented children receive humane \ntreatment, it was welcomed by the Bush administration as a priority \nissue in preventing the trafficking of persons around the world.\n  At the time Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission \npresident Richard Land said that:\n\n       It shows a broad coalition all the way from the left to the \n     right and in between when it comes to significant human \n     rights issues.\n\n  The law itself was named for William Wilberforce, an evangelical \nChristian who led the effort in Britain's Parliament to end the slave \ntrade in Britain in the 19th century. But now, 6 years later, too many \nof my Republican colleagues are calling to roll back the very \nprotections that just a few years ago were rightfully lauded as a \ntremendous victory for human rights.\n  Many of us believe the current Central American refugee crisis \nrequires an immediate and compassionate response. Yet the proposals put \nforth by Senate Republicans have been to reverse critical child refugee \nprotections, and deport DREAMers who have absolutely nothing to do with \nthis current crisis.\n  The proposal introduced by my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, \nand similar proposals from my Republican colleagues would weaken the \n2008 trafficking law and implement expedited deportation that denies \nchildren the chance to go through an orderly process to determine if \nthey need protection--and it applies to all unaccompanied children who \ncross the border. I believe we are a better nation than that.\n  My Republican colleagues keep saying they want a humane process, but \nthese proposals would trade the safety of children for expediency and \neliminate the very protections unanimously set forth by Congress back \nin 2008.\n  As a father, I have to say I believe this debate can't just be about \nthe efficiency with which we can deport refugees. It should take into \naccount the situation these boys and girls are seeking to escape in the \nfirst place.\n  Both the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and the Refugee \nand Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services in two separate \nreviews recently found that approximately 60 percent of unaccompanied \nchildren from Central America suffered or faced harms that indicated a \npotential or actual need for international protection.\n  To understand how these proposals could adversely harm the children \ninvolved, one can read a recent article in the New York Times by Julia \nPreston. It tells the story of Andrea, a young woman from Honduras who \nwas forced by her own family--associates with the Mexican drug cartel--\ninto prostitution at age 13, if you can imagine that. After 2 years she \nran away, hoping to seek safety in the United States. She tried twice \nto flee abuse, crossing the Rio Grande, and was apprehended by the \nBorder Patrol in both attempts.\n  When agents questioned her, Andrea did not tell them why she fled. \nShe said:\n\n       I was just trying to protect myself . . . I was just afraid \n     of everything, after all those things those guys had been \n     doing to my body.\n\n  Andrea, a victim of sex trafficking, was sent back into harm's way to \nlive with relatives in Mexico.\n  Andrea is not alone. Many more children could also be sent back into \na dangerous environment if proposals to overturn the 2008 Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act are passed.\n  Unaccompanied children such as Andrea need a safe place to talk about \nviolence and abuse. A Border Patrol station holding cell is no place \nfor an interview that literally will impact the rest of their lives, \nespecially while they are still recovering from a dangerous journey. \nSubjecting Central American children to this screening process would be \na retreat from our Nation's commitment as a humanitarian leader, and, \nfrankly, undercuts our American values of putting children ahead of \npolitics.\n  A coalition of more than 100 nongovernmental organizations--such as \nFirst Focus, Women's Refugee Commission, and the American Immigration \nLawyers Association--all wrote a letter to President Obama earlier this \nmonth to share their thoughts on this humanitarian crisis. They wrote:\n\n       Congress gave consideration to the unique circumstances of \n     children when it enacted the [Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act].\n\n  Undermining due process and protection under the law is not the right \nanswer, and certainly will not appease the criticisms of those who have \nbeen calling for more punitive and aggressive enforcement.\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\n  Yesterday, in an open letter to Congress, the Evangelical Immigration \nTable warned against weakening the protections afforded by the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, stating that the \nlaw:\n\n       . . . ensures that victims of trafficking are not only \n     identified and screened properly but that traffickers are \n     penalized and brought to justice.\n\n  I have also heard from the Southern Baptist Convention, the U.S. \nCatholic Conference of Bishops, anti-trafficking groups, and children's \nlawyers who have all sent the same message to us: Don't weaken this \nanti-trafficking law. Congress should focus on strengthening safeguards \nfor children rather than weakening their protections.\n  Last week one of my colleagues from Texas proposed that the only way \nto stop the rise of unaccompanied children is to punish DREAMers and \nintroduce legislation to defund the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals Program--or DACA, as it is called. DACA has helped more than \n550,000 undocumented students across the country who came to the United \nStates as children to have an opportunity to pursue a higher education. \nDREAMers in the DACA Program are not the cause of the current Central \nAmerican refugee crisis. And the notion that any legislation to address \nthis issue must also end DACA is, frankly, out of touch. DREAMers are \nbright, they are hard-working, and most of them don't know how to be \nanything but an American.\n  I have met many DREAMers from New Mexico. I have heard their stories. \nI have read their letters. They have never given up on this country, \nand, frankly, I am not giving up on them.\n  Last year I had the pleasure of meeting a young woman named Laura in \nLas Cruces, NM. She arrived in the United States from Mexico when she \nwas 7 years old. She learned English. She earned good grades in school. \nIt wasn't actually until she was 13 years old that she even found out \nshe was undocumented.\n  She said:\n\n       I couldn't believe it. All my dreams, all my hard work, it \n     felt like it was all for nothing. . . . Don't leave anyone \n     behind on the American dream.\n\n  Laura wants to be a doctor.\n  There is the story from a young woman named Yuri. Her family \nimmigrated to the United States from Mexico when she was 2 years old \nback in 1996. While in high school in Albuquerque, NM, Yuri volunteered \nin her community, graduated in the top 10 percent of her class. She \neven received the 2013 Sandia Laboratory scholarship. Recently, she was \napproved for DACA and is currently a student at the University of New \nMexico.\n  There are literally countless stories just like these of young people \nwho love this country and have only known it as their home. We are not \ngoing to let Republicans use this current humanitarian crisis as an \nopportunity to punish DREAMers.\n  I am happy to end President Obama's deferred action program, but we \nwill only do that by passing the DREAM Act as part of comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  If we really want to help solve this crisis and make our policies \ncrystal clear, it is all the more reason to pass the Senate's \nbipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  The reality is, our Nation is facing a refugee crisis at our southern \nborder. Children from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala have fled to \nthe United States and to other neighboring Central American countries \nto escape unimaginable violence, corruption, extreme poverty, and \ninstability in their home countries. In some cases, these children are \nliterally fleeing for their lives. Many of these children are turning \nthemselves in to Border Patrol agents.\n\n  This little boy's name is Alejandro. He is 8 years old. He traveled \nalone from Honduras, with nothing but his birth certificate in his \npocket. I thought about that. I can't imagine my 7-year-old traveling \nacross Washington, DC, or Albuquerque, NM, or any major metropolitan \ncity in the United States by himself.\n  It took him 3 weeks to make that dangerous journey from Central \nAmerica to the banks of the Rio Grande. After being asked where his \nparents were, Alejandro said they were in San Antonio. He came to the \nUnited States because he wanted to reunite with his family. He didn't \nrun, he didn't hide when an agent approached him. Alejandro wanted to \nturn himself in--just as many mothers and children have done over the \ncourse of the last year. Yet we have heard this week calls from some \nwho would militarize our border and send in the National Guard.\n  I would say we need more resources for our Border Patrol agents. They \nhave been taxed. They have certainly been putting in long hours since \nthese numbers started to crest. But I don't think sending soldiers to \nmeet people like Alejandro is the right solution to this crisis. The \nnotion that lax border policies are somehow responsible for this latest \ncrisis is not just a myth, it is a willful misrepresentation driven by \npoliticians who would rather create a political issue than solve a real \nproblem.\n  In a recent interview when asked to discuss whether sending in the \nNational Guard would be an appropriate response to these problems at \nthe core of the current crisis, Steven Blum--who was the former Chief \nof the National Guard Bureau under President George W. Bush--told the \nWashington Post:\n\n       There may be many other organizations that might more \n     appropriately be called upon. If you're talking about search \n     and rescue, maintaining the rule of law or restoring \n     conditions back to normal after a natural disaster or \n     catastrophe, the Guard is superbly suited to that. I'm not so \n     sure that what we're dealing with in scope and causation \n     right now would make it the ideal choice.\n\n  That is a very polite statement. The fact is there are more Border \nPatrol agents today and more technology and resources at the border \nthan any time in our Nation's entire history, and our Border Patrol is \nbetter prepared to deal with this issue than the National Guard.\n  Border Patrol apprehensions are today less than one-third of what \nthey were at their peak, and this is because we have worked so hard and \nso effectively to secure the border. Those of us who represent border \ncommunities understand the challenges we face, but there are solutions \nbefore us that are pragmatic and bipartisan; that uphold our American \nvalues; that don't compromise them. Republican leaders should demand \nthat their colleagues in the House of Representatives act to fix our \nbroken immigration system. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill more \nthan a year ago now, and passing that bill would make our immigration \npolicies crystal clear to the world.\n\n  Additionally, passing the Senate's supplemental funding bill to \naddress this crisis sends a clear signal that we are aggressively \nstemming the flow of children and families from Central America while \ncontinuing to treat those refugee children humanely under the law. This \nsituation is an emergency and frankly we need emergency funding.\n  Passing the emergency supplemental would allow the Departments Of \nHomeland Security and Justice to deploy additional enforcement \nresources, including immigration judges, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement attorneys, asylum officers, as well as expand the use of \nthe alternatives to detention program. We are not arguing that every \nchild should stay. Many, in fact, will be returned, but it will be \nafter a Department of Justice judge has evaluated his or her case for \nasylum.\n  The supplemental would also help governments in Central America \nbetter control their borders and address the root causes of migration, \nincluding criminal gangs causing and profiting from this refugee \ncrisis. A number of us today met with the Ambassadors from Honduras, \nGuatemala, and El Salvador, and it was very clear what was driving \nthese issues. Without getting to those root causes, we won't be able to \nsolve this crisis permanently.\n  The supplemental would provide much needed resources for U.S. Health \nand Human Services to ensure that these children receive medical \nscreenings, housing, and counseling. Yet, instead of supporting this \nfunding which seeks to meet these challenges head-on and protects these \nchildren, Republicans want to use the crisis to eliminate crucial child \nprotection, punish some of our Nation's brightest students, and promote \ntheir border-enforcement-only agenda.\n  Before I close and hand the floor off to some of my colleagues, I \nwould like to highlight some of the humanitarian work that is being \ndone in my home\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\nState of New Mexico to address this crisis by telling the story of \nProject Oak Tree volunteer Orlando Antonio Jimenez.\n  Project Oak Tree is a short-term-stay shelter for Central American \nundocumented immigrants in Las Cruces run by the Catholic Diocese of \nLas Cruces. The shelter opened earlier this month after DHS established \na temporary facility for undocumented parents and their children at \nFLETC--the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center campus--in Artesia, \nNM.\n  Orlando signed up to volunteer for Project Oak Tree on day one. He \nsaid he saw the immediate need to assist families facing this \nhumanitarian crisis and he didn't think twice. He said his Christian \nvalues and belief in doing the right thing drove him to volunteer.\n  Orlando gets the opportunity to speak to almost every single person \nwho arrives at Project Oak Tree and said that almost all of the stories \nhe hears from mothers have some element of fear for their safety if \nthey were to go back home. Orlando said he will never again say the \nwords ``I am starving'' when he is hungry because he knows now what \nstarving really means. He says that this experience has changed his \nlife forever and that he will continue to help as much as he can.\n  I am grateful for Orlando's work in our community and for the many \nothers in New Mexico who have stepped in and shown compassion and done \nall they can to help. Now it is Congress's turn to help. It is our turn \nto be part of the solution to this refugee crisis.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise on the floor together with my \ncolleagues from New Mexico and Florida to talk about the refugee crisis \nat our Nation's border. I appreciate Senator Heinrich's leadership on \nthis issue and his comments, and I am looking forward to hearing from \nSenator Nelson as well.\n  I would like to share a little bit of a personal story and amplify a \nfew comments I made on the floor last Thursday about this challenge. I \nfeel very personally connected to this issue and to the children who \nare coming to the border, children such as Alejandro, whose picture was \nsuch a stark reminder that we are dealing with little kids.\n  In 1980 and 1981, I was a student in law school, and I decided that I \ndidn't know what I wanted to do with my life and I needed to figure it \nout. So what I did was I took a year off from law school and went to \nwork with Jesuit missionaries in the town of El Progreso, Honduras. El \nProgreso, Honduras, was at that point a small community at the edge of \nbanana plantations in a large agricultural valley in that country. I \nworked there as the principal of a school that taught kids to be \nplumbers and carpenters. I was dealing with youngsters in that \nneighborhood. Well, today El Progreso is in the epicenter of this \nproblem. There have been many hundreds of kids from El Progreso who \nhave come to the border this year.\n  San Pedro Sula--a nearby large city--is thought to be the murder \ncapital of Honduras, which is now the murder capital of the world.\n  When I was in Honduras in 1980 and 1981, it was not an overly violent \nplace. It was under military dictatorship. There were problems and \nchallenges, and there was poverty, but refugees were coming into \nHonduras back then from El Salvador and Guatemala. They weren't leaving \nbecause there wasn't the everyday violence we see today. Honduras was a \ngreat ally of the United States, a great partner. Honduras was one of \nthe original countries to which we sent Peace Corps volunteers, and I \ncould see their influence all around the country.\n\n  But Honduras is a very different nation today. Honduras is now the \nmurder capital of the world, has the highest homicide rate, which is \nabout 40 times the homicide rate of the United States. This area, El \nProgreso and San Pedro Sula, is the epicenter of that. The United \nStates had to pull Peace Corps volunteers out of the country a few \nyears ago because it got too violent. The friends I have stayed in \ntouch with over the years have informed me about what has been \nhappening in their neighborhoods as the violence has increased.\n  We had a hearing last week where we had witnesses before us in the \nForeign Relations Committee. We asked: Why are the kids leaving \nHonduras? Is it because their parents don't love them?\n  I mean, you think about family members. What would it take for a \nfamily to let a child take a trip of the kind Alejandro took? I can \ntell you from living in Honduras that parents love their kids just as \nmuch as people love their kids here in the United States. They are no \ndifferent. To send your child thousands of miles--you would only do it \nfor the most extreme reasons, and living in the murder capital of the \nworld is that extreme reason. These kids are fleeing to the border \nbecause they are not safe.\n  What is the cause of the violence? I talked about this a little bit \nlast week. The violence in Honduras, which is the murder capital of the \nworld; El Salvador, which has the fourth highest homicide rate in the \nworld; and Guatemala, which has the fifth highest homicide rate in the \nworld--the violence is overwhelmingly driven by the drug trade. That \nwas the evidence from our hearing last week as well.\n  Drug cartels have moved into Honduras and into these Central American \ncountries. They get drugs from South America. They are shipping them to \nthe United States because of the U.S. demand for illegal drugs, \nespecially cocaine. The drug rate in Honduras is not about Hondurans \nusing drugs. Hondurans don't use drugs to any significant degree at \nall. It is the illegal demand for drugs by people in the United States, \nlargely, and the dollars we are sending down to buy drugs that have \nturned Honduras--that have turned San Pedro Sula and El Progreso into a \nmassive drug cartel area where the combination of dollars and violence \nand fights between drug cartels puts little kids in harm's way. And \nthen the gangs want them to join--we want to be the most powerful gangs \nbecause we want the money, and the way we do that is we recruit more \nkids.\n  So the root of this problem--the root of these refugees--is violence \nin their neighborhoods that is created by a drug trade that is driven \nby, sadly, U.S. demand for illegal drugs. That is what is happening. \nThat is what is happening.\n  It has been heartbreaking to see a country that I care about and love \nand people whom I care about and love live in what is now the murder \ncapital of the world largely because of the demand for illegal drugs \ncoming from this Nation. So we are going to blame these kids? We are \ngoing to call them names or stand out in protest against them? Why? \nBecause they live in a violent neighborhood? Because they want a better \nfuture? Because they look at the United States and think we may be a \nbetter and safer place for them? We shouldn't be blaming them. We \nshouldn't be blaming them because they are doing what any of us would \ndo if we lived in a neighborhood where the violence was this extreme. \nIf you have no other way to protect yourself, you are going to leave. \nWe leave neighborhoods and we leave situations that are this bad.\n  The good news is--and Senator Heinrich has laid this out--we don't \nhave to stand by and say there is nothing we can do. There are \nsolutions. We had a meeting with the three Ambassadors today, and the \nForeign Relations Committee is going to have a meeting with the three \nPresidents of these Nations tomorrow, and we are going to talk about \nsolutions. Let me run through six things we can do, and I will talk \nbriefly about some of them. My colleagues have already dealt with some \nof them, and Senator Nelson will, but first let's start off with, how \nabout not blaming the kids, No. 1. Let's not blame the kids. Let's not \npretend they are crooks or criminals. Might there be some who are \ncoming across the border who have criminal records? Sure. We can do a \ncriminal record check and we can figure that out, and if that is the \ncase, then we can deal with that. But these kids are leaving to stay \nalive.\n  My wife is a juvenile court judge. She used to say: I sometimes put a \nkid in jail to keep him alive.\n  The need to remain alive sometimes leads you to do extreme things, \neven to travel thousands of miles to come to a country where you think \nyou might be more safe.\n  Let's begin by not blaming these kids. That is No. 1.\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\n  No. 2, we do need to implement the law. Senator Heinrich talked about \nthis law which was passed by a unanimous Congress, which was signed by \nPresident Bush, which was named after William Wilberforce. Do you know \nwho William Wilberforce was? William Wilberforce was a great \nabolitionist English preacher who had interaction with the slave trade \nwhen he was in England and then came to realize that the slave trade \nwas wrong and that religions had promoted the slave trade. He turned \nhis life around and became a crusader against human trafficking, a \ncrusader against the slave trade. That is what this law is that was put \nin place.\n\n  Let's not willy-nilly change the law. Let's implement the law. The \nlaw was a good law. In order to implement the law, we do need funding. \nSenator Heinrich talked about the supplemental request that would be \nbefore the Senate. We have had some good discussions about it. I think \nwe have put it in a place where it is now solid. We do need to support \nthat supplemental request so that there will be ample services where \nthese children can be evaluated. If they qualify for asylum, they \nshould be able to stay, just as other refugees stay. If they have \ncommitted criminal activities, they can be sent back in order to \nenforce the law. It seems that is what folks are always saying around \nhere--we should enforce the immigration laws. Let's enforce the William \nWilberforce law and make sure there are funds in place to do it.\n  The third thing we should do is get our priorities right about how we \nspend money. We are spending the money the wrong way in Central \nAmerica. It is kind of amazing what we are doing. You would think we \nought to be investing a little bit in the security of Central America \njust as we invest in rebuilding infrastructure in Afghanistan, just as \nwe invest in things all around the world, and we should especially be \ndoing it in Central America because it is the U.S. demand for illegal \ndrugs that is creating the conditions of violence there. Doesn't that \ncreate some obligation to take a little bit of responsibility for \nhelping Central American nations with security?\n  Well, we do spend money on the security in Central American nations, \nbut the money has been dwindling every year--dropping, dropping, \ndropping. For 2015 the President's budget submission for the Central \nAmerican Regional Security Initiative was $130 million, which is about \n$40 million each for the three countries. Compare that to what we will \nspend on border security in 2015, which is $17 billion. So $130 million \nfor regional security in the nations these refugees are coming from and \nwe are spending $17 billion on the border.\n  Instead of having to catch all these kids as they are coming across \nthe border and spend time and expense on the legal processes, wouldn't \nit be a little better to try to take some of that money and spend more \nin Central America to help these three nations have stronger police \nforces, stronger judiciary systems? If we could deal with and reduce \nviolence in the neighborhoods--and we have to do it in partnership with \nthese nations. They have responsibilities as well. If we could do that, \nwe could dramatically reduce the number of kids who are coming to the \nborder. We are spending money the wrong way.\n  I am happy this supplemental has some significant funding to increase \nour security efforts in Central America. That is very critical. We have \nto work with the Central American governments to prosecute the coyotes. \nThe coyotes are the smugglers who bring these kids to the border, and \nthey often perpetrate violence and tell these kids: Hey, look, we can \nget you to the border, and you can stay forever. They will spin false \nmessages about American law, and they do it because they are making \nmoney off these poor families.\n  Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western \nHemisphere. For a parent to pay $4,000 or $5,000 to one of these \nsmugglers for their kids to come here--that is usually more than their \ncombined assets. They have to gather up money from all kinds of places \nto be able to do it. We need to prosecute the coyotes and these \nsmugglers in Central America, and our effort is going to help these \ncountries do that.\n\n  We need to make sure these countries spread the message that once the \nkids get here, they are not going to come and stay automatically. That \nwork is being done, but more can be done.\n  I think probably the most important thing we can do here is to spend \nmore money helping to solve the cause of the violence and the drug \ncartels in Central America. If we do that, we will see the number of \nkids who are fleeing neighborhoods such as the ones I lived in \ndramatically reduced.\n  The fourth thing we can do--and Senator Nelson is going to talk about \nthis, so I will not get into it--is interdict more drugs. If you want \nto do something tough, why send the National Guard to the border? These \nkids are not sneaking across the border. They are turning themselves in \nto the first person they see. They know if they see someone with a U.S. \nuniform on, they won't be killed. They feel safe. We don't need more \nNational Guard at the border because the kids are already turning \nthemselves in. But if you want to be tough, how about more funds for \nthe American military so they can interdict more drugs before they get \nto Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador? Senator Nelson will go over \nthat.\n  Fifth, we need to do immigration reform, and Senator Heinrich \nmentioned that. We passed immigration reform in this Chamber 13 months \nago. There were all kinds of stories about it. There has been no action \nin the House--not even bills out of committee, much less from the House \nfloor--on immigration reform.\n  This morning the ambassadors told us the uncertain status of whether \nthere is going to be immigration reform is an issue. What is going to \nhappen? Something passed, but maybe it won't pass in the other House. \nWhen there is uncertainty, it enables these coyotes to go in and kind \nof market and say something is going to happen. They will say: We can \nget you to the United States, and you can stay.\n  The faster we pass immigration reform and create certainty, the \neasier it will be to deliver a message that everybody in Central \nAmerica will understand about what our rules are and what they are not \nand who is allowed to come in and who is not.\n  Finally--and this is the hardest one of all--we have to figure out \nbetter strategies to reduce the illegal use of drugs, especially \ncocaine, in the United States. As long as there is this massive demand \nfor illegal drugs such as cocaine in countries such as Honduras that \nhave poor budgets, there will be powerful drug cartels that will use \nthem as staging grounds to try to supply the United States drug demand.\n  We sometimes hear people talk about drug and cocaine use as a \nvictimless crime. They say: It is a victimless crime; I am not hurting \nanybody. I may use drugs, but I am not hurting anybody.\n  This is not a victimless crime. The ones who are using recreational, \nillegal drugs transited through the Americas are the ones who are \ncreating victims. They are creating the murder capital of the world, \nand they are the reason kids are fleeing their homes and trying to find \nsafety in the arms of a Border Patrol agent on the border of the United \nStates.\n  We need new strategies to tackle a huge and overwhelming demand for \nillegal drugs in the United States. Two weeks ago the President's drug \ncontrol policy key administrator, Michael Botticelli, went to Roanoke, \nVA, to roll out the national drug control strategy. He chose Roanoke \nbecause Virginia, like a lot of States, has had significant problems--\nwhether it is heroin or prescription drugs. He also chose Roanoke \nbecause it has been a place where there have been strong efforts to \ncome together to tackle illegal drug use.\n  Last Friday I went to Roanoke and spoke at a drug court graduation--\npeople who were addicted to drugs but worked with social workers and \nfolks from local courts to break the bonds of that addiction, the bonds \nthat, just as they are addicted to them, also put people in chains in \ncountries such as Honduras by turning their neighborhoods into violent \ndrug-controlled shooting galleries.\n  We have to be creative and strategic in dealing with the demands for \nillegal drugs. It is sad that these kids are fleeing their country \nbecause of the violence that in some ways has its roots here. The drug \ndemand in this country\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\nis at the origin of the violence that is chasing these kids out of \ntheir neighborhoods, and that gives us a moral responsibility to try \nand tackle this problem and solve it.\n  I thank my colleagues for their strong support for the supplemental \nappropriation we will take up. I look forward to working with them. We \ncan solve this problem. We can solve it if we do the right things.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that this is a very \nsubstantive discussion. This Senator is enormously impressed with the \nquality of the commentary from the two who have preceded me and those \nwho will follow. We are addressing the treatment of this issue in a \ncomprehensive way.\n  I was so glad the Senator from Virginia mentioned the initial \nlegislation from years ago protecting children once they reached the \nborder is named after William Wilberforce, a Parliamentarian in England \nin the late 1700s and early 1800s whose sole mission--it took him 20 \nyears as a politician and a member of Parliament--changed the course of \nhistory because he singlehandedly, through his legislative efforts, \nabolished the English slave trade, and it changed the course of the \nhistory of the world.\n  When we think of that kind of quality of parliamentary endeavor, it \nis time for the Senate to rise to this occasion in what is considered a \nhumanitarian crisis but is so complicated as to the reason it is \ncausing hundreds and thousands of children to appear at our border.\n  Right off the bat this law says we are going to treat these children \nin a humanitarian way. They are going to get medical treatment and a \nsafe place to stay.\n  When Senator Heinrich showed the picture of the little boy named \nAlejandro--doesn't your heart go out to him? Taking care of a little \nboy like that is at the heart of America. We don't want all of these \nchildren coming to our border, begging for entrance.\n  Listen to these Senators as they dissect the problem of what we \nshould do to eliminate the problem in the first place.\n  I want to take one snippet of what Senator Kaine said. Why is \nHonduras the murder capital of the world? Why are the other two Central \nAmerican countries--El Salvador and Guatemala--ranked so high as murder \ncapitals of the world? Why is it that next door in Nicaragua and Belize \ntheir children are not coming to our border in great numbers? The same \nthing is true with Costa Rica and Panama. Why those three countries? \nBecause the drug lords producing the drugs in South America are sending \nhuge shipments by boat--2 and 3 tons of cocaine per boat--through the \nCaribbean to the East or the Pacific to the West. Where are they going? \nThey are going to those three countries.\n  Basically, most of those drug shipments are getting through. Once \nthey get to those Central American countries--since the economic power \nis among the drug dealers and the drug lords--they can buy off \neverybody else. If you don't do what they say, you are dead.\n  When a young man gets close to becoming a teenager, his parents are \nconfronted with a situation of either joining one of these criminal \ngangs, which is interrelated with the drug lords, or they have to \naccept the fact that they are going to be attending their child's \nfuneral because he will be killed if he doesn't join them.\n  The third choice they have comes from what they hear from these \ncoyotes when they say: You are going to have free entrance into the \nUnited States.\n  What do you think a parent is going to do? Because the big shipments \nof drugs--primarily by boat to the east and the west--has corrupted the \nwhole system in those three Central American countries, what should the \nUnited States be doing?\n  We have had very successful drug interdiction programs in the past. \nWe have been very successful at it. We now have a four-star Marine \ngeneral--General Kelly, who is the head of the United States Southern \nCommand--who has a task force in Key West, the Joint Interagency Task \nForce South, watching their radar and aerial surveillance but doesn't \nhave the assets to go after 75 percent of those drug shipments. If we \nwould give General Kelly and the joint task force the additional Navy \nassets--that is Navy boats with helicopters or Coast Guard cutters with \nhelicopters--to interdict those shipments instead of letting 75 percent \nof them go, we would get to the root cause of the whole problem of why \nthe children are showing up on our border.\n  The big shipments of drugs have completely corrupted the societies of \nthose three countries, leading to all of the ramifications of the \nchildren and others going north.\n  Once those big shipments of 2 or 3 tons of cocaine in a boat land in \none of those Central American countries, they break them up into small \npackages. It is then transported by individuals, and it is very hard to \ninterdict those drug shipments as they go north through the rest of \nCentral America, Mexico, and to the border. The place to get them is \nwhen they are the large shipments. There are many more of these \nshipments coming by boat than on airplanes. As a result, what we see is \nthis crisis.\n  I will close by saying my wife Grace and I have been involved through \na Christian charity in trying to help some of the poor villagers have \nhope, particularly in Honduras in this case. I am not going to say the \nname of the village because I don't want to alert the bad guys that \nthis is a little village where they are getting attention, an \neducation, nourishment, and some health care. More than that, they are \ngetting the love of Americans. So it is a painful personal picture for \nus to see what has happened to that little country.\n\n  Finally, the President's request of over $3 billion does not include, \nas we learned in an all-Senators meeting last week with three or four \ncabinet secretaries and other agencies represented, funds for \nadditional Coast Guard cutters or Navy ships or the movement of those \nCoast Guard cutters or Navy ships with their helicopters from other \nplaces. I hope, by the effort Senator Heinrich has exerted today, with \nmany of us coming here and speaking about this, that we are going to \nstart to get this message through as to what needs to be done to \naddress this crisis.\n  Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to share my heart, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues sitting here \nbefore me, especially Senator Heinrich, who invited us to partner in \nthis dialogue today. I wish right now just to express my frustration. \nWe see on our television sets and we hear throughout the American \nlandscape rhetoric, posturing, and demagoguery that does not reflect \nthe truth of who we are as a nation, and it obscures the facts of what \nis happening on our southern border right now as a country. We have \nthousands upon thousands of children in the most vulnerable and \ninnocent stage of their lives showing up at our border. I hear ugly \nrhetoric about just turning them around and sending them back--rhetoric \nthat does not reflect who we are as a nation, the history of our \ncommunities or the laws of this land.\n  If I may, for a brief time I wish to speak just to reflect on the \nfact of why these children are showing up. Why are they coming to our \nborders? As the senior Senator from New Jersey has said clearly: This \nis not a case of ordinary people seeking better economic opportunities. \nIf this was just about poverty, then we would see people coming from \nall the nations in that area. To be specific, El Salvador's poverty \nrate is 34.5 percent. Belize's poverty rate is actually higher at 41.3 \npercent. To make a journey from a country with a lower poverty rate to \na country with a higher poverty rate, because that is where many of \nthese refugees are going--to Belize--begs a closer examination of the \ntrue drivers of this migration, because it is not poverty. It is not \npeople simplistically looking for economic opportunity. We are seeing \ncountries in addition to America facing the same problem: Children from \nthese three nations escaping severe persecution, sexual assault, rape, \nviolence, and murder are not just coming to the borders of the United \nStates to escape this persecution but going to other nations in that \narea.\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\n  For example, combined, Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and \nBelize documented a 435-percent increase in the number of asylum \napplications logged by individuals from El Salvador, Honduras, and \nGuatemala. In this area of our globe, where there is such violence and \npersecution in these three countries, it is driving people out not just \nto the United States, as some people allege because of the policy of \nthe Obama administration; these are people escaping persecution to \ncountries all throughout the region. This is about violence. This is \nabout heinous crimes. This is about a drug war. This is about cartels \ncarrying out the most egregious of human acts, evidencing the depravity \nand the evil that so cuts at the conscience of humanity, so that people \nare escaping to wherever they can go.\n  We in the United States have a long and noble history that when there \nare places on our globe that face this level of crisis, we respond, and \nwe are a part of an international community where our peer nations have \nshown that history as well. Here in North America, we know allies such \nas Canada have done incredible deeds when there is crisis, violence, \nwar, and persecution--mass rapes going on. There have been responses \nfrom our northern neighbor.\n  In 1972 when Uganda's President Idi Amin announced the Ugandan Asians \nwere to be expelled, Canada set up a refugee office and, by the end of \n1973, more than 7,000 Uganda Asians arrived in Canada.\n  Germany, for example, right now currently is accepting 20,000 Syrian \nrefugees. As I speak right now, Jordan and Lebanon are host to over 2 \nmillion Syrian refugees, and we as a nation are encouraging our allies \nin the Middle East to be there for those refugees when they come to \nthose borders. That is the international community. In America, we set \nthe standard. We are the leaders globally for compassion, for humanity, \nfor charity. I am proud that this tradition, which is two centuries old \nin America, can continue under Democrats and Republicans. It has not \nbeen a partisan football.\n  In 2008, under the Bush administration, in the face of Burma's \nhumanitarian crisis, this country, with the courage of its compassion, \nresettled thousands of Burmese refugees, admitting as many as 18,000 of \nthem. President Bush signed the legislation to ease the restrictions \nthat prevented ethnic minorities involved in that struggle against the \nBurmese regime--eased restrictions for them entering the United States. \nPresident Bush spoke eloquently during that time about American \ncompassion. He spoke about American heritage and American tradition. He \nsaid, quite poignantly, I thank those of you Americans and those around \nthe country--all of us--who have opened up our arms and said: ``Welcome \nto America. How can we help you settle in?''\n  This is who we are as a nation. And when we have children--\ninnocents--escaping violence and terror and crimes against humanity, \nwhere we as a nation are not even fully relieved of culpability for \nwhat is going on and when our Nation's drug consumption is helping to \ndrive that violence, we have a responsibility. That is who we are. That \nis our truth. We know this. We are a nation of people who came from \npersecution, who came from famine, who came from religious war. We are \na nation settled by those who were yearning to be free.\n  Now, I know the Statue of Liberty well because New Jersey has its \nback. When I travel around the State, I often get a great view of her \nnoble torch. I know it is not down along our southern border, but the \nideals of the Statue of Liberty still hold true:\n\n       Give me your tired, your poor,\n       Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n       The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n       Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\n       I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  I am grateful and support Senator Mikulski's leadership and the push \nto address this crisis by stepping up as a nation, by following the \nletter of the law and providing due process for these young people who \nhave come to our borders, so that we can evaluate them and see those \nwho have a justifiable claim for asylum and to see that we honor our \ntradition and our law and give them a place in our country that is safe \nand secure from the terror and the violence that is going on in those \nthree countries. It cannot be acceptable that we use our resources now \nsimply to expedite the return of thousands of children into that \nconflict zone, which is more dangerous now than at the height of \ncivilian dangers during the Iraq war.\n  We must as Americans follow that great tradition. We must as \nAmericans now do the right thing by innocent children: evaluate them \nwith our resources, expedite the judicial process to understand clearly \nwho is meritorious of asylum. And we should invest our resources in \nmaking sure the conflicts in those nations are abated so this crisis \nends.\n  I say clearly: In America we stand for something now as we have time \nand time again. We must garner our resources and, most importantly, our \ncompassion, which is the truth of who we say we are, and make sure we \ntake care of these vulnerable children and make sure we don't turn them \naround into a dangerous situation. It is time we show internationally \nthat when there is crisis, America stands and shows leadership and does \nthe right thing.\n  With that, I yield the floor for the senior Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I am really \nmoved by Senator Booker's passion, Senator Nelson's clarity of thought, \nand by my other colleagues who have joined us. I am compelled to join \nthem because we do have a crisis, but we also have, in my mind, a clear \nmoral and legal compass we need to follow.\n  We have a refugee crisis on our southern border, which I argue \nrequires an emergency response domestically and the urgent \nrecalibration of our foreign policy. Why do I say that? Because, as I \nhave argued for several years in the Foreign Relations Committee, the \ncontinuous cuts we have had in the programs that are in our national \ninterests, in our national security, were going to bring us a day in \nwhich we would rue the consequences of those cuts.\n  So here we are with Honduras having the No. 1 murder rate per capita \nin the world, and the other two Central American countries from which \nthese children are fleeing in the top five in the world. As Senator \nNelson spoke so eloquently, there is the whole question of the \nnarcotics trafficking taking place, using this as a via to the United \nStates where the demand is, and the total inability of these countries \nto deal with entities that have more money and very often have more \nfirepower than any of the national governments that are engaged. Then \nadd to that the dynamic and explosive growth of gangs. I am talking \nabout gangs armed and fueled with money in a symbiotic relationship \nwith the drug traffickers. That creates a challenge. In one of these \ncountries it went from 600 to 40,000 members of a gang. This isn't \nabout some far-off place; this is right here in our own front yard, in \nour hemisphere, a very relatively short distance. Unless we deal with \nthe root causes of these problems, there will be no resources or any \nchange in law that is going to ultimately meet the challenge of those \nwho flee because to stay is to die.\n  So that is the challenge we have before us. We have to deal with that \nchallenge on our southern border, and our distinguished chair of the \nAppropriations Committee has fashioned a package I think is balanced \nand seeks to do that. But as we deal with this refugee crisis, in my \nview, it is equally important that we not rush to change our laws in a \nway that strips children of the very rights for which we have been \nknown as a country. I am not even talking about the 2008 law; I am \ntalking about the very essence of our immigration law for decades that \nhas asylum as a fundamental pillar.\n  It is imperative to understand this is a desperate effort by \ndesperate parents to do what any parent would do to protect their child \nfrom violence and the threat of death. Imagine the circumstances a \nparent must be in to send an 8-year-old on a treacherous journey of \n2,000 miles where all things can happen to them in the hope--in the \nhope--they can arrive and make a claim for asylum, but not knowing \nwhether their child will actually be able to arrive alive. That is some \ndramatic choice,\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\nbut those are choices facing these parents.\n\n  These children are facing tremendous threats: towns and schools \ncontrolled by narcotic traffickers, gangs threatening to kill them, \nrapes and manufacturers.\n  In the Foreign Relations Committee recently, we held a hearing and I \nnoted a piece that was written in the New York Times by Pulitzer Prize-\nwinning author Sonia Nazario, who testified before the committee. This \nwas to give the Senate the sense of what we are talking about.\n  A young boy named Christian Omar Reyes, a sixth grader--his father \nwas murdered by gangs while working as a security guard. Three people \nhe knows have been murdered this year. Four others were gunned down on \na corner near his house in the first 2 weeks of this year. A girl his \nage was beaten, had a hole cut in her throat, her body left in a ravine \nacross from his house. Christian said: It is time to flee.\n  Carlos Baquedana, a 14-year-old who worked in a dump picking scrap \nmetal when he was a boy, making a dollar or two a day, when he was 9 \nyears old, barely escaped two drug traffickers who were trying to rape \nhim. When he was 10, the drug traffickers pressured him to try drugs \nand join a gang or die. He has known eight people who were murdered--\nthree killed in front of him. In one case he watched as two hit-men \nbrazenly shot two young brothers execution style. Going to school is \neven too dangerous for him now.\n  These stories are, unfortunately, not unique. They are tragic stories \nof life-changing experiences that too many children face in Central \nAmerica every day--children such as Christian and Carlos whose stories \nare unknown but no less tragic.\n  Let me take a moment to repeat that I strongly oppose changing \nexisting law. The answer is not to repeal the law that keeps these \nchildren safe and gives them an opportunity--that is all the law gives \nthem, an opportunity--to determine whether their status here can be \nadjusted under asylum. The answer is not to deny these children their \nday in court and send them back to very probable death. But those who \nwant to repeal the 2008 law would be doing exactly that.\n  If we provide the funding the government needs, the administration \nhas the authority to deal with the crisis in a safe and humane way \nwithout turning our back on the rule of law that we take pride in as a \nnation.\n  Antitrafficking organizations have explained to me that this \ntrafficking law was designed by both Republicans and Democrats in broad \nbipartisan efforts to give special protections to children who cannot \nadequately represent themselves and who often do not self-identify as \nvictims of abuse, crime or human trafficking.\n  Congress sought to provide special protections for those who have \nfled thousands of miles in recognition of the fact that a larger \npercentage of these children may have very compelling and legitimate \nclaims.\n  Unfortunately, the Border Patrol's cursory review of Mexican \nchildren's claims often results in a failure to identify children who \nare at risk of persecution or trafficking, according to the U.N. \nCommissioner for Refugees. Extending this type of superficial screening \nto Central American children would certainly mean serious abuse or \ndeath upon their return.\n  We can keep this important antitrafficking law and at the same time \naddress the situation on the border. Let me explain how the \nadministration already--already--has the authority to control this \ncrisis.\n  Critics have complained that the 2008 trafficking law requires \nchildren to be released into the community, but what the law actually \nsays is that children need to be held in the manner that is in the \n``best interests of the child.'' In this situation, where we are \ndealing with an influx of thousands of children, it is clearly in the \nbest interests of these children to hold them in a safe and clean \nshelter rather than returning them to face possible death or quickly \nreleasing them into the hands of a sponsor who may not be properly \nvetted. Failure to properly screen these children could result in \nchildren being returned to their very traffickers.\n\n  Critics have also complained that deportation hearings do not take \nplace for years after the children arrive and that this creates an \nincentive for children to come to the United States. But the law allows \nthe Justice Department to hold hearings much more quickly--without \ndenying due process--by moving recently arriving children and families \nto the front of the line for hearings before a judge.\n  As the Justice Department testified last week before the \nAppropriations Committee hearing, that is exactly what they are doing--\nsurging resources and expediting full hearings.\n  This expedited process that still protects due process would send a \nsignal to the parents in Central America that children without valid \nclaims--and there will be a significant universe that will not have a \nvalid claim and will be deported--will not be able to stay in the \nUnited States. But at the same time we protect the rights of legitimate \nrefugees and trafficking victims.\n  So while not every single child apprehended at the border will have a \nvalid claim to stay in the country, and many will be deported, we have \na moral and a legal obligation to keep them safe until their status is \nresolved.\n  The answer is not to repeal the law that protects them but to enforce \nit and to provide the administration with the resources it requested to \naddress both the domestic and international aspects of this crisis.\n  This problem was not created overnight, and it will not be solved \novernight. But the solution is not to abandon our values and the rule \nof law that we uphold as an example to other nations so every child \nwill be safe wherever they may live. If we do this now, I can tell you, \nI do not know how we will have any authority to look at any other \ncountry in the world and say to them: You must accept refugees from \nSyria, you must accept refugees from Congo, the Dominican Republic, you \nmust accept refugees from Haiti. The list goes on and on.\n  There is a reason this law was passed. It was passed to say if you \nare fleeing 2,000 miles to try to come to the United States, there may \nbe a greater probability that you have a real case to be made for \nasylum because you have a credible fear for the loss of your life.\n  As I hear those who advocate for the rule of law, I say you are \nright. The rule of law means you do not undermine the law or change it \nwhen you do not want to ultimately live under it. You obey it. You obey \nit.\n  If you flee 2,000 miles because you were told by the gangs to join or \ndie or if you were raped and you flee 2,000 miles never to experience \nthat tragic and traumatic set of circumstances again, you have a very \ncompelling case.\n  So let me close by saying the fact is there are some who are \nexploiting this issue for political gain, some who could not even see \ntheir way to cast a vote or to allow a vote on the type of \ncomprehensive immigration reform the Senate passed on a broad, \nbipartisan basis in which both border control and human trafficking and \nall of these other issues we are now facing would have had the \nresources and would be addressed.\n  I also find it incredible to see the Governor of Texas saying he is \ngoing to send the National Guard to the border. What is the National \nGuard going to do in what is otherwise a Federal law enforcement \nobligation with Border Patrol agents who ultimately are obviously \ninterdicting these young people but they are actually turning \nthemselves over to them. What is the National Guard, with rifles, going \nto do at the Texas border that the Border Patrol cannot do themselves?\n  This supplemental bill is almost entirely for enforcement of the law. \nI know Republicans have been saying for years they want more money for \nenforcement of immigration law. Well, folks, here it is. Here it is. I \ncannot believe with the resources that are going to the very States \nthat say they face a challenge, there will be those who will vote \nagainst it. I cannot believe that just because the President is \nproposing it, they cannot ultimately find their way to vote for the \nmoney that is going to go largely to the States that face the most \ncritical challenge at this time.\n  So that is what our immigration debate has come to. We began this \nCongress with an overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of commonsense \nimmigration reform, and here we are unwilling to even provide something \nI have never\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\nvoted for but will--strictly enforcement funding. We have Republicans \ncalling for DREAMers to be deported as part of this bill in the House \nof Representatives and a rollback of legislation to protect small \nchildren from human trafficking. That is what we have come to.\n  Rolling back this law, which passed with broad bipartisan support in \nboth Houses of the Congress and was signed by a Republican President, \nis not something I can personally accept, and I will use the procedures \nof the Senate--I hope with others who feel the same--if that is the \nchoice that has to come before us, not to permit that to happen.\n  The President has the authority to control this crisis already. Let's \ngive him the resources to do the job, and let us, in the process of \ndoing that, not create a dark day in our Nation's history which we will \nregret for years to come.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee that will be proposing the emergency \nsupplemental bill. This bill will be introduced tonight, and I want to \nbriefly describe it.\n  First of all, what does the emergency supplemental bill do? It deals \nwith three crises; one, it will fight wildfires with additional \nresources as to what is going on in our own country; second, it will \nhelp Israel be able to continue to man its Iron Dome antiballistic \nmissile system, as has been under siege by Hamas rockets; and, third, \nit will help be a downpayment on resolving the crisis of the children \narriving at the border.\n  To be specific, it will fight wildfires to the tune of $615 million. \nRight now there are 127 wildfires burning in our Western States, \ncovering four or more States.\n  Second, it will strengthen Israel's Iron Dome and add $225 million to \nreplenish the antimissile defense system, saving lives by shooting down \nHamas rockets, helping our essential ally Israel.\n  Third, it will deal with the crisis of our children arriving at the \nborder, and that will be $2.7 billion--$1 billion less than what the \nPresident asked for. It will care for the children. It will provide \nfood, shelter, and other needs. It will resolve children's asylum \nstatus, and it will have enforcement money to break up organized crime \ncartels, the traffickers, and the smugglers.\n  The total for all three of those will be $3.57 billion.\n  I agree with President Obama. This is an emergency supplemental. \nThese funds are designated as emergency spending because they meet the \ncriteria set in the Budget Control Act of 2011 that the needs must be \nurgent, temporary, unforeseen, and prevent loss of life. That is \nexactly what we are facing.\n  What does it mean to designate the funds as emergency spending? It \nmeans no offsets. So we do not take existing funds where we are either \ndefending the Nation or helping America's families to pay for the \nspending in this bill.\n  The needs are urgent.\n  Firefighting needs are needed now. The Forest Service will run out of \nmoney in August. Fires are burning Oregon, Washington, and other \nStates. We need to be able to provide the support to fight those fires \nand help our neighbors in our Western States.\n  Iron Dome. The funding is needed now to replenish a key part of the \nmissile defense system, replace Iron Dome artillery. Israel has already \nused a great deal of its assets dealing with the more than 2,000 Hamas \nrockets aimed at Israel. Israel has the right to self-defense. We are \nhelping them have what they need to intercept 90 percent of the \nrockets.\n  Funds to deal with unaccompanied children crossing our border are \nneeded now. If we do not do this, the Department of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement will run out of money in August, and the Department \nof Homeland Security Border Patrol will run out in early September. It \ndoes not mean that our Border Patrol agents or ICE agents will stop \nworking, but it will mean the Department of Homeland Security will have \nto take money from other Homeland Security needs to keep these agencies \ndoing their jobs.\n  Also, Health and Human Services will run out of money to house \nchildren in August. It means that children will stay longer at the \nborder. They will be in inappropriate holding cells. It also means \nBorder Patrol agents will be taking care of them, rather than child \nwelfare social workers. If you want to use Border Patrol agents to take \ncare of children, that is one thing. I think they should be defending \nour border and we should have social workers taking care of the \nchildren.\n  Our approach is sensible. It meets human needs. While we acknowledge \na tight budget situation, we fund only that which is needed in calendar \nyear 2014. This is very important. It funds only what is needed in \ncalendar year 2014. It defers $1 billion of the President's request \nuntil 2015, subject to Congressional action that the need be validated. \nWe hope by 2015 the surge will have diminished because of the \nprevention and intervention issues we are dealing with. But make no \nmistake, the funds we say we need we really do need.\n  This bill defers funds until next year, because I am deeply concerned \nif we do not follow the Senate number, the House will make draconian \ncuts that impact the care of the children, and also being penny wise \nand pound foolish, they are going to stop our ability to go after the \nsmugglers and the coyotes. So we do not want to go after the children, \nwe want to go after those people who are exploiting the children and \ntrying to recruit them into despicable activities.\n  We also do not want radical riders that will weaken our refugee and \nhuman trafficking laws or accelerate deportation of children without \ndue process under existing law. We do not want a backdoor version of \nbad immigration reform.\n  This bill is only a money bill. It does not include immigration \nlegislation. How that will be addressed on the Senate floor will be \ndecided by the leadership on both sides. The challenges to this request \nare many. We have made changes to the President's request. We have \nincluded more money for immigration judges and more money for \nadditional legal representation for children so we can determine their \nlegal status and determine whether they have the right to seek asylum \nstatus.\n  We also have robust enforcement against gangs and organized crime. \nSeven organized crime syndicates are operating in these three Central \nAmerican countries now. We are talking about more guns at the border. \nWe need more law enforcement and the help of the United States going \nafter the real bums and scums, which is these drug dealers who recruit \nthese children, murder children before other children's eyes.\n\n  You know what. We also know that when we work in a crisis and we do \nurgent supplemental efforts, we sometimes waste money. We can only look \nat some of the other agencies where we have done this. This bill \nincludes strong oversight from the inspectors general to make sure the \ntaxpayers' money is well spent, to protect our border, protect the \nchildren, and go after smugglers, coyotes, and human traffickers.\n  The best way to make sure the surge of children is slowed is not by \nrewriting refugee and human trafficking laws, it is by making it harder \non these crooks and criminals.\n  I am going to conclude by saying this: We already have 60,000 \nchildren at the border. This crisis is not at our border, however. The \ncrisis is in their home countries: Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala.\n  These children are truly fleeing violence. I have been down to the \nborder. I have talked to these children, listened to children who faced \nsexual assault, the recruitment into human trafficking, gang \nintimidation, persecution, threats of grisly physical actions directed \nagainst them.\n  What is happening in these countries? When you listen to the cries of \nthe children, I can tell you, in these countries there is a war on \nchildren. We cannot turn our backs on these children who are seeking \nrefuge. We need to pass this supplemental and we need to deal with the \nviolence that is coming out of Central America; that if we do not deal \nwith it there, it is not that the children will come to our borders, it \nis that the violence and the gangs will come to our borders.\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\n  I hope when the leader introduces the bill later on this evening we \ncan proceed and debate this with due diligence. I look forward to \nchairing the committee as we go through this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \npresentation and colloquy with my fellow Republican colleagues for up \nto 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Corker, Mr. Graham, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. McCain \npertaining to the introduction of S. 2650 are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CORKER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2262\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor with a number of my \ncolleagues to ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by \nthe majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate resume consideration of S. 2262, which is the Shaheen-Portman \nenergy efficiency bill; that the motion to commit be withdrawn; that \namendments Nos. 3023 and 3025 be withdrawn; that the pending substitute \namendment be agreed to; that there be no other amendments, points of \norder, or motions in order to the bill other than budget points of \norder and the applicable motions to waive; that there be up to 4 hours \nof debate on the bill equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended; that the bill be \nsubject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that if the bill is passed, \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 371, S. 2282, \nwhich is the passage of the Keystone Pipeline, at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, but no later than Thursday, July 31, 2014; that \nthere be no amendments, points of order, or motions in order to the \nbill other than budget points of order and the applicable motions to \nwaive; that there be up to 4 hours of debate on the bill equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; that upon the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill; finally, that the bill be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold.\n  What I am basically asking is that we get a vote on Shaheen-Portman \nand if that moves, that we then get a vote on the Keystone Pipeline--\nsomething our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been talking \nabout for months.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would propose to the Senator from New \nHampshire an alternative. Before I do that, I would say the biggest \nproblem we have is the inability of the Senate to process amendments in \nthe normal order. I believe the Senator from New Hampshire is \nsympathetic to that.\n  If we could just have an opportunity to offer and vote on amendments, \nI have every confidence this piece of legislation would have been long \npassed. But somehow we are stuck. And it is not just the minority party \nthat is limited on opportunities to offer ideas to help improve \nlegislation and to get votes. It is even our friends who are in the \nmajority. I can only imagine what it is like to feel like: I am in the \nmajority, and I can't even get votes on my amendments or my legislation \npassed.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments in order to S. \n2262 be five amendments from the Republican side related to energy \npolicy, each with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each amendment. I \nfurther ask that following the disposition of these five amendments, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage \nof the bill, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection of the Senator from Rhode Island \nis heard.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak on these two \ncommonsense pieces of legislation.\n  My dear friends Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman--Democrat and \nRepublican--have worked so hard in a bipartisan way, which we don't \nalways see anymore on the floor here or over on the House side. It is a \nshame. People tell me about how things used to be. I have been here not \nquite 4 years, and I haven't seen it yet. I am still waiting for it to \nhappen. But we have a bill, the Shaheen-Portman bill. It is basically a \nbill that creates jobs, saves money, makes significant strides toward a \nmore energy-efficient nation, which we should be.\n  I am from an energy-producing State, the great State of West \nVirginia. My dear friend Senator Heitkamp is from the great State of \nNorth Dakota, which is a tremendous energy-producing State. We believe \nin energy policies. We believe we should be using everything we have to \nmake sure we have the economic engine so we can compete globally and in \na very competitive way.\n  With that being said, this is the low-hanging fruit. This is truly \nlow-hanging fruit. And we all agree--why shouldn't we pass a piece of \nlegislation that basically we all benefit--all 50 States will benefit. \nThe bill will put us on a path toward a more sustainable future. It has \nbroad support, as we can see. And our colleague Senator Cornyn from \nTexas will tell you that if it got voted on, it would pass \noverwhelmingly. Now, that is hard for me, coming from West Virginia \nwhere there is a lot of common sense.\n  People say: Well, if it would pass, why don't you just vote on it and \npass it?\n  That is what I am saying. It is a shame that politics has trumped \ngood policy in this body and in this city, and we have to get back to \nsome order of common sense.\n  I am a tremendous supporter of this piece of legislation. I thank \nSenator Shaheen for all the hard work she has done. She has not given \nup. She will not give up. And that is what it takes--the tenacity to \nmake sure a good piece of legislation which not only helps the great \npeople of New Hampshire, it helps all of us. That is what I am looking \nforward to.\n  Then we look at the Keystone Pipeline. I have never seen a piece of \nlegislation that makes more sense than this piece of legislation, the \nKeystone Pipeline. When I first heard about this, people said: Senator \nManchin, what do you think about this?\n  The only thing I can say is that in West Virginia we would rather buy \nfrom our friends than our enemies. So we are going to buy the oil. The \noil is going to be sold somewhere in the world. Why shouldn't we have \naccess to that? Why shouldn't we have control of that? Why shouldn't we \nbenefit from the jobs? We are talking 20,000 direct jobs during \nconstruction, 118,000 indirect and spinoff jobs after construction, \ncontributing $20 billion of economic stimulus to the United States. \nEvery State, including my State of West Virginia--new Hampshire, North \nDakota, Rhode Island--we are all going to benefit.\n  It is something we find almost reprehensible, for us not to be able \nto vote on legislation. And I understand the amendment process. I \nunderstand all of that. But when we have very clearly defined pieces of \nlegislation that really create good policy for all of America, that is \nsomething for which sometimes maybe we push the politics aside, we vote \non the policies and the contents of these other pieces of legislation, \nwhich I know West Virginia would be happy for me to vote on, and I will \nbe in very much support of these two pieces.\n  With that, I thank Senator Shaheen for her hard work. I thank her for \nher not-give-up attitude, that New Hampshire commitment she has. She is \ngoing to work and fight. We are going to be right behind her and work \nwith our bipartisan friends on the other side. Senator Portman has \ncommitted the same way. So we hope we can get something reasonably \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I am standing with my good friend from \nthe\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\ngreat State of West Virginia, certainly a tremendous legislator and \nformer Governor and someone who knows how to get things done, Senator \nShaheen.\n  I know what is happening. I think I have learned at least that much \nsince I have been here, about the rules and how things work. But I also \nsee this body through the eyes of an American citizen.\n  I see two pieces of legislation--one the Keystone Pipeline. The vast \nmajority of people in this country support moving forward with the \nKeystone Pipeline. It is a critical piece of North American \ninfrastructure. It was critical in the last discussion we had about the \ndisruption and about the horrible conditions in the Middle East. If we \nhaven't learned the lesson, we need to build out our resources right \nhere among our friendly allies in the form of Canada and use our own \nresources here and then have the ability to use that new energy \ndevelopment for soft power, to actually begin to have a meaningful \ngeopolitical discussion that doesn't involve an addiction to foreign \noil.\n  So we think about Keystone Pipeline, and we think about the \nrelationship we have with Canada and the jobs that could be created, \nbut mainly we think about developing the infrastructure that is \nabsolutely essential to the development of our country and the \ndevelopment of our energy resources.\n  We can talk about fuel sources--and that is what my great friend from \nWest Virginia just talked about, having a policy that truly includes \nall of the above--all of the above, not picking and choosing. Let the \nmarket decide. Let's make sure that it is diverse, that we have every \nopportunity to develop everything we are going to develop. But we have \nto move that energy, and the Keystone Pipeline is example 1.\n  A lot of the disagreement about the Keystone Pipeline has nothing to \ndo with the pipeline itself. It has to do with the oil sands \ndevelopment up in Canada.\n  When we pick and choose winners and decide we are not going to vote \non something, the American people just shake their head and say this \nmakes so much sense, so why isn't the Congress voting.\n  Then let's take the second part of a solid energy policy--``all of \nthe above'' but also conservation, also energy efficiency, also making \nthe best use in a great American tradition, a conservative American \ntradition of making sure we have the best energy efficiency in the \nworld and having a piece of legislation that guarantees that and \ncreates jobs as a result and saves money for schools and saves money \nfor businesses.\n  All of this makes so much sense, and the American public knows it \nmakes sense. Yet this body cannot find a way forward to take a vote. \nHow frustrating is that?\n  It is frustrating for us here in this body, but it is more \nfrustrating for the American public that watches this display of \ninability to move forward on critical pieces of public policy that \nwould make a difference not only for our future but the future of the \nyoung people here whom I see every day, the future of the young people \nin my State, knowing that we need to absolutely have an energy policy \nthat works for the future, that is diverse, that recognizes the \nimportance of energy efficiency, and that moves energy.\n  We know we have a huge number of people in this body who support the \nKeystone Pipeline. Do we have 60 votes? We will find out. Let's take a \nvote. We know there is tremendous bipartisan support not only for \nKeystone but for energy efficiency, for the Shaheen-Portman bill. Let's \ntake a vote. Let's actually demonstrate to the American public that we \ncan move forward on what are literally no-brainers, things that \nabsolutely make sense. And those of us who support the Keystone \nPipeline, we will find out. We will find out if we can pass it.\n  Think about this: We have a bill here that mandates we approve that \nlittle bit of crossing into the United States of America, which is the \nonly way the Federal Government really gets involved in it, is because \nit is coming from a foreign country--approves that. Maybe we win, maybe \nwe lose, but we will know where we are. The administration has taken 6 \nyears to evaluate the Keystone Pipeline--longer than it took us to \nfight World War II. There is something dramatically wrong with that. So \nfrustration builds. We know we need to move on the Keystone Pipeline. \nWe need to have a strong vote. Let's take that vote. Let's take the \nvote on Shaheen-Portman.\n\n  It is a critical piece of legislation--well-thought-out--and comes \nright out of committee where lots of amendments were offered, where \nthere was the ability to have a dialogue. It comes about the right way \nwith the bill sponsors standing on the floor answering questions and \ndebating what the bill does. Yet because of this impasse--because of \nwhatever happens behind closed doors that the American public doesn't \nsee--they only look at what they see happening in the debate here and \nwonder why.\n  I support Senator Shaheen in her efforts to promote this bill. This \nwill not be the first time we have come and asked this. We will \ncontinue to do everything we can to move a vote forward on Shaheen-\nPortman, to move a vote forward on the Keystone Pipeline, and start \ngetting the work done for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Before my colleague leaves I wish to thank Senator \nHeitkamp for her support, not just for Shaheen-Portman but for a \nresolution to getting a vote on our energy efficiency legislation that \nI have worked on for 3\\1/2\\ years with our colleague Senator Rob \nPortman from Ohio but also for the impasse that would break around the \nvote for the Keystone Pipeline as well. Pairing the two would allow us \nto see where we stand on both of these issues.\n  I appreciate my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, coming \nto the floor because he and Senator Heitkamp have talked about the fact \nthat we have to look at a variety of areas of energy if we are going to \naddress our future energy needs in this country. There is new urgency \nto energy efficiency right now. A recent study just came out that shows \nthe United States ranks 13th out of the world's largest 16 economies in \nenergy efficiency. So that study analyzed the world's largest economies \nthat cover more than 81 percent of the global gross domestic product \nand posts 71 percent of the global electricity. What it found is we are \nseverely lagging behind other countries in our use of energy \nefficiency. This legislation, the Energy Efficiency and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act, also known as Shaheen-Portman, is a way for us to \naddress the deficit we currently have in this country.\n  We have heard from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient \nEconomy that by 2030 this legislation would create 192,000 domestic \njobs. That is nothing to sneeze at, at a time when our economy is still \nrecovering from the recession. It would save consumers and businesses \n$16 billion a year--again, real savings in a way that is important to \nconsumers and businesses. It would reduce carbon pollution at a time \nwhen we know pollution is affecting our environment and we are seeing a \nrecord number of disasters. It would be the equivalent of taking 22 \nmillion cars off the road. Our legislation does this without any \nmandates, without raising the deficit. In fact, we see a very small \nsavings of about $12 million in the legislation.\n  It addresses the building sector where we use about 40 percent of our \nenergy. It addresses the industrial manufacturing sector that consumes \nmore energy than any other sector of our domestic economy, and it \naddresses the Federal Government where we use more energy than any \nother entity in our economy; 93 percent of the energy is used by our \nmilitary. Clearly, energy efficiency is something that would benefit \nall of us.\n  There are 10 bipartisan amendments that have been incorporated into \nthis legislation. It is the product of 3\\1/2\\ years of work. It has \nbeen endorsed by hundreds--literally hundreds and hundreds of business \ngroups, of businesses, organizations, everything from the Natural \nResources Defense Council to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the International Union of Painters.\n  This is legislation that makes sense. We just heard Senator Cornyn on \nthe floor saying he thought there was support to get this legislation \ndone. I think we need to figure out how we can\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\ncome together. We don't have much time left before we go out in August \nto go back to our home States. This would be a great bipartisan effort \nto go out on at the end of July, to be able to go home and say to \npeople across this country that we worked out a deal that passed this \nenergy efficiency legislation, that we got a vote on the Keystone \nPipeline--let the chips fall where they may--that we addressed one of \nthe biggest challenges facing this country, which is energy, and what \nwe are going to do about our energy future.\n  I certainly hope that in the remaining time between now and the \nbeginning of August we can come together, find some sort of resolution \nto address this issue and get this legislation done. We know the House \nhas said they are willing to take it up. They are interested in seeing \nsome action on energy efficiency. Now is an opportune time to do that.\n  I am disappointed by today's objections, but as Senator Heitkamp said \nso well, we are not going to give up. We are going to continue to try \nand move this issue and do what is in the best interests of the people \nof this country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to ask unanimous consent, \nfirst of all, to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                         Traumatic Brain Injury\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to highlight an important \npiece of legislation that was just voted out of the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions--known by the acronym HELP. We \nvoted out of committee today S. 2539, the Traumatic Brain Injury \nReauthorization Act of 2014. Senator Hatch and I introduced S. 2539 to \nreauthorize existing programs to support States' efforts to help \nindividuals live with traumatic brain injury and of course to help \ntheir families.\n  TBIs range from mild concussions to devastating life-altering \ninjuries that collectively represent a significant public health \nchallenge. It is the signature injury, unfortunately, of the conflicts \nof the last decade, whether it is Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  It is also an injury that occurs approximately 2.5 million times in \nthe United States each year. Over 50,000 people die of traumatic brain \ninjuries every year. Traumatic brain injury is implicated in nearly \none-third of all injury-related deaths.\n  Children--just imagine this number--ages 0 to 4 and teens ages 15 to \n19 are at the greatest risk for traumatic brain injury. Among all \nchildren in an average year, 62,000 will sustain brain injuries that \nrequire hospitalization and 564,000 will be seen in hospital emergency \nrooms. Clearly, we must continue to improve our response to traumatic \nbrain injury, which includes prevention, timely and accurate diagnosis, \nand treatment.\n  The bill passed today out of the HELP Committee would make modest but \nimportant improvements to the TBI Act that is in place already. We ask \nthat the Department of Health and Human Services develop a traumatic \nbrain injury coordination plan to ensure that Federal activities at HHS \nand other Federal agencies are being coordinated for maximum efficiency \nand effectiveness.\n  We also ask for a review of the scientific evidence on brain injury \nand in particular brain injury management in children, with a special \nemphasis on evaluating scientific evidence behind the ``return to \nschool'' and ``return to play'' policies. This of course is very \nimportant.\n  As public awareness of the seriousness of traumatic brain injuries \nincreases, parents, schools, and coaches are struggling to develop \nappropriate responses. A lot of attention thus far has been focused on \nthe ``return to play'' policies, trying to ensure that children don't \nreturn to sports until they have healed from a previous concussion, but \nthere is much less attention on the so-called return to school policies \nand how we can take steps to ensure that children with a concussion or \na more serious brain injury can return to the classroom and continue \nlearning safely and effectively.\n  It is my hope that this bill, S. 2539, will help focus future \nresearch efforts and guide Federal and State agencies looking to \ndevelop policies in this area. Along with a lot of the members of the \nHELP Committee, I am pleased the committee voted today to move forward \nS. 2539, and I hope the rest of the Senate will join Senator Hatch and \nme in passing this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  In conclusion, it has been a great honor to work with Senator Hatch \non this legislation as it is when we work together on a whole series of \nimportant matters in the Senate.\n\n\n                       2014 Kids Count Data Book\n\n  Mr. President, I have brief comments on an important set of data that \nhas just been released. I will highlight very briefly the 2014 Kids \nCount Data Book, something a lot of child advocates and families are \naware of. This is an annual report, and I want to highlight the fact \nthat the 2014 report is now on the record.\n  This Kids Count Data Book was just published by the Annie E. Casey \nFoundation for this year. The Kids Count Data Book looks at every State \nto measure child well-being in States and across the country \nconsidering factors such as economic well-being, health, education, \nfamily, and community. Within each of these categories the report \nhighlights four important metrics and notes whether we have improved \nfrom the year 2008 to 2012.\n  Nationally, 10 of the 16 metrics showed improvement. That is good \nnews. Five metrics worsened. Of course we don't like hearing that, but \nit is important to measure when we are going in the wrong direction. \nAnd one of the metrics remained unchanged. So we are happy the \nimprovement number is 16 metrics and the worsening metric number is 5, \nbut we still have a long way to go to improve in each of these areas.\n  The report also ranks States based upon their overall results. \nPennsylvania is ranked 16th in the Nation. I wish we were in the top \n10. I wish we were in the top five and even No. 1. So we have some work \nto do in Pennsylvania. In some areas Pennsylvania is doing well \ncompared to the national average. For example, we have a lower rate of \nchildren without health insurance. That is certainly good news, with \nstill more to do on that. Teen birth rates in Pennsylvania continue to \nbe below the national average. Pennsylvania has a slightly higher \npercentage of children attending preschool. That is good news. We have \na lot more to do on that, both in Pennsylvania and across the Nation. \nFinally, Pennsylvania students continue to have higher proficiency \nrates in reading and math skills when compared to the national rate, \nbut there is still more work to do there as well.\n  The report also highlights areas where we need to improve both in \nPennsylvania and nationally. Far too many children in the United States \nof America are living in poverty with parents who often lack secure \nemployment. Too many teens are not in school and also not working, \nwhich dramatically worsens their ability to grow into economically \nself-sufficient adults.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to review the 2014 Kids Count Data \nBook which is available on the Web site of the Annie E. Casey \nFoundation. We should all consider what we can do in the Senate and in \nthe other body to improve our children's lives and our future.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak about amendments I have \nfiled to the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  My first amendment, the United States Job Creation and International \nTax Reform Act, would truly incentivize American companies to create \njobs in the United States, while at the same time leveling the playing \nfield for U.S. companies in the global marketplace. We can do this by \nreforming the rules for taxing the global operations of American \ncompanies and making America a more attractive location to base a \nbusiness that serves customers around the world.\n  Our current Tax Code does just the opposite, but the base bill we are \ndebating today wouldn't change that. Instead, it would discourage \nglobal businesses from locating their headquarters in the United States \nand make it harder for U.S.-based companies to expand.\n  Instead of messaging that we should bring jobs home, we need to \nreform our\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\noutdated international Tax Code. Let's just do it. Many of the United \nStates' major trading partners have moved to what are called \nterritorial tax systems. Those types of tax systems tax the income \ngenerated within their borders and exempt foreign earnings from tax. \nThe United States, on the other hand, taxes the worldwide income of \nU.S. companies and provides deferral of U.S. tax until the foreign \nearnings are brought home. Deferring these taxes incentivizes companies \nto leave their money abroad. Because the United States has one of the \nhighest corporate tax rates in the world, companies don't bring those \nearnings back home and instead reinvest outside of the United States.\n  This is having a real impact on jobs. Thirty-six percent of the \nFortune Global 500 companies were headquartered in the United States in \n2000; in 2009 that number dropped to 28 percent. Clearly, America is \nlosing ground, but the base bill we are considering won't change that.\n  My amendment would help to right the ship by pulling our \ninternational tax rules into the 21st century. This bill would give \nU.S. companies real incentives to create jobs in the United States in \norder to win globally. I hope as we talk about jobs this week, we will \nhave a chance to consider the amendment.\n  My second amendment, the Small Business Fairness in Health Care Act, \nwould remove the ObamaCare disincentive for small businesses to add \njobs. Small businesses are the drivers of the economy in Wyoming and \nacross the Nation, but the bill before us is not focused on removing \nthe burdens that current laws have placed on our Main Street \nbusinesses.\n  A recent survey by the National Small Business Association found that \nbecause of the President's health care law 34 percent of small \nbusinesses report holding off on hiring a new employee and another 12 \npercent report they had to lay off an employee in the last year.\n  My amendment is a great step to help address those issues. It would \nremove the ObamaCare mandate that businesses with 50 employees provide \nhealth insurance. This would allow small companies with 49 employees to \nadd jobs without the fear of the employer mandate. My amendment would \nalso clarify that 40 hours, not 30 hours, is full-time so that folks \nwho have jobs aren't limited to 29 hours of work per week.\n  These aren't the only ideas we should debate when we talk about \ncreating jobs in the United States. We should be fighting the \nadministration's war on coal, an industry that supported over 700,000 \ngood-paying jobs in 2010. The EPA recently issued new regulations that \ntry to force a backdoor cap and tax proposal on Americans that Congress \nhas already rejected. We need to reject that idea again. Instead of \nrunning from coal, America needs to run on coal.\n  We should debate the merits of the Keystone Pipeline and insist that \nthe President approve this project which has been pending for more than \n5 years and would create more than 40,000 jobs. The State Department \nhas done five reviews of the project and determined that the pipeline \nwould cause no significant environmental impacts. So let's create those \njobs. What are we waiting for?\n  Mr. CASEY. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4756-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Anderson is an accomplished news reporter and \ndedicated prison chaplain, ministering to inmates in the Commonwealth.\n  Though he has traveled the world, and worked as a reporter at radio \nand television stations across the Midwest, Reverend Anderson is \nhonored to call Bardstown in Nelson County, KY, his home, where he \nhosts ``Talk of the Town'' Monday through Friday evenings on WBRT, \nBardstown's hometown radio station on 97.1 FM and 1320 AM. This year, \nWBRT celebrates its 60th anniversary informing and cultivating a \nspecial relationship with the Bardstown community.\n  During his nearly four decades as a news reporter, Reverend Anderson \nhas enjoyed a varied and successful career covering everything from \nSuper Bowls to bank robberies. However, he has found no assignment more \nrewarding than that of ``a good news reporter,'' bringing the good news \nof Christ to others.\n  His conversion experience began after he covered the horrific 1988 \nCarrollton school bus crash. Killing 27 people, including 24 children, \nthe Carrollton crash remains the worst drunk-driving accident in our \nNation's history.\n  The gruesomeness and heartache Reverend Anderson witnessed following \nthat crash inspired him to begin bringing the light of Christ to \nothers. On May 15, 1988, the day after the accident, Reverend Anderson \nfelt called by God to be a ``good news reporter.'' One year later he \nfounded 70x7 Evangelistic Ministry. Continuing as a news reporter by \nday, Reverend Anderson began his ministry career by preaching at church \nservices and revivals at night.\n  His ministry eventually brought him to the prisons of Kentucky and \nOhio, where he became a devoted and beloved prison chaplain. Reverend \nAnderson worked with the prisoners, bringing many hardened criminals \nthe message of Christ. Reverend Anderson eventually took his prison \nchaplaincy overseas, ministering to inmates in Estonia and Latvia, \nbefore returning to the United States.\n  The Reverend Gregg W. Anderson's dedication seems to know no bounds. \nHis devotion and commitment to his work, whether in news reporting or \nin his Christian ministry, is an inspiration for us all, and I ask that \nmy Senate colleagues join me in honoring him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4756-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4756-S4757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GREGORY SCOTT SALYER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nveteran from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As a member \nof the Army National Guard, Gregory Scott Salyer served his country \nwith honor on a tour of duty in Afghanistan.\n  Service to this country is something that runs deep in Salyer's \nfamily. His father, uncle, and grandfather are all military veterans, \nand Salyer followed suit when he enlisted in 2006.\n  In Afghanistan, Salyer and his team performed the treacherous, yet \nindispensable, task of tracking, unearthing, and disposing of \nimprovised explosive devices, IEDs. IEDs were, and still remain, one of \nthe most serious and unnerving threats to our troops abroad. Salyer's \nwork in diffusing that threat undoubtedly increased the safety of our \nservicemen and women.\n  Returning to Kentucky following his service in the Guard, Salyer \nbrought with him the National Defense Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the Afghanistan \nCampaign Medal, and the ARCOM Medal of Valor.\n  For his honorable service to this country, Salyer is deserving of our \npraise here in the Senate.\n  Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring \nGregory Scott Salyer.\n  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing \nSalyer's service in Afghanistan. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\n           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]\n\n               Joins Guard for Work, Sent to Afghanistan\n\n                           (By Heather Oney)\n\n       Gregory Scott Salyer joined the Army National Guard in \n     Prestonsburg in 2006, serving until 2011.\n       The former Magoffin County High School student said he was \n     having a hard time finding a job, so at the age of 24 he \n     decided to enlist, following in his dad's, uncles' and \n     grandfathers' footsteps.\n       Salyer served one tour in Afghanistan, working in route \n     clearance. His crew, which included five other men from \n     Magoffin, tracked, dug up and disposed of improvised \n     explosive devices (IEDs). While he said he was hit once, he \n     came home without any injuries.\n       ``I would rather go back than sit here,'' Salyer said. \n     ``Everything was simple. You trained for a job, then you went \n     out and did your job. You would get up the next day and do it \n     all, again.''\n       Salyer said growing up around guns helped him get ready for \n     his time overseas.\n       ``I had been around guns my whole life and been shot at \n     while corning,'' Salyer laughed. ``You could tell these boys \n     from California with stricter gun laws were not used to it, \n     but us country people were used to doing hard work every now \n     and then.''\n       Salyer received the National Defense Medal, Global War on \n     Terrorism Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Afghanistan \n     Campaign Medal, ARCOM Medal of Valor, and Whitelist \n     recognition.\n       He has one son, Hunter Salyer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4757-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BARRY E. OWENS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nKentucky's proud military veterans--Barry E. Owens. Owens hails from \nMagoffin County, and served his country with honor in the Vietnam war.\n  Although millions of young Americans were drafted into service during \nthis time, Barry decided to leave nothing to chance and volunteer. He \nserved in the U.S. Army from 1968 until 1970, achieving the rank of \nspecialist 4.\n  In 1969, he was deployed to Vietnam with the 2nd and 35th Regiments \nof the 4th Infantry Division. In a time when the war became \nincreasingly unpopular, Owens always retained his sense of duty. ``I \nserved my country with pride and honor,'' he said.\n  Owens is a member of Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Salyersville \nchapter of the Disabled American Veterans. His commitment to this \ncountry is worthy of praise from this body. Therefore, I ask that my \nSenate colleagues join me in honoring Barry Owens.\n  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing \nSpecialist Owens's service in Vietnam. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]\n\n              Owens Volunteers for Draft, Goes to Vietnam\n\n                           (By Heather Oney)\n\n       Barry E. Owens, born and raised in Royalton, Magoffin \n     County, volunteered for the draft during the Vietnam War in \n     1968 with the U.S. Army, climbing to the rank of Specialist 4 \n     by the time he was discharged in 1970.\n       He attended basic training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, \n     then advanced training for supply specialist and armory \n     school at Fort Lee, Virginia.\n       From 1969 until discharged, Owens served in Vietnam with \n     the 2nd and 35th Regiment 4th Infantry Division.\n       After a few days upon reporting, Owens's company commander \n     decided that for the next year he would be a better fit as an \n     11 Bravo Infantry soldier, working ``out in the boonies,'' as \n     opposed to sitting around an office in a base camp.\n       Owens said he can remember the soldiers lining up in a \n     field to get their hair cut by Vietnamese civilians. Since \n     there was no electricity, they had to use the hand clippers \n     where you have to squeeze them to make them work. His \n     sergeant was in line and getting impatient.\n       ``I told him I was a barber before going into the \n     military,'' Owens laughed. ``So I started at the back of his \n     head and came out with a half moon, and that's where I \n     stopped. I threw the clippers and ran. The next time I saw \n     him his head was shaven, I think that's when they started \n     shaving heads.''\n       Owens was stationed in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, \n     including areas around Pleiku, Kon Tum City, Buon Me Thuot, \n     and many firebases in this region, including VC Valley and \n     areas on the border of Cambodia and Laos.\n       ``The Vietnam veterans returning home from this country \n     were not greeted and welcomed home with parades or such \n     fanfare,'' Owens remembers. ``Many of us were met at airports \n     with degrading slurs, cursed and spat upon.''\n       It would be another 20 years before the Veterans \n     Administration would acknowledge Post-Traumatic Stress \n     Disorder (PTSD) and other disabilities and afford medical \n     care to this era of veterans. Many Vietnam veterans fell into \n     drug and alcohol abuse, often even resulting in homelessness, \n     with many committing suicide and dying at an early age.\n       ``I served my country with pride and honor,'' Owens said.\n       He is a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), \n     and the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Chapter 15 \n     Salyersville. He has been married to his wife, Shirley, for \n     over 20 years and has three daughters, Melissa, Misty, and \n     Jennifer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4757-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING REVEREND SAMUEL C.

On June 25, 2014, he was elected the \npresident of the National Baptist Convention of America. With over 3.5 \nmillion members worldwide, the National Baptist Convention of America \nis an organization that seeks to ``positively impact and influence the \nspiritual, educational, social, and economic conditions of all \nhumankind''.\n  It is with the greatest sincerity that I ask my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing Rev.

He has \noverseen DIA's rapid tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence \nsupport to U.S. warfighters as they confront a variety of threats--from \nmilitancy in North Africa and the crisis in Ukraine, to tracking \nterrorists and weapons proliferation.\n  In all of his assignments, General Flynn has provided outstanding \nleadership with integrity and has offered sound advice on numerous \nissues of importance to the Army and our Nation.\n  I know that he is looking forward to spending more time with his \nfamily in Rhode Island, and I wish Mike and his wife Lori the very \nbest.

Mr. President, I wish to voice my concern over the \nnomination of Mr. Norman Bay to be a Commissioner on the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission--and eventually Chairman of the entire FERC.\n  I have serious concerns with Mr. Bay's qualifications to serve as a \nCommissioner, let alone lead the entire agency, particularly at such a \ncritical time for the Commission and the many issues it must address \nsuch as energy grid infrastructure, safety and reliability.\n  Mr. Bay has at best limited experience in the energy sector and, \nunlike many of the recent FERC Chairmen, has never served on the \nCommission. Mr. Bay's inexperience is only further illuminated when \ncompared to the lengthy and significant energy sector experience of \ncurrent FERC Acting Chairman, Ms. Cheryl LaFleur.\n  While I may not agree with Ms. LaFleur's various policy positions, \nthere is no denying the fact that she has spent nearly her entire \ncareer learning the intricacies of a very complicated electricity grid.\n  We must have the very best people on FERC, and the Chair must be the \nbest qualified for leading the agency. Mismanagement in this critical \nagency could have serious consequences for American families, small \nbusinesses, national security and energy infrastructure reliability. I \ndo not believe in on-the-job training for such an important position. \nIt appears there has been an undefined deal--some would say a\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nbackroom deal--struck with the administration to give Mr. Bay a FERC \napprenticeship, while the qualified Ms. LeFleur is forced out of her \ncurrent role as FERC Chairman.\n  Certainly, the Obama administration knows enough regulators to have \nnominated one that would be ready to serve once confirmed. This \npresents the question: if he is not ready to serve, why was Mr. Bay \nnominated in the first place?\n  I am afraid that President Obama and his Senate cohorts want to use \nMr. Bay and the FERC to carry out their radical energy agenda that uses \nthe government to pick winners and losers in the energy marketplace, \nwhich will only cause prices to increase on those who can least afford \nmore expensive energy.\n  I also think serious questions have yet to be answered by Mr. Bay \nabout his time as FERC's Enforcement Director. His answers to questions \nby various members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee were \nvague at best and evasive at worst.\n  Some suggested that actions taken by Mr. Bay as Enforcement Director \nhave had a chilling effect on wholesale electric markets and have \nalready caused electricity prices to increase in certain parts of the \ncountry.\n  There is simply too much at stake for me to support a nominee we know \nso little about and who knows so little about the job for which he was \nnominated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4759-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RECOGNIZING JESSICA BISIAR\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

A bill to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nintroduce the Leahy-Collins Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking \nPrevention Act. The prevalence of homelessness among young people in \nAmerica is deplorable. There are 1.6 million homeless teens in the \nUnited States. This problem is not limited to large cities. Its impact \nis felt strongly in smaller communities and rural areas, including in \nmy home State of Vermont. It affects our young people directly and \nreverberates throughout our families and communities.\n  The Runaway Youth Act, first signed into law in 1974, has proven \nessential to providing the services and resources that runaway and \nhomeless youth need, and our continued support is vital. Thirty-nine \npercent of the homeless population is under the age of 18, and the \naverage age at which a teen becomes homeless is 14.7 years old. These \nnumbers are stark reminders of our duty as a nation to protect the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  This bill reauthorizes funding for key elements of the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Programs, including the Basic Center Program, which \nprovides short-term emergency shelter and family reunification services \nto runaway and homeless youth. The Transitional Living Program provides \nlonger term residential services, life skills, education, and \nemployment support to older homeless youth. This bill reauthorizes the \nStreet Outreach Program, which is staffed by workers who go out into \nthe community to provide crisis intervention and services referrals to \nrunaway and homeless youth on the street and at drop-in centers. It \nalso supports funding for national support activities like the national \nrunaway youth crisis line, and access to evaluation tools to help \ngrantees track the success of their efforts and ensure that Federal \nfunding is supporting only the most effective programs.\n  This reauthorization includes new and important provisions to combat \nhuman trafficking. Victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking in \npersons and runaway and homeless youth--two of our most vulnerable \npopulations--are intersecting populations. Runaway and homeless youth \nservice providers are uniquely situated to identify victims of sexual \nexploitation and trafficking in persons. These youth have specific \nneeds and this bill ensures that victims of trafficking will be \nidentified as such, and receive the appropriate services.\n  Another improvement made by this reauthorization is a provision to \nimprove support for family reunification and intervention. Service \nproviders will be able to use grant funds to encourage the resolution \nof family problems through counseling and other services. Family \nsupport is critical to providing stability for homeless youth, and this \nnew provision will help boost positive outcomes.\n  I am proud that this bill contains a new nondiscrimination clause to \nprohibit any grantee from discriminating against a child based on their \nsexual orientation or gender identity. It is estimated that 40 percent \nof the runaway and homeless youth population identifies as LGBT. It is \nclear that this community needs the services authorized under the \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Act. No young person should be turned away \nfrom these essential services.\n  Supporting our youth when they are most in need and helping to get \nthem back on their feet benefits us all. Homeless children are less \nlikely to finish school, more likely to enter our juvenile justice \nsystem, and are ill-equipped to find a job. The services authorized by \nthis bill are designed to intervene early and encourage the development \nof successful, productive young adults.\n  I have heard from dozens of service providers urging swift passage of \nthis legislation. These are the people who are there on the frontlines \nwhen youth have nowhere else to turn. Without the programs funded \nthrough the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, hundreds of thousands of \nchildren would be left on the street.\n  I thank Senator Collins for working with me on this legislation and \nfor joining me as an original cosponsor. I hope all Senators will join \nus in supporting the prompt passage of the Leahy-Collins Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act with Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Leahy. This bill would reauthorize the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act, which expired last September. The programs \nsupported by this Act have provided lifesaving services and housing for \nAmerica's homeless and human trafficked youth for forty years and are a \nvital tool in addressing the problem of homelessness among young people \nin our country.\n  Homelessness is affecting youth in unprecedented numbers. According \nto the Health Resources and Services Administration, there are \napproximately 1.6 million homeless teens in the United States. Some \nadvocacy groups estimate that 39 percent of the homeless population is \nunder the age of 18. Some of these youth may stay away from home for \nonly one or two nights, while others have been living on the street for \nyears.\n  Of the 1.6 million homeless youth, the National Alliance to End \nHomelessness estimates that, in any given year, there are approximately \n550,000 unaccompanied, single youth and young adults up to age 24 who \nexperience a homelessness episode of longer than one week. \nApproximately 200,000 youth each year live permanently on the street--a \nlife that is extremely difficult, often dangerous, and unhealthy. \nSadly, 5,000 teenagers are buried each year in unmarked graves either \nbecause they are unidentified or unclaimed.\n  Teens run away and become homeless for many reasons. A study \nconducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found \nthat 46 percent of homeless youth left home because of physical abuse \nand 17 percent because of sexual abuse. This population is at greater \nrisk of suicide, unintended pregnancy, and substance abuse. Many are \nunable to continue with school and are more likely to enter our \njuvenile justice system.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations, I \nhave made addressing homelessness a priority. Since 2010, we have seen \na 16 percent drop in chronic homelessness. We must build on this \nsuccess and ensure our nation's homeless youth have opportunities to \nsucceed just as other youth. The Administration has set a goal, which I \nfully support, to prevent and end youth homelessness by 2020.\n  The programs reauthorized by this bill serve homeless youth by \nmeeting\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\ntheir immediate needs and providing long-term residential services for \nyouth who cannot be safely reunified with family. In 2013, 94 percent \nof the minors who entered Basic Center Programs exited these programs \nsafely and appropriately, and 72 percent were reunited with their \nfamilies. Similarly, 88 percent of youth in Transitional Living \nPrograms made safe and appropriate exits.\n  In Portland, Maine, the Preble Street Resource Center has used \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Act resources to connect with youth who need \nfood, a safe place to sleep, health services, and education support. \nOver 200 individual youth were served at the Joe Kreisler Teen Shelter \nlast year, and dozens received the support they needed to return home, \nfind independent living options, and deal with trauma, substance abuse, \nand mental health challenges. The Street Outreach Program allows Preble \nStreet to operate a Drop-In center and helps caseworkers and social \nworkers connect with youth who appear homeless or in distress. This \nsupport often translates into powerful success stories. In fact, Preble \nStreet has seen some of its youth go on to become physicians, \nattorneys, film makers, and social workers.\n  Mr. President, homeless youth are at high risk of victimization, \nabuse, targeting by human traffickers, criminal activity, and death. \nResearch shows that 40 to 60 percent of homeless youth have experienced \nphysical abuse. Without a safe place to stay, young people suffer and \nremain disconnected from education, the workforce, and community \ninvolvement, and they struggle to enter adulthood successfully.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act will \nsupport the critically needed services for young people who run away, \nare thrown out, or are disconnected from families. A caring and safe \nplace to sleep, eat, grow, and develop is critical for all young \npeople, and the programs reauthorized through this legislation help \nextend those basic services to the most vulnerable youth in our \ncommunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Leahy and me in supporting this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORKER (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Rubio, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Risch, and Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin):\n  S. 2650. A bill to provide for congressional review of agreements \nrelating to Iran's nuclear program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, in order to set the context, I am going to \nsay a few words on the opening, and then enter into a discussion with \nSenator Graham, Senator Rubio, and Senator McCain. But let me say that \nall of us--I know certainly myself--want to start by saying I strongly \nsupport the negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. I also \nstrongly support the President's stated goal that we must prevent Iran \nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Congress, in fact, has led the way on this point--Senator Graham, \nSenator Menendez, and many others, Senator Kirk--by building a broad \nmultilateral sanctions regime that has forced Iran to the negotiating \ntable. That is why today we are introducing the bill, the Iran Nuclear \nNegotiations Act, with a simple message: Allow Congress to weigh in on \nbehalf of the American people on what is one of the most important \nnational security issues facing our Nation.\n  We hope the administration reaches a good agreement over the next 4 \nmonths that will prevent a nuclear-armed Iran from becoming a reality. \nBut if and when they reach an agreement, let's bring all the details \nout in the open. Let's examine the agreement in its entirety, and let's \ndetermine if it is in our national security interests.\n  To help ensure that that is the case, Senators Graham, McCain, Rubio, \nand myself are offering this bill that will do three things: First of \nall, have a Congressional review. First, it allows Congress to weigh in \non any final deal the President reaches with Iran. The bill requires \nthe President to submit any final deal to Congress for review, and then \nallows Congress to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval should \nit choose to do so.\n  Second, it ensures Iran does not cheat on any final agreement. The \nbill requires the Director of National Intelligence to report on any \nviolation by Iran to Congress. If determined there is credible and \naccurate evidence that Iran violated the agreement, all sanctions that \nhave been temporarily lifted should be reimposed.\n  Thirdly, in order to ensure the interim deal does not become the \nfinal deal, the bill puts a clock on negotiations. This clock is \nconsistent with the timeline the administration itself has outlined. If \nthe President does not submit a comprehensive final agreement to \nCongress, all sanctions lifted under the interim agreement would be \nrestored immediately on November 28, 2014, 4 days after the end of the \nextension period.\n  Let me be clear: Nothing in this bill talks about imposing new \nsanctions of any kind. Nothing in this bill would prohibit Congress \nfrom seeking further sanctions if it chooses to do so. This bill does \nnot dictate the terms of what a final deal should look like. Rather, it \nhelps to ensure the Iranians do not use the negotiations as a delaying \ntactic or cover for advancing their program. This bill is all about \ntransparency.\n  The administration can go out and try to get the best deal possible. \nThey simply have to show Congress and the American people the results, \nletting the deal fail or succeed on its own merits. This should be an \narea of broad support and broad bipartisan agreement. Even Secretary \nKerry, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said \nthat any final deal would have to pass muster with Congress.\n  I want to stop here. I have some additional comments I might make. I \nknow there are numbers of people here who wish to speak. I want to \nclose with this. This bill represents a constructive, responsible role \nfor Congress to play on this important national security issue to try \nto prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, in the hope that Members on both sides \nof the aisle will agree, as Secretary Kerry has stated, that any final \ndeal should have to pass muster with Congress and the American people.\n  I know Senator Graham from South Carolina--no one has played a bigger \nrole in trying to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear-armed \ncountry. With that, I would love to hear his thoughts and his reason \nfor wanting to be a part, with five Senators, in creating this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Senators McCain, Rubio, and Corker on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, all have I think revived the committee, along with Senator \nMenendez. The committee is probably the most effective it has been in a \nvery long time. The committee is doing a lot of work in a bipartisan \nfashion. I hope one day this becomes a bipartisan piece of legislation. \nBut credit to the three of you all for coming up with this idea. I am \nglad to be part of it.\n  I wish to hear from Senator Rubio about his view of why this \nlegislation is necessary.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak for a \nfew moments. I thank both the Senators from Tennessee, South Carolina, \nand Arizona for allowing me this opportunity to join them in this \neffort.\n  For those who are watching at home, I know so many other issues are \ngoing on around the world--we see the things going on with regard to \nIsrael over the last few days; certainly the shootdown of that airplane \nby Ukrainian separatists, being armed by the Russians, is of great \nconcern.\n  But what should not be lost in all of this is there is another urgent \nmatter before the Nation and the world; that is, the ambitions of a \nrogue, radical regime in Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon that they \nwill use to hold the world hostage and establish dominance in the \nregion and in their stated goal, to destroy Israel and wipe it off the \nface of the Earth.\n  What has happened here over the last few months, for those who have \nbeen following this, is the White House has engaged in negotiations, \nalong with some other countries, with Iran to get them to walk away \nfrom this. These negotiations have been ongoing. I have never been very \noptimistic about it, although we all hope to wake up one day to the \nnews that the Ayatollah and the Supreme Leader in Iran and those who \nsurround him have somehow decided to\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\nwalk away from this ambition and change their direction.\n  These negotiations are not going very well. That is why they have now \nbeen extended for another 4 months. The administration claims there has \nbeen great progress being made, although it is not clear what that \nprogress is toward. For example, Iran's right to enrich, which they do \nnot have one, but this right to enrich uranium has essentially been \nrecognized as part of these negotiations, meaning there will be no \nguarantee that Iran cannot at some time in the future come back and \nexploit this agreement to develop nuclear weapons. If they keep the \nmachines, and if they keep the process in place to enrich uranium, if \nthey decide at some point in the future to go from a symbolic nuclear \nprogram, or a nascent one, into a full-fledged weapons one, they can do \nthat rather quickly.\n  That is what they have agreed to do, already allowed them to retain a \nright to enrich. That, in and of itself, should be reason, in my \nopinion--perhaps it is not shared by others but in my opinion--to pull \nthe plug on these negotiations. But it is not even clear in this \ninstance that the administration is still insisting that Iran dismantle \nall of its nuclear-related facilities. In fact, according to some press \nreports, the Iranians want to keep all of their current centrifuges and \nthe United States is supposedly open to allowing Iran to retain \nthousands of them. Iran's Supreme Leader even said recently that they \nneed a larger enrichment capability than the one they currently have.\n  Another thing that has happened as part of this extension is that the \nP5+1 countries are going to allow Iran to access another $2.8 billion \nin sanctions relief. Basically what they have done here is they have \nforced the hand of this extension, and they get even more relief as a \nresult of it.\n  I am also worried that the administration seems willing to allow Iran \nto have even more than 4 months to provide simply answers about its \npast work on nuclear weapons.\n  If they are not even willing to come clean on what they have done in \nthe past, how can we possibly treat them as a reliable, responsible \nactor. Beyond that, there seems to be no attention whatsoever paid to \nthe need to address Iran's ballistic missile program, its ICBMs. There \nis only one reason why you have ICBMs and that is these are long-range \nrockets capable of one day reaching the United States as they continue \nto develop them. The only reason they would even have one of those is \nto put a nuclear warhead on it. Just imagine a world where Iran has \nnuclear weapons capable of reaching this very city or New York or any \npart of the continental United States.\n  It would be all-out chaos. They would now have to be treated very \ndifferently, and they would basically be able to act with impunity \nanywhere in the world. And that reaches my last point. Absent in this \nwhole conversation and in all these negotiations is any discussion \nabout Iran's ongoing sponsorship of terrorism and their ongoing human \nrights violations, including a pastor--an American, with strong links \nto this country--being held unjustly in that country.\n  All of this is to say this is the reason why this bill is so \nimportant. Any final agreement on a matter of this consequence should \nbe reviewed by this body, should come before Congress, and Congress \nshould have the ability to provide oversight. The absence of that, I \nbelieve, unfortunately, leaves us vulnerable, not only to a terrible \ndeal but to a dangerous one that could potentially endanger the future \nof our allies and even of our own country.\n  I am grateful to join these Senators. I don't know who would want to \nspeak next. I know all of my colleagues--I know the Senator from \nArizona has spent a tremendous amount of time sounding the alarm on the \ndanger--not just of this deal--that Iran poses in this region.\n  I would be interested in hearing from the Senator from Arizona on his \nviews about this extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Florida and I thank him for his \nadvocacy for freedom and democracy throughout the world. Frankly, I \nhave been incredibly impressed with his knowledge and depth, including \nin our own hemisphere, which I think he and I would agree has been very \nmuch ignored. There are enormous challenges ahead there as well.\n  I would ask a couple of questions of my friend from Tennessee and my \nfriend from South Carolina.\n  Isn't it true that in order to have a true nuclear capability you \nhave to have a warhead and you have to have a delivery system, and the \nIranians are proceeding apace forward in acquiring those capabilities? \nWould anybody believe that if they were truly interested in not going \nto nuclear weapons, they would not be spending time and effort on that \ncapability?\n  Doesn't that destroy any credibility they might have about a \ncommitment to not continue the development of nuclear weapons?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I would say that if there was a group of people in \nthe world to be suspicious of, I would put Iran very close to the top \nof that list.\n  The international intelligence community believes they have tried to \nmilitarize their nuclear program in the past. Senator Rubio made a good \npoint. They deny this, but before you go forward, you would want to \nanswer that question: Were they engaged in militarization of what was \nclaimed to be a peaceful nuclear power program?\n  Second, why would you go through all of this upheaval, build a \nnuclear powerplant secretly at the bottom of a mountain, if all you \nwanted to do was have peaceful nuclear power? None of this really adds \nup. Why do you need an ICBM if all you want to do is produce peaceful \nnuclear power?\n  Having said that, suspicion is warranted here. But more than anything \nelse, the final deal that may be reached should come to this body \nbecause I would suggest that of all the problems in the world today, \nthis is the top of the list for me.\n  If they did break out as did North Korea, if a bad deal turned into a \ndangerous deal just as with North Korea, Sunni Arabs would respond in \nkind and we are on the road to Armageddon. I cannot think of a much \nworse scenario for our national security than the ayatollahs with \nnukes. I cannot think of a much more direct threat to the survival of \nthe State of Israel than ayatollahs in Iran with nukes. I can't believe \nthe Sunni Arabs would allow the Shia Persians to have a nuclear \ncapability unanswered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my friend from Tennessee, was he surprised \nand shocked that there would be an extension of these negotiations? Was \nhe shocked and surprised that the end date is now after the midterm \nelections that we have in the United States of America?\n  Was he shocked that even though there has not been ``sufficient \nprogress,'' there was still more relaxation of the sanctions, which \nthen gives the Iranians billions of dollars worth of a boost to their \neconomy? Was he surprised and shocked that this extension took place?\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Obviously, just the way the Senator asks the question--\nand obviously nobody in this Senate has spent more time on these issues \nthan the Senator from Arizona--and I thank the Senator so much for his \nleadership on the Armed Services Committee and also on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and on all of these issues--absolutely not.\n  When you have a deal that is aimed, that says there is a built-in \nextension, you know that people aren't going to focus until the very \nend. So we expected there to be an extension. I was very disappointed, \nthough, to know that we were giving additional sanctions relief.\n  I am very concerned because of the way this has happened. In March \nthe administration agreed to allow them to enrich uranium, which was a \nbig setback. I mean, we don't allow our best friends. We approved one, \ntwo, three agreements. The Senator and I just did one the other day in \nthe committee with Senator Rubio. Senator Risch is also a part of this \nbill. But with our closest friends and allies we do not approve \nenrichment.\n  So here we are really doing something that will undo many of the \nagreements that we have and certainly have--as Senator Graham of South \nCarolina mentioned--a tremendous impact on the region. There is no \nquestion people in the Arabian Peninsula right across the strait are \nlooking at a\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\ncountry that has been their foe--and looking at potentially their \nhaving the capability to enrich uranium. Yes, this agreement started in \na very bad place, but I think we all want to see a diplomatic solution. \nWe want this to be successful.\n  I would add that Rouhani has the Supreme Leader whom he has to go \nback and talk to. He can always use that. The Supreme Leader, as \nSenator Graham mentioned, wants 100,000 centrifuges--not the 19,000 \ncentrifuges they have.\n  I would say to our administration to have us as a backstop--where \nCongress has to approve this. That would actually be an aid to them as \nthey move down this negotiating path. I look at this as an asset to \nthem, and I look at our fulfilling our responsibilities if this bill \nbecomes law. I thank the Senator for asking.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, could I ask the Senator from Florida, we judge \nnations by their behavior, I believe. In fact, we don't view them in a \nvacuum. For example, the President of the United States said that if \nSyria crossed the red line in the use of chemical weapons, we would \nhave to respond, and obviously we didn't.\n  Meanwhile, 170,000 people have been slaughtered--men, women, and \nchildren. So isn't it appropriate for us to not look at the Iranians in \na very narrow spectrum but to look at overall behavior going all the \nway back to the bombing of the barracks in Beirut, the USS Cole, and a \nplot to kill the Saudi Ambassador here? And maybe the worst, most of \nall, is the Revolutionary Guard that has gone into Syria and the \nincredible flow of weapons and training on the part of the Iranians \nwhich has turned the tide in favor of Bashar al-Assad.\n  What about the Iranian missiles, some of which are threatening and \nraining down on Israel. Shouldn't we understand better? Shouldn't the \nAmerican people and the world understand better what we are dealing \nwith--a country with leaders who are dedicated to the extinction of \neverything we stand for and believe in? Therefore, wouldn't that impact \nour calculations as to their sincerity about a nuclear weapons program?\n  Mr. RUBIO. I think the Senator from Arizona touches on the exact \npoint.\n  First, we have to understand Iran is the world's leading state \nsponsor of terrorism. No nation on Earth uses terrorism as an active \nform of tradecraft as they do. They use terrorism the way we use \nmilitary forces when necessary. They view it as a very active part of \ntheir agenda.\n  The Senator is correct. Virtually every major terrorist organization \nin the Middle East, absent a couple, they provide extraordinary \nassistance to. I think the Senator touched on another point: What is \ntheir goal? That is important to understand.\n  What is the Iranians' goal in these negotiations? In my mind those \ngoals are quite clear. In fact, it is shocking to me because I know the \nadministration knows this as well.\n  The goal of Iran is pretty simple. They want relief from as many \nsanctions as possible without agreeing to any irreversible concessions \non their nuclear program.\n  Let's go through what they want to achieve. They want to be able to \nachieve or obtain an internationally recognized right to enrich--check.\n  They want the capability to enrich, process in the future, and keep \nthat much in place as possible. They have already gotten that--check.\n  They want to continue to develop their long-range rockets and missile \ncapabilities so that one day they can be in that position where, when \nwe negotiate with them in the future on anything else, they are \nuntouchable because they can launch a nuclear attack against the United \nStates and certainly against our allies. They continue to do that--\ncheck.\n  The Iranians in this whole negotiation view themselves to be in a \nposition of strength. To be quite frank, they believe that our \nPresident wants this deal more than they do. They believe he wants this \ndeal more than they do, and that is what puts them in this tremendous \nposition of strength.\n  The result is that these negotiations are not going to, in my view--I \nhope that I am wrong. I hope that tomorrow when we open the paper and \nread: You know what. They have changed their mind. They don't want to \ndo any more terrorism--no more rockets and no nuclear weapons program--\nand they have become just a normal government in a normal country. \nDon't hold your hopes out for that because that is not what they have \nshown in the past. That is not what they are doing now, and they are \nnegotiating from a position of strength because they know the President \nwants a deal much more than they want or need a deal.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask again, going full circle with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, wouldn't we actually be helping the administration \nat the negotiating table to say wait a minute, we have a Congress full \nof people who have spent a lot of time on this issue, are very \nskeptical and, one, are going to have to be convinced of this deal?\n  Wouldn't we actually be strengthening the United States' hand at the \nbargaining table, in the Senator's view, if it were something of this \nmagnitude that Congress would have to be involved in, as we have been \nin other major treaties that have been made, some of them much less \nsignificant than this agreement?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The answer, unequivocally to me would be yes, assuming \none thing: that those of us in this body would handle this in a mature \nfashion, assuming that Republicans would not vote no because this is \nthe Obama deal and Democrats would not be tempted to vote yes because \ntheir President did this, a Democratic President.\n  I have confidence in the body that they would not do that. Let me \ntell you why. There are a lot of treaties out there that affect our \nnational security. I can't think of an event in my life that is going \nto affect our national security one way or the other greater than the \nIranian nuclear deal that I think is coming.\n  If a Republican scuttled the deal that was good, you would have a \nvery unique place in history because you would have done a disservice \nto our country and the world at large.\n  Is it possible to know that it is a good deal? Yes, because the \nIsraelis would comment on it. The Sunni Arab world would comment on it. \nIf it is truly a deal unlike North Korea, which led to a bad outcome, I \nthink you would have a score of people, including me, that would \nacknowledge that the President did the world a great service.\n  If it is a bad deal, if Senator Rubio is right that they want to \ncheck the box and get a deal for the sake of getting a deal, I hope my \nDemocratic colleagues would stand and say: This will come back to bite \nus as a nation.\n  I have confidence the body can do this because I can't think of \nanything more serious we will vote on other than going to war.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. As the Senator from \nSouth Carolina noted, the relationship that exists between the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and the Senator from New Jersey, I believe, has \nreinvigorated the Foreign Relations Committee in a very incredible way. \nWhat has taken place, thanks to that bipartisanship and hard work, has \nreally been some remarkable results.\n  Frankly, thanks to the Senator's leadership and under the chairman, \nwe have been able to have a significant impact on the conduct of \nnational security in what I would argue is probably the greatest \nturmoil in my lifetime.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his great work.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I could, since the Senator and I have worked together \non the committee, the administration came to us when they didn't have \nto. They came to us on the authorization for the use of force in Syria. \nWe came together over a very short amount of time, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and crafted something of which I am very proud. It didn't \nend up coming to the floor because a different course of action was \ntaken, but the fact is that the administration sought our input on \nsomething that, as the Senator from South Carolina just mentioned, may \npale compared to the impact of this Iranian negotiation relative to \nnuclear arms.\n  So this is something that is very important. I agree with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina--I believe that if something is presented, we would \nact very much in the same manner. It would be a sober discussion. \nPeople would understand the importance of it. And I\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\nthink, from the administration's standpoint, the Senate saying grace \nover it and approving it gives him additional buy-in from the American \npeople that we are behind him if they negotiate a good deal. On the \nother hand, if they don't, obviously we should have the right to weigh \nin and keep the sanctions that have been put in place by us.\n  Everybody says: Well, the administration still has to come back and \ntalk with you all about sanctions.\n  That is not true. There is a waiver provision in there. They can't be \nundone permanently. But I think it gives us the appropriate say-so.\n  I thank the Senator so much for his leadership and for everybody's \ntime on the floor and for working on this issue. Hopefully, as the \nSenator mentioned, this will become something that is very bipartisan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4770-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 512--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND THE PROPOSED RULES AND GUIDELINES \n         RELATING TO CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Thune, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Boozman, \nMr. Coats, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Risch, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Moran, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Barrasso, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Toomey, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Lee, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. \nKirk) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 512\n\n       Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``EPA'') proposed rules entitled \n     ``Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing \n     Stationary Sources: Electric Generating Units'' (79 Fed. Reg. \n     34830 (June 18, 2014)), and ``Carbon Pollution Standards for \n     Modified and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric \n     Generating Units'' (79 Fed. Reg. 34960 (June 18, 2014)), in \n     furtherance of the President's Climate Action Plan of June \n     2013;\n       Whereas the proposed rules would result in a Federal \n     takeover of the electricity system of the United States \n     leading to significant increases in electricity rates and \n     additional energy costs for consumers and elimination of \n     access to abundant, affordable power, putting the \n     manufacturing of the United States at a competitive \n     disadvantage, threatening the diversity and reliability of \n     the electricity supply, and undermining energy security;\n       Whereas increased energy costs will, as always, fall most \n     heavily on the elderly, the poor, and individuals on fixed \n     incomes;\n       Whereas increased energy costs also result in job losses \n     and damage families, businesses, and local institutions such \n     as hospitals and schools;\n       Whereas in the haste of the Administration to drive coal \n     and eventually natural gas from the energy generation \n     portfolio, the Administration has gone beyond the plain \n     reading of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), \n     disregarding whether the EPA has the legal authority to \n     propose and finalize rules and guidelines that include \n     elements from the cap-and-trade program rejected by the \n     United States Senate in June 2008;\n       Whereas including emissions sources beyond the power plant \n     fence as opposed to only emissions sources inside the power \n     plant fence creates a cap-and-trade program;\n       Whereas the President noted in the wake of the initial \n     failure of the proposed cap-and-trade program, ``There are \n     many ways to skin a cat'', demonstrating that the \n     Administration seems determined to accomplish \n     administratively what fails to be achieved through the \n     legislative process;\n       Whereas at a time when manufacturers are shifting \n     production from overseas to the United States and investing \n     billions of dollars in the process, an Administration with a \n     poor management record decided to embark on a plan that will \n     result in energy rationing, pitting power plants against \n     refineries, chemical plants, and paper mills for the ability \n     to operate under the emissions requirements of the EPA;\n       Whereas after adopting similar carbon constraints, European \n     countries experienced skyrocketing energy costs, economic \n     decline, and a lower standard of living;\n       Whereas, on July 17, 2014, Australia repealed a carbon tax \n     because Australia found that the carbon tax eliminated jobs, \n     increased the cost of living for families, and did not \n     benefit the environment;\n       Whereas the proposed rules mandate renewable energy use and \n     initiate demand destruction to shrink energy production and \n     usage, which will result in reduced economic opportunity at \n     the State level, forcing States to pick winners and losers \n     and choose between economic growth and energy affordability;\n       Whereas history demonstrates that at the end of the \n     rulemaking process, the EPA will use its authority to \n     constrain State preferences on program design, potentially \n     even dictating policies that restrict when families of the \n     United States can do laundry or run the air-conditioning;\n       Whereas impositions by the EPA almost guarantee that costs \n     will be maximized and passed along to ratepayers, the size \n     and scope of the Federal government will expand, and the role \n     of the States in the system of cooperative federalism will \n     continue to diminish;\n       Whereas the EPA failed to provide a complete assessment of \n     the economic costs imposed by the proposed rules or the \n     benefits that may result;\n       Whereas benefits from the proposed rules (as measured by \n     reductions in global average temperature, reductions in the \n     rate of sea level rise, increases in sea ice, or any other \n     measurement related to climate change) will be essentially \n     zero;\n       Whereas, in 2009, former EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson \n     testified that ``U.S. action alone would not impact world \n     CO2 levels.'';\n       Whereas on June 18, 2014, former EPA Administrator William \n     Reilly testified that ``Absent action by China, Brazil, India \n     and other fast-growing economies, what we do alone will not \n     suffice.'';\n       Whereas China remains the largest emitter of carbon dioxide \n     in the world with increasing emissions rates;\n       Whereas China continues to pursue aggressive economic \n     growth, and estimates indicate that China will pass the \n     United States as the largest economy in the world by 2016;

Res. 515\n\n       Whereas chronic diseases impose high costs in the United \n     States in the forms of human capital, medical expenditures, \n     and economic productivity;\n       Whereas chronic diseases are the leading cause of \n     disability and death in the United States, and chronic \n     diseases account for 7 out of 10 deaths in the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 25 percent of individuals with a \n     chronic disease have some limitation on daily living \n     activities and may be restricted from working or attending \n     school;\n       Whereas chronic diseases account for $3 of every $4 spent \n     on health care in the United States, including--\n       (1) $432,000,000,000 spent annually on heart disease and \n     stroke;\n       (2) $174,000,000,000 spent annually on diabetes;\n       (3) $154,000,000,000 spent annually on lung disease; and\n       (4) $148,000,000,000 spent annually on Alzheimer's Disease;\n\n       Whereas the adoption of proactive healthy behaviors and \n     lifestyles by individuals will materially reduce the burden \n     of chronic diseases in the United States;\n       Whereas it is not possible to meet the enormous challenges \n     presented by chronic diseases, the aging of the population, \n     and other demographic changes without engaging individuals to \n     be active participants in maintaining their health and well-\n     being;\n       Whereas self-care can reduce the human and economic costs \n     of chronic diseases, help individuals achieve better overall \n     health, and prevent or delay many diseases;\n       Whereas self-care includes simple actions that individuals \n     can take for themselves and their families to stay healthy, \n     treat minor illnesses, and prevent or manage long-term \n     conditions;\n       Whereas self-care entails a lifelong habit and culture of--\n       (1) making healthy lifestyle choices on a daily basis;\n       (2) practicing good hygiene to prevent infection and \n     illness;\n       (3) avoiding unhealthy and risky actions;\n       (4) monitoring for signs and symptoms of changes in health;\n       (5) taking care of minor ailments; and\n       (6) knowing when to consult a doctor, pharmacist, or other \n     health care professional;\n       Whereas individuals need greater access to tools that \n     enable better self-care, including those that improve health \n     literacy, promote good nutrition and overall wellness, \n     facilitate physical activity, and prevent and manage chronic \n     diseases;\n       Whereas over-the-counter medicines (commonly known as \n     ``self-care medicines'' in other regions of the world) are \n     some of the most important self-care tools, and help \n     individuals improve wellness, treat everyday ailments, and \n     prevent chronic diseases;\n       Whereas every $1 spent on over-the-counter medicines in the \n     United States each year saves the health care system in the \n     United States $6 to $7, accounting for $102,000,000,000 in \n     annual savings relative to treatment alternatives;\n       Whereas self-care and the responsible use of over-the-\n     counter medicines can help individuals avoid unnecessary \n     visits to health care professionals, easing the burden on \n     those health care professionals;\n       Whereas self-care empowers individuals with higher self-\n     esteem, improves wellness, and reduces the use of health care \n     services;\n       Whereas individuals in the United States have not \n     sufficiently taken advantage of the potential of self-care to \n     improve health, reduce the burden of chronic disease, and \n     strengthen the sustainability of the health care system in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas achieving the full potential of self-care is the \n     shared responsibility of consumers, policymakers, regulators, \n     and health care professionals: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 24, 2014, as ``International Self-Care \n     Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of improving awareness of \n     self-care and the value self-care represents for the people \n     of the United States;\n       (3) encourages patients, government officials, health care \n     professionals, manufacturers and providers of medical \n     products, and the media to use ``International Self-Care \n     Day'' to highlight the benefits of self-care;

SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO THE NEED FOR LONG-\n                   TERM TRANSPORTATION FUNDING BILL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Highway Trust Fund is projected to become insolvent \n     before the end of fiscal year 2014.\n       (2) The user-fee principle upon which the Highway Trust \n     Fund was established is eroding as demonstrated by the fact \n     that since 2008 Congress has transferred $54,000,000,000 from \n     the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund.\n       (3) The gas tax and diesel tax, which are the primary \n     funding mechanisms for the Highway Trust Fund, have not been \n     increased since 1993 and are not indexed for inflation.\n       (4) Highway Trust Fund revenues have not kept pace with the \n     infrastructure needs of the United States, in significant \n     part due to a decline in miles driven, a decline in the \n     purchasing power of highway excise taxes, and increased fuel \n     efficiency.\n       (5) In 2013, according to the World Economic Forum Report \n     on Global Competitiveness, the United States was ranked 25th \n     globally in overall infrastructure quality.\n       (6) Short-term surface transportation extensions increase \n     costs of transportation projects, limit the ability of State \n     and local governments to plan infrastructure improvement, and \n     ultimately have resulted in the degradation of infrastructure \n     of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) any long-term transportation reauthorization bill \n     should at a minimum fund infrastructure spending levels \n     established in Senate authorizing legislation through fiscal \n     year 2020; and\n       (2) the Committee on Finance of the Senate and other \n     relevant committees of jurisdiction should work diligently to \n     produce long-term surface transportation reauthorization \n     legislation expeditiously.\n\n                    Subtitle C--Budgetary Provisions\n\n     SEC. 2041.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) the objective described in paragraph (1) has been \n     attained, and the Interstate System connecting all States is \n     near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the perceptions of the Federal Government on \n     what is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. __03. FUNDING LIMITATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines for any of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2020 that the aggregate amount required to \n     carry out transportation programs and projects under this \n     title and amendments made by this title exceeds the estimated \n     aggregate amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for \n     those programs and projects for the fiscal year, each amount \n     made available for that program or project shall be reduced \n     by the pro rata percentage required to reduce the aggregate \n     amount required to carry out those programs and projects to \n     an amount equal to that available for those programs and \n     projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. __04.

In addition to \n     influences on mental disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and \n     alcoholism, unemployment is also an important risk factor in \n     cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life \n     expectancy.'';\n       (F) according to the National Center for Health Statistics, \n     ``children in poor families were four times as likely to be \n     in fair or poor health as children that were not poor'';\n       (G) any major decision that would cost the economy of the \n     United States millions of dollars and lead to serious \n     negative health effects for the people of the United States \n     should be debated and explicitly authorized by Congress, not \n     approved by a Presidential memorandum or regulations; and\n       (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make United \n     States energy as clean as practicable, as quickly as \n     practicable, without increasing the cost of energy for \n     struggling families, seniors, low-income households, and \n     small businesses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that--\n       (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-income households, \n     and small businesses do not experience skyrocketing \n     electricity bills and joblessness;\n       (B) to protect the people of the United States, \n     particularly families, seniors, and children, from the \n     serious negative health effects of joblessness;\n       (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to develop and \n     authorize an appropriate mechanism to address the energy \n     needs of the United States and the potential challenges posed \n     by severe weather; and\n       (D) to restore the legislative process and congressional \n     authority over the energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not \n     promulgate any regulation relating to power sector carbon \n     pollution standards or any substantially similar regulation \n     on or after June 25, 2013, unless that regulation is \n     explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n                          Subtitle B--Permits\n\n     SEC. 221.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) record volumes of natural gas production in the United \n     States as of the date of enactment of this Act are providing \n     enormous benefits to the United States, including by--\n       (A) reducing the need for imports of natural gas, thereby \n     directly reducing the trade deficit;\n       (B) strengthening trade ties among the United States, \n     Canada, and Mexico;\n       (C) providing the opportunity for the United States to join \n     the emerging global gas trade through the export of liquefied \n     natural gas;\n       (D) creating and supporting millions of new jobs across the \n     United States;\n       (E) adding billions of dollars to the gross domestic \n     product of the United States every year;\n       (F) generating additional Federal, State, and local \n     government tax revenues; and\n       (G) revitalizing the manufacturing sector by providing \n     abundant and affordable feedstock;\n       (2) large quantities of natural gas are lost due to venting \n     and flaring, primarily in areas where natural gas \n     infrastructure has not been developed quickly enough, such as \n     States with large quantities of Federal land and Indian land;\n       (3) permitting processes can hinder the development of \n     natural gas infrastructure, such as pipeline lines and \n     gathering lines on Federal land and Indian land; and\n       (4) additional authority for the Secretary of the Interior \n     to approve natural gas pipelines and gathering lines on \n     Federal land and Indian land would--\n       (A) assist in bringing gas to market that would otherwise \n     be vented or flared; and\n       (B) significantly increase royalties collected by the \n     Secretary of the Interior and disbursed to Federal, State, \n     and tribal governments and individual Indians.\n\n     SEC. 203.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Building \n     and Renewing Infrastructure for Development and Growth in \n     Employment Act'' or the ``BRIDGE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 302. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) infrastructure has always been a vital element of the \n     economic strength of the United States and a key indicator of \n     the international leadership of the United States;\n       (2) the Erie Canal, the Hoover Dam, the railroads, and the \n     interstate highway system are all testaments to the ingenuity \n     of the United States and have helped propel and maintain the \n     United States as the largest economy in the world;\n       (3) according to the 2013-2014 World Economic Forum's \n     Global Competitiveness Report, the United States--\n       (A) ranked fifth in the world on the Global Competitiveness \n     Index; and\n       (B) ranked 19th in the world in the ``Quality of overall \n     infrastructure'' category;\n       (4) according to the World Bank's 2012 Logistic Performance \n     Index, the capacity of countries to efficiently move goods \n     and connect manufacturers and consumers with international \n     markets is improving around the world, and the United States \n     now ranks ninth in the world in logistics-related \n     infrastructure behind countries from both Europe and Asia;\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\n       (5) according to a January 2009 report from the University \n     of Massachusetts/Alliance for American Manufacturing entitled \n     ``Employment, Productivity and Growth'', infrastructure \n     investment is a ``highly effective engine of job creation'' \n     such that $1,000,000,000 in new investment in infrastructure \n     results in 18,000 total long-term jobs;\n       (6) according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, \n     the current condition of the infrastructure in the United \n     States earns a grade point average of D+, and an estimated \n     $1,600,000,000,000 of additional investment is needed over \n     the next 7 years to bring the infrastructure of the United \n     States up to adequate condition;\n       (7) according to the National Surface Transportation Policy \n     and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed \n     annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade \n     the United States surface transportation system to a state of \n     good repair and create a more advanced system;\n       (8) the current infrastructure financing mechanisms of the \n     United States, both on the Federal and State level, will fail \n     to meet current and foreseeable demands and will create large \n     funding gaps;\n       (9) published reports state that there may not be enough \n     demand for municipal bonds to maintain the same level of \n     borrowing at the same rates, resulting in significantly \n     decreased infrastructure investment at the State and local \n     level;\n       (10) current funding mechanisms are not readily scalable \n     and do not--\n       (A) serve large in-State or cross-jurisdictional \n     infrastructure projects, projects of regional or national \n     significance, or projects that cross sector silos;\n       (B) sufficiently catalyze private sector investment;

Mr. President, while presiding for a couple of hours \njust now I listened to some very powerful and eloquent debate organized \nby the Presiding Officer--I thank him for doing so--regarding the \nmigrant unaccompanied children who are coming across our border. Those \nremarks moved and inspired me. They were followed afterward by an \neffort by Senators Shaheen and others to bring to the floor a measure \non energy efficiency.\n  The connection between the two may not seem immediately apparent. \nBut, in fact, I was struck by the irony of an effort by some of our \ncolleagues to eliminate and repeal, in effect, a measure called the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. It is \nactually named the Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008, very symbolically and significantly named \nafter a leader who sought to abolish the slave trade.\n  Our colleagues who seek to repeal, in effect, that measure are \ncalling its provisions a ``loophole'' because it provides for screening \nof migrant children, such as those who are reaching our border, who are \nnot from the immediate bordering countries. They are from other Central \nAmerican countries. They are seeking to apply to them the same \nprocedures or lack of procedures, lack of screening, lack of individual \nconsideration that apply to migrant children from Canada and Mexico on \nthe theory that those provisions are a ``loophole'' in our law. In \nfact, those screening procedures are the very intent and substance of \nour law. They are meant to provide individual, careful, fair \nconsideration of each child.\n  On a day when consideration of the energy efficiency bill named for \nSenators Shaheen and Portman was blocked from consideration, colleagues \nare considering a measure and advocating a measure that is completely \nunnecessary. The Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill is vitally \nnecessary. The repeal of the Trafficking Victims Protection and \nReauthorization Act of 2008 is entirely unnecessary, in fact unhelpful \nand downright harmful.\n  The question of what to do about the flow of migrant children to our \nborder is one of profound importance for our Chamber and our country to \nface in the coming days and weeks.\n  I recently visited the border in a trip organized, thankfully, by \nSenator Hirono and joined by Senator Murkowski. We met Senator Cornyn \nwhile we were there. We went to various of the facilities to see for \nourselves and speak with the children who were coming to our borders, \nthe professionals who were seeking to care for them, the Border Patrol \nagents endeavoring to enforce the law, all of whom are involved in this \nsituation on the ground.\n  That experience has formed--I hesitate to say transformed, but it has \ncertainly changed my view of this problem, because we speak in this \nbody about these unaccompanied minors, as they are called, as though \nthey are an interchangeable mass. They are massive in numbers, but each \nis an individual. Each has a story to tell. Each is different.\n  They have in common, most of them, stories of horror and terror, \nvicious persecution, cruelty and brutality, rape, murder, and forced \nprostitution in the countries they are seeking to escape. This \nbrutality is spawned by gang\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\nwarfare, the result of conflict among gangs trading in drugs; cartels \nand organized crime that have put children in the middle of their \nmurderous activities.\n  As others during that eloquent colloquy organized by the Presiding \nOfficer observed, much of that drug trade has moved from Colombia to \nCentral America. It is fueled by demand, the same demand that fuels the \nColombian gang warfare, from the United States. The demand comes from \nthis country, the demand for those illicit drugs.\n  Those children, caught in the horrific violence plaguing their home, \nhave fled to this country seeking safety and security. Many of them are \nalso seeking their parents, because the majority have one or more \nparent in this country already. The vast majority have a close \nrelative, if not a parent, an aunt or uncle. So their journey seeks to \nreunify them with their families, as well as to escape the grisly, \ngrinding horror of their existence in those homelands they have left. \nThose journeys are plagued by the harshest, most inhumane of \nconditions: deserts, swamps and, most dangerously, the traffickers.\n  The smugglers who exploit them put them in stash houses, take them \nhostage, hold them for ransom, threaten their lives, and often rape and \nmurder them, preventing them from reaching this country. These faces \nare of the children I saw, with fear in their eyes, fear of all adults, \nbecause most of the adults in their lives have been a threat, not a \nprotector; fear in their eyes about the Border Patrol agents who are \nthere when they arrive at the loading dock at the McAllen border \nfacility. It is a loading dock where produce or goods might be dumped \nor left to be shipped elsewhere. They arrive at the loading dock and \nsit on a bench, fear in their eyes, apprehension in their voices.\n  They are then interviewed by the Border Patrol, who are wearing \nuniforms, looking like the authoritarian figures they are. In the lives \nof these children, the police are not a source of comfort, they are a \nsource of danger because in their country the police are corrupt and a \nthreat, not a protector.\n  They are not apprehended by the Border Patrol; they surrender to \nthem. Border security is not the issue. Again, as some of my colleagues \nremarked earlier, these children are coming in to give themselves up in \nthe hope of being taken into custody, fed, housed, and given some basic \nsecurity and safety.\n  Their numbers are down--anywhere from 30 to 50 percent down in July \nas compared to June, so we were told by the Border Patrol agent. \nWhether that is a temporary phenomenon or a trend remains to be seen, \nbut the numbers are down.\n  After this holding detention center, where they are kept in cement-\nfloor cellblocks, segregated by age and gender, so densely packed that \nthey can barely sit let alone lie down, and provided with foil \nblankets, they are sent to more permanent facilities, such as the \nLackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, where we also visited.\n  That facility has a dormitory, a health clinic, a school. Classes are \nconducted in tents, and the treatment is far more humane. They are \ngiven classes in English. They are eager--intensely eager--to learn \nEnglish, and they are taught in classrooms in these tents where there \nis a blackboard and an American flag outside an artificial turf soccer \nfield, where they are intensely eager to play soccer.\n  They stay there about 7 days to 3 weeks until they are moved to a \nhome because many of them have relatives. Most of them have some family \nmembers in this country or another facility. They move from one \ntemporary facility to a better one and then to a home.\n  In the second facility, they are in the custody of the HHS or the \nOffice of Refugee Settlement, not the Border Patrol. It is a better \nfacility, no question, but still rudimentary.\n  One of the most powerful moments of this trip was to watch these \nstudents--I would say about 20 of them in a class--show how they were \nlearning English, show the words they have learned and tell us where \nthey were from--Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador--and then to rise to \nshow us Senators how they could recite the Pledge of Allegiance. We \njoined with them in reciting that pledge. I wish my colleagues--I wish \nevery American could have been there at that moment. There was \nsomething basic, fundamental about us as Americans in that moment, \nabout what we offer--hope, opportunity, freedom, and protection--to \npeople who come here with that aspiration, that those children \nepitomized at that moment. Whether you agree or disagree on what should \nbe done, whether you feel we ought to do something differently with \nthese children, that moment evoked a fundamental value in our society.\n  Another moment did as well--when a busload arrived. As we were about \nto leave, the staff of that facility lined up on both sides of the \nchildren coming off the bus into the facility, clapping for them. The \nstaff was clapping and cheering for these children arriving at the \nfacility, after leaving the border crossing where they were under the \ncustody of the Border Patrol agents. They were clapping and cheering \nfor children who recently arrived in this country, and the children \nwere beaming.\n  The staff and the professionals who care for these children are truly \nto be thanked. They are dedicated professionals--the Border Patrol \nagents who do their very best to make these kids feel at home under \nvery adverse conditions; the HHS counselors and teachers who seek to \ninterview them, give them some basic hope and comfort; all of the \nprofessionals in the Office of Refugee Resettlement who seek against \nthe odds to provide them with a future.\n  The mayor of McAllen, who runs a small town on the border--which is \nwhere that border crossing is, where the McAllen facility is housed--I \nthink many of us expected him to complain to us about the burden of \nthis flood of children coming into his town, the expenditure of \nresources necessary to support the infrastructure, the burden on him \nand his fellow townspeople. To the contrary, the mayor of McAllen, Jim \nDarling, said to us that they welcome these children. They regard the \nborder as part of their home. They have an interchange in culture and \nfamily.\n\n  He said to us, in effect--I don't remember whether they were his \nexact words--about welcoming these children: This is what we do. We are \nAmericans. This is what we do. We are Americans--not asking for \nreimbursement for the expenses for his town, although it is a \nsignificant part of his budget. Comparable to the Federal Government, \nit would be in the billions. His budget is much smaller, so the \nproportion, obviously, is much less, but it is a major fiscal burden on \nMcAllen.\n  Mayor Jim Darling impressed us and inspired us with his willingness \nto welcome these children--at least to care for them while the law is \nenforced. That is the point I want to emphasize to my colleagues \ntonight.\n  What is needed is not a repeal of the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008. What is needed is not to send these \nchildren back without screening or consideration. What is needed is not \na wholesale closing of due process. It is enforcement of that law, \nresources to enforce that law, resources to provide the immigration \njudges and the advocates who are so desperately needed for these \nchildren. After all, they look at any authoritarian figure with fear, \neven the teachers, many of them, as well as the border agents who seek \nto elicit from them those stories about why they fled their home. They \nfear retaliation from anyone who might learn they are talking about the \nreasons they left. They need spokespeople for this process, and they \nneed the individual consideration, child by child by child. That is \nwhat the law requires. That law should be enforced, not repealed.\n  Enforcement also means border security. It means better facilities \nwhile they are under care of the Department of HHS as well as the \nBorder Patrol. It means that we support State officials if they provide \nState facilities. Those decisions about where, when, and how many \nshould be made by State officials, but the Federal Government can \nsupport them.\n  That is why I thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership on the \nsupplemental, as well as the Presiding Officer for his leadership in \norganizing the colloquy earlier today because raising awareness, as \nwell as resources, is what is necessary to make sure we reunite these \nchildren with their families when, in fact, their request for asylum is \njustified child by child, justified by\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\nthe facts and the evidence, upheld by due process, by justice and by \nfairness--not demonizing, as may be done by calling out the National \nGuard or denouncing children who are doing nothing more--6-, 7-, 8-, 9-\n, 10-year-olds--than seeking safety and security.\n  Their courage, as well as their resilience, finally, was inspiring as \nwell. Having crossed so many miles, against so many obstacles, in the \nface of so many threats, their smiles as they recited the Pledge of \nAllegiance to the United States of America is the picture I will have \nin advocating a bipartisan solution, long-term immigration reform, and \na fair and just resolution to their fight as they seek freedom and \nsecurity in our great Nation, the greatest country in the history of \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/23/senate-section/article/S4848-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 24, 2014\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.
