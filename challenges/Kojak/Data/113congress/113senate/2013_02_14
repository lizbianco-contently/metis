Mr. President, in less than 2 hours our country will be \nwithout a Secretary of Defense at a time when we have a war going on in \nAfghanistan and about 70,000 troops there. We have a nuclear weapon \nwhich was detonated in North Korea a few days ago. They are \nthreatening, as they have publicly on other occasions, but after this \nbomb was set off, that they are doing it to attack us. We have this \nsituation in Iran with all their very militaristic statements against \nus.\n  All over the world America is involved in matters dealing with our \nmilitary. I met the night before last in my office with the man who \nkilled Osama bin Laden. I talked to him about his 16-year career as a \nSEAL and the places he went around the world protecting the interests \nof the United States. It wasn't just in Afghanistan, not only in \nPakistan, but all over the world.\n  To think we have now in the Senate a situation where we are going to \nwind up without a Secretary of Defense at this time. We had all the \ntalk--you know, we have some questions about Senator Hagel.\n  Keep in mind he is a Republican. They say: We have some questions to \nask. But publicly a significant number of Republican Senators have said \nthey would not filibuster.\n  Remember, there has never in the history of the country been a \nfilibuster of a Defense Secretary nominee--never.\n  I needed to file cloture. Not all the shows, but a number of shows, \nattacked me last night. They said: We told Reid and all these people we \nshouldn't have agreed to the rules changes because this is what we have \ngoing on.\n  I am ignoring that, but it is shocking that my Republican colleagues \nwould leave the Nation without a fully empowered Secretary of Defense \nduring all the things we have going on in the world, including a war. \nSeveral of my colleagues requested a letter from the President. A \nletter was sent at their request to the chairman of the committee, \nwhich is standard procedure, with Senator Levin answering all their \nquestions.\n  They said: We need that letter so we may vote. One stall after \nanother. I am told now that the letter was sent to the chairman of the \ncommittee, and that is not good enough. They want it sent to individual \nSenators.\n  This isn't high school getting ready for a football game or some play \nthat is being produced at high school, we are trying to confirm \nsomebody to run the defense of our country, the military of\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\nour country. That letter was received yesterday about 4 o'clock, and \nnow they have indicated they want something else.\n  A committee of jurisdiction, the Armed Services Committee, has \nextensive information on Chuck Hagel. They have as much information \nthat is available on the Benghazi situation: testimony from \nadministration officials, from multiple committees, and from an \nindependent review board. Secretary Clinton testified; Secretary \nPanetta, who is going to be leaving his job in less than 2 hours; \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, Martin Dempsey; and others have all \ntestified regarding the attack that claimed four American lives. Chuck \nHagel had nothing to do with the attack in Benghazi. Stating the \nadministration hasn't been forthcoming is outlandish.\n  There are serious consequences to this delay, consequences that are \noccurring right now.\n\n  The President is making some important decisions about Afghanistan. \nHe announced to the world just a day or two ago that 34,000 troops will \nbe coming home during the next year from Afghanistan. We are \nnegotiating with the Afghan Government regarding how we will support \nthem beyond 2014. Negotiations are going on right now.\n  I heard today from former Senator John Kerry that he is headed for \nthe Middle East. Why? Syria. That is something else the Secretary of \nDefense has to be concerned about.\n  Next week while we are on recess--while we are on recess--they are \nhaving a NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels about what to do to \ncoordinate our approach on Afghanistan and the rest of our obligations \nas members of NATO. It is going to be somewhat unusual that the United \nStates isn't represented by the Secretary of Defense. We will not have \none if we don't get this done this week.\n  I am sure they are going to focus on how to end the war responsibly \nin Afghanistan, how our alliance will work together through the time of \ntransition, and how we can ensure Afghanistan doesn't become a safe \nhaven for al-Qaida again. We need a Secretary of Defense at that \nmeeting. It sends a terrible signal to the hundreds of thousands of \ntroops we have around the world and the military personnel in the \nUnited States that we are not going to have a Secretary of Defense.\n  Republicans are telling our troops: Well, you may have a leader \nlater. What is going on in Europe, the Brussels conference, doesn't \nreally matter.\n  It sends a terrible signal not only to our military personnel but to \nthe world.\n  He has answered exhaustive questions about his record. He has the \nsupport of the President of the United States.\n  I heard a lot of speeches from the other side saying the President \nshould have the right to choose whomever he wants. He has the support \nof this body, the majority vote in this body, and this democracy. We \nare a nation at war. We are, whether we like it or not, the world's \nindispensable leader. We are.\n  For the sake of our national security it is time to put aside this \npolitical theater, and that is what it is. People are worried about \nprimary elections. We know how the tea party goes after Republicans \nwhen they aren't conservative enough. Is that something they need to \nhave on their resume: I filibustered one of the President's nominees? \nIs that what they want?\n  The filibuster of Senator Hagel's nomination is unprecedented. I \nrepeat, not a single nominee for Secretary of Defense of our country \nhas ever been filibustered--never, ever. As we all know, in a matter of \ndays across-the-board cuts are going to take place, and it will affect \ndefense to the tune of $600 billion. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a \nSecretary of Defense to work things out?\n  Leon Panetta, after more than 30 years of service to this country--\nCongress, chairman of the Budget Committee, OMB, the President's Chief \nof Staff, head of the CIA, Secretary of Defense--after all these years \nhas gone home to his farm, his family in California.\n  We do not have, as of 12 o'clock today, a Secretary of Defense. These \nacross-the-board cuts are going to be very difficult. The Pentagon \nneeds a leader to oversee and manage historic cuts and ensure they are \nmade in a responsible way.\n  A moment about Hagel. He was an enlisted man in the Vietnam war. He \ndidn't have to go; he enlisted. The story of Senator Hagel is not a \nlegend, it is true. He was a heroic warrior. He was an infantryman. He \nsaved his brother's life.\n  When he was a Senator here the picture he had was of him and his \nbrother in Vietnam on a personnel carrier. He is proud of his service. \nHe should be. He was wounded two times, an infantry squad leader, and a \nman of integrity and dedication who has a deep understanding of our \nnational security establishment. This came not only from his military \nservice but as a Senator, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nand a member of the Intelligence Committee. He has been a member of the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.\n  At a time when America faces so many threats--I have outlined just a \nfew of them--all across the world our Nation needs a man of Senator \nHagel's combination of strategic and personal knowledge. We need a \nSecretary of Defense. It is tragic that they have decided to filibuster \nthis qualified nominee. It is really unfortunate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S722-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In just 15 days significant across-the-board cuts are \nset to take effect unless the President and the Senate Democrats come \nup with a plan to replace them with smarter, targeted spending \nreductions. The President and the Senate majority have known about this \ndeadline for more than a year. Yet here we are just days before the so-\ncalled sequester is set to hit, and a familiar scenario is playing out \nonce again. It goes something like this:\n  Phase 1. Republicans identify a challenge and actually propose a \nsolution.\n  Phase 2. Liberals sit on their hands until the last minute.\n  Phase 3. They offer some gimmicky tax hike designed to fail and then \nblame everybody else when it does.\n  Phases 1 and 2 have gone exactly according to plan. House Republicans \nproposed and passed plans to replace the sequester months ago. As if on \ncue, Senate Democrats have doggedly refused to consider any of them, \nmuch less offer any of their own. Here we are again at phase 3. That \nmeans it is now time for them to swoop in with the gimmick.\n\n  That is why our friends on the other side have been huddled behind \nclosed doors with pollsters and PR spinmeisters. They have been busy \ndevising the most appealing-sounding tax hikes they can think of.\n  Don't believe me? Just watch what happens now. Later today, Senate \nDemocrats are expected to roll out the gimmick. Remember, this is not a \nsolution. Even they know it can't pass. But that is the idea. It is a \npolitical stunt designed to mask the fact they have offered no \nsolutions and don't plan to offer any solutions. It is a total waste of \ntime.\n  For nearly 2 months, I have been coming to the floor to ask Senate \nDemocrats to work with us on a bill that could pass both Houses of \nCongress. If they were the least bit serious about a solution, they \nhave had more than a year to write a bill in committee, bring it to the \nfloor, vote on amendments, get it to the House and fix this.\n  Instead, they have waited right up until the moment of crisis, just \nas they always do, and then they get together not with the goal of \nfinding a solution but to hatch an escape plan aimed at making \nRepublicans look like the bad guys. Their whole goal here isn't to \nsolve the problem, it is to have a show vote that is designed to fail, \ncall it a day, and wait for someone else to pick up the pieces.\n  My message this morning is quite simple: There won't be any easy off-\nramps on this one. The days of eleventh hour negotiations are over. \nWashington Democrats have gotten used to Republicans bailing them out \nof their own lack of responsibility. But those days have passed. Look, \nthey run the Senate; they run the White House. It is time they started \nacting like it.\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\n  As a first step, Senate Democrats need to honor their pledge to \nreturn to regular order. Legislation that passes through this Chamber \nshould be written with input from both parties. It should get a fair \npublic vetting in committee, and Senators should get a chance to offer \namendments. Just yesterday, the President's own Treasury nominee called \nfor a return to regular order.\n  So it is time for the President and Senate Democrats to put the games \nand gimmicks aside. It is time they stopped waiting until the last \nminute to get things done around here. People are tired of it. I know \nmy constituents in Kentucky are certainly tired of it. They have had \nenough of the political theater. It is time to put the stunts aside and \nactually work on real solutions. That is what we were sent here to do, \nand we should do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S723-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Department of Defense. Nomination of Charles Timothy Hagel, \n     of Nebraska, to be Secretary.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has been suggested that the Senate \nshould not move forward with Senator Hagel's nomination, alleging he \nhas not complied with requests that he produce speeches. In fact, the \nstandard committee questionnaire requires nominees to provide a copy of \n``any formal speeches you have delivered during the last 5 years of \nwhich you have copies.'' Senator Hagel complied with this requirement \nbefore his hearing 2 weeks ago.\n  Before the hearing, a number of requests were received from \nRepublican Members that Senator Hagel seek and obtain and provide to \nthe committee some transcripts of additional speeches. In fact, \nhundreds of pages of transcripts were, in fact, supplied to the \ncommittee before the hearing, in addition to those he had submitted in \nresponse to the committee questionnaire.\n  Since then, we have received two additional requests for specific \nspeeches, and in each case we forwarded to Senator Hagel the requests. \nHe sought and provided transcripts of speeches for which he had no \nprepared remarks and of which he had no copies. So he has responded to \nthose requests, and where he was able to obtain a transcript or a video \nof the speech from the organization he addressed, he provided a copy. \nWhere no such materials existed, he told us that was the case.\n  Senator Hagel was informed that a video of his remarks existed in one \nof those cases but that the organization had been unable to find it. \nThe organization has now located the video, and it will be provided to \nthe majority and minority staffs of the committee today.\n  In the last few days there has been some finding of transcripts or \nvideos that have surfaced on the Internet--a handful of 2008 and 2009 \nspeeches that Senator Hagel did not recollect. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of links to the Web transcripts or Web videos and a \nlist of Senator Hagel's potentially relevant Senate speeches that are a \npart of the Congressional Record from 2008 be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Hagel stated in his financial \ndisclosure that he received $200,000 from Corsair Capital, which is a \nprivate equity firm, and he was a member of its advisory board. It has \nbeen alleged that Senator Hagel failed to provide complete financial \ndisclosure, despite the admitted lack of evidence of any kind, and a \nhighly negative innuendo was dropped by one of our colleagues which \nsaid that, and I quote, ``it is, at a minimum, relevant to know if that \n$200,000''--referring to those fees from Corsair Capital--``that \n[Senator Hagel] deposited in his bank account came directly from Saudi \nArabia, [or] . . . from North Korea. . . .'' Without any evidence of \nany kind, that kind of innuendo has been dropped here. It is \ninappropriate, unfair, untrue.\n  Senator Hagel has provided the same financial disclosure and met the \nsame conflict of interest standards that the committee requires of all \nprevious nominees. As I explained in a February 8, 2013, letter to my \nranking member, Senator Inhofe:\n\n       Our committee has a well-defined set of financial \n     disclosure and ethics requirements which apply to all \n     nominees for civilian positions in the Department of Defense. \n     . . . We have applied these disclosure requirements and \n     followed this process for all nominees of both parties \n     throughout the 16 years that I have served as Chairman or \n     Ranking Minority Member of the [Armed Services] committee. I \n     understand that the same financial disclosure requirements \n     and processes were followed for at least the previous 10 \n     years, during which Senator Sam Nunn served as Chairman or \n     Ranking Minority Member.\n\n  And I added:\n\n       During this period, the committee has confirmed eight \n     Secretaries of Defense (Secretaries Carlucci, Cheney, Aspin, \n     Perry, Cohen, Rumsfeld, Gates, and Panetta), as well as \n     hundreds of nominees for other senior civilian positions in \n     the Department. . . . The committee cannot have two different \n     sets of financial disclosure standards for nominees--one for \n     Senator Hagel and one for other nominees.\n\n  As required by the Senate Armed Services Committee and by the Ethics \nin Government Act, Senator Hagel has disclosed all compensation over \n$5,000 that he has received in the last 2 years. As required by the \nArmed Services Committee, he has received letters from the Director of \nthe Office of Government Ethics and the Acting Department of Defense \nGeneral Counsel certifying that he has met all applicable financial \ndisclosure and conflict of interest requirements.\n  As required by the Armed Services Committee, he has answered a series \nof questions about possible foreign affiliations. Among other \nquestions, the committee asks whether during the last 10 years the \nnominee or his spouse has ``received any compensation from, or been \ninvolved in any financial or business transactions with, a foreign \ngovernment or an entity controlled by a foreign government.'' And \nSenator Hagel's answer was ``No.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the recitation. \nBasically what the Senator is saying is that all the rules that were in \nplace for nominees to the Department of Defense under Republican \nPresidents are being followed for Senator Hagel. But there are some who \nwant to go beyond those and create new rules beyond those for Vice \nPresident Cheney when he was Secretary or Donald Rumsfeld or Gates or \nany of the other Secretaries of Defense. The Senator is saying some now \nwant to do something different for this nominee of President Obama's \nthan the practices they found totally acceptable for the nominees of \nPresident Bush?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. A number of our colleagues have \nmade that demand, and it is simply not something on which we are going \nto set a precedent. It is not the way to proceed in this body.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I stand with the Senator from Michigan. In the Judiciary \nCommittee, we follow the same procedure for our judicial nominees \nregardless of the party of the President who nominates them. If we \nbegin switching the rules depending upon who is President--well, if we \nthink the American public holds Congress in low esteem right now, it is \ngoing to get even\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\nworse. So I compliment the Senator for sticking to the rules.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Vermont.\n  Just to complete my statement on the financial part, this is relative \nto the fees he received when he was on the advisory board of Corsair \nCapital.\n  This is a company he does not control. He is not in a position to \nrequire that it disclose anything. The other members of the advisory \nboard--all of whom are identified, by the way, on the company's Web \nsite--include the chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, who is a \nlaureate of the 2002 Israel Prize in Economics and a recipient of the \nScopus Award from Hebrew University. Other members of the advisory \nboard: the former director of investments for Yale University and the \nformer chairman of the Financial Services Authority, which is \nresponsible for regulating the insurance industry in the United \nKingdom. So the innuendo that Corsair Capital is somehow a puppet \nentity that is funneling tainted money to members of its advisory board \nis unfair. It is totally inappropriate.\n\n  Senator Inhofe said yesterday that he is not filibustering this \nnomination. He is just insisting on a 60-vote requirement for Senate \napproval. And he said it is not unusual to insist on 60 votes for the \napproval of a nominee and this was done during the Bush administration \nfor the nomination of Stephen Johnson to be EPA Administrator and the \nnomination of Dirk Kempthorne to be Secretary of the Interior.\n  Well, the Senate rules do not provide for 60-vote approval of \nnominations or any other matter. These rules establish a 60-vote \nrequirement to invoke cloture and end debate. If 60 votes are required \nhere, it is because there is filibuster. There is no 60-vote \nrequirement for the approval of a nomination, and the two examples \ncited by Senator Inhofe actually prove this point. On the nomination of \nStephen Johnson, cloture was invoked by a 61-to-37 vote on April 29, \n2005. On the nomination of Dirk Kempthorne, cloture was invoked by an \n85-to-8 vote on May 26, 2006. But--and this is the point--after the \ndebate was ended by those votes on cloture, the nominations were \nconfirmed by regular votes of this body. And those regular votes are \neither a voice vote or a majority vote on a rollcall vote.\n  So that history is, again, an example of how the Senate operates. \nSixty votes is not required to approve a bill or approve a nomination. \nIf a matter is being filibustered, 60 votes is required to end the \ndebate, and then, if the debate is ended, there is a vote on a \nnomination or a bill.\n  No nomination for the position of Secretary of Defense has ever \nbefore been filibustered. This filibuster breaks new ground. The \nfilibuster of a nomination for Secretary of Defense is the first one \nunder any circumstances, and it is unwise. The Department is facing a \nbudget crisis that was described as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 by the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So a filibuster at this time of \na budget crisis is exceptionally ill-advised. Leaving the Department of \nDefense leaderless at a time when we are in an Afghan conflict, when \nNorth Korea has just exploded a nuclear device is exceptionally ill-\nadvised. And perhaps most important, having a Department of Defense \nthat does not have a new Secretary confirmed is unfair to the men and \nwomen in uniform. It sends them exactly the wrong message, as it does \nto our friends and our adversaries around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n ADDITIONAL SPEECHES AND EVENTS BY CHUCK HAGEL THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THE\n                                INTERNET\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDecember 4, 2008............

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud what Senator Levin has said about \nSenator Hagel. If you made a list of the qualifications of the perfect \nSecretary of Defense, it would look like the resume of Chuck Hagel. If \nyou look past the partisan posturing of some, I think the American \npublic supports his confirmation as Secretary of Defense.\n  I worry that this partisan posturing adds to the low opinion \nAmericans have of both the House and Senate. This is not the way we \nshould be doing the country's business.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of \nDefense and urge all Senators to support him. We are at a time of \nfiscal austerity. We all understand that. But we need a leader at the \nPentagon, one who understands what it takes to maintain the strongest \nmilitary force in the world.\n  Senator Hagel is a former enlisted soldier. He understands defense \npolicy and practice from the ground up. He is the leader we need as \nSecretary of Defense. He is experienced by any measure. Like thousands \nof people he will lead at the Pentagon, he has earned a combat \ninfantryman's badge. These qualifications are not abstract. He has two \nPurple Hearts from combat service in Vietnam. He still carries shrapnel \nin his body from those injuries.\n  On any issue having to do with the U.S. military, I have long valued \nthe firsthand experience of Chuck Hagel. But this service alone is not \nwhat makes him qualified. He has been a leader in the public and \nprivate sectors. He cofounded Vanguard Cellular Systems, a successful \ncellular carrier in the 1980s and 1990s. He was president and CEO of \nthe USO and the chief operating officer of the 1990 G7 Summit. He \nserved as president of an investment bank, on the boards of some of the \nworld's largest companies, and as a two-term U.S. Senator. He is \nclearly a qualified nominee.\n  Since his nomination was announced last month, some have questioned \nSenators Hagel's position on a number of issues--notably, his support \nfor Israel. Well, as recently as his confirmation hearings, he has \nreaffirmed his long record of support for Israel. In January, Danny \nAyalon, the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister and former Israeli \nAmbassador to the United States, affirmed what he sees as Senator \nHagel's commitment to the unique U.S.-Israeli relationship. As a member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Hagel supported the \nauthorization of almost $40 billion in aid to Israel. In a 2008 book, \nSenator Hagel wrote that, ``there will always be a special and historic \nbond with Israel exemplified by our continued commitment to Israel's\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\ndefense.'' He also wrote that that there can be no compromise on \nIsrael's identity as a Jewish state. He has affirmed the U.S. \ncommitment to Israel's security and Israel's right to defend itself \nagainst aggression. These are just a few examples, but by any objective \nmeasure, Senator Hagel is committed to the mutual interests of the \nUnited States and Israel.\n  Attacks suggesting that Senator Hagel is soft on Iran are also \nbaseless. Through all my conversations with Senator Hagel, I have never \nonce doubted his belief in the President's responsibility to build \nalliances and exhaust all available means to achieve our foreign policy \ngoals through diplomacy. But he also believes that aggressive actions \nby us against a foreign government should be strategic. There is not a \nshred of evidence to support claims that he supports a nuclear Iran, or \nthat he does not support the President's efforts--unilateral or \nmultilateral--to bring Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear \nprogram. He has reaffirmed that he believes in keeping all options on \nthe table, including force if necessary, to prevent Iran from obtaining \na nuclear weapon. Senator Hagel supports the sanctions against Iran \nalready in place. He has affirmed the need to keep military action on \nthe table. He supported the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of \n1997, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, and the Iran Freedom \nSupport Act of 2006. Any assertion that Senator Hagel accepts Iran's \nnuclear program is false.\n  Then there are the bogus, inflammatory claims that Senator Hagel is \nsoft on terrorism. Nothing could be further from the truth. He has not \nhesitated to call Hezbollah and Hamas what they are--terrorist \norganizations. He condemned Iran's support of Hezbollah and cosponsored \nthe Senate resolution demanding that Hamas recognize Israel's right to \nexist. He also supported the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, a \nmultilateral effort to force Hamas to recognize Israel, renounce \nviolence, disarm itself, and accept prior agreements with Israel.\n  I have traveled with Senator Hagel to different parts of the world, \ncombat areas and areas of great security concern to the United States. \nI have sat in meetings with him as he spoke with our military and \nintelligence officials. Please excuse me if I am somewhat vague, since \nmost of these meetings were of a highly classified nature, but I can \nsay this: he asked tough questions and always kept the security \ninterests of the United States foremost at hand with both U.S. security \nofficials and also with the leaders of other countries. Senators who \nwere with us of both parties commented to me afterward how impressed \nthey were with the way Senator Hagel conducted these meetings.\n  In this time of talk of across the board budget cuts, some have \nsuggested that Senator Hagel would recklessly weaken the defense \nbudget. Nothing in Chuck Hagel's record supports that. He resigned as \nDeputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration over what he \nconsidered to be inappropriate budget cuts.\n  He opposes cuts that would weaken our security. He vigorously opposes \nsequestration, which has been rightly compared to cutting with a meat \ncleaver. Like Secretary Panetta and Secretary Gates, Chuck Hagel \nbelieves the Pentagon has a role to play in deficit reduction but not \nat the expense of keeping our military the preeminent fighting force in \nthe world. He says that reductions must be smart and strategic. I \nagree. I am confident that our men and women in uniform will have no \nstronger advocate and that our Nation will have a solid defender in \nChuck Hagel.\n  Senator Hagel, who has seen combat from the perspective of an \nenlisted member of our Armed Forces, sees our military as the last \nresort, not the first resort in international relations. Those who have \nbeen in combat, from President Eisenhower on until today, have taken \nthat same position. No matter what any detractor may say, his is sound \npolicy.\n  Matters of war and peace are matters of life and death. Those who sit \nin boardrooms or in easy chairs and say: Let's commit our soldiers here \nand our soldiers there--they are not the ones going. By and large, it \nis not their family members risking their lives. We need a Secretary of \nDefense who knows what it is like to go and to face combat and to be \nwounded. Should we commit our troops when it is necessary for our \ndefense? Of course. That is why we have troops. But let's recognize \nthat such decisions come at great human cost.\n  Senator Hagel, a decorated veteran who still walks with the shrapnel \nfrom his wounds in Vietnam, understands that a decision to go to war is \na decision to send our sons and daughters, husbands and wives, fathers \nand mothers into harm's way. It is his deep, visceral understanding of \nthis fact, his record of experience, his patriotism, and his dedication \nto this Nation that qualify him to be the next Secretary of Defense.\n  We should have the vote and confirm this patriotic American hero. \nLet's not hide behind a filibuster. Let's have the courage to vote yes \nor vote no. Do not hide behind parliamentary tricks. Do not vote maybe. \nThe American people elected us to vote yes or vote no. When you want to \nset up a filibuster rule on something, you are basically saying: Let's \nvote maybe. That is hardly a profile in courage and certainly not the \nkind of courage we would expect from a Secretary of Defense. So vote \nyes or vote no. But however you vote, let's do it without delay. I will \nvote yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Mandatory Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, earlier this week I outlined four main \ntopics that I hoped to hear the President discuss in his State of the \nUnion Address. Today, I would like to talk in more detail about one of \nthose items and perhaps the most challenging--restructuring Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security to preserve them for current and future \ngenerations.\n  In Washington, these three programs fall into the category of \nmandatory spending, meaning they are not contingent on annual \ncongressional review or funding. Instead, they are based on formulas \nthat have already been written into law, and therefore this spending \noccurs automatically, as if it is on autopilot. So, anyone who becomes \neligible for the program based on the requirements in the law \nautomatically qualifies for the benefits. We do not have the ability on \na year-to-year basis to review or change this. We can only make \nstructural changes and reforms to the program as necessary.\n  Today these items make up a majority of the government's annual \nbudget. This is because when these programs were implemented they did \nnot take into account the remarkable and wonderful increase in the \nlifespan of Americans, nor the impact of the post-World War II baby \nboom generation reaching the point of retirement age, which is now at \nthe level of about 10,000 retirements each and every day of the year. \nThat is putting an enormous strain on the overall budget and the amount \nin proportion to the budget that goes for funding these mandatory \nprograms.\n  After World War II and after a long decade of depression, Americans \nsaw a bright new future. They came home from the war. They began to \nstart families. Millions upon millions of children were born in the \npost-war period up until the earlier 1960s. This is the so-called baby \nboom generation.\n  Initially, when they were born, certain industries came into play. If \nyou were in the diaper business, suddenly you were in a boom business \nor cribs and strollers and then tricycles and bicycles. These children \nmoved on to the age where they began to enter elementary school, and we \nbuilt schools all over the country to accommodate this growth in our \npopulation working their way through the system. Then it was junior \nhighs and then we needed to enlarge our high schools, and new colleges \nand universities sprung up across the land, too. Upon graduation, they \nfound jobs, and it was time to start their own families--housing \nboomed.\n  Throughout the whole lifespan of this baby boom generation, there \nhave been enormous economic changes to adapt to this massive amount of \npeople working their way through life and becoming such an integral \npart of the American dream and American history.\n  We often talk now about this issue in cold hard facts because this \ngeneration\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\nis reaching retirement age, moving into retirement and qualification, \nfor Social Security and Medicare coverage in massive numbers--10,000 or \nmore a day. But when we are talking about it in just cold hard facts \nand numbers, we tend to ignore the impact of these programs in a much \nmore personal way on our American public.\n  Becoming eligible for the programs we are talking about means access \nto health care during a more difficult time of life. Perhaps you are no \nlonger covered by your employer because you have made the decision to \nretire or reached retirement age. There are health care issues as we \nage that we wish did not happen, but they come on in ever-increasing \nintensity. It means grandparents having enough money to travel to see \nthe kids and a new grandbaby. It means men and women who have worked \nhard all of their lives to provide for their families finally having \nthe financial freedom to take some time off to retire.\n  Hoosiers and Americans all across this land have paid into the system \nall through their working years. They rely on these health and \nretirement security programs and their benefits. These are honest, \nhard-working men and women who have been told that if they made \ncontributions through their paychecks to these programs, they would \nbecome eligible at a certain age for a certain standard of coverage. \nThey expect to receive that. So, the challenge before us today is to \nmake sure these benefits continue to be available to both current and \nfuture recipients. But, as we examine our Nation's current fiscal \nstate, we all need to come to terms with the fact that these programs \nwill not be available in their current form if we do not make some \nnecessary changes.\n  The Heritage Foundation reports that mandatory spending has increased \nat almost six times faster than all other spending. In other words, \nspending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is growing faster \nthan all of our spending on defense, education, infrastructure, medical \nresearch, food and drug safety, homeland security, and I do not begin \nto have the time to list all of the various functions of spending that \ngo toward reaching out and meeting the needs of this country.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported this month that \nspending on these programs and interest on the debt will consume 91 \npercent of all Federal revenues 10 years from now. Imagine our budget \nas being a big pie. It is cut in certain slices in terms of how much \nmoney is spent on defense, how much money is spent on mandatory \nprograms, and the amount of money that is spent on all of the other \nfunctions in which the Federal Government is engaged. That part of the \npie which provides for the automatically entitled mandatory spending \nbenefits is growing at a rate that is unsustainable.\n  It is ever shrinking the defense and nondiscretionary part--\neverything else we spend money. We spend too much money on too many \nthings so we are going to have to be very careful. I have talked about \nthis many times of how we spend and allocate funds in the future.\n  Unless we address this runaway mandatory spending issue, we are not \ngoing to be able to have the funds to do even essential \nconstitutionally mandated things, such as providing for our national \nsecurity and making funds available for paving roads, health care \nresearch, education, or whatever else we feel is appropriate for our \nFederal Government to engage.\n  Furthermore, this mandatory spending has enormous impacts on our \nyoung people. In a recent New York Times column titled ``Carpe Diem \nNation,'' David Brooks wrote about two ways spending on health and \nretirement programs not only threatens our economic growth but hurts \nyoung people. It squeezes government investment programs that boost \nfuture growth. Second, the young will have to pay the money back. To \ncover current obligations, according to the International Monetary \nFund, young people will have to pay 35 percent more taxes and receive \n35 percent fewer benefits.\n  This is the plight that exists. These are the cold hard facts. We \nhave to deal with this math. Understanding how we deal with this \ndirectly affects people's lives, directly affects the benefits they \nrely on for their retirement and for their health care.\n  The challenge before us is to understand, if we don't do something, \nthis 35-percent higher taxes and 35-percent fewer benefits on our young \nis not only unacceptable, I think it is, in my opinion, immoral. \nImmoral for our generation, for this Congress, and our executive branch \nto leave our children and grandchildren in such a position without \ndoing something about it. The challenge before us and the goal this \nbody should be striving for is finding common ground--not how to \neliminate these programs but about how to save these programs while \nensuring we have adequate resources to finance the essential and \nnecessary functions of the Federal Government. This starts with our \nconstitutional obligation to provide for the Nation's security, the \nsecurity of the American public, as well as providing for the general \nwelfare.\n  Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals recognize we \nneed to restructure Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security if we are \nserious about putting this country on a sounder fiscal footing and if \nwe are going to be able to keep these programs from becoming insolvent. \nHopefully, there are Members on both sides of the political spectrum \nwho agree we need to make the changes now in order to avoid more \npainful changes later.\n  We have been postponing this action and this needed legislative \nprocess for decades. It has always been too hot to handle. It is too \npolitically damaging. It might put us in political jeopardy.\n  The President, in his State of the Union Address, said it is time we \nput the interests of our Nation ahead of our own personal political \ninterests. I couldn't agree more. That is what we should always be \ndoing. We have not done that when it comes to this critical issue, \nwhich has such an enormous impact on everything we do. It has such an \nenormous impact on people who have saved all their lives for the \nbenefits they were promised when they retire or became a certain age or \nthe young people in this country who are coming out of school, starting \na family, getting a job, hoping to also participate in the American \ndream, owning a home, and raising a family. We have the freedom our \ncountry provides us in ways no other country ever has or perhaps ever \nwill. We are so blessed to have been born in this country, to live in \nthis country, and to have the freedom and the possibility of achieving \nour dreams.\n  All of those are in jeopardy if we don't address this situation. For \ndecades now, we have known what is coming. We have seen a growth in our \npopulation of baby boomers moving through their entire lifecycle and \nare now reaching retirement age. We have postponed this over and over. \nWe have come up with short-term solutions over and over and over and \nfailed to come up with any long-term solutions over and over and over.\n  The time is now. We are at the point where if we don't do something \nnow, the prediction of David Brooks is going to take place. Our young \npeople are going to be saddled with ever-higher taxes to hold up a \nsystem that is going to only be able to deliver ever-lower benefits.\n  As we consider the right path to move forward, we need to acknowledge \nthat any bipartisan congressional effort to reform and preserve these \nprograms will be unsuccessful unless the President shows a willingness \nto get involved and engage fully in this effort. I believe he \nunderstands the magnitude of the issue because he has said: I refuse to \nleave our children with a debt they cannot repay.\n  We all want a government that lives within its means. We need to get \nour fiscal house in order now. We cannot kick this can down the road. \nWe are at the end of the road, said the President of the United States \nin comments made when he was a Senator, comments made when he was a \ncandidate for President, comments made when he was President during his \nfirst 4 years, and comments made subsequent to that, in his inaugural \naddress, and in his recent State of the Union Address.\n  We need more than talk. We need engagement. We need an engagement of \nthe President if we are going to make these difficult decisions to put \nour country on a better fiscal path and to save these programs for \nthose who have put their hard-earned money and work into them and then \nnot qualify for those benefits.\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\n  I would like to take this opportunity to remind the President of his \nrepeated commitment to reduce our debt and deficit. I want to remind \nhim of the many times he has spoken about the need to fix Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security.\n  Now, Mr. President, what I would like to say is this: We need more \nthan your soaring rhetoric. We need more than the promises you made. We \nneed your direct engagement if we are going to address this fiscal \ncrisis and essentially do what I think all of us know we need to do.\n  We basically have two options: we may continue with the status quo \nand wait until the moment that a crisis hits and we may no longer send \nout the checks; we must raise taxes once again to cover a program that \nshould have received needed reforms or at the point where the programs \nbecome solvent. Or, the alternative is that we can come together and \ncommit to the American people that we will act and no longer avoid or \ndelay the challenging and necessary task of fixing these programs to \nsave them for future generations.\n  I stand ready. I trust my colleagues stand ready to address this \nissue now, and we are asking you to stand with us. Let's do what we all \nknow we need to do to restore our Nation's fiscal health, to save these \nprograms from insolvency, to grow our economy, and get Americans back \nto work. The time is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am proud to stand here to support \nthe nomination of Chuck Hagel as our next Secretary of Defense.\n  I believe he will be confirmed by this Chamber, I hope, on a \nbipartisan basis. He is, in fact, extraordinarily qualified for this \nposition of unique trust and responsibility. That is the criterion we \nmust apply. Is he qualified? We may have, probably each of us does have \namong us 100 Senators, someone whom we would make our first choice or a \nbetter choice or is the right person, in our view. That is not the \nquestion before us. It is whether he is qualified to be part of the \nPresident's team and to be held accountable for the policies the \nPresident sets.\n  Chuck Hagel is a decorated war veteran with two Purple Hearts. He is \na highly successful businessman and entrepreneur and a real manager at \na time when we need a manager in the Department of Defense.\n  He is a former colleague as a Member of this body, but he is also a \nformer deputy head of the Veterans' Administration. He has given his \nlife to public service and, most especially, to helping men and women \nin uniform while they serve this country in the military, and then when \nthey come back to civilian life, helping them contribute and continue \nto give back to this Nation.\n  He is a Republican who has won the confidence of President Obama and \nwhom President Obama has chosen to be a member of his team.\n  We speak, as Members of the Senate, about giving the President a \nmeasure of deference, a prerogative in making the selection about who \nwill serve on his team because it is the President who sets policy. The \nPresident will set our policy on the Middle East and on Israeli \nsecurity. Chuck Hagel has said he is committed, unequivocally, clearly, \nunambiguously, to the security of Israel and to whatever weapons \nsystems are necessary to provide Israel in maintaining and sustaining \nthat security, the Iron Dome, David's Sling, and other measures this \nNation has committed to its great ally in the Middle East. This is an \nally that is necessary not only to stability there and hopefully to \npeace but also to our national interests. Chuck Hagel may have made \ncomments in the past that seemed to vary somewhat from the President's \npolicy, but it is the President who sets that policy and whom we will \nhold accountable for that policy.\n  Likewise, on Iran, Chuck Hagel has said he is in favor of preventing \na nuclear-armed Iran, not containing it but preventing it. Whatever his \npast says, it is the President who sets that policy. Chuck Hagel has \nindicated he is completely in accord with it, in support of it, and \nwill implement it. Again, it is the policy of the President to prevent \na nuclear-armed Iran, and we must in this body give support and \nencouragement to the President in being strong and tough, setting even \nstronger and tougher sanctions, and using the military option, if \nnecessary, to stop a nuclear-armed Iran.\n  Going from policy to what I think is perhaps the unique challenge of \nthe next Secretary of Defense, which is to attract and retain the best \nand the brightest to our military--we talk all the time about people \nbeing our greatest asset in the military. We have weapons systems that \ndefy the imagination, let alone comprehension.\n  At the end of the day, the people who run those weapons systems, the \npeople who staff and work every day to keep America safe, are the ones \nwho are our greatest asset. At a time when we are bringing troops back \nfrom Afghanistan when Secretary-to-be, hopefully, Hagel, has indicated \nwe ought to do it even more quickly, our greatest challenge will be to \nprevent the hollowing out of our military as has occurred in the wake \nof past conflict.\n  That hollowing out is not only about hardware and weapons; it is \nabout the people who command and the people who run those weapons. We \nneed to ensure we keep those midlevel officers and enlisted members who \nare so important to the leadership of our military. Chuck Hagel's \nleadership and commitment will be critical to that task.\n  I have met with Chuck Hagel privately. I asked him tough questions \nabout Iran and Israel. I am satisfied on those points that he will \nadvise the President in accord with those policies.\n\n  But even more important, I am struck by his passion and the intensity \nof his commitment to our men and women in uniform. His caring about \nthem is indicated in so many ways--spontaneously and strongly in his \ntestimony as well as in his private conversation. He will make sure \nthat sexual assault in the military--the epidemic and scourge of rape \nand assault against men and women who serve and sacrifice for this \ncountry--will be stopped; that there will be, in fact, zero tolerance \nnot only in word but in deed, and his viewing, for example, of the \ndocumentary ``Invisible War''--his understanding that this kind of \nmisconduct is an outrage, never to be even complicitly condoned and to \ntreat as a criminal offense the most extreme kind of predatory criminal \nactivity is important to the future of our military and our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  He is committed to making sure that women in combat--a policy of the \nPresident--is implemented forcefully and faithfully. He is committed to \nmaking sure the policy of repealing don't ask, don't tell is \nimplemented zealously and vigorously. He is committed to making sure \nthat our veterans--not only for our returning Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans but also for the veterans of his own generation--our Vietnam \nveterans who had Post-Traumatic Stress at a time when it was \nundiagnosed and, in fact, unknown as a condition resulting from \ncombat--have the benefit of policies and practices we are now \nimplementing to deal with Post-Traumatic Stress and traumatic brain \ninjuries.\n  He is also committed, equally importantly, to making sure the \nepidemic of suicide among our currently serving men and women in \nuniform and also our veterans is addressed forcefully. There are \ntragedies every day involving those suicides--families who lose loved \nones and a country that loses a great public servant--and Chuck Hagel \ncares about those men and women. He will see a person in uniform not as \nsimply an officer or an enlisted man but as someone who will soon be a \nveteran and become part of a continuum.\n  Chuck Hagel has served the VA as well as now in the Defense \nDepartment, and he will make sure the transition from active service to \nreservist service is seamless; that veterans are provided with the \ntransition assistance they need for employment, education, and health \ncare, and that our National Guard receives the respect and service it \ndeserves.\n  I am convinced Senator Hagel's No. 1 priority will be taking care of \nour troops. He was a veteran's advocate with the USO, and he has won \nthe respect and admiration of veterans groups. In addition, he has won \nthe support of an extraordinary array of former Secretaries of Defense, \nambassadors and diplomats, senior retired military leaders, and, in \nparticular, two former Members of this body who appeared with him at \nhis testimony, former Senators Warner and Nunn.\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\n  I believe Chuck Hagel is the right man for the fiscal challenges that \nwill confront the Department of Defense. Putting aside sequester--which \nI dearly hope will not happen; Secretary Panetta has said it would be \nirresponsible for the Congress to allow it to happen, and many of us \nagree it must be avoided--and the challenges in the next month or \nseries of months, the long-term outlook for the Department of Defense \nis that it must do more with less, and Secretary Hagel, if he is \nconfirmed, will have that management task. He is one of the people in \nthis country who is almost uniquely qualified to carry it out, and I \nbelieve he will, with great distinction. He will take care of our men \nand women in uniform and strengthen our national defense. He will do \nwhat he thinks is right, even if it is not popular.\n  Finally, Chuck Hagel is, as everyone has said, a good and decent man. \nAnd I thank in particular Senator McCain for his very compelling and \ntelling comments during our consideration before the vote in the Armed \nServices Committee. He said, and I agree, that no one should impugn \nChuck Hagel's character. He is a person of integrity and character, and \nI believe he will have the respect at all levels of our defense--the \nmen and women who serve and sacrifice every day, the men and women who \nare essential to our national security--and I recommend him and urge my \ncolleagues to support him.\n  I respectfully hope he will be confirmed quickly and that it will be \ndone on a bipartisan basis so we will be united--as our Armed Services \nCommittee in this body is almost always united--in favor of the \nPresident's choice for this uniquely important responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Republican whip.\n\n\n                             Time To Govern\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise to mark another sad record for \nthe Senate: 1,387 days since the Senate has passed a budget--1,387 \ndays.\n  The last time I checked the 2012 election was over, and of course it \nhas been over for more than 3 months now. Unfortunately, the President \nstill seems to be very much in campaign mode, giving speeches all \naround the country. For the time being, what we need, rather than a \nPresident on a perpetual campaign, is for Democrats and Republicans to \nwork together to try and solve some of our Nation's most pressing \nproblems, and there is no more important issue than our national debt.\n  Unfortunately, the President, after extracting about $600 billion in \nnew taxes as a result of the fiscal cliff negotiations, is still coming \nback to the well, and he is calling for tens of billions of dollars in \nnew spending. At a time when we ought to be talking about bending the \ncost curve down, trying to rein in wasteful Washington spending, the \nPresident wants to spend more, and he wants to raise taxes to do it.\n  Perhaps worst of all, we know the promises we made to our seniors for \nMedicare and Social Security are imperiled. Unless we act together to \nsave and protect Social Security and Medicare, they are on a pathway to \nbankruptcy, and that is irresponsible and wrong.\n  I am tempted to describe President Obama's spending and tax ideas as \nsmall ball, but they are worse than that. They represent a conscious \ndecision to neglect some of the most pressing issues that confront our \ncountry. One might even say it is a dereliction of duty in the battle \nto save America.\n\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office projected our gross \nnational debt will increase from $16 trillion in 2012 to $26 trillion \nin 2023. Now that may seem like a long way off, but since President \nObama has been President, the national debt has gone up by 55 percent--\njust in the last 4 years. If we project that forward to 2023, when some \nof these young men and women who are working here as pages will be \nlooking at entering the workforce and looking at their futures, all \nthey will see ahead of them is debt and a reduced standard of living. \nThis is what lies ahead for all of us unless we embrace real spending \ncuts and unless we deal with the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and \nSocial Security.\n  If President Obama has a secret strategy for getting our debt under \ncontrol, we would all love to hear it. His last two budget proposals \nfailed to receive a single vote in the Senate. The last 2 years his \nbudget has actually been put to a vote, no Democrat voted for it and no \nRepublican, because it simply didn't address the problems I have \ndescribed. I hope this year is different. Unfortunately, the President \nhas already missed the statutory deadline for submitting his own \nbudget, which was February 4. I hope when he finally gets around to \nsending us his proposed budget it is a serious plan for long-term debt \nreduction. Based on experience, I can't say I am overly optimistic, but \nhope springs eternal.\n  I guess one of the things that worries me the most is that in the \nPresident's State of the Union message, which he so eloquently \ndelivered a few nights ago, he didn't say one word about his 2014 \nbudget--not one word. I would urge the President to take a long hard \nlook at the new Congressional Budget Office report. I would urge him to \nlaunch serious bipartisan budget negotiations as soon as possible so we \ncan avoid another last-minute cliffhanger and another 2 a.m. Senate \nvote.\n  Above all, I would urge the President to take a look at a balanced \nbudget amendment to the U.S. Constitution that I have cosponsored along \nwith all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. That amendment \nwould require the Federal Government to balance its budget each and \nevery year.\n  Is that such a crazy idea? Well, no. That is what every family has to \ndo. That is what every small business has to do. And that is what 49 \nStates are required to do under their laws. This amendment to the \nConstitution would be the 28th amendment to the Constitution, including \nthe first 10, which are, of course, our Bill of Rights. It would \nrequire a congressional supermajority to raise taxes or to raise the \ndebt ceiling.\n  As I said a moment ago, families across America have to balance their \nbudgets. And, of course, along with a budget brings the discipline of \ndeciding what our priorities are--the things we have to have and we \ncan't live without, the things we want but we have to defer, and then \nthe things that maybe we would like to have but simply can't afford. \nWell, this number right here, 1,387 days since the Senate passed a \nbudget, is one reason why our debt continues to go up by leaps and \nbounds, and there is no plan in sight to bring it under control.\n  Here is the bottom line for President Obama: The 2012 election is \nover, and now it is time to govern. It is time to move beyond the \ncampaign rhetoric, drop the gimmicks and work across the aisle with \nRepublicans to do what is right for the country. We are ready, willing, \nand able to engage with the President and our Democratic colleagues to \ntry to address these problems that confront our country. In fact, there \nis no good reason for any of us to be here unless we are willing to do \nthat.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, while the Senator from Texas is still on \nthe floor, he knows I have a lot of respect and affection for him, and \nI am delighted to serve with him here and also to serve with him on the \nFinance Committee. I appreciate Senator Shaheen for letting me jump in \nfor just a minute.\n\n  We agree on so much. We actually do. And not just the Senator and I \nbut our colleagues here. And I think we fully recognize that although \nthe deficit comes down from $1.5 trillion to about $850 billion or so, \nit is way too much. I think we also agree that one of the best ways to \nreduce the deficit is to strengthen and grow the economy.\n  I believe--and I think I heard the President say this the other \nnight--there are three things we need to make sure we address.\n  One, we need to address--and the President said this--we need to \naddress entitlement programs, not to savage old people or to savage \npoor people but to figure out how to get better health care results for \nless money to be able to preserve those programs for the long haul.\n  I think we will have an interesting proposal from Senator Durbin \nlater this year with respect to Social Security and putting it in a \nstructured way, maybe a path forward on Social Security that makes it \nclear we are not trying to balance the budget on Social Security but \nactually do reforms that we\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nknow are needed and I know are needed so we will have that program for \nthe long haul.\n  I commend my side of the aisle, and I commend your side of the aisle. \nWe acknowledge that we need some revenues, whether it is on the tax \nexpenditure side, the deductions and loopholes and so forth, or finding \nother ways to raise revenue.\n  Third, we just came from a press conference this morning with \nCongressman Issa, Congressman Cummings, Senator Coburn, and myself to \nfocus on the GAO and their high-risk list, high-risk ways for wasting \nmoney. That comes out today. Every 2 years they give us this high-risk \nlist for how to find ways to save money and spend our tax dollars more \nefficiently.\n  We have all that working together, those three things: entitlement \nreform, some additional revenues, and actually looking in every nook \nand cranny to see how we can get a better result for less money. Those \nwe can do together. My colleague and I have worked on some things \ntogether, and I want to work on those with the Senator, and I look \nforward to that. I think that if we do, a lot of our colleagues will \njoin us.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican Whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would like to tell the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware how much I appreciate him and his friendship, and \nit is genuine.\n  I guess the thing that is so maddening about serving in the Senate is \nthat everyone in this body--the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire--everyone who serves in this body understands the \nproblems that confront our country that he so eloquently described in \nterms of unfunded liabilities for Medicare and Social Security, which \nare on a path to bankruptcy, the debt, and just imagine, if interest \nrates were to go up, what that would mean in terms of our ability to \nfund everything from safety net programs to national defense.\n  But it never seems to happen. The date never seems to arrive when we \nactually sit down and address it. And I believe this number of days \nwithout a budget is really symptomatic of the problem. But thanks to \nour colleagues across the Capitol--who passed a ``no budget, no pay'' \nbill, which has now been signed by the President--unless Congress \npasses a budget, we are not going to get paid, which is entirely \nappropriate and long overdue.\n  So I would just say to my friend, and he is my friend, that I \nappreciate his comments. I hope someday soon we can find a way, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike--that is the only way it is going to \nhappen--I hope we can get serious about this. Unfortunately, it hasn't \nhappened yet. I am an optimist. I think it can happen. But it is going \nto require Presidential leadership, and, frankly, that is one reason I \nwish the President would get off the campaign trail. Now that he has \nwon--he has another 4-year term--he doesn't have to worry about running \nfor election again, but then to work with us because that is the only \nway it is going to happen.\n  So I appreciate his comments and look forward to continuing to work \nwith the Senator.\n  Mr. CARPER. Again, I thank Senator Shaheen and Senator Hoeven for \nallowing us to have this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Charlie Morgan\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today I rise with a heavy heart \nbecause our Nation has lost one of its outstanding citizens and many of \nus have lost a dear friend.\n  Charlie Morgan, chief warrant officer of the New Hampshire National \nGuard, passed away early Sunday morning with her wife Karen and their \ndaughter Casey by her side. Chief Charlie Morgan was just 48 years old. \nFor those of us who had the pleasure of knowing Charlie, it has been a \ndifficult week. However, as I rise today, I take comfort in the \nopportunity I had to share part of Charlie's life and work.\n  Many know Charlie for the national attention she received over the \nlast several years advocating on behalf of her fellow gay \nservicemembers and their families. However, first and foremost, Charlie \nwas a soldier. She enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1982. After a brief \nperiod away, Charlie returned to service as a member of the Kentucky \nNational Guard in 1992, 1 year before the now-repealed don't ask, don't \ntell policy became law.\n  Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Charlie \nreturned for a third time, joining the 197th Fires Brigade of the New \nHampshire National Guard, a tour that included a yearlong deployment in \nKuwait.\n\n  In addition to the mental and emotional challenges of military \nservice, Chief Warrant Officer Morgan shouldered the constant burden of \nkeeping her life secret from her fellow soldiers. Married to her \npartner Karen in 2000, Charlie was unable to live openly under the \nmilitary's don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  Immediately following the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, Charlie \nmade national news as one of the first servicemembers to publicly \nconfirm her homosexuality and shed light on many of the remaining \ninequalities faced by same-sex military families.\n  I first met Charlie in 2011. She contacted my office during her \ndeployment in Kuwait when she learned that despite the repeal of don't \nask, don't tell, her partner Karen of over 10 years would not be \nallowed to attend mandatory National Guard Yellow Ribbon Reintegration \nPrograms upon her return. I was pleased to work with Secretary Panetta \nand the New Hampshire National Guard, which has been very supportive of \nCharlie, to ensure that she and her wife Karen would be able to \nparticipate in the program together.\n  However, as those of us who appreciated her determination understood, \nCharlie was not satisfied. She continued to vigorously pursue equal \nbenefits for same-sex spouses, particularly survivors' benefits and \ncompensation still denied under the Defense of Marriage Act. And this \nwas not an abstract issue for Charlie. In 2011 she was diagnosed for a \nsecond time with breast cancer. Concerned for the future well-being of \nher family, Charlie took aim at DOMA by challenging its \nconstitutionality in Federal court, and her case is set to be heard by \nthe Supreme Court later this year.\n  Several days ago my office sent out an online condolence card to the \nMorgan family, and the response from that card has been overwhelming. \nIn less than a week we received over 2,000 messages of support from \ncitizens all across our country, and I would like to read just a couple \nof those this morning.\n  From Hobkinton, NH, we heard: Charlie is a hero to many of us. Thank \nyou for making your lives public so others can live their lives \nprivately in love.\n  From Oregon, we heard: Thinking of you in this time of loss. It is \nalso a loss for our country, but she leaves a legacy that will carry \non.\n  From Fulton, IL, we heard: Thank you so much, Charlie, for all you \nhave done. You will not be forgotten, and your service, work, and \nlegacy will live on. Those of us left behind will honor you by \ncontinuing on in this all-important fight for equality.\n  I hope Charlie Morgan knew how many lives she touched and how greatly \nwe admired her efforts. I know that she will be sorely missed and that \nher example will continue to guide us well into the future.\n  With Charlie's memory in mind, I will soon be introducing the Charlie \nMorgan Act. This bill will end a number of restrictions on benefits for \nlegal spouses of all military servicemembers and veterans regardless of \ntheir sexual orientation. Every individual who provides for our defense \ndeserves the peace of mind that comes with knowing one's family will be \ntaken care of should the worst happen. No one should ever again go \nthrough what Charlie and her family had to go through. I hope all of us \nin the Senate will take up this legislation and act quickly to address \nthis issue. It is long overdue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                      Keystone XL Pipeline Project\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise today for the purpose of engaging \nin a colloquy with my distinguished colleagues on the matter of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline for 30 minutes.\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleagues, both Republican and Democratic, on a bipartisan basis to \nurge approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Joining me today will be Senator Mary Landrieu from the great State \nof Louisiana, a Democrat; Republican Senator John Cornyn from Texas; \nRepublican Senator John Boozman from Arkansas; Democratic Senator Joe \nManchin from West Virginia; Republican Senator John Barrasso from \nWyoming; Democratic Senator Mark Begich from Alaska; and Republican \nSenator Lisa Murkowski, also from Alaska. I emphasize that to show the \nbipartisan support for this critically important project.\n  I also will have a statement from Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who \nhas been leading this effort with me, in his case on the Democratic \nside of the aisle. He wasn't able to be here, but I do have a statement \nfrom Senator Baucus that I will read as well, and I appreciate very \nmuch his statement of support.\n  You may have seen that the national gas price has now risen to an \naverage of $3.62 per gallon. So the average price for gasoline today in \nthe United States--and it continues to go up--is up to $3.62 a gallon. \nThat is the highest it has ever been in the month of February. So that \nis a new record--not a record we want to make, either, but it is a \nrecord, the highest price for a gallon of gasoline in the United States \nthat we have ever had in February.\n  If you take a look at that trend line, you will see it has been going \nup dramatically, and that price is double--$3.62 a gallon average \nacross the country--that is double the price of gasoline compared to \nwhen this administration first took office. So it is a doubling of the \nprice, and, of course, every consumer, every working American is paying \nthat price at the pump. It affects our small businesses across the \ncountry, and it affects our families across the country every day.\n  There was a poll released yesterday that you may also have seen. The \npoll was commissioned by API, which is American Petroleum Institute, \nand was conducted February 5 through February 10 by Harris Interactive. \nThey polled just over 1,000 registered voters, and so the poll has a \nmargin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. In that poll, 69 percent of \nthe respondents support construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline--69 \npercent--and 17 percent oppose it. So Americans overwhelmingly support \nthe project--69 percent to 17 percent--in the most recent poll. And, of \ncourse, why wouldn't they.\n\n  This is a project which provides energy to our country when we very \nmuch need it. It is a project which will provide jobs--tens of \nthousands of jobs. We have 7.9 percent unemployment. We have 12 million \npeople out of work. Here is a project that won't cost the Federal \nGovernment one single penny, but it creates tens of thousands of high-\nquality private sector jobs.\n  It is about economic growth. This is a $7.9 billion project. The \nproject over its life will create hundreds of millions of dollars of \ntax revenue for State and local governments, as well as the Federal \nGovernment to help with our deficit and our debt without raising \ntaxes--more tax revenue without raising taxes.\n  It is also about our energy security, energy security for America. \nInstead of bringing oil from the Middle East, this is about working \nwith our closest friend and ally Canada to meet our energy needs. This \npipeline will not only bring in Canadian oil, however. It also moves \noil from my State of North Dakota and from the State of Montana to our \nrefineries in places such as Texas and Louisiana and other places \naround the country. So this is about making sure we don't have to \nimport oil from the Middle East, and I think that is something every \nAmerican wants. That truly is an issue of national security.\n  It has been 4\\1/2\\ years since TransCanada--the company that is \nseeking to build the Keystone XL Pipeline--it has been 4\\1/2\\ years \nsince they first applied for a permit. Here is a chart that shows the \nroute the pipeline would take, and it shows that they had already built \nanother pipeline. This is actually a second pipeline they are seeking \nto build. But after 4\\1/2\\ years, they still don't have approval of a \nproject that is similar to other projects that have been built.\n  As a matter of fact, we have built quite a few pipelines through the \ncountry, and they go everywhere. For some reason this project has been \nheld up for 4\\1/2\\ years when almost 70 percent of Americans support \nit. We need the energy, and we need the jobs. Why would that be?\n  There was a report in the news yesterday that actress Daryl Hannah \nand about 40 activists handcuffed themselves to the fence of the White \nHouse, and they were arrested for that. They were doing that in protest \nof the Keystone Pipeline project. Maybe that is where we should be \ntoday. Instead of our bipartisan group of Senators here in the Senate \narguing the merits of this project and advocating for what the American \npeople want, maybe we should be handcuffed to the White House fence \nbecause that seems to work.\n  It has been 4\\1/2\\ years, and we still don't have a decision. We \nstill don't have approval from the administration on this project even \nthough gas prices have doubled on this President's watch, even though \nthe American people overwhelmingly support the project, even though we \nneed the energy and the jobs. We don't want to keep importing oil from \nthe Middle East, and that is why we are here. We are here on a \nbipartisan basis to make our case and to get this project approved.\n  I want to begin by recognizing a distinguished colleague and somebody \nwho has been a real leader in the energy world and has a direct \ninterest on behalf of his constituents in the great State of Texas \nconcerning this project. We need to move oil to the refineries in \nTexas; we need to move oil--not only Canadian oil but oil from North \nDakota, Montana--and we need to get it to refiners so we can get it to \nour consumers, so instead of seeing the price continue to go up, we can \nbring it down. I think that is what the American people want.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Texas can talk about the refining and jobs \naspect of this multimillion-dollar project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican Whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nSenator from North Dakota for his leadership on this issue. He has been \nrelentless in pursuit of this Presidential permit to authorize the \nKeystone XL Pipeline because he recognizes, as I do, that it is \nimportant in terms of jobs, energy security, and national security.\n  It has been said that because of the revolution in natural gas \nproduction in America, and as a result of horizontal drilling and \nfracking--combined with the energy we can get from the Keystone XL \nPipeline from Canada--that North America could potentially be energy \nindependent--North American energy independence--in the not-too-distant \nfuture.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is scheduled to be here as well. This is a \nbipartisan effort, as all successful efforts around here must be.\n  Before Senator Landrieu speaks, I want to talk about the Keystone XL \nPipeline, which would create an estimated 20,000 American jobs in \nconstruction and manufacturing in my State, which still is the No. 1 \nenergy-producing State in the Nation. As a result, job growth in Texas \nis outpacing most of the rest of the country. I would add that North \nDakota is now the second largest energy producer in the country thanks \nto the Bakken shale efforts. In Texas alone the Keystone would lead up \nto $1.6 billion worth of direct investments and would boost our State's \neconomic output by an estimated $2 billion. This would not only create \nthousands of long-lasting and well-paying jobs, it would allow Texas \nrefineries to refine up to 700,000 barrels of oil each day to produce \ngasoline, jet fuel, heating oil, and the like.\n  As the distinguished Senator from North Dakota pointed out, this \nwould increase the supply at a time when gas prices have gone up, \nbecause of restricted refinery capacity, in the worldwide price of oil. \nIt can do nothing but help America contain those high prices.\n  It strikes me that this is a no-brainer. While we find ourselves \nengaged in armed conflicts in places such as the Middle East--where \nIran periodically threatens to block the Strait of Hormuz, through \nwhich about 20 percent of the world's oil supply flows--\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\nwhy wouldn't we want to make ourselves less dependent on Middle Eastern \noil? Why wouldn't we want to make ourselves more independent on North \nAmerican energy? This is a no-brainer on almost every count I can think \nof.\n  Let me express my gratitude to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota for his relentless leadership. I know he is not going to give \nup. He just keeps getting stronger.\n  In excess of 50 Senators have signed a bipartisan letter to the \nPresident on this, and it is very important for our country as it \nrelates to jobs, energy independence, and national security.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Louisiana here, and I know \nothers wish to speak on this important issue as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Texas. Look at the economic growth and dynamism in his \nState of Texas; look at the economic growth and dynamism in the State \nof North Dakota. We are now the fastest growing State in the country. \nSenator Cornyn is correct when he said Texas is the largest producer of \noil in the country. I think they produce about 1.1 million barrels of \noil a day. We are at 750,000 barrels and growing, so we are after you. \nThe important point is we are producing this product and we have to \nhave the infrastructure to get it to market.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas, and I wish to \nnow turn to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. Here is another \nState that is doing amazing things in oil and gas. They have \nrefineries, and they have refineries that need product. To get that \nproduct from North Dakota, Montana, and our ally Canada to Louisiana, \nwe need pipelines. We don't want to ship it in from the Middle East. We \nwant to send them our oil.\n  I am very pleased Senator Landrieu is here, and I would ask for her \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am very proud to join in this \ncolloquy with over eight Members of the Senate this afternoon. We are \nhere to talk about this important issue and share ideas with our \ncolleagues and with those who are listening to this debate. This \npipeline is important so we can get a reliable, steady stream of oil \nand gas as we move to cleaner fuels in the future for our country.\n  I say to my good friend, the Senator from North Dakota, how important \nit is for drilling, particularly for natural gas, using the \nbreathtakingly new technology that is allowing us to find both wet and \ndry gas, which is very valuable to our country. This is happening in \nmany places in the country. It will help to fuel a renaissance in \nmanufacturing.\n\n  This is not just going to help traditional oil- and gas-producing \nStates such as Louisiana and Texas, this breakthrough in technology \nenables us to retrieve gas not only in an economically efficient way \nbut in an environmentally sensitive way. It is going to be very \nimportant and impactful to many States in the Union.\n  We are already seeing companies coming back to the United States. \nThey are relocating from Chile, places in Europe, places in Asia, and \ncoming back to the United States primarily because of this resurgence \nof gas.\n  But here we are talking about a pipeline that is primarily for oil \nthat comes out of sand. This is not the traditional deep wells where \nthere are large deposits of oil that are drilled. This is a technology \nthat is allowing the separation of these sands to get the carbon or oil \nout of them.\n  Now, yes, we want to move as quickly as we can away from carbon--or \nto lessen carbon because of its damaging impacts--but there is a \ntransition period we have to go through. There is no waving of a magic \nwand; there is no snapping of a finger; there is no jumping from this \ngeneration of energy production to the next overnight.\n  Even President Clinton--even Al Gore when he was Vice President--\ntalked about the transition we have to go through. I see this pipeline \nas a transition. It is giving us oil from one of our closest, most \ndependable, and friendliest of all allies, Canada, as opposed to \npushing over the next 5 or 10 years to continuing to do business with \ncountries that do not share our values, such as the leadership in \nVenezuela today or the problems with countries in the Middle East. Even \nthe Saudis, whom we respect in some ways, do not have the same value \nsystem as the United States. We would much rather--at least my \nconstituents would much rather--deal with Canada and Mexico. Not only \nare they better allies, but for Louisiana, we like working in Canada. \nIt is a little closer to home. We like working in Mexico.\n  Many of the workers on these rigs and in this business come from \nLouisiana and Texas. Let me be crystal clear: My colleagues who are \nhelping on this issue are absolutely right, the people of Louisiana \nwish to work in Canada where there are environmental protections, where \nthe wages are good, where there are not a lot of pirates floating \naround, and where workers are much less likely to be kidnapped. I mean, \nthese are serious issues for the oil and gas industry. That is one of \nthe reasons I have been urging President Obama, along with many of my \ncolleagues, to rethink his position on this pipeline.\n  I guess this has been said by my colleagues--I see the Senator from \nWest Virginia is here, and I am sure he has said this on the floor \nbefore--Canada is going to produce this oil one way or another. The \nquestion is: Who are they going to send it to? Are they going to send \nit to their good friend the United States and our refineries in Texas \nand Louisiana or are they going to ship it somewhere else in the world? \nI would like--and the Senator from North Dakota knows this--to form a \nstronger partnership with Canada and Mexico so we can have security in \nNorth America. This will help the Canadian economy and it will help the \nMexican economy, which immediately and directly affects our whole \nNation. These are our border countries. We are doing a lot of work. I \ndon't know if the Senator knows this, but down in Mexico, in the Gulf \nof Mexico--I literally--and this is a little bit afield--was recently \nin Israel and had the great opportunity to go offshore to visit a \nfield, the Leviathan field, which is one of the largest fields in the \nworld. It was discovered in a remarkably new place, which gives Israel \na great opportunity to think about being energy independent or energy \nself-sufficient, which is quite exciting.\n  When I went offshore in Israel, I met my own workers from Morgan \nCity, Thibodeaux, and Lafourche. They said: Why are you here? I said: \nThe same reason you are. The Louisiana workers go everywhere. We are \nproud to do it. We would love to be close to home in Canada, Mexico, \nand our refineries, which are expanding for the first time in many \nyears. Our manufacturing base is expanding.\n  Finally, I would say in this colloquy, I ask the Senator from North \nDakota: Has he had a conversation with the oil minister from Canada--I \nthink it is Minister Oliver--and talked to him at all recently? I had a \nconversation with him yesterday, and I wanted to maybe share that with \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. To the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, I recently \nvisited with the ambassador, Ambassador Gary Doer. We talked about this \nand other issues.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Through the Chair, I wanted to say I had a very good \nconversation with the Canadian Minister of Natural Resources. We had a \nlong conversation, about 10 or 15 minutes, and he explained to me the \nimportance of this development for Canada. He also said to me what I \njust shared with my colleagues. He said: Senator, Canada is going to \ndevelop this resource. It is just a question of whom we send it to or \nwith whom we share these benefits.\n  So for those who are opposed to the pipeline because they don't like \nthe direction it is going or they think there is something America can \ndo to prevent this resource from being developed, that is simply not \ntrue.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia. I wanted to get that in the \nRecord. I thank the Senator for his leadership and for allowing me to \njoin this colloquy because the people of Louisiana strongly support the \ndevelopment of this pipeline. We are proud of the oil and gas industry, \nbut we also recognize we need to make a transition to cleaner fuels and \nwe want to do our part and are happy about the natural gas that is \nbeing discovered in this Nation.\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nLouisiana for her leadership in energy, onshore and off, in a big way. \nShe is absolutely right.\n  This is our opportunity to have North American energy security and \nNorth American energy independence, working with our closest friend and \nally Canada. This is how we do it--Mexico as well. The Senator from \nLouisiana is also absolutely right: Canada will produce this oil. That \nis a fact. That is going to happen. The question is, Is it going to \ncome to the United States or is it going to go offshore to China? We \nsee these green lines; they show the pipelines that would take that oil \nto China rather than the United States. Net effect: We continue then to \nimport oil from the Middle East, and Canadian oil goes to China. It \nmakes no sense--not to mention better environmental stewardship that we \nwould enjoy working with Canada, which we will touch on as well.\n  I wish to at this point ask the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, \nMr. Boozman, to join the colloquy, and I would also invite Senator \nManchin as well. I see Senator Begich is here also. So I invite Senator \nBoozman to make his comments but then also offer the opportunity for \nour other distinguished Senators to join in the colloquy.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his leadership and for, again, spearheading this effort. I thank \nall the Senators who are here and are, in a very bipartisan way, trying \nto move this project forward.\n  We speak a lot about jobs in regard to this project, but that simply \ncannot be overemphasized. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, most of the \nlargest labor unions--major labor unions--all agree that if this \npipeline were to go forward, which it has to do, it would create \n250,000 jobs; 20,000 of those tomorrow, almost immediately. Again, it \nis so important.\n  It is important to my home State because many businesses, many hard-\nworking Americans living there would benefit tremendously. We have a \nlarge Nucor plant. That Nucor plant in Blytheville, AK, in Mississippi \nCounty, would supply a lot of the iron that would be used. We have \nanother facility, Welspun Tubular Company, they make oil pipe. They \nhave 500 miles of this pipe sitting in storage that they have produced \nto go forward, which should be a great thing. The problem is instead of \nincreasing employment for the future, right now they have had to lay \noff workers because of the indecision.\n  So there are all kinds of reasons we need to do this. Others have \ntalked about national security reasons, but the labor--the good-paying \njobs that would be created, again, not being dependent on places such \nas Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, that is a pretty good deal, and we need \nto move forward immediately.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to recognize the Senator from the \ngreat State of West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, if I may, I wish to thank all my \ncolleagues. This is something wonderful for the people who are watching \nand the people watching who are here, to see a bipartisan colloquy; \nthat we all agree, basically, about energy being the crux of what we do \nand how this country is made up and how we got to where we are today.\n  My little State of West Virginia now has a tremendous shale gas find \nin the Marcellus Shale, with the Utica Shale in Ohio, the shale being \nexplored and produced all over our country. We truly have an \nopportunity in our lifetime to become totally energy independent.\n  The only thing I am saying is, where I come from, the people are such \ngood people and they have a lot of common sense. They say: We would \nrather buy from our friends than our enemies. How much would this \ndisplace, as far as us buying from and depending on areas of the world \nthat haven't been friendly to the money we give them for the product of \noil they sell us; does the Senator from North Dakota have an idea about \nthat?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to respond to the Senator from \nWest Virginia. Right now, between the oil we produce in the United \nStates, both together with Canada and Mexico, we generate about 70 \npercent of the oil we consume. This project alone would add 6 percent. \nWe are talking about over 800,000 barrels a day this project adds and \nbrings to market. So we go from about 70 percent just for this project \nphase 1 to about 76 percent. But understand this pipeline project is \nexpandable to 1.4 million barrels a day, so we can see it would take us \nup even higher.\n  So we are talking about a significant contribution to our oil supply, \nagain, from North Dakota, Montana, and Canada, versus, as the Senator \nsays, countries such as Venezuela or from the Middle East.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. My other question would be this. Since we have Senators \nfrom two of our great producing areas, knowing the challenges we had in \nLouisiana and the gulf coast with the BP oilspill, as well as a lot of \nconcern about the environment and that is why it has been held up, I \nunderstand our friend, Gov. Dave Heineman from Nebraska, now has \napproved this. That, as I understand it, was the last concern he had.\n  I have always said this, and I will ask the question of the Senator \nfrom Alaska--they have one of the harshest climates and are one of the \nlargest oil producers for our country and they have been able to do it \nin a safe atmosphere--will the Senator from Alaska comment on his \nconcerns, if he has them, about doing this in a safe environment.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Absolutely. I thank my friend from West Virginia. We \nbuilt the largest single capital project back in the 1970s when we \nbrought oil off the North Slope, almost 800 miles through the harshest, \nmost unpredictable climates one would ever see. I can tell my \ncolleagues, if we went back to the stories and articles, the sky would \nfall, the environment would be destroyed, and the world would come to \nan end by us building that pipeline. We are multiple decades past. It \nhas worked very well. There haven't been those disasters people claimed \nwould happen.\n  On top of that, my friend from Louisiana mentioned the environmental \nimpact and it makes sense that the pipeline is the safest way to move \noil.\n  On top of that, we have a choice--the Senator from North Dakota made \nit very clear--and that is to get it refined in China or the United \nStates. I don't know about anybody here, but I would bet we all agree \nthat between the environmental standards, we have a better \nenvironmental record than China in the refining of oil products, so it \nmakes sense for us to do it.\n  On top of that, people are traveling to Alaska not just for the jobs \nand the opportunity but the beauty of Alaska, and we have more visitors \nwho want to see the pipeline, to visit the pipeline. When I went down \nthe Gulkana on a rafting trip, it is unbelievable beauty. But one of \nthe last things people do when they come down and land the raft and \nbegin to pack to go back home, there is the pipeline going right across \nthe Gulkana. Guess what. It hasn't damaged the environment. As a matter \nof fact, there are plenty of photos of people trying to get their raft \nunderneath the pipeline; trying to get the pipeline and the rapids at \nthe same time. So the Senator's point is a very good one.\n  The Governor of Nebraska has approved it going through their State, \nbut there is nothing similar to Alaska when it comes to the harsh \nenvironment we had to build in. We did it, and we did it when \ntechnology was much different. Today, the standards are even greater. \nAgain, I wish to echo the Senator's point.\n  If I could make one other point. This is unique, the Chamber and \nlabor working together for the common good of this country and the jobs \nand the groups--we think of the Teamsters and Operating Engineers, the \npipeline contractors, the plumbers and pipefitters, they are all part \nof this agreement to build this pipeline and train workers; as my \ncolleagues know, there is a huge gap in our trades. So we get to \nutilize a training opportunity, employ thousands of people not only for \ntoday but for the future.\n  So from Alaska's perspective, we like it. We know pipelines. We know \nwe have to build big ones, as we did, and the fact is, as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota said, they are going to move this oil one way or \nanother. We have a choice. Do we do it in our country, get\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\nthe jobs that are attached to it, the opportunity to refine it in \nStates with great quality refineries or do we let China do it? This is \na no-brainer for my State.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. One very quick question, if I may, to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  There might be a fallacy of thinking that only oil that is going to \nmove is what we would buy from Canada. How much oil would be moved from \nthe United States that we produce in the United States but that is \ncaptive right now, that is not being refined, maybe down in Louisiana \nand Texas? Would this help U.S. production?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I appreciate the question from the Senator from West \nVirginia. For starters, it would put 100,000 barrels a day--this is for \nstarters--into the pipeline. So day one is 100,000 barrels.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Just for North Dakota?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. North Dakota and Montana. It is very important to \nunderstand that is just when we start. The pipeline is expandable. \nToday, North Dakota is the second largest producer of oil in the \nNation, second only to Texas. We produce 750,000 barrels a day--and it \nis growing--and more of our oil is leaving the State by truck and rail \nthan by pipeline. We need these pipelines. This project alone will take \n500 trucks a day off our roads, trucks which are beating up our roads \nand creating safety issues in our State. This is vital infrastructure \nwe need to get this product to refineries in Louisiana, in Texas, in \nIllinois, and other points around the country.\n\n  At this point, I wish to thank the Senator from Louisiana, again, for \nher participation in this colloquy. I wish to turn to the esteemed \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, another major energy-producing \nState, and ask him for his thoughts in regard to the regulatory \nobstacles to energy development. If we are going to be energy secure, \nenergy independent in this Nation, we have to find a way to empower \nproject investment and empower the kind of development we are talking \nabout--not only infrastructure but the new technologies that will help \nus produce more energy in our country with better environmental \nstewardship. That is what we seek to do and I know that is exactly what \nSenator Barrasso is working on in his State. I would like him to \naddress that aspect.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, if I may join in this discussion--and \nit is wonderful to see the bipartisan nature of this discussion, to \nturn and look around the floor of this Chamber and see three Democratic \nSenators talking to this issue and three Republican Senators talking to \nthe same issue and agreeing, because all of us are like-minded in the \nfact that when we think of energy--and the Keystone XL Pipeline is a \nbig part of that--we think of energy security for our Nation, which is \npart of this, economic growth, and environmental stewardship. We just \nheard from one Alaskan Senator and the other Alaskan Senator will speak \nshortly.\n  We hear what a wonderful job people continue to do in one of the most \npristine areas of the country, the State of Alaska. I will tell my \ncolleagues, as a Senator from Wyoming, an energy capital of this \nNation, that energy is a big part of our economy but so is tourism. If \nwe did things that did not focus on environmental stewardship for our \nown State, it would impact our tourism. Energy is a big part of the \neconomy, so we want to have economic growth, energy security, as well \nas environmental stewardship.\n  But I will tell my colleagues it has been a difficult task based on \nsome of the regulatory obstacles to energy development. The President \nlikes to talk about how he supports all-of-the-above American energy \ndevelopment. But, in fact, we heard him the other night during the \nState of the Union Address. His actions over the past 4 years tell a \ncompletely different story. Instead of making it easier for our own \ncountry to produce energy, I believe he has made it harder.\n  If we look at the folks who are leaving his administration: The EPA's \nDirector, Lisa Jackson, she said the EPA's role is, interestingly, ``to \nlevel the playing field against fossil fuels.'' Secretary Chu, who is \nleaving the administration, said he would ``boost the price of gasoline \nto the levels in Europe.'' Secretary Salazar, who is leaving, continues \nto talk about the fact that the energy strategy, he says, showed good \nresults, but they have restricted access to Federal offshore and \nonshore oil and gas resources through moratoriums, through blocking \npermits, through leasing plans. They have denied Americans billions in \npublic revenue and thousands of jobs.\n  I stand here saying that the Keystone XL Pipeline is a perfect \nexample of the Obama administration's pattern of delaying good projects \nby requiring excessive redtape.\n  So I come here with the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Alaska--and I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nleadership, for his determination, for his courage, and for his \nfortitude--in fighting to make sure we as a country continue to strive \nfor American energy security. That is exactly what we are going to have \nwith this proposal.\n\n  I call on the administration today--the President, as well as the new \nSecretary of State--to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, to allow that \nenergy--which is either coming here to the United States or going to \nChina or elsewhere--to approve it to come to the United States, to help \nour production, to help our consumers, to help our jobs in this \ncountry. Those are the things that are important as we try to focus on \nenergy security for our Nation, economic growth for our Nation, as well \nas environmental stewardship.\n  So I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership.\n  I see now the ranking member of the Energy Committee is here with us \nas well, who has done a masterful job with a visioned ``Energy 20/20.'' \nFor people who have not seen it, I would say they are missing \nsomething--if they have not really read through it--from the Senator \nfrom Alaska because she has focused like a laser on these three E's of \nenergy security, economic growth, and environmental stewardship.\n  So I thank both the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from \nAlaska, the ranking member of the Energy Committee, for their \nleadership.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator from \nWyoming being here and for his leadership on energy. Again, I want to \nrecognize that he comes from an energy-producing State, a State that is \nproducing energy for this Nation and creating hundreds of thousands of \ngood jobs in doing so. I thank him for his leadership on the Energy \nCommittee as well.\n  I want to turn to and recognize the Senator from Alaska, who is the \nranking member on our Energy Committee. As the Senator from Wyoming \nsaid, she has recently put out a blueprint for energy development, \nenergy independence, energy security for our Nation. It is \ncomprehensive. It includes all types of energy and, again, developing--\ndeveloping--them the right way, with good environmental stewardship and \nthe latest technologies but truly accomplishing something the people of \nthis country very much want; that is, energy security.\n  So at this point I would turn to the Senator from Alaska and ask for \nsome of her comments on this Keystone Pipeline project in terms of the \neconomic benefits and the need for our Nation to truly have energy \nsecurity.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague from North Dakota. I thank him \nfor his leadership on how we can get the Keystone Pipeline moving, how \nwe can ensure that a resource from our friend and ally Canada can be \nutilized, can help us here in this country to truly gain that level of \nenergy security we have been talking about.\n  There have been several good comments about the report I released \nlast week, my ``Energy 20/20.'' I just happen to have a copy of it here \non the floor. But out of 115 pages, I can distill it in one simple \nbumper sticker; that is, energy is good, energy is necessary.\n  If you look at the cover of the report here, it is essentially a map \nof the world from way up high. When you are looking down and you see \nthe lights at night, you can tell the prosperous places within the \nworld. It is where the lights are on. It is where our energy is. So \nwhen we talk about energy, I think it is important to really put it in \nthe context of how important, how significant it is to our daily lives.\n  Over a week ago now we were all reminded of the importance of energy \nwhen there were 34 minutes of dead\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\ntime during the Super Bowl. A lot of folks were paying attention to, \nwell, where do we get our energy sources from? It starts a good \nconversation, a necessary conversation.\n  In my document I focus on five different areas where we need to talk \nabout energy policy. I am looking for an energy policy that is \nabundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure. When we talk about \nthe fifth one, the security, this is where the Keystone XL project \nreally comes in to play. When we are talking about security, that does \nnot necessarily mean that everything we want as a nation is going to be \nproduced right here within our own borders. What it means is how we \nreduce vulnerabilities from others, how we can eliminate our reliance \non OPEC.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a reality. This is doable. This is \npossible by 2020. This is not pie in the sky. Let me give you some \nnumbers.\n  In 2011 Canada produced roughly 2.9 million barrels of crude oil per \nday. Mexico produced 2.6 million. When you add this to the \napproximately 6 million barrels the United States produces each day, \ntotal North American production--which is 11.5 million barrels--it is \nfar greater than the Nation's net imports, which was 8.5 million \nbarrels back last year--more than double the imports from OPEC.\n  So if we can do more within our own borders here and ensure that we \nare able to rely on our friends to the north, the Canadians, and our \nfriends to the south, the Mexicans, we can displace--we can fully \ndisplace our reliance on OPEC imports by the year 2020.\n  But part of achieving this goal is being able to count on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. It is as simple as that. It is about security. It \nis about ensuring that we have a supply that not only helps us achieve \nthat energy security, but it allows us to achieve economic security.\n  So far as the jobs that are created, really the ripple effect that \ngoes out--it is not just constructing one pipeline. It is the ripple \neffect that comes from this boom of opportunity within our country.\n  So it is jobs and economic security. It is energy security from the \nperspective of reducing our reliance on those countries we do not \nnecessarily like, removing ourselves from the need to import OPEC oil, \nand having the ability to control our destiny from a perspective of \nabundance rather than from scarcity.\n  We should look to our friends and neighbors. We should work with the \nCanadians. The President should sign the Keystone XL Pipeline bill into \nlaw. He should make it happen. We should not be waiting any longer for \nall the reasons so many on this floor have discussed this afternoon.\n  So to my friend the Senator from North Dakota, I say thank you for \nyour leadership. Let's make this happen now.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Alaska again for being here \ntoday talking about the importance of moving forward with the Keystone \nXL Pipeline project and, again, for her leadership on energy issues. \nShe is our ranking member on Energy. I think no matter whom you talk \nto, she is absolutely inclusive when she talks about energy \ndevelopment, all aspects--the energy development, the environmental \nstewardship, the jobs, developing all types of energy. She brings \ntremendous knowledge and experience to energy issues. So I would urge \nthe administration to listen to one of the leading voices in energy in \nour country, and that is Senator Murkowski, and ask them to approve \nthis project.\n  The senior Senator from Montana could not be here today but did ask \nthat I express his strong support for the Keystone XL project--Senator \nMax Baucus from Montana. My friend from Montana has said over and over \nthe same thing all of us know; that is, Keystone is about jobs, and \nevery day we delay the Keystone Pipeline is another day we delay \ncreating American jobs.\n  So I want to thank not only Senator Baucus but all of the Senators \nwho have joined us here today: Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, Senator \nCornyn from Texas, Senator Boozman from Arkansas, Senator Manchin from \nWest Virginia, Senator Barrasso from Wyoming, Senator Begich from \nAlaska, and, as you have just heard, Senator Murkowski from Alaska.\n  We have made the environmental case. The environmental case is \nstronger with the pipeline project than without it. Every single State \non the route is supporting the project. And I think, as Senator \nMurkowski so well concluded for us, it is about energy; it is about \njobs; it is about tax revenue we need to close the deficit and address \nthe debt without raising taxes; and it is about energy independence and \nenergy security for this country so we do not continue to import oil \nfrom the Middle East or from places such as Venezuela but, rather, we \nget it from our closest friend and ally Canada, as well as from States \nsuch as my own State and from Montana, and we refine it in our \nrefineries and provide it to our hard-working citizens across the \ncountry. So instead of having record highs in the price of gasoline--we \nhave the highest price ever at this point in February: $3.62 a gallon--\nwe start moving energy costs down for our consumers, to create a more \nrobust economy, and to ease the pain at the pump for our hard-working \nAmericans.\n  I just want to close with that there will be another rally of \ndemonstrators around the White House this weekend. I think it is \nscheduled for Sunday. Now, I do not know if they are going to handcuff \nthemselves to the fence like actress Daryl Hannah did the other day or \nwhat they are going to do. But the simple point is this: I just gave \nthe information from a poll that was conducted from February 5 through \nFebruary 10. One thousand voters were contacted in that poll that was \ncommissioned by API and conducted by Harris Interactive. One thousand \nvoters were contacted, and 69 percent support construction of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline and 17 percent oppose.\n  So here is a project which on the facts is something that needs to \nhappen. We need approval of this project on the facts, as we have gone \nthrough and cited in great detail. But this is a project which the \nAmerican people support 69 percent to 17 percent. My question for the \nadministration is, Is this decision going to be made on the facts and \nwhat the American people want or is this going to be made on the basis \nof special interest groups that may demonstrate from time to time \naround the White House? I believe the decision needs to be made for the \nAmerican people to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline project.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                          Unions and ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today as a physician who \npracticed medicine in Wyoming for more than 25 years, and I rise to \ncontinue the debate we have been having in this body about the \nPresident's health care law.\n  Although there has been significant debate and discussion, what I \nhave continued to try to do is discuss some of the many ways in which \nthis law falls short of its goals and falls way short of what the \nAmerican public has asked for when it comes to the need for health care \nreform.\n  The Obama administration continues to put significant effort into \ntrying to sell its health care law and tries to convince people that it \nis the answer to all of their problems. But in the words of John Adams, \n``Facts are stubborn things.''\n  Despite all the spin of this administration, the American people \ncontinue to learn the facts--the facts about just how bad this law is \nand how much it is going to cost them personally in terms of finances \nand personally in terms of their own health care. That is why the \nPresident's health care law continues, this day, to be unworkable, \nunpopular, and absolutely unaffordable.\n  We saw another example of this recently when one group who had \npreviously supported the law learned more about what is in it.\n  Back when we were debating the bill originally, labor unions around \nthe country were among the biggest backers of the law. Unions sent \ntheir lobbyists up here to press their Democratic supporters to pass \nthe law. They put out many statements saying things like, ``We need \nthis health care law now.'' They held rallies right out in front of the \nCapitol.\n  We saw the same kinds of demonstrations last spring when the Supreme \nCourt was considering a challenge to the law. Now, I went to the oral \narguments, and I remember one group of\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nunion members chanting: ``We love ObamaCare.''\n  Well, apparently now, today, I will tell you, the love is gone. \nAccording to a recent front-page article in the Wall Street Journal, \nsome union leaders now say that ``many of the law's requirements will \ndrive up the costs for their health-care plans and make unionized \nworkers less competitive.''\n  Republicans said the President's plan would drive up costs for hard-\nworking Americans from the beginning. Union leaders absolutely ignored \nour warnings and supported the law anyway. Now we have been proven \nright, and we are seeing buyer remorse by a lot of the law's \nsupporters. This was absolutely predictable. What is really interesting \nis the reaction. It is clear from that Journal article that many union \nleaders are angry and disappointed.\n  Well, union leaders should be angry. The Obama administration misled \nthem into believing their members could keep the health care plan they \nhad. They should be angry with President Obama. They were deliberately \ndeceived when he promised repeatedly, saying health insurance costs \nwould go down $2,500 for the average family by today.\n  The unions are also now lobbying the Obama administration to do an \nend-run around the law. The Wall Street Journal quoted union leaders \nsaying that they were going to push the Obama administration to now \nsubsidize their health insurance costs. Now disturbing comments come \nfrom the administration suggesting it might be willing to do just that.\n  Unions have focused their efforts on trying to get the administration \nto expand access to advanced premium tax credits. The subsidies were \nintended only for people who cannot get insurance through their \nemployers. That is how it was set up. Well, that means union members \nwho have insurance for a plan jointly run by the union and their \nemployers are not eligible for the subsidies.\n  The law is crystal clear. In fact, the law lays out four conditions \nfor getting the tax credit: You have to get insurance through the \nexchange, either a State exchange or the Federal exchange; you have to \npay the premiums yourself; you must not be eligible for minimum \nessential coverage other than the plans offered in the individual \nmarket; and you must not be enrolled in an eligible employer-sponsored \nplan. Those are all four. That is it. So union workers covered by their \nemployer or by a joint plan from their employer and the union do not \nmeet these four criteria.\n  Let's go back to Nancy Pelosi and that famous quote: ``First you have \nto pass it before you get to find out what's in it.'' The union bosses \nshould have read the bill before they decided to support it. And if \nthey had read the bill, they would have been smart to oppose it.\n  Despite the clear law, a spokesman for the Treasury Department told \nthe Wall Street Journal that ``these matters are the subject of pending \nregulations.'' Amazingly, one of the lobbyists for the union said the \nadministration can ``create a loophole for them through Federal rule-\nmaking.'' Create a loophole for the unions. Create a loophole.\n  Well, that is wrong. The American people know it is wrong. The \nadministration has no legal authority to expand access to health \ninsurance subsidies under the law. This is not a matter of regulation, \nit is a matter of the law. It was a bad law--bad law as it was being \nadopted, bad law as it was being signed. It is full of unintended \nconsequences. This particular consequence was spelled out \nunambiguously. Last week, 31 Republican Senators wrote to remind the \nPresident of that fact.\n  Of course, it is not just union members who are disturbed by the \nlaw's effects on health care costs. Numerous reports have pointed out \nthat costs will continue to rise when more of the health care law's \nmandates kick in next January. One study estimates that healthier \npeople are going to see their insurance costs go up by 40 percent to \ncover the cost of insuring less healthy people. The law's requirements \non caps on medical benefits will also cause an increase in premiums. So \nwill the requirements that adults up to age 26 be allowed to stay on \ntheir parent's plan.\n  Late last year, Blue Shield of California asked for permission to \nraise its rates by as much as 20 percent. The CEO of Aetna said rates \nin some areas could go up as much as 100 percent. That is on top of the \npremium increase of more than $3,000 the average family has seen since \nPresident Obama took office.\n  We have got to lower the cost of health care. President Obama and the \nDemocrats who voted for this piece of legislation in the House and in \nthe Senate promised the law would do that. Well, it has not done it. It \nwill not do it. Their plan was short on reform and long on budget \ntricks and accounting gimmicks and on empty promises.\n  The cost concerns the unions raise are absolutely legitimate. I share \nthose concerns and so do all of the Senators on this side of the aisle. \nBut we cannot give extra benefits to union members. The problem is not \nthat the law makes union health benefits more expensive; the problem is \nthe President's health care law makes everyone's health insurance more \nexpensive. The answer is to control costs for everyone, not just for \nspecial-interest groups with friends in the White House.\n  We need to revisit the taxes, the fees, and the other policies that \ndrive premium increases. We need real health care reform in this \ncountry, reform that gives people the care they need from the doctor \nthey choose at a lower cost.\n  When we were debating the President's health care law, some of us \nwarned about the danger of writing a bill behind closed doors. \nActually, the President warned about the danger of writing a bill \nbehind closed doors until he decided that was exactly what he wanted to \ndo. So he sent his Chief of Staff to do just what he said would be \ndangerous, write a law behind closed doors.\n  Some of us were concerned about the special deals for special groups. \nOf course, these were special deals that would harm health care for the \nrest of us. President Obama and Democrats in Congress rejected our \nconcerns. Nancy Pelosi famously said we need to pass the law so we can \nsee what is in it. Well, the American people now are seeing more and \nmore of what is in the law, and they do not like what they see. Now \nthey are calling for all of us to do something about it. This is not \nthe time for special-interest loopholes. It is not the time to make \nmore deals behind closed doors. It is not the time to hand out breaks \nfor one favored group at the expense of everyone else.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Tribute to Randy and Suzy Storms\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, another sad occasion in Kansas. A week ago \nthis past Sunday, the Wichita community was struck by the tragic news \nthat Randy and Suzy Storms were killed in a fatal car accident in east \nWichita. Randy and Suzy were traveling home from visiting a friend at a \nlocal hospital when Randy experienced a health problem while driving, \nwhich led to a devastating accident.\n  Randy and Suzy were very well known and very well loved in the \nWichita community for more than 30 years. Their care and compassion for \nthose in difficult circumstances shaped how they lived their lives. \nRandy had a special gift for connecting with those who were struggling, \nperhaps because he knew how difficult life could be. As a teenager, \nRandy suffered a spinal injury which forced him to live as a \nquadriplegic. Resolved to make his faith in Jesus the core of his \nidentity and not his physical disability, Randy chose to invest his \nlife in caring for others.\n  Shortly after high school, Randy began to serve on the staff of Young \nLife, a Christian organization that mentors and works with young \npeople. His position at Young Life was a springboard to reaching a \nwider Wichita community. Over the years, Randy became a counselor and \nfriend to countless pastors, community leaders, young adults, and \neveryone else who was in need of a friend.\n  Jen Shively, who served with Randy for 27 years, remembered that he\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n``loved people well,'' and that ``loving others was effortless for \nhim.''\n  Nan Chastain met Randy while attending Young Life and she remembers \nRandy as ``the definition of faithfulness.'' She said, ``He was always \nthere for anyone whenever they needed him.'' In short, Randy Storms \nvalued every life.\n  His wife Suzy was also known for her great love and her care for \nothers. On any given day, you could find Suzy helping young women and \nteen mothers in need of encouragement and a listening ear.\n  Sean Spencer, a long-time friend of the Storms, knew Suzy to be a \nperson of great strength and grace. Together, the couple invested in \nthe lives of many married couples, both young and old, who were facing \nthe trials of life together. Randy and Suzy found joy in serving \ntogether and encouraging others.\n  The Wichita community came to know the Storms as the folks who would \nshow up to your kids' sporting events, high school graduations, and \nbaptisms to celebrate what means the most in life--people. The Storms \nwere also known as the folks who would faithfully show up at the \ndarkest hour to lend a helping hand or to offer comfort to those facing \nserious difficulties.\n  Randy and Suzy Storms lived out the biblical teaching to love your \nneighbor as yourself, and they touched the lives of countless Kansans. \nMy heartfelt sympathy goes out to their two children Nick and Natalie \nand their two grandchildren Jack and Lucy. Randy and Suzy were two very \nspecial people who will be greatly missed by so very many.\n  This tragedy is a somber reminder that every day is a gift and we are \nnot promised a tomorrow. May we learn from the Storms that what truly \nmatters in life is the people around us, and may their example spur us \nto love one another more deeply.\n  I ask my colleagues as well as all Kansans to remember the Storms \nfamily in their thoughts and prayers in the days ahead.\n\n\n                        Global Battle For Talent\n\n  Mr. President, I am thankful for the opportunity to be on the Senate \nfloor today to continue to tell my colleagues about the issues of \nentrepreneurship and the global battle for talent, the opportunity to \nstart businesses, and the challenges we face from other countries in \ncompeting in this global economy.\n  From our Nation's earliest days, entrepreneurs have been the driving \nforce behind U.S. economic growth and expansion. Yet the state of \nentrepreneurship in America is not as strong as it once was. In today's \nglobal economy, an entrepreneur has more choices than ever about where \nto start his or her business.\n  Over the last 2 years, at least seven other countries have taken \naction to better support and attract entrepreneurs. In the 2-plus years \nI have been a member of the Senate, seven countries have changed their \npolicies, their laws, and their regulations to be attractive to \nentrepreneurs, while we have not. This map shows those countries--\nRussia, Singapore, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Canada, and the United \nKingdom.\n  I recently shared what Canada was doing to attract more \nentrepreneurs, and today I will share what is happening in the United \nKingdom and explain why it is in our country's best interests to act \nquickly to retain highly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants.\n  Much like the United States, the UK had a range of visa categories \nfor immigrants with varying skills and financial resources. But in \n2011, the UK Government made changes to simplify their visa rules in \norder to attract more talented entrepreneurs to their country. The UK \nrecently created an entirely new type of visa for what they call \n``prospective entrepreneurs.'' These individuals are allowed to enter \nthe UK for a set period of time to secure funding and start the process \nof setting up their businesses before they begin the traditional visa \nprocess. Raising capital can be one of the more challenging aspects of \nstarting a new business, and this visa gives entrepreneurs a running \nstart.\n  The UK has also changed its top visa category, tier 1, to be \nrestricted to entrepreneurs, investors, and the exceptionally talented. \nThose entrepreneurs falling within the tier 1 category must have set up \nor taken over a British business. The initial investment in their \ncompanies can be as little as 50,000 pounds, given that certain \ncriteria are met. By lowering the initial capital investment required, \nentrepreneurs can get set up and running their businesses sooner rather \nthan just raising more money.\n  The UK has also revamped its Global Entrepreneurs Programme, which \nworks to encourage innovative technology businesses to relocate to the \nUK. The program is aimed specifically at foreign entrepreneurs and \noffers a range of support to startups, from help in raising capital to \nproviding mentors to offering networking opportunities with successful \nentrepreneurs. This program has helped more than 200 entrepreneurs and \nearly-stage technology companies get established in the United Kingdom \nso far.\n  You can see from this poster, Sir Richard Branson is helping promote \nthis program because he knows firsthand the value of entrepreneurship. \nMany people today know Richard Branson as the creator of Virgin \nAirways, but he got his start at the young age of 16 by successfully \nlaunching a new student magazine. Now, 45 years later, his investment \ngroup employs approximately 50,000 people in 34 countries and its \nrevenues in 2011 were around $21 billion.\n  The UK's Immigration Minister said this about the country's recent \nefforts to attract more startup companies:\n\n       Entrepreneurs and investors can play a major part in our \n     economic recovery, and I want to do everything I can to \n     ensure that Britain remains an attractive destination for \n     them. Last year we issued far too few visas to those who wish \n     to set up a business and invest in the UK--I intend to change \n     that.\n\n  That was the Immigration Minister of the UK speaking. And this is our \ncompetition.\n  We in Congress and the administration need to take notice. Other \ncountries are aggressively courting entrepreneurs and those talented \nindividuals will not sit on the sideline with their good ideas. They \nwill go to the country that welcomes them and set up shop.\n  A story I heard while visiting Silicon Valley recently illustrates \nthis point. A large company that was just a few years ago a startup \nitself told me they had plans to hire 68 highly skilled immigrants but \ncould not get visas for them to work in the United States.\n  Rather than letting that talent go, the company hired them but in a \ndifferent country. While it is troubling to me that we lost 68 jobs \nbecause there was no visa for them--we lost those jobs here in the \nUnited States and the visa program didn't work to attract and retain \nthem--what troubles me even more than that is we know that someone--and \nmaybe several of those 68 people hired--will go on to start a business \nthat may result in significant job creation. Those are jobs that could \nhave been created in the United States but now will be created in \nanother country.\n  There is a global battle for entrepreneurial talent, and the United \nStates is falling behind. When we lose those entrepreneurs and highly \nskilled immigrants, we lose the jobs they create. This is certainly \nabout the entrepreneurs, but it is more about the folks whom they will \nemploy--folks here in the United States who are in desperate need of \nemployment.\n  The legislation that led to changes in the UK's visa law was drafted \nby Cambridge venture capitalist Alex van Someren. Alex is aware that \nhere in America there have been recent efforts to attract entrepreneurs \nto our country, but the barriers to entry are still higher than in the \nUnited Kingdom. Alex said this in a recent interview he had with \nBusiness Weekly: ``We have beaten the American effort and that is \nfabulous news for UK entrepreneurship.''\n  This might be good news for the United Kingdom, but it is not good \nnews for Americans. I want to make sure that the first choice for \nentrepreneurs looking to start a company remains the United States of \nAmerica, and Congress has the responsibility to make certain that \nhappens.\n  In a bipartisan effort, Senator Warner, Senator Coons, Senator Blunt, \nand others introduced the Startup Act 3.0 yesterday and an identical \nbill is being introduced today in the U.S. House of Representatives. \nStartup Act 3.0 makes changes to the Federal regulatory process to \nlessen government\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\nburdens on job creators, modifies the Tax Code to encourage investment \nin new businesses, seeks to accelerate the commercialization of \nuniversity federally funded research that can lead to new ventures and, \nimportantly, provides new opportunities for highly educated and \nentrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States where their \ntalents and new ideas can fuel economic growth and, most importantly, \ncreate American jobs.\n  Startup Act 3.0 creates an entrepreneur's visa for foreign-born \nentrepreneurs currently in the United States. Those with a good idea, \ncapital, and willingness to hire Americans would be able to stay in the \nUnited States and grow their businesses.\n  In many instances, foreign-born entrepreneurs, here legally, have an \nidea and want to begin a company that will employ Americans but are \ntold their visa does not allow them to remain in the United States. \nWith few ways to stay, these entrepreneurs are forced to move and to \ntake their business with them where they will create jobs in other \ncountries.\n  I want to make certain America is the best place for entrepreneurs \nwho want to build in America and hire Americans. Passing Startup Act \n3.0 will help make that happen by creating new ways for immigrants \nlegally in the United States to open a business and to employ our \nfellow citizens.\n  People come from all around the world to the United States. They come \nto study and they come to work. They come to live in a place where they \ncan have the freedom to pursue their dreams. The entrepreneur's visa \nwould allow these risk-takers to stay here and operate their \nbusinesses.\n  Each immigrant entrepreneur would be required to create jobs for \nAmericans. If the business was not successful and the jobs were not \ncreated, the immigrant would have to go back to his or her own home \ncountry.\n  While some immigrant entrepreneurs would fail, others would follow a \npath worn by many who came before them and succeeded. Entrepreneurial \nimmigrants have long contributed to the strength of our economy by \nstarting companies and creating jobs. I can think of the Russian \nimmigrants, for example, who are entrepreneurs in a sense who came to \nKansas and brought hard red winter wheat with them. What a true \nentrepreneur--an immigrant entrepreneur--who changed the face of our \nState.\n  On the current Fortune 500 companies, more than 40 percent were \nfounded by a first- or second-generation American. Not only are these \nimmigrants entrepreneurial, but they are also disproportionately \ninnovative. Foreign nationals residing in the United States were named \nas investors or coinvestors in a quarter of all patent applications \nfiled in the United States in 2006.\n  Today, one of every ten Americans employed in a privately owned U.S. \ncompany works for an immigrant-owned firm. While we work in the United \nStates to continue educating our children with the skills for a 21st \ncentury economy and training the next generation of great American \nentrepreneurs, we also need to welcome those who want to create a \nbusiness here in the United States and employ our citizens.\n  I believe that 80 percent of my colleagues here would agree with the \nprovisions of Startup Act 3.0. They understand these are important \nissues for the economic growth and new job creation for Americans. I \nurge my colleagues to pass what we can agree to now and keep working to \nfind common ground on issues that still divide us. The longer we wait, \nthe farther we fall behind in this global competition for the most \nentrepreneurial immigrants.\n  While the United Kingdom and other countries are creating new \nopportunities for entrepreneurs, the United States remains the land of \nopportunity and birthplace of the American dream. We need to pass \nStartup Act 3.0 so foreign entrepreneurs can strengthen our economy and \nso American business men and women can pursue their dreams here in the \nUnited States.\n  Millions of our citizens, unfortunately, remain out of work. Many are \nunderemployed. Our economy is barely growing. We can jump-start the \nAmerican economy through Startup Act 3.0, and the skills we need to \npursue the American dream can be here in the United States and we can \nstrengthen our economy.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cardin and Ms. Mikulski are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                            Sequester Impact\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (Ms. Heitkamp). Madam President, while we are waiting to \ntake up some other important legislation, I wanted to come to the floor \nto speak on another very important matter.\n  What I wish to talk about is sequester. ``Sequester'' is a nine-\nletter word that would be a big hit in a Scrabble game, but it is a \nlousy word for the game of life and the functioning of our economy. \nSequester is a technique we are going to use as Washington-speak for \nsaying we will have, starting March 1, across-the-board cuts that will \nbe devastating to our economy and to the functioning of government. I \njust held a hearing this morning in my full Appropriations Committee \nabout the consequences of these cuts. It is really scary. We are going \nto cut defense. It is going to have a negative impact on our readiness. \nAt the same time, people building some of the smart weapons for the \nfuture, such as shipyard workers, over several thousand of them, could \nbe laid off.\n  Not only must we protect our military from these devastating cuts, \nbut there are others who wear the uniform of the United States of \nAmerica who protect us. For example, we have 57,000 Border Patrol \nguards who could be laid off. We also have people who run our weather \nsatellites who help provide the important information to warn for \ntornadoes, to warn for hurricanes, to warn for these terrible blizzards \nso that local governments can efficiently prepare. Then there are \nterrible cuts in the area particularly of education.\n  We need to be able to come up with $86 billion to cancel this year's \nsequester. That is $86 billion--``b'' as in Barbara, not ``m'' as in \nMikulski. We have less than 2 weeks to do that.\n  Now, as the full chair of the Appropriations Committee, working with \nour Democratic leadership and our very able chair of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Murray, as well as Senator Baucus, the chair of the \nFinance Committee, as well as other people in the Senate, we have been \nable to come up with an alternative. It offers a balanced approach to \nrevenues as well as to cuts.\n  Our proposal will include reforms to the Tax Code and save $55 \nbillion. At the same time, what we will be able to do is come up with \ncuts in spending. One will be $28 billion of cuts in the farm bill and \nthen another $27 billion in defense.\n  Now, before people worry and before Iran gets any funny ideas--or \nanybody who is a foe of the United States--that we are going wimpy or \nsoft, the answer is no. These cuts will not go into effect until 2015, \nafter we have brought our troops back home from Afghanistan. Then they \nwill be spread out over 8 years until 2021. So we won't impact \nreadiness. If there is a foreign predator, don't think we are weakening \nourselves. What we are doing is looking at ways the Defense Department \ncan get rid of some of these programs that are now dated, some of the \nweapons systems that are no longer as relevant as they once were, as we \nmodernize.\n  So between the mandatory spending cuts in the farm bill and in \ndefense, we will cut spending by $55 billion. So we take $55 billion in \ncuts and $55 billion in revenue, and this will give us the $110 billion \nto be able to deal with this problem.\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\n  I am really jazzed about sequester. I represent some of the great \niconic Federal agencies in the State of Maryland. I have 1,000 Federal \nemployees. People say: Oh, we know them. Aren't those the pointy-headed \nbureaucrats who only do heavy lifting by getting a latte in the \nmorning? The answer is absolutely not. Let me tell my colleagues who \nthose people are, and I am really proud of them.\n  They run the Social Security Administration. They make sure the \nchecks go out on time. They are doing all the actuarial work. They are \nmaking sure Social Security is relevant, financially solvent, and far \nmore efficiently run, with lower overhead than an insurance company.\n  I represent the National Institutes of Health, whose sole job is to \nfind cures for the diseases affecting the American people. Right this \nvery minute we are working on the cure for Alzheimer's, with a \ncognitive stretch-out of Alzheimer's. My dear dad died of that. I know \nthe consequences. It is a terrible heartbreak for the family, and I \nwill tell my colleagues that it is a budget-buster when one has to turn \nto long-term care. If we can keep the funding going and if we can have \nthat breakthrough, if we can even find a cognitive stretch-out for 3 to \n5 years for people going into nursing homes, we could cut our Medicaid \nbudget in half because 80 percent of the money in our Medicaid budget \ngoes to paying for long-term care for people with Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, or other diseases with neurological \nimpairments. We are being pound foolish to save nickels and dimes. We \nneed a long-term solution.\n  By the way, the sequester is supposed to happen every year for 9 \nyears. It was to get us to the table so we could deal not only with our \ndebt and deficit--yes, we got that message, but the other message is \nthat we have to get America ready for the future. We have to create \njobs today and innovate for jobs tomorrow. That is at NIH. Those are \nthe people working there.\n  I represent three Nobel Prize winners who are civil servants, several \nNobel Prize winners over at Johns Hopkins. They are not only proud of \nwinning the prizes, but they want to help America win the markets--new \nideas for new products that will lead to new jobs.\n  We also have in my State the Federal Drug Administration. I wish the \nPresiding Officer could come over there. There are 4,000 people working \nthere.\n  They say: Well, all those people. Yes, all those people. Again, there \nare Ph.D.s and M.D.s, people with master's degrees, and what are they \nworking for? They are looking for new medical devices to help people, \nthe new breakthroughs in perhaps the next generation of the pacemaker. \nThey are taking ideas invented by the private sector, including a \nnew insulin pump that will help a diabetic person have a more active \nlife or even breakthroughs for neurological impairment for perhaps the \nchild with cerebral palsy--they are looking for safety and efficacy so \nthose products can move to clinical practice, to the marketplace, and \nproducts we can sell to the world. There are many countries that could \nnever afford an FDA, but because they are FDA-certified in our country, \nthey will buy our products.\n\n  I am proud of that, that we are going to be the country that is \ninventing cures for cancer. We only look at the ``a'' words: AIDS, \nAlzheimer's, autism, arthritis. Just look at that. At the very time we \nare looking to lay off people or furlough people at NIH, they have just \nlowered the cancer rates in the United States by 12 percent--12 \npercent.\n  During the terrible fiscal cliff negotiations around New Year's, I \nspoke to Dr. Francis Collins, who heads that agency. We were making \nthese announcements on how America leads the way to lower cancer rates \namong its own people. Isn't that a great victory? At the same time, I \nwas telling him he could be heading into sequester or going over a \nfiscal cliff.\n  Every day these 130,000 people are working to help America, whether \nthey are working with weather satellites, whether they are doing the \nnext generation of drug approval, whether they are running the Social \nSecurity Administration, whether they are over at the National \nInstitute of Standards making sure American products have American \nstandards and not the Chinese standards--again, so we can manufacture \nhere and sell over there.\n  So I think sequester is a terrible thing. As the chair of the full \nAppropriations Committee, I am working with our leadership to try to \ndeal with this issue, but I also say to the other side of the aisle, \nlet's come together. Let's work with our President. Let's have that \ngrand bargain through looking at tax reform, reviewing some of our \nmandatory spending and how we can get savings out of that, as well as \ntargeted, strategic cuts. Let's get us on the right fiscal path, but \nalso let's get us on the path for innovation, for jobs today and jobs \ntomorrow. We want to continue to lead the world, and we want to defend \nourselves not only against foreign predators who might wish to do us \nharm but those other horsemen of the apocalypse who ride, such as \npestilence and disease, and we can do it. So let's saddle up and get \nthe job done.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to join in a \ncolloquy with my colleague from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, there seems to be a lot of back and \nforth and misinformation about where various Senators stand on the \nissue of the Hagel nomination. I have a statement I will give in a few \nminutes about why I am opposed to Senator Chuck Hagel to be Secretary \nof Defense, but I think it is important to make a couple points. One is \nthat the distinguished chairman and I were here back in 1988.\n  In 1988, on December 16, John Tower was nominated to be Secretary of \nDefense.\n  On January 25, 1989, his confirmation hearings began. On February 2, \n1989, the committee postponed the confirmation vote after allegations \nwere raised. On February 8, the committee vote was delayed again until \nFebruary. February 23, he was voted out of the committee. March 10 was \nthe time where the Senate rejected the nomination by 53 to 47.\n  I was there. I saw. One of the worst things I have ever seen in the \nhistory of the Senate, the way they dragged out Senator John Tower--a \ngood and decent man's reputation with allegation after allegation, all \nof which turned out to be false. So I would like to inform my \ncolleagues, this is not the first time we have had a delay in the \nconfirmation of a Secretary of Defense.\n  I will be glad to go over what I saw, including allegations that were \nthrown over the transom day after day, week after week. They destroyed \na good and decent man in Senator John Tower. So the allegation that \nsomehow we are dragging this out or delaying it, it is not the first \ntime in history, I will say to my dear friend, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Having said that, there are still questions outstanding. I believe \nSenators have the right to have those questions answered. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina and I, the Senator from New Hampshire had a \nresponse from the President today on the question we had, but there are \nother questions. But I think during the break is sufficient time to get \nany additional questions answered. I will vote in favor of cloture on \nthe day we get back. I believe my colleagues would also--a number of my \ncolleagues would do the same.\n  I think that is a sufficient period of time to get answers to \noutstanding questions. I think Senator Hagel, after that period of \ntime, deserves a cloture vote and an up-or-down vote on his nomination.\n  I ask if my colleague wants to comment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We reported Senator Hagel's nomination out at 5 o'clock. \nI would argue that the hearing was interesting, I think at times \nunnerving. Here it is Thursday. So there are some questions being asked \nby our colleagues that I think are legitimate. Some are kind of \ncreating a new standard. I am confident, in the next week,\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nunless there is some explosive bombshell that I cannot quite get my \nhands around, I intend to vote for cloture and against the nomination. \nI am one, along with Senator McCain, who believes filibustering should \nbe a rare thing.\n  But what we are doing is saying the debate time for Senator Hagel is \nnot yet over, since he just got reported out Tuesday at 5 o'clock. Put \nyourself in the shoes of the colleagues who are not on this committee. \nThis has been a very controversial nominee. I will say the reason we \nvoted for Senator Kerry on the same day he got reported out of \ncommittee and he got 97 votes, that all of us felt comfortable with the \nnomination. There are very uncomfortable things about this nomination. \nBut having said that, I do believe that unless there is something new \nthat comes out, we should proceed to a vote, up or down. I am willing \nto invoke cloture because I think, as Senator McCain said, the week \ntime period would give us a chance to answer these questions.\n  Let me inform my colleagues that just about an hour ago, there was a \npress report that a speech was given by Senator Hagel--I can't remember \nthe group. But one of his aides posted--based on his notes what he had \nsaid the next day on a Web site.\n  During that speech, according to this aide, Senator Hagel said the \nU.S. State Department was an extension of the Israeli Government. \nThings such as that are unnerving. There is at least one speech he gave \nthat he did not report that we think there is a copy of. We should get \nit in the next few days. That is why I would oppose cloture today, vote \nfor it after the recess.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, who also, in my view, is one of the great protectors of \nthe Senate, preserving its tradition and customs--I would ask if he has \na view on this issue. I wish to repeat: I would vote for cloture. The \nSenator from South Carolina would vote for cloture. I would be \ninterested in the view of the Senator from Tennessee on this whole \nissue.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona. Probably the best \nknown function of the Senate--constitutional responsibility--is the \nright of advise and consent. We take it very seriously. Here that means \nwe have to consider what happens. The Armed Services Committee, upon \nwhich I do not have a chance to serve, completed its consideration of \nSenator Hagel's nomination 2 days ago. Now it is before the whole body. \nHe is the President's appointee. The President has a right to appoint \npeople in whom he has confidence. But we have a constitutional \nresponsibility to consider the nominee.\n  A number of Republican Senators have questions, including the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the Senator from South Carolina, that they would like to \nhave answered. I think they are entitled to that. I think if the shoe \nwere on the other foot and it were a Republican President making a \nnomination, Democratic Senators would say the same thing: Give us a \nreasonable amount of time to consider this nomination on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I have a little experience in that myself. The first President Bush \nnominated me to be U.S. Education Secretary about 20 years ago. I \nthought I was a fairly noncontroversial nominee, much less important \nthan the Secretary of Defense. But I remember very well, it was 87 days \nbetween the time the President announced my nomination and the day on \nwhich the Senate unanimously confirmed me.\n  There was, at the time, a Senator from Ohio named Metzenbaum, who for \nwhatever reason decided the Senate needed more delay to consider my \nrecord and my background.\n  There is nothing new about this. I would respectfully suggest that \nthe majority leader's motion to cut off debate on Senator Hagel, made 2 \ndays after his nomination comes to the floor of the Senate, is \npremature.\n  Republican Senators have questions they would like to have answered. \nI think they are entitled to do that. When we come back from recess, 10 \ndays from now, I think that is sufficient time to consider those \nquestions. I will vote for cloture so we can have an up-or-down vote on \nthe President's nominee for the Secretary of Defense. I think the \nPresident is entitled to that but not prematurely.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I note that the present occupant of the \nchair is familiar with the rigors of this process as well. So I think \nit is important to note. Again, I wish to say that it is one thing to \nsupport or oppose a nominee, but I do not believe a nominee deserves a \ndragged-out process. I think the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts would agree with me; that it might be a disincentive \nin the future for well-qualified men and women who want to serve, who \nsee a process that is dragged out and allegations made and requirements \nfor disclosure that frankly are not required.\n  I note the presence of the majority leader on the floor, so I would \nlike to filibuster for an hour or so.\n  I yield to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, at the request of the Republicans, I ask \nunanimous consent that at 4:15 today, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the Hagel nomination; that the time until \n4:15 be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. My \ndesignee is Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I will not object because \nof the assurances of my three friends from the other side of the aisle \nstating that they plan on voting for cloture. They obviously said they \nwill not vote for cloture today, which is, I think, too bad because \nthere has been more than enough time in the last 2 days to read the \nadditional speeches that have been coming in.\n  The only argument that was raised beyond that, that I know of, has to \ndo with a payment from an equity fund. That was received. It has been \nfully explained. It is a highly reputable fund that Senator Hagel was \nan adviser to, similar to many other very reputable people. So I think \nthe continuation of what amounts to a filibuster, since 60-vote votes \nare required to end debate, is too bad when there is a Secretary of \nDefense who is leaving to go back to California, and we very much need \nto have our new Secretary of Defense in place, given the circumstances \nin this world.\n  We have a budget crisis in this country. Our sequester is confronting \nus. That sequester will have a damaging effect on the Defense \nDepartment, on the men and women in uniform, and on programs, the \nequipment, the training they need to be ready for any kind of a \ncontingency.\n  So the delay in having a vote on cloture, to me, is a mistake, and we \nought to approve the ending of the debate today so we can get on with \nthe confirmation vote, which will be a majority vote. After there is a \ncloture vote, debate is finally ended in this body, the final passage \nof a bill or the vote on the nominee is a majority vote, not 60 votes. \nSo I am hoping there will be 60 votes today so we can get on with \napproval of this nominee, hopefully shortly thereafter, and fill this \nspot which is sitting there waiting to be filled.\n  We have North Korea exploding a nuclear device. We have a war going \non in Afghanistan. We need to have a Secretary of Defense in place. So \nI hope there is not a delay. Following the vote today, I hope we do \ninvoke cloture, because I think there has been more than adequate time. \nSurely, there has been time on the floor when we have had hour after \nhour go by with no one who seeks to be recognized to speak.\n  I do hope that if the unanimous consent proposal is agreed to, there \nwill be 60 votes today. But if not, then there will be no alternative \nbut to have the vote when we come back. At that point, we would, of \ncourse, look forward to the support, at least on cloture, of the three \nSenators who have just spoken, our friends on the other side of the \naisle.\n  That is the best we can hope for. But that is my hope. I will not \nobject because of that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object. I will \nnot object, I will just respond to my friend. He is my dear friend. I \ndid not note that sense of urgency for 3 months when John Tower's \nnomination was held in limbo by the then-majority\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\nDemocrats. The Secretary of Defense post was vacant at that time as \nwell. So this is not the first time in history a Secretary of Defense \nposition has been vacant.\n  Again, I hope we can get this resolved, move forward. I think the \nSenator from Michigan, my friend, understands we can get this issue \nresolved on the day we return from the recess. Certainly, there are, I \nbelieve, sufficient votes to invoke cloture at that time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Arizona would yield for 1 minute, I do \nnot believe Senator Tower was filibustered. There was a delay in \ngetting to that vote. But I do not believe there was a requirement--I \nmay be wrong on this. I do not believe there was a filibuster for the \nSecretary of Defense nominee at that time, and many Secretary of \nDefense nominees have been approved in a matter of days, just the way \nSenator Kerry was approved in a matter of days.\n  So circumstances differ nominee to nominee. I again will not object, \nbased on the statements which we have heard from my friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I always enjoy some exchanges with my \nfriend, the chairman. But the fact is, as the chairman knows, that was \ndelayed and delayed and delayed. A new allegation came in, it was \ndelayed. A new allegation came in, it was delayed. All those \nallegations turned out to be false. I will not rewrite history anymore, \nexcept to say it was one of the more shameful chapters, in my view, in \nthe history of the Senate.\n  Again, I thank him. I am confident that within 1 week or so we will \nprobably have this vote completed. I do not object to the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 30 minutes on either side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For all the years that I have known Senator Hagel, I have \nknown him to be an honorable man and a patriot in this Chamber and \nelsewhere--overseas, in the field of battle. Senator Hagel has served \nthis country faithfully and with distinction.\n  We have our differences. Senator Hagel was and remains my friend. \nThere was a time when Senator Hagel and I saw the world and America's \nrole in it in much the same way.\n  When the Balkans were torn apart with mass atrocities and genocide, \nSenator Hagel and I stood together with Senators Bob Dole and Joe \nLieberman to lend bipartisan support to President Clinton in taking \nmore forceful action to end the slaughter.\n  In May 1999, Senator Hagel said on this very floor why the United \nStates should intervene militarily in Kosovo:\n\n       But we also understand there are things worth going to war \n     for, there are things worth dying for. . . . When people are \n     being slaughtered at a rather considerable rate, and genocide \n     is occurring, and ethnic cleansing is occurring, and people \n     are being driven from their homes.\n\n  On and on.\n\n       What do we do now? The geopolitical consequences, the \n     humanitarian consequences involved in this are great.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       History has surely taught us that when you defer the tough \n     decisions, when you let the butchers continue and the tyrants \n     and dictators continue, it gets worse. And it has gotten \n     worse with Milosevic. For 10 years we've dealt with him. Four \n     wars he's started.\n\n  Et cetera.\n  I agreed with his statement at the time, and I still do. I think it \napplies with greater or equal force to Syria today. I am not sure that \nSenator Hagel believes that anymore.\n  When America was attacked on September 11, 2001, Senator Hagel and I \nurged a strong American response to vanquish the enemies who attacked \nus, beginning in Afghanistan. Two years later, President Bush decided \nthe United States may have to use force against Saddam Hussein in Iraq, \nand then Senator Hagel and I voted to authorize the use of force in \nIraq.\n  Senator Hagel and I were often together in our criticism of the Bush \nadministration's conduct of the war in Iraq. We both were disturbed by \nthe apparent arrogance of then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and \nhis abject failure to respond to the clear fact that we were losing the \nwar in Iraq on the ground.\n  In August 2003 I urged President Bush to send more troops. The \nSenator from South Carolina and I called for the resignation of the \nSecretary of Defense, and we wanted to change our strategy, to replace \nmilitary and civilian leaders who were failing in their \nresponsibilities. Senator Hagel, on the other hand, believed we should \ncut our losses and withdraw from Iraq.\n  Since that time, Senator Hagel has taken policy positions that I \nbelieve call into question the quality of his professional judgment on \nissues critical to national defense. I am also concerned that Senator \nHagel is ill-suited to lead the 2.5 million uniformed members of the \nArmed Services and to ensure the sound management of an agency that has \nan annual budget equal to the 17th largest economy in the world.\n  Of all the responsibilities of government, none is more fundamental \nthan providing for the Nation's defense. We must have the most \nqualified and able person for the position, and having carefully \nreviewed Senator Hagel's long public record, I find his nomination \nwanting.\n  Senator Hagel's appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nfailed to allay my concerns about his nomination. During the hearing he \nrepeatedly refused to give an assessment of his previous statements on \nissues such as the troop surge in Iraq, the identification and \nengagement of terrorist organizations, and his past rhetoric about our \nallies. In response to these questions, he either assigned history the \ntask of judging the merit of his past statements and positions or \nsimply said:\n\n       If I had an opportunity to edit that, like many things I've \n     said, I would--I would like to go back and change the words \n     and the meaning.\n\n  History isn't likely to affirm Senator Hagel's declaration that the \ndecision to increase forces in order to wage a counterinsurgency in \nIraq, a decision that helped prevent our losing that war, he said was \nthe most dangerous foreign policy blunder since Vietnam.\n  It is quite obvious now that statement was histrionic, woefully \nuninformed, and absurd. But I didn't raise it at Senator Hagel's \nhearing for the satisfaction of an ``I told you so'' moment, but to \ndetermine if Senator Hagel recognizes he was in error and, more \nimportantly, if that recognition informs his judgment today.\n  I wanted to know if he had learned from his mistakes. Unfortunately, \nI am not confident that he has. After 2 weeks of reviewing his record, \nmy concerns about whether Senator Hagel is ready to serve as Secretary \nof Defense have not diminished.\n  Nothing in Senator Hagel's background indicates he would effectively \nmanage the Department of Defense. In today's unprecedented environment \nof fiscal uncertainty, ensuring that defense investment decisions \naffecting an agency as massive and unwieldy as the Department of \nDefense do not adversely impact our military readiness is enormously \nchallenging. It requires that the Secretary have, as Secretary Gates \nand Secretary Panetta had, a proven track record of successfully \nmanaging large and complex organizations. Senator Hagel has no \nexperience.\n  There are those of us who seek to cut waste, fraud, and abuse from \nthe Department of Defense. Senator Hagel seeks something else \nentirely--to cut military capabilities that serve as tools to ensure \nour continued engagement throughout the world in support of America's \ninterests and those of our allies.\n  In the eyes of the President, at least, Senator Hagel, however, \napparently is the right man to oversee the continuing drawdown of the \nArmed Services. Over the past 4 years, the administration has pursued a \nprogram of defense reductions that exceed those expected of a normal \npost-war drawdown, cuts that have begun to directly undermine U.S. \nglobal military power. Last week, Secretary Panetta said people would \nstand by and deliberately hurt this country in terms of our national \ndefense by letting sequestration take place.\n\n  My doubts about Senator Hagel's suitability extend beyond his \nprospective management of defense budgetary resources. The North \nKoreans recently tested another nuclear weapon. Iraq is\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\nunraveling. The Iranians just rejected Vice President Biden's proposal \nat the Munich Security Conference for one-on-one talks concerning \nnuclear weapons. Libya, Mali, Tunisia, and Egypt are in various states \nof unrest, for which we have no strategy. We are in the most unsettled \nperiod since the end of the Cold War, and I have serious concerns as to \nthe quality of Senator Hagel's professional judgment and the acuity of \nhis views on critical areas of national security, including security in \nEast Asia and the Middle East.\n  His record on Iraq was particularly troubling. As I alluded to a \nmoment ago, in 2002 Senator Hagel voted to authorize the use of force \nagainst Iraq. By 2006, his support for the war had diminished.\n  After Republican losses in the 2006 midterm elections, the Senator \nwrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post under the title \n``Leaving Iraq, Honorably,'' foreshadowing his opposition to the surge \nand advocating ``a phased troop withdrawal from Iraq.'' When President \nBush announced his decision to surge troops in 2007, Senator Hagel \nactively campaigned against it.\n  He voted in February 2007 in favor of a bill expressing opposition to \nthe surge and later in favor of measures to set a date certain for \nwithdrawal of troops from Iraq, an equally bad policy. Senator Hagel \nwrote in his 2008 memoir, ``America: Our Next Chapter'' that ``history \n. . . will show'' that his legislative efforts to oppose the surge \ncorrectly framed the political matters at issue at the time.\n  Carl Levin, on the other hand, said in 2009:\n\n       In considering whether or not to surge troops in Iraq . . . \n     I think that history will show that President Bush reached \n     the right decision.\n\n  Senator Hagel advocated the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from \nIraq by 2007 rather than negotiating an agreement for an enduring \npresence of U.S. forces. The President ultimately did exactly what \nSenator Hagel recommended, reportedly against the advice of military \nleaders. In response to written questions on this matter, Senator Hagel \nagain stated that the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq was \nthe right call and asserted that Iraq is in a better place today \nbecause of it. That is another Orwellian statement.\n  In fact, since the withdrawal of our forces in 2011, the fragile \npolitical accommodation made possible by the surge of 2007 has \nunraveled over the past year. Al-Qaida in Iraq is remobilizing. \nIranian-backed Shiite militias are gaining strength. Meanwhile the \ncountry is on the brink of civil war as protests against the Maliki \ngovernment draw thousands, Iranian aircraft are flying over Iraq with \nweapons for Syria, and there are many other examples. Nevertheless, \nSenator Hagel is equally quick to advocate full withdrawal from \nAfghanistan despite conditions on the ground or the advice of military \ncommanders.\n  Senator Hagel's views on Iran are also profoundly troubling. \nConsider, for instance, his recent set of incorrect and confused \nresponses to basic questions about President Obama's Iran policy during \nhis confirmation hearing last month, which one senior White House \nofficial rightfully described as ``somewhere between baffling and \nincomprehensible.''\n  I am more deeply concerned by Senator Hagel's overall record on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, may I ask how much time \nremains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 19 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the last two speakers on our \nside--the last would be me, the next to last would be Senator Graham--\nbe given 5 minutes for Senator Graham and 7 minutes for me.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection--reserving the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 minutes remaining on each side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I assume the 12 minutes the Senator referred to would be \ncounted against their time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, Senator Hagel's opposition to the use of \nsanctions, his apparent confusion about administration policies and its \nimplications, and his apparent incomprehension of the threat a nuclear-\narmed Iran poses to international stability is alarming and would cause \nother nations to doubt the credibility of the President's commitments.\n  Senator Hagel is an honorable man who has sacrificed much and bravely \nfor our Nation. About his character and love of country, there can be \nno doubt or debate. However, his positions on the principal national \nsecurity issues facing our country--the Iranian nuclear program, the \nresurgent Islamist terrorist threat in North Africa and the Middle \nEast, and, more broadly, whether we should maintain our ability to \nproject strength in defense of our interests and allies'--indicate to \nme a disqualifying lack of professional judgment. Also, Senator Hagel's \ncomplete lack of experience in running an enterprise of such size and \ncomplexity casts further doubt.\n  Therefore, despite my esteem for Senator Hagel, on the basis of his \nrecord, I will not support his confirmation. I say this with regret, \nbut he is the wrong person at the worst time for the job this day. We \ncan and must do better.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I wish to ask my colleagues to support \nthe Hagel nomination. Let me just hit a couple of highlights.\n  He volunteered to go into the Army during Vietnam. He was assigned to \nGermany. He volunteered to go to Vietnam.\n  His brother was assigned in one part of Vietnam, he in another. His \nbrother Tom and he asked to be in the same unit. While on patrol in the \njungles at night, his brother saved his life. On another patrol at \nnight, he saved his brother's life. He was wounded twice. He was \nmedevaced. He asked to go back into the fight.\n  He has served as Deputy Administrator of the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs with a quarter of a million employees under his management. He \nrepresented the State of Nebraska in the Senate for 12 years. He \ncoauthored the post-9/11 GI bill with Senator Webb. Out of uniform and \naway from Capitol Hill, he has lead the USO.\n  This is exceptionally capable man, who is a patriot, has given \nextensive testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. He has \ncleared up the issues that have been asked over and over, including one \nthat was raised about his role in authoring the Global Zero \nreport. First, the report didn't propose anything. It was, in the words \nspecifically used in the front end of the report, ``illustrative,'' \nproposing nothing but laying out different scenarios and possibilities. \nThere was nothing that was proposed in a recommendation that we \nunilaterally disarm, reduce the arsenal, or eliminate the triad. And \nthat would especially be so since another of the coauthors was General \nCartwright, the former commander of U.S. Strategic Command and the \neighth Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n\n  This is a critical time for national defense. It is a critical time \nfor our country. We need to get on and approve the nomination so he can \nget on with his duties as Secretary of Defense.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I have 5 minutes. Would the Presiding \nOfficer let me know when 4 minutes has elapsed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an opinion piece by the editorial board for the \nWashington Post dated December 18, 2012.\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 18, 2012]\n\n       Chuck Hagel is Not the Right Choice for Defense Secretary\n\n       Former Senator Chuck Hagel, whom President Obama is \n     reportedly considering for defense secretary, is a Republican \n     who would offer a veneer of bipartisanship to the national \n     security team. He would not, however, move it toward the \n     center, which is the usual role of such opposite-party \n     nominees. On the contrary: Mr. Hagel's stated positions on \n     critical issues, ranging from defense spending to Iran, fall \n     well to the left of those pursued by Mr. Obama during his \n     first term--and place him near the fringe of the Senate that \n     would be asked to confirm him.\n       The current secretary, Leon Panetta, has said the defense \n     ``sequester'' cuts that Congress mandated to take effect Jan. \n     1 would have dire consequences for U.S. security. Mr. Hagel \n     took a very different position when asked about Mr. Panetta's \n     comment during a September 2011 interview with the Financial \n     Times. ``The Defense Department, I think in many ways, has \n     been bloated,'' he responded. ``So I think the Pentagon needs \n     to be pared down.''\n       While both Republicans and Democrats accept that further \n     cuts in defense may be inevitable, few have suggested that a \n     reduction on the scale of the sequester is responsible. In \n     congressional testimony delivered around the same time as Mr. \n     Hagel's interview, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said \n     the sequester would lead to ``a severe and irreversible \n     impact on the Navy's future,'' ``a Marine Corps that's below \n     the end strength to support even one major contingency'' and \n     ``an unacceptable level of strategic and operational risk'' \n     for the Army.\n       Mr. Hagel was similarly isolated in his views about Iran \n     during his time in the Senate. He repeatedly voted against \n     sanctions, opposing even those aimed at the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps, which at the time was \n     orchestrating devastating bomb attacks against U.S. troops in \n     Iraq. Mr. Hagel argued that direct negotiations, rather than \n     sanctions, were the best means to alter Iran's behavior. The \n     Obama administration offered diplomacy but has turned to \n     tough sanctions as the only way to compel Iran to negotiate \n     seriously.\n       Mr. Obama has said that his policy is to prevent Iran from \n     obtaining a nuclear weapon and that containment is not an \n     option. Mr. Hagel has taken a different view, writing in a \n     2008 book that ``the genie of nuclear weapons is already out \n     of the bottle, no matter what Iran does.'' The former senator \n     from Nebraska signed on to an op-ed in The Post this \n     September that endorsed ``keeping all options on the table'' \n     for stopping Iran's nuclear program. But Mr. Hagel has \n     elsewhere expressed strong skepticism about the use of force.\n       We share that skepticism--but we also understand that, \n     during the next year or two, Mr. Obama may be forced to \n     contemplate military action if Iran refuses to negotiate or \n     halt its uranium-enrichment program. He will need a defense \n     secretary ready to support and effectively implement such a \n     decision. Perhaps Mr. Hagel would do so; perhaps he would \n     also, if installed at the Pentagon, take a different view of \n     defense spending. (Mr. Hagel declined through a spokesman to \n     speak to us about his views.)\n       What's certain is that Mr. Obama has available other \n     possible nominees who are considerably closer to the \n     mainstream and to the president's first-term policies. Former \n     undersecretary of defense Michele Flournoy, for example, is a \n     seasoned policymaker who understands how to manage the \n     Pentagon bureaucracy and where responsible cuts can be made. \n     She would bring welcome diversity as the nation's first \n     female defense secretary.\n       Mr. Hagel is an honorable man who served the country with \n     distinction as a soldier in Vietnam and who was respected by \n     his fellow senators. But Mr. Obama could make a better choice \n     for defense secretary.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is an editorial about the nomination of Senator \nHagel to be Secretary of Defense. The Washington Post said:\n\n       Mr. Hagel's stated positions of critical issues ranging \n     from defense spending to Iran fall well to the left of those \n     proposed by Mr. Obama during his first term and place him \n     near the fringe of the Senate that would be asked to confirm \n     him.\n\n  The last line is:\n\n       Mr. Hagel is an honorable man who served the country with \n     distinction as a soldier in Vietnam and who was respected by \n     his fellow Senators, but Mr. Obama can make a better choice \n     for defense secretary.\n\n  That sort of sums up where I am: a fine man. If it were about \nfriendship, there wouldn't be a problem. This is about the times in \nwhich we live. And I want to echo the statements of the Washington Post \nabout him being out of the mainstream.\n  We have had two hearings, and we will have a couple of votes in the \nnext week or so. I would say to my colleagues regarding the cloture \nvote today, they have every right to say now is not the time to end the \ndebate about Senator Hagel. He was reported out of the committee at 5 \no'clock Tuesday. There are some legitimate questions and information we \nhaven't gathered, and we should be able to have an opportunity to look \nat that, and people not already committed should have a chance to \nreview this information. So the idea of waiting until after the break \nmakes eminent sense. I think we will be better informed regarding our \ndecision. Debate should continue for at least that period of time.\n  Senator Kerry was able to get out of committee and to be voted on the \nsame day because all of us felt comfortable with John Kerry, even \nthough we may have disagreed with his politics. I believe John Kerry is \na good man. We are on opposite sides of the issues sometimes when it \ncomes to Iraq and initially Syria, but I have always thought he was in \nthe mainstream of the debate. So he got 97 votes because we felt \ncomfortable with him. You can tell people on our side, and some others, \nquite frankly, in the Democratic Party have expressed some discomfort.\n  I would argue that after the hearing there is more discomfort than \nthere was before the hearing. Senator Inhofe and Senator Levin, we had \na very good hearing, but to me it was unnerving, some of the things \nthat came out of that hearing. The performance created more questions \nand doubts than it created confidence.\n  That is the question the Washington Post posed. It is one thing to be \nin the left lane, the right lane, or the center lane, but I would say \nSenator Hagel's statements and votes put him in a league of his own. \nAnd that is why I will vote no.\n  When it comes to Israel and his statement that ``The Jewish lobby \nintimidates a lot of people up here. I'm not an Israeli Senator, I'm a \nUnited States Senator,'' Senator Hagel, to his credit, said that was \ninappropriate and he apologized. But think for a minute how many of my \ncolleagues would have said that. I asked him to name one Senator who \nhas been intimidated, and he couldn't name one. I asked him to name one \npolicy we have enacted because of the Jewish Israeli lobby, and he \ncouldn't name a policy.\n  Now we find out today--and I don't know if this has been verified, \nbut it is posted--that an aide of his reported that during a speech \nSenator Hagel gave several years ago he said the U.S. Department of \nState was an extension of the Israeli Government. Now this is showing a \nchip on one shoulder about Israel--an unhealthy statement, to say the \nleast, and I think patently false. But it is unnerving to a guy like \nme, and I can only imagine what kind of signal a statement such as that \nsends in these dangerous times.\n  On Iran he was one of two Senators to vote against renewing \nunilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran and Libya in 2001. He was one of \ntwelve Senators who did not sign a letter asking the European Union to \ndeclare Hezbollah a terrorist organization. He refused to designate the \nIranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization in 2007----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Presiding Officer. While they were killing \nour soldiers in Iraq. He refused to sign a letter to President George \nW. Bush, he said, to engage in direct unconditional comprehensive talks \nwith the Government of Iran. He was for that, telling Bush to do it \nunconditionally. He voted against comprehensive Iranian sanctions.\n  He was one of two Senators who failed to sign a letter to President \nClinton showing unconditional support for the State of Israel.\n  I would argue that this man's record, when it comes to Iran and \nIsrael, and statements he has made, puts him well out of the \nmainstream. The Washington Post was right when they said he is on the \nfringe. And now is not the time to have somebody on the fringe serving \nas Secretary of Defense when it comes to Iran and Israel. For that \nreason, I will vote no. I will oppose cloture because debate should \ncontinue. When we get back, unless there is a real bombshell, I will \nvote for cloture and move on to his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I am proud to support Chuck Hagel for \nSecretary of Defense. If Chuck can make it through the jungles of \nVietnam, he can surely make it through the bureaucracy of the Pentagon.\n  America needs Chuck as its Secretary of Defense to bring our troops \nhome and to keep our military the strongest in the world. Sergeant \nHagel is an American hero. When so many Americans were dodging the \ndraft, he volunteered to serve in Vietnam. The draft board gave him the \noption to return to college, but Chuck refused. He said:\n\n       I think the best thing for me is to go in the Army. It may \n     not be the best thing for the Army, but I think that's the \n     way to get all this straightened out. I was the oldest of \n     four boys. My father [had] passed away, and I just was not \n     coming together the way I should come together. There was a \n     war going on in Vietnam. I felt a sense of some \n     responsibility. So I said, ``No. Let's--let's go. And so I \n     volunteered for the draft, went in the Army and celebrated my \n     21st birthday down at White Sands Missile Range.''\n\n  And Chuck didn't serve in a safe billet. When assigned to Germany, he \nprotested and asked to deploy to Vietnam. So he volunteered for Vietnam \nand saw the horrors of war as an infantry sergeant.\n  Chuck and his younger brother Tom are the only known American \nbrothers to serve side by side in Vietnam. At different times, they \nrisked their own lives to save each other's. At one point, Tom \nfrantically dressed a wound around Chuck's chest hoping, praying, that \nhis older brother would make it out of Vietnam alive. And Chuck \neventually returned the favor by dragging Tom out of a burning vehicle \njust before it exploded, saving his brother's life. Talk about brothers \nin arms, these were real brothers in arms.\n\n  These experiences made Chuck who he is, and they help you and me \nunderstand why he is the right man to run the Pentagon and to be put in \ncharge of defending America. Just listen to how Chuck describes what it \nwas like to serve in Vietnam. He says:\n\n       I walked a lot of point, and my brother Tom and I together \n     walked a lot of point, which was all right. You know what \n     happens to a lot of point men, but I always felt a little \n     better if I was up front than somebody else.\n\n  Chuck is willing to walk point for America now. He has been walking \npoint for most of his life. This is how Chuck describes a point man:\n\n       A point man, as I think most people know, is the individual \n     who is out front. And these are usually squad-sized patrols, \n     sometimes a company-sized patrol, depending on the mission. \n     And you have the front--physically the front position, but \n     also the responsibility of essentially not walking your squad \n     or your company into an ambush or a trap. So you had to be \n     very, very focused on the peripheral vision and the antenna \n     and just the sense and the instincts that something doesn't \n     look right or grenades hanging in trees, which booby traps \n     were just a way of life. You dealt with that all the time. \n     And there were a lot of guys who just didn't pay attention to \n     it. They just--that's just the way they were. And I, again, \n     always felt better if I was up front than maybe some others.\n\n  Let me repeat that: Chuck Hagel always felt better if he was up \nfront, where it was most dangerous. We live in dangerous times today \nand we need a man such as Chuck Hagel right now who has seen the \nhorrors of war and will do all he can to prevent another generation \nfrom seeing them.\n  In my interactions with Chuck, I have been struck by his honesty, his \nsincerity, and his commonsense approach. I know if he were still a \nsitting U.S. Senator, we would probably be great friends. That is \nbecause we come from similar backgrounds and the same generation. He is \nlike many Americans. He grew up in a working class, ``salt of the \nearth'' family. In Chuck's words, he was raised in Little Town, NE, \nwhere the local legion club and the VFW hall were the centers of the \nuniverse.\n  I could go on and on about Chuck Hagel, but let me say this in \nclosing. When I think about people and I go to my little town in my \ncommunity where I grew up--in Farmington, WV--and I know Chuck grew up \nin a small town--I can shake people's hands and look them in the eye \nand they see me to my soul. They know if I am sincere or I am telling \nthe truth. And I want to say to all of you that I have shaken Chuck \nHagel's hand. I have looked him in his eyes and I saw the soul of a \ngood man, a man I want leading this country and taking care of our \nyouth, our infantry, our men and women in uniform. So I implore all of \nmy colleagues to consider voting for Chuck Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 22 minutes and the \nRepublicans have 12 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  As so many of my colleagues have described, Chuck Hagel is a soldier, \na statesman, a businessman, a patriot. As my colleague from West \nVirginia pointed out, he could have chosen a much easier path in the \n1960s, a path that many trod, but he chose the most difficult. He not \nonly joined the Army, but he volunteered for Vietnam, when he had the \nopportunity to serve honorably and well in Europe. He joined his \nbrother at Fort Dix. He knows the pressures our men and women face. And \nhe knows the decisions we make here, and the decisions that are made in \nthe Pentagon, ultimately are carried out by those young men and women \nin uniform. In fact, I can't think of anyone over the last several \ndecades who has learned that lesson so well.\n  The other thing that is so impressive is that this is not a one-\ndimensional resume. Chuck Hagel was a businessman, and very successful. \nHe founded his own company, created jobs, and created opportunities. He \nwas the Deputy Administrator of the Veterans' Administration. He has \nrun a large Federal agency. Very seldom do people come into one of \nthese positions having run a Federal agency, or at least being the \nsecond in command. And he has been a U.S. Senator. So he knows very \nwell the procedures and the personalities that are here in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  To me, though, some of the most compelling endorsements come from \nthose who have actually done the job before. When Bob Gates and Bill \nCohen and Bill Perry stand up and say, this is the person for the job, \nyou have to believe that. These gentlemen have done the job for \nRepublican Presidents and Democratic Presidents, and they have done it \nwith great distinction.\n  Then when you get somebody such as Brent Scowcroft, who is, in my \nview, one of the most knowledgeable and authoritative voices in \nnational security, and was the National Security Adviser to President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush--who also weighed in, along with Madeleine \nAlbright--you have compelling, irrefutable evidence and testimony from \nthose who have done the job that Chuck Hagel can do the job.\n  There has been a lot said and discussed as to whether he truly \nappreciates the relationship between the United States and some of our \nclosest allies, particularly Israel. Here we have the current Deputy \nForeign Minister of Israel Danny Ayalon, who also serves as our \nAmbassador from Israel to the United States, saying that he has met \nhim, he feels, in his view--and I will paraphrase--he has a true \nunderstanding of the natural partnership between the United States and \nIsrael. Again, that is compelling evidence.\n  If you add to that the unconditional endorsement of several former \nU.S. Ambassadors to Israel, American patriots who have dedicated \nthemselves to maintaining a strong, vital, vibrant, and crucial \nrelationship for both the State of Israel and the United States, the \nevidence accumulates more and more that the President has chosen well \nand wisely.\n  This is a critical time. We are looking at conflicts in Afghanistan, \nwe are looking at a nuclear detonation on the Korean peninsula, we are \nlooking at budget problems that have never faced any previous Secretary \nof Defense and that have to be addressed within days or weeks. There is \na ministerial meeting next week in Brussels for our defense ministers. \nWe have to maintain our alliances. All these forces come together.\n  So I think the evidence is overwhelming. The President has chosen \nwell and wisely.\n  But let me make one final point. This is a historic vote. By my \nrecollection, no nominee for the Secretary of Defense has been \ndefeated, delayed, or dismissed on a procedural vote.\n  Our history suggests, because of this office, because it is one so \nclosely associated with the President making life-\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\nand-death decisions, that deference is given to that choice--at least \nthat it is not caught up in a procedural battle, that there is an up-\nor-down vote. My colleagues, in good faith, after careful study, can \nvote yea or nay, but to defeat someone on a procedural vote would be \nunprecedented and unwarranted. As a result, I would urge that this \nprocedural motion before us be carried, cloture be dispensed with, and \nwe can get on to expressing our true feelings based on the evidence and \nbased on our best judgment of whether Senator Hagel should serve as \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Cruz, is ill and \nunable to speak on this nomination. He has, however, expressed his \nconcerns to me in the form of a letter. I appreciate his contributions \nto this debate throughout the committee process.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                February 14, 2013.\n     Senator James Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I continue to have considerable \n     concerns with the unnecessary rush to force through a vote on \n     Chuck Hagel's nomination before he has adequately responded \n     to multiple requests from members of the Armed Services \n     Committee for additional information.\n       Our requests directly relate to matters he would have \n     significant influence over as our nation's Secretary of \n     Defense and are based on his alarming record on foreign \n     policy matters. For instance, Sen. Hagel has repeatedly \n     declined to support measures to crack down on state sponsors \n     of terrorism, belittled the notion of using any means to \n     prevent a nuclear Iran, advised U.S. leaders to engage in \n     direct negotiations with rogue nations and hostile terrorist \n     groups, and expressed remarkable antagonism towards the \n     longstanding U.S. alliance with Israel. Moreover, these are \n     all positions he's disavowed since his nomination.\n       These deeply concerning positions rightfully raise the \n     question of what conflicts of interest could exist as a \n     result of financial compensation he has received in the \n     recent past. Under the Senate's responsibility to advise and \n     consent on nominations, it is completely appropriate to make \n     these requests for disclosure--requests that are absolutely \n     relevant to the role of our nation's Secretary of Defense. \n     Several senators, who currently oppose such requests for \n     information, contradict their own past statements that affirm \n     the importance of disclosures related to executive branch \n     nominations.\n       In a February 6 letter, 25 senators, including every \n     Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and both \n     the Minority Leader and the Whip, agreed that neither the \n     Committee nor the full Senate has sufficient information to \n     assess Sen. Hagel's nomination.\n       In order to have sufficient information, we have submitted \n     several requests. This includes requests for disclosure on \n     the personal compensation that he has received in the last \n     five years--information which is entirely within his own \n     control; requests for additional disclosure on foreign funds \n     that he may have received indirectly, and whether any such \n     foreign funds raise conflicts of interest; requests for a \n     complete list of his prior public speeches, notably multiple \n     speeches on controversial topics have been made public by the \n     press, despite those speeches having been omitted from his \n     own disclosures; and a critical request from the \n     Administration regarding additional information about the \n     precise actions taken on September 11, 2012, during and \n     immediately following the tragic murder of four Americans in \n     Benghazi.\n       I believe that to date, responses to these requests are \n     insufficient. Very few positions have as great an impact on \n     national security as does the Secretary of Defense and it is \n     our responsibility to ensure that those nominated to serve in \n     this critical position are held to the highest standards.\n       I am prepared to move forward on Senator Hagel's nomination \n     in a timely manner, but I do not believe the Senate should \n     vote on that nomination unless and until he provides adequate \n     disclosure in response to these requests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Ted Cruz.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me start off by saying that I agree \nwith almost everything they have said on both sides about Chuck Hagel. \nI agree that he was a hero. I think of my own Army career and I think \nof his and how much greater his was. That isn't the issue.\n  I think both Senator Graham and Senator McCain said it very well. \nYes, his character is wonderful. We love the guy. He served his \ncountry. All of those things are true. The problem is the stances he \nhas taken regarding Israel and countries like Iran. Israel has \nhistorically been a very, very close ally of ours and, I have often \nsaid, our only true ally in the Middle East we can count on. But we \nneed to take a close look at Senator Hagel and how he would act, \njudging from his past performance, as the Secretary of Defense.\n  The vote that is coming up at 4:15 is the vote for or against Senator \nHagel. All of this talk about a procedural vote and filibustering: no. \nThis is the vote to determine whether Chuck Hagel should be the next \nSecretary of Defense.\n  This statement about filibustering has been made over and over again. \nThey say this the first time this has ever happened. Look, we have \npeople nominated all the time for Cabinet positions who are subjected \nto a 60-vote threshold. I will describe some of them right now, \nstarting on the Republican's side:\n  Kathleen Sebelius is now the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \nIn 2009 there were a lot of people who didn't think she would be good, \nand so they objected to force a 60-vote threshold. That is what \nhappened.\n  John Bryson was up for Secretary of Commerce. I didn't think he would \nmake a very good Secretary of Commerce. I opposed him, and he was \nsubjected to the 60-vote margin.\n  Here is the interesting thing. Today we have Barack Obama, who is a \nDemocratic President of the United States, and then we have Harry Reid, \nwho is the majority leader, so the Democrats are in control. During the \nlast Bush administration, we had exactly the reverse. George Bush was \nPresident of the United States and a Republican, and the Democrats were \nin the minority--the same situation.\n  So what happened? First of all, we had John Vogel come up. It was the \nsame thing--subjected to a 60-vote margin. We had Senator Dirk \nKempthorne. There were a lot of people who did not approve of him. He \nwas nominated by President Bush, a Republican, and the Democrats didn't \nlike him. They subjected him to a 60-vote margin. That wasn't a \nfilibuster then. This isn't a filibuster today.\n  People are trying to blame me as the bad guy who is causing a \nfilibuster. That is not the case at all, any more than it was the case \nback in 2005, 2006, and other times when we had a nominee who was put \nforth by President Bush who was objected to by the Democrats.\n  When Dirk Kempthorne was nominated to be the Secretary of Interior, \nthere was a lot of opposition to him by the Democrats. Of course they \nsaid: We have to subject him to a 60-vote threshold. The Secretary of \nthe Interior is a Cabinet position, but they seem to be drawing a \ndistinction, for some reason, between the Secretary of Defense and any \nother Cabinet positions. As Cabinet positions, they are the same. And \nthe process of requiring a 60-vote threshold happens over and over \nagain.\n  Senator Rob Portman--the same thing happened to him when he was \nappointed by President Bush to be the U.S. Trade Representative. The \ncloture motion was vitiated later on, but it was objected to first so \nthat he would have been subjected to a 60-vote threshold.\n  One that is kind of interesting is Stephen Johnson. President Bush \nappointed him to be the EPA Administrator. Actually, he was a guy whom \nI thought a lot of, and he was a Democrat. So we have here President \nBush, a Republican, appointing a Democrat who was objected to by the \nDemocrats. Now we have President Obama, a Democrat, nominating a \nRepublican who is objected to by the Republicans. It is exactly the \nreverse. There is no difference at all.\n  I am the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. I will stand \nup and walk through fire to make sure every member of the committee has \nall their questions answered. That is what advice and consent is all \nabout. We want to look at the individual. In the case of our committee, \nwe want to make sure every member of the Committee has a chance to look \nat the process and make sure everything is out there.\n  This is kind of a funny thing. The distinguished junior Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Cruz, lost his voice. For a Senator to lose his voice--what \nworse\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\ncan happen than that? So he is not able to speak, but if he could, I \nbelieve he would say: It is not so much my concern, the issues that \nhave been articulated by Senator McCain and by Senator Graham. My \nconcern is about the process.\n  Madam President, I give myself 3 additional minutes.\n  The fact is this new member of the committee, a new Member of the \nSenate, knew he was entitled to have all his questions answered. He has \ntried now for weeks. He was stonewalled. He can't get them. So this is \nabout the process. Senator Cruz is not making any accusations. He says: \nI just want the information I have asked for.\n  I have the utmost respect for Carl Levin. He and I, despite what the \nmedia wishes, get along great. I love the guy. We disagree now and then \non policy, but I really like him.\n\n  The other day, Carl Levin said:\n\n       Every member, every member should add his or her voice to \n     the demand for the production of relevant documents which \n     Senators need to decide on confirmation or for any other \n     legitimate reason.\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly with that, and that is exactly what these \nindividuals are asking for. They are asking for that information.\n  Senator Cruz is very articulate. I regret that he lost his voice \ntoday.\n  In the past, every time the minority has objected and has wanted as a \nmatter of procedure, to have a 60-vote margin, that is what has \nhappened. It has happened with a consent agreement. I asked for that, \nand I think we have that now, but we had to force it.\n  This is not a filibuster. It is the same thing that was required and \nrequested by Harry Reid, back when he was the minority leader, against \nJohn Bolton, against Stephen Johnson, against Robert Portman, and \nagainst Dirk Kempthorne. This is a normal way of operating.\n  A lot of us still don't have the information we want, but I am \nwilling and they are willing. I have checked with the people who have \nnot gotten all the information they want. They said: Let's go ahead and \nhave the vote. So, in a way, are they caving in? In fact, they are just \ndoing all they can to be conciliatory. I think we are doing everything \nwe can. We are not filibustering, and we don't want to string this out.\n  I repeat one last time that this vote is the vote on Chuck Hagel. It \nis not on procedure or anything else. It is a vote on Chuck Hagel.\n  Madam President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time does the majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes remaining for the majority \nand 3 minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is rare. Twice in the history of \nthe Senate have we had a filibuster involving a nominee for a Cabinet \nposition--twice.\n  But especially disappointing about this is that it was just a few \nweeks ago that we came together on a bipartisan basis and we said: We \nare not going to do this anymore. We are going to try to work together. \nWe are going to try to avoid these filibusters. And here we have, \nsadly, a historic filibuster over an appointment of a former Senator--\nChuck Hagel, a Republican of Nebraska--as Secretary of Defense.\n  I know there is controversy associated with his nomination, but I \nalso know Chuck Hagel. I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee \nwith him. We served together in the Senate. There is no question in my \nmind that the President made a good choice.\n  I will also tell you that you need to know a little bit about the man \nto understand why it is a historic choice. Chuck Hagel volunteered and \nenlisted in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam era. That was not a casual \ndecision. That was a time when enlisting in the Army meant you might \nrisk your life. He lucked out; he got stationed in a theater that \nwasn't at war. But what does he do next? He volunteered to go to \nVietnam. He volunteered as an enlisted man to go to Vietnam. And he \nwent there--with his brother, incidentally, the two of them--to serve \nin the U.S. Army. He was involved directly in combat, was given the \nPurple Heart for his service, and he told me personally about days he \nwill never forget as long as he lives. So does Chuck Hagel know what it \ntakes to be a soldier? Does he know what it takes to lead the \nDepartment of Defense? He certainly does.\n  I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee with him. I know his \nfeelings on the issues. And when I listen to how some of his positions \nhave been distorted, I find it hard to believe.\n  Chuck Hagel was a conservative Republican Senator and an honest man \nof integrity. And some of the things that have been said about him, \nsome of the charges that have been made in the course of the Armed \nServices Committee were just embarrassing, to think that colleagues in \nthe Senate would say that about a man they knew and served with \npersonally, or they should have known better than to say. That is why \nwe are here today.\n  The sad reality is that I have listened to many Republican Senators \nwho are not going to vote for Chuck Hagel come up here and talk about \nhow important it is to fill this position. The North Koreans detonated \nnuclear devices this week and raised concerns all over that part of the \nworld and beyond. We know what is going on in the Middle East, in Syria \nand other places. We still have 68,000-plus American soldiers who are \nliterally risking their lives--while we meet in the comfort and \nsecurity of the Senate Chamber--in Afghanistan. They are risking their \nlives, and we are saying: Well, we would sure like to appoint a \nSecretary of Defense, but we have to make a political point here today. \nWe have to vote against him today and put it off for 10 days, and then \nwe may reconsider it again. God forbid something awful occurs in the \nnext 10 days. I hope it doesn't.\n  There are still good people at the Pentagon, and I am sure they will \ndo a good job, but we should have that Secretary of Defense--one of the \nmost critical appointments in the President's Cabinet--filled. This \nnotion that we have to make a political stand here and stop Chuck Hagel \ntoday to make some political point really troubles me.\n  Some of the requests for information about Chuck Hagel go beyond any \nof the standards of disclosure we have ever seen before. This isn't \nfair. It isn't fair to Chuck Hagel. It isn't fair to the President. It \ncertainly isn't fair to the men and women in uniform all across the \nUnited States and around the world who are risking their lives for this \ncountry.\n  Those who come to the floor and say that in 10 days, he will be fine, \nfor goodness' sake, swallow your pride. Let's make sure we vote for him \ntoday. Let's fill this spot. Let's not have this sad historic \nfilibuster on this appointment to the President's Cabinet.\n  I really hope my colleagues will reflect on what Chuck Hagel has \nmeant in his life, his service to the country, his service to the State \nof Nebraska, and his service to this Nation as a Senator. He is a good \nman, and he will do a good job in the Department of Defense. I trust \nthe President's judgment.\n\n  For anyone who thinks they are making a political point in order to \nkind of show the President that we can still filibuster, I remind them \nit was just a few weeks ago that we stood on the floor of the Senate \nand said we were going to be more thoughtful about the use of the \nfilibuster in the future; we were going to be more careful that we \ndon't politicize it. Unfortunately, what is happening today is a \nserious disappointment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator, through the Chair, \na question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield time to the \nSenator from California. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Whatever my friend wishes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am glad we are voting today on the \nPresident's choice for Secretary of Defense, our former colleague, \nChuck Hagel. I stand here as a Senator who has had a number of \nquestions as well about some of the things he said in the past, some of \nthe votes he has cast, and some of his philosophy. And what I did, as \nsoon as I learned he was the President's pick, was to ask those \nquestions.\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nRemember the President is the Commander in Chief. This is a critical \nappointment. It has to be someone he has faith in, puts his trust in, \nand he picked someone. He picked a brave hero who served in Vietnam.\n  So I wrote all my questions down, and believe me, they covered some \ntough ground on women's rights, gay rights, Iran, and Israel. There \nwere a number of questions. I asked if it would be all right if when \nthe answers came we could put them online so people could see the \nanswers. The answer that came back was absolutely yes. The answers to \nmy questions were very clear and very strong.\n  Senator Hagel has evolved on certain issues. He admitted to a mistake \non a couple. That is the hardest thing for any politician to admit. \nThere are four words politicians hate to say, ``I made a mistake.'' He \nadmitted to that on a couple of issues.\n  I just think the way he is being treated is so sad. It is so sad. \nWhen I watch some of the questioning from my colleagues--not all of \nthem, a couple of them, and I am not referring to my dear friend, \nSenator Inhofe--it was reminiscent of a different time and place when \nsomeone would say: I have here in my pocket a speech that you made on \nsuch-and-such a date--and, of course, nothing was in the pocket. It was \nreminiscent of some bad times.\n  I am so glad we are voting today. I know it is going to be a close \nvote. I don't know what the outcome will be. I do believe eventually \nthis good man will be the Secretary of Defense. I believe that in my \nheart. If anyone is still undecided on this vote, let's understand that \nnever in history have we had a 60-vote requirement--to my knowledge--\nfor a nominee for Secretary of Defense. If I am wrong, I hope to be \ncorrected. There is a reason for it.\n  Lord knows I was one of the key voices of dissent on the Iraq war, \nand I was not happy about a lot of the people who were put into place \nby George W. Bush. Believe me, I didn't want to see them continue in \nthose positions. I think they led us astray in Iraq, and it led to so \nmany thousands of deaths. However, I never dreamed of requiring a 60-\nvote majority. In my view, this is not a good day for the Senate.\n  I know my friend, Senator Inhofe, is very sincere. I am on the \nForeign Relations Committee; I am a senior member of that committee. We \nhave listened to the State Department on Benghazi. We have had \nbriefings and hearings and answers came in. We had secret briefings \nthat were highly classified. We had open hearings--I would ask for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have to say, what more are you trying to get out of \nthis? Benghazi was a crisis. It was a disaster. It was terrible. There \nshould have been more security there, but don't blame the brave \nAmericans for it. Blame the terrorists who did this.\n  As the facts became available, those facts came right out. Why are we \ntrying to stop this good man because of something he had nothing to do \nwith?\n  In closing, I hope if you are on the fence, you will vote today for \nChuck Hagel, and a ``yes'' vote on cloture.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry before the clock starts: I \nunderstand we have 3 minutes left on our side. How many minutes are \nleft on the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 7 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't see anyone seeking recognition, so I will go \nahead and take the last 3 minutes.\n  First of all, it is very interesting that all of those on the other \nside who are supporting Senator Hagel to be the next Secretary of \nDefense, not one of them has said anything at all about the issues. \nThey all talk about the things with which we agree. He was a hero; we \nsaid it. Senator McCain said it and Senator Graham said it. We all \nagree he was a hero in the war, and he is deserving of this type of \nthing.\n  Why is it that no one has mentioned that Senator Hagel is one of only \ntwo Senators who voted against sanctions against Iran? Why is it they \ndon't mention that he was one of only four--in fact, all of them in the \nMajority signed a letter for solidarity with Israel. Senator Hagel was \none of four Senators who didn't sign that letter of solidarity for \nIsrael. The same thing with declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nas a terrorist group. He was one of only four Senators who did that.\n  I would only say this is not a filibuster. Everybody knows it is not \na filibuster. I hope the media is listening: This is not a filibuster. \nThis is the same process that was required by the Democrats in the case \nof John Bolton, in the case of Steve Johnson, in the case of Rob \nPortman, and in the case of Dirk Kempthorne. It is a prerogative of the \nSenate. It is not a filibuster. We merely want a 60-vote margin. We \nreceived it in all of those cases.\n\n  I commented earlier that when we had a Republican in the White House \nand a Democratic majority in the Senate they made that same \nrequirement. I was here in the Senate for all four of them. I never \nobjected to requiring a 60-vote threshold.\n  Then, of course, we had a 60-vote threshold for the nomination of \nKathleen Sebelius, who is serving now in a Cabinet position. The same \nthing. This is a Cabinet position. We had the Secretary of Commerce, \nJohn Bryson. I objected to him. He passed the 60-vote margin. The only \nissue is the 60-vote margin, and that is what we are talking about. It \nis not a filibuster.\n  The last thing I will do is read--since our last speaker is my very \ngood friend and chairman of the committee--what he said the other day. \nI wholeheartedly agreed with him when he said every Member should add \nhis or her voice to the demand for the production of relevant documents \nwhich Senators need to decide on confirmation. I agree with that. What \nwe object to is the process where we have Members who have made \nrequests for information that is relevant to this appointment, and they \nhave been unable to receive that information. So it is a process.\n  As the ranking minority on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nwill stand up for the rights of every single minority member of that \ncommittee. Senator Levin would do the same thing and stand up for the \nrights of every majority member of that committee in this process.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  First of all, the questions which have been asked of us to provide \nmaterials of the nominee have fallen into three categories: The first \none is to the White House about Benghazi, and those questions have been \nanswered. There have been requests for Senator Hagel's speeches, and \nthose speeches have been provided. Relative to financial disclosure, \nadditional financial disclosure, disclosure which is required by the \nrules, that has been provided.\n  The statement that was made by one of our colleagues about Corsair \nCapital is a statement which, frankly, is out of bounds. It is \ninappropriate for anyone to be asked about that when he is an adviser \nto a perfectly legitimate equity fund and has perfectly legitimate \nmembers on the board. There is no evidence--and the person making the \ninnuendo acknowledged that there is no evidence--that the funding came \nfrom Saudi Arabia, Iran, or any other inappropriate place.\n  So as for the information that has been provided, it is probably more \ninformation than probably any nominee--at least in recent memory--has \nhad to provide. We have done everything we possibly can.\n  Now in terms of the qualifications for Senator Hagel, this comes from \nformer Secretaries of State, National Security Advisers, National \nSecretaries of Defense, including Secretary of State Albright, National \nSecurity Adviser Berger, Secretary of Defense Brown, National Security \nAdviser Brezezinski, Secretary of Defense Cohen, Secretary of Defense \nGates, National Security Adviser Jones, Secretary of Defense Laird, \nNational Security Adviser McFarlane, Secretary of Defense Perry, \nSecretary of State and National Security Adviser Powell, Secretary of \nState Schultz, and National Security Adviser Scowcroft.\n  This is what they said, and this is the validation: We, obviously, \nknow Senator Hagel. We trust Senator Hagel. We believe in his \nqualifications.\n  These people are Democrats and Republicans who are outside of this \nbody, and here is what they say: From his\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\ntime as the Deputy Veterans' Administrator managing a quarter of a \nmillion employees, to during the Reagan Presidency, to turning around \nthe financially troubled World USO, to shepherding the post-9/11 GI \nbill into law as a United States Senator, and most recently through his \nservice on the Defense Policy Board at the Pentagon and as cochairman \nof the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, Chuck Hagel is uniquely \nqualified to meet the challenges facing the Department of Defense.\n  I have already put into the Record many of the statements that have \nbeen written by veterans organizations in support of Senator Hagel.\n  Senator Inhofe said when no one talks about his position on Iran, \nwell, yes, we do. Here is what he says:\n\n       Iran poses a significant threat to the United States, our \n     allies and partners, and our interests in the region and \n     globally. Iran continues to pursue an illicit nuclear program \n     that threatens to provoke a regional arms race and undermine \n     the global non-proliferation regime.\n\n  He is fully committed to the President's goal of preventing Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon. All options must be on the table to achieve \nthat goal. And relative to Israel, he has said he is a strong supporter \nof Israel. Even more importantly, the Deputy Minister of Israel said he \nis a good friend of Israel, and, indeed, in the words of Danny Ayalone, \nsaid he believes--and I am now talking about Senator Hagel--Hagel \nbelieves in the natural partnership between Israel and the United \nStates and is proud of the volume of defense relations between Israel \nand the United States which are so important to both countries.\n  Now the only question that remains is what we are voting on. What we \nare voting on is to end the filibuster. My good friend from Oklahoma \nsays it is not a filibuster, but the definition of ``filibuster,'' \nunder our rules, is you are going to continue to talk unless there are \n60 votes to end debate. That is what we are voting on. It is called \ncloture.\n  If we get cloture today, then there will be another vote on the \nnomination of Senator Hagel. The proof of that is that we have three \nRepublican Senators who stood up today and said that while they are \ngoing to vote against cloture today, they are going to vote for cloture \na week from this Tuesday. That is a procedural vote if I ever heard it. \nThey are still going to vote against his nomination, but they have \ndecided that they will vote for cloture a week from Tuesday. That is \nthe difference between the vote to end debate and the vote on the \nnomination itself. What we are deciding here today is whether a \nfilibuster will continue. That is not just me talking; that is the \nrules speaking. That is what the rules provide for, that we need 60 \nvotes to end debate.\n\n  Has there ever been a requirement before by opponents of a nominee \nthat there be 60 votes to end debate? Has this ever happened in \nhistory? Not for a nominee for the Defense Department, no; Secretary of \nDefense, no. For other Cabinet officers, there have been in the past \nrequirements set by opponents that to stop talking we are going to have \nto get 60 votes. But that only means what the rules say it means, which \nis that under the rules of this body, conversation or debate does not \nend if the opponents insist on it until there are 60 votes. That is the \ndefinition of a filibuster and that is what I hope we could bring to an \nend today. If we don't bring it to an end today, then there will be \nanother vote a week from Tuesday.\n  I hope we don't have to do that. This position is too important. The \ndangers in this world are too severe to leave this position in this \nambiguous state between now and a week from Tuesday, or whenever the \nfinal vote on approval of this nomination is. The world is too \ndangerous to have this period of uncertainty. There is no need for it. \nWe have provided the documents which have been required. The \ninformation relative to the financial situation of Senator Hagel has \nbeen provided. It is time for us now to bring the debate to an end, \nrequire 60 votes and then, hopefully, if we can get 60 votes today, \nthen vote on the final approval of this nominee. But, again, if 60 \nvotes aren't there today, the majority leader has made it clear he will \nthen, of course, reconsider the cloture motion for a week from Tuesday. \nEither way, it is critically important that Senator Hagel's \nconfirmation take place and that we fill this position of Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Mr. President, I don't know if there is any time left but, if so, I \nyield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order and pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Charles Timothy Hagel, of Nebraska, to be Secretary of \n     Defense.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nnomination of Charles Timothy Hagel, of Nebraska, to be Secretary of \nDefense shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I could not participate in this Hagel \nnomination cloture vote because I had to return to Louisiana to attend \na funeral. Had I been present, I would have voted no for two reasons.\n  First, I would like to state for the Record that I believe this \nprocess has been rushed and that very reasonable Member requests for \ninformation have been denied.\n  Secondly, I oppose the nomination on its substance in light of \nSenator Hagel's long history of troublesome votes and comments \nregarding the defense of Israel and related Middle East issues.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this will be the last vote of the day. We \nwill have a vote Monday night and we will vote again on this matter \nTuesday morning--a week from Monday and Tuesday.\n  I regret that Republican Senators, except the valiant four, chose to \nfilibuster the nomination of President Obama's nominee to be Secretary \nof\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\nDefense. The Republicans have made an unfortunate choice to ratchet up \nthe level of obstruction in Washington. Just when you thought things \ncould not get worse, it gets worse.\n  We need to have this vote today. Why? You know, in times like this, \nit is nice to have a Secretary of Defense, not a lameduck. We have a \nwar going on in Afghanistan. The war has been going on for 10 years. \nThe President announced on Tuesday that half the troops are going to be \ncoming home.\n  North Korea earlier this week tested a nuclear weapon. Just a couple \nmonths ago, they tested a missile to deliver a warhead. They have said \npublicly and very openly they want to make sure they can reach the \nUnited States.\n  We have a conflict going on in Syria. It is a serious conflict. The \nMiddle East is still in turmoil. Iran is threatening everyone, \nincluding us. We have a few things going on. There is a NATO defense \nmeeting next week, where NATO Defense Ministers, including someone from \nthe United States, whom we hoped would have been the Secretary of \nDefense, would attend that meeting.\n  A couple of my Republican colleagues said: That does not matter. Just \nhave somebody else attend.\n  What does that do to our standing in the world community?\n  We need a Secretary of Defense on the job. No one, no one knows, \nespecially any Senator, what foreign challenge we will face in this \ncountry, perhaps within the next 10 days. It would be nice if we had a \nSecretary of Defense.\n  There is nothing that is going to change in the next 10 days about \nthe qualifications of Chuck Hagel.\n  I served with Chuck Hagel. He is a conservative Republican \nrepresenting the ultraliberal State of Nebraska. He served with \ndistinction in the Senate as a Senator. He served on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Armed Services Committee, and Intelligence \nCommittee. He is a man of quality and of courage, not just being able \nto come and give a speech on the Senate floor.\n  During the Vietnam war, he volunteered to go into combat. That is \nwhat he chose to do because he thought it was the patriotic thing to do \nfor his country, our country. His family felt that way. He and his \nbrother went together. They didn't go to push pencils, they carried \nrifles; strapped to their sides, grenades.\n  He was wounded twice. He was an enlisted man. He didn't walk around \nordering people to do things. People were ordering him what to do--\nexcept when it came to his brother. He saved his brother's life in \ncombat in Vietnam.\n  They are filibustering him. That is what they are doing. I am going \nto call Chuck Hagel when I finish and say I am sorry, sorry this is \nhappening. I am sorry for the President and I am sorry for the country \nand I am sorry for you. We are not going to give up on you.\n  We are going to vote, as I said, Tuesday, when we get back, in the \nmorning.\n  I hope, I truly do hope nothing happens during the next 10 days we \nwill not have a Secretary of Defense. We are not going to have one, and \nI hope nothing goes wrong and we will rue the day--more than just \nembarrassing the President, the Senate, and the country--in not \nconfirming the President's nomination of this good man from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, to my knowledge we do have a Secretary of \nDefense, and his name is Leon Panetta. It is my understanding that Mr. \nPanetta is going to stay on the job, a job he has done very well as \nSecretary of Defense and as CIA director for the last several years. \nThe majority leader knows full well the reason why cloture was denied--\nor closing off debate was denied, because there are reasonable requests \nbeing made on this side for additional information. I hope and trust \ninformation will be provided in the next few days. When we come back \nfrom the recess, we will have another vote and another opportunity for \nSenators to express themselves.\n  This is not any attempt to kill this nomination. This is not a \nfilibuster. I realize it is the headline the majority leader would like \nthe newspapers to write.\n  We actually had some very reasonable discussions going on earlier \ntoday among Senators on the Democratic side and the Republican side to \ntry to work this out, given the fact that this nomination has just been \nso recently reported from the Armed Services Committee, and to \naccommodate the reasonable request for Senators to receive answers to \ntheir legitimate questions. We didn't need to have this vote today. We \ncould have delayed it until after the recess. I am confident the vote \nwould have turned out differently.\n  The White House and the majority leader were determined to have this \nvote in order to try to get a story in the newspaper, one that \nmisrepresents the nature of the objection on this side which, as I \nsaid, was a vote not to cut off debate because it was premature. \nReasonable requests for information have not been accommodated by the \nnominee.\n  There are solid public policy differences between Members of this \nother side of the aisle and the nominee.\n  This is not about politics. This is not about personalities. It is \nabout questions such as whether Iran should be allowed to get a nuclear \nweapon. Should we have direct negotiations with terrorist organizations \nsuch as Hezbollah and Hamas?\n  What is the official posture of the U.S. Department of Defense and \nthis administration relative to our best ally in the Middle East, \nIsrael? What would be the plan for the nominee should he be confirmed \nwhen it comes to dealing with steep cuts to the military that are going \nto come out of the sequester, which was the President's idea and which \nis now going to go into effect on March 1. This is something which the \nPresident himself said was not going to happen. All of these are \nlegitimate areas of difference and areas of inquiry that could be \naccommodated, could have been accommodated without necessity of this \nvote today.\n  This was the majority leader's choice, which was his prerogative, and \nthe White House's choice. We could have done this differently. We could \nhave worked this out, but that did not happen, unfortunately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not a filibuster. This is not a \nfilibuster. I would like to see what a filibuster is. This is the first \ntime in the history of our country that a Secretary of Defense has been \nfilibustered, filibustered successfully and probably ever filibustered, \nand for all this, the statement from my friend from Texas on a rant to \nmake sure he is OK on Israel. He wants to make sure he is OK on Iran on \nthis.\n  We had hearings, not singularly but plural. The Secretary of State \ncame, the Secretary of Defense.\n  This has gone to the absurd. We were told by a number of Senators \nthey would like a letter from the President's White House talking about \nwhat he did following Benghazi. Remember, Benghazi was debated at \nlength in the Presidential election. That is over, we thought. No, it \nis not over.\n  The President said, OK, and he adhered to what he wanted and wrote in \ndetail about calls he made right after the terrible occurrence in \nBenghazi and sent it to the chairman of the committee. We received \nreports back some of the Senators were offended because the letter was \nsent to the chairman and not to them. This is all foolishness.\n  People may say whatever they want to say, but we still have a \nSecretary of Defense. Leon Panetta gave his final closing, ending; it \nwas all over with his speech yesterday. I am friendly with Leon \nPanetta. I have known him for 31 years. No one in the country has \nserved with more distinction than a Member of Congress, chairman of the \nBudget Committee, head of the Office of Management and Budget, the \nPresident's Chief of Staff, head of the CIA, Secretary of Defense. He \nwants to go tomorrow, and yesterday he told everybody he was going \nhome.\n  Yes, we have a Secretary of Defense. It is about as lame as a duck \ncan be. How do you think the people in NATO feel when, I don't know who \nwill go, I guess Ash Carter or somebody will go, but we don't have a \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I can't imagine--as I said this morning, I will just repeat, I guess \nto be able to run for the Senate as a Republican in most places in the \ncountry, you need to have a resume that says: I helped filibuster one \nof the President's nominees. Maybe that helps. Maybe that keeps a tea \nparty guy from running against you. But this should not be politics. \nThis should be substance, and\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\nthere is nothing wrong with Chuck Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, with all due respect to the majority \nleader, this was an unnecessary vote today. The majority leader said: \nWhat is a filibuster? I can remember one that wasn't called a \nfilibuster. I can remember when President Bush the first nominated a \nvery noncontroversial University of Tennessee president who had been \nGovernor to be the Secretary of Education of the United States about 20 \nyears ago.\n  There was a Democratic Senate at the time, and the Senator from Ohio \ndecided he wanted more time to study the qualifications of the nominee \nfrom Tennessee. I was that nominee.\n  I thought that was an extraordinary period of time. It was 87 days \nbetween the time President Bush announced my nomination and the time \nthe Senate unanimously confirmed me. That was a Cabinet position. I \nwent around to see Senator Warren Rudman to see what I should do. He \nsaid: You don't have any cards. You don't do anything. The Senate has \nthe right to consider, with its constitutional prerogative of advice \nand consent, the nominees of the President. That is what the Senate is \nthere for.\n  I said: Warren, how did you get to be a Senator? He said: Well, I \nwill tell you a story. President Ford nominated me in 1976 to be on--I \nbelieve it was the Federal Communications Commission. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire, a Democratic Senator and a Democratic Senate, put a hold \non Warren Rudman until Warren Rudman withdrew his nomination.\n  The end of the story was that Warren Rudman then ran against that \nSenator, beat him, and that is how Warren Rudman became a Senator.\n  We know what a filibuster is. A filibuster is when one side or the \nother--which it has a perfect right to do under our system of \ngovernment--decides to try to kill a nomination by denying 60 votes or \nto stop legislation by 60 votes. The Democrats have done it on a \nregular basis when they were in the minority and the distinguished \nmajority leader was one of the most effective persons in the Senate to \ndo so. I presided many times over the Senate when he objected.\n  I remember when we were trying to get 60 votes to have a permanent \nchange in the estate law, and we would get up to 57, 58 or 59 and the \ndistinguished majority leader would object.\n  What are we doing today? We are doing today exactly what was said \nwhen the vote was called. The question was do 60 of us believe it is \ntime to end debate on the nomination of the President to be Secretary \nof Defense, the leader of the largest military organization in the \nworld, the largest employer in the United States. The Senate Armed \nServices Committee has reported that recommendation to the Senate 2 \ndays ago--not 10 days ago, not 15 days ago, not 30 days ago, 2 days \nago.\n  Most of us aren't on the Armed Services Committee. Are we not \nentitled, are we not entitled to have more than 2 days to consider one \nof the most important nominations the President has to make without \nhaving the distinguished majority leader accuse us of a filibuster? \nWhat we do in this body is debate. We debate issues.\n  In addition to that, there are a number of people on the Republican \nside who have asked for information for which they haven't received \nanswers yet.\n  In every one of those cases, those are not requests I am interested \nin. They will not produce answers I need to know. They may be outside \nthe range of questions I think ought to be answered.\n  After only 2 days of a nomination being on the floor, if Republican \nSenators have questions to ask and information to seek, they ought to \nbe allowed to do that. That is what this is about.\n  What we have said--and the Democratic leadership knows this--we have \ntalked in good faith through the morning. We have suggested to have \nthis debate when we come back. Instead of 2 days after the bill was \nreported to the committee or to the Senate floor, it would be 2 days \nplus 10--a couple weeks. It would give us a chance to read the \nhearings, consider the evidence, ask our questions.\n  There were three Senators who came down to the floor today, including \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from South Carolina, who said \nthen we will be ready to vote for cloture. In other words, we will be \nready to vote to end debate to do what the Senate should do. \nEventually, after a full consideration, we would have an up-or-down \nvote on a President's nominee for the Cabinet. At least that is my \nbelief, that eventually you should have a an up-or-down vote on the \nPresident's nominee for the Cabinet.\n  It is an unfortunate vote, and it is unfortunate to characterize this \nas a filibuster. This is a vote by Republicans to say we want more than \n2 days after this nomination comes to the floor to carefully consider \nit because we have questions. Many have questions, and then most of us \nbelieve that after a sufficient time--and, for me, a sufficient time \nwill probably be those 10 days--after those 10 days, it will be time to \nend debate. It will be time to have a vote and then it will be time to \nmove on to something else.\n  I wish to make sure this is properly characterized. This was a motion \nto close off debate after 2 days of bringing to the full Senate the \nPresident's nomination to lead the largest military organization in the \nworld at a time when Senators had reasonable questions for which they \nwant answers. A vote to extend that until 10 days from now or some \nother appropriate time after that not only is reasonable, it is in the \ntraditions of the Senate. Such reasonableness has been exercised by \nDemocrats, as well as Republicans throughout the history of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senator Alexander is my friend. Sometimes \nthat word is thrown around the floor of the Senate not very sincerely, \nbut I mean it and he knows it. And I respect him very much. But I would \nsay to the Senator, there is no other way to describe what we are going \nthrough than a filibuster.\n  A filibuster is, of course, an effort by at least one Member of the \nSenate to continue the debate and stop the vote on a matter, whether it \nis an amendment or a nomination. A cloture motion--in other words, to \nclose off the debate--is an effort to produce 60 votes to overcome that \nSenator and to move to a vote, a final vote, on an amendment or a \nnomination. So by every Senate standard, by every definition, what we \nare facing with Senator Chuck Hagel as a nominee for the Secretary of \nDefense is a filibuster. It is. And that is why the majority leader \nfiled a motion for cloture.\n  It is interesting to note that 59 Senators--a substantial majority of \nthe Senate--were prepared to vote for Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of \nDefense, including four from the Republican side of the aisle. But we \nfell short of the needed 60 votes, the 60 votes under cloture, needed \nto end a filibuster. So I have to say to my friend from Tennessee, by \nevery definition in the Senate, by every standard, your side has \nsuccessfully filibustered the nomination of Chuck Hagel in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  It has happened before on Cabinet nominees--twice, I am told, in our \nhistory, and once while I was here involving Dirk Kempthorne, whose \nnomination was controversial and another cloture vote was called. I \nasked myself, how did I vote? After a while, you sometimes forget. And \nI was told, well, it turned out the cloture vote for Dirk Kempthorne \nwas 85 to 7. So clearly, he had 60 votes, and I voted for the cloture \nvote in this circumstance. He was then affirmed by a voice vote \nthereafter. So it has happened before, but it happens rarely--twice in \nour history--when we have a Cabinet nominee who is filibustered.\n  I will concede to the Senator there are many times we have questions \nthat need to be answered before we can make a sound or final decision, \nbut what is peculiar about this vote is that the questions are being \nasked about a fellow colleague, someone the Republicans served with for \nyears. This is not a name that was just dropped out of the blue. I \nwould assume my Republican colleagues knew Chuck Hagel. You served with \nhim, you were on committees with him, you sat hour after hour, day \nafter day, and maybe month after month in meetings together. So\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\nhe is a known quantity more so on the Republican side of the aisle than \non our side. I served with him on the Intelligence Committee, and I \nthought he was a person of sound judgment. There were times when I \nthought he showed real courage. I never doubted for a minute his \ncommitment to some of the basic issues.\n  The Senator from Texas, who is also a friend, said: Well, we are not \nsure where he stands on issues such as Iran. I think he has said \nunequivocally over the last several weeks his position is the same as \nthe President's, that we need to stop Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapon. The same has been said relative to our relationship with \nIsrael. If people still have questions about that today, they are \nignoring his answers or they do not believe him. And in that case, they \ncan vote yes or no. I don't know how many more times he needs to say \nthat to satisfy his critics. Perhaps, for some of them, he will never \nsatisfy them.\n  But it is troubling to me, and I would agree with Senator Reid--and \nLeon Panetta is a close personal friend. We go back to our House days. \nI recall he had a unanimous vote when he was nominated for Secretary of \nDefense--an indication of the respect we have for him. But his days are \ncoming to a close and he said so. What the President has said is, I \nneed to move up somebody into this critical position for the national \nsecurity of the United States, and Chuck Hagel is the person I propose.\n  We have had ample time. I would be surprised if there are any--\nperhaps many--Senators who didn't have a chance to personally sit down \nwith Senator Hagel. He came to my office, and I know he made himself \navailable to virtually every Senator before this process started. So \nChuck Hagel has done what he was asked to do, answer the questions and \nappear before the committee. And for a person who is a former \ncolleague, it is hard to understand or explain why there are so many \npeople on the Republican side of the aisle puzzled by this fellow from \nNebraska, someone whom they served with for so many years.\n  Let me also say I want to join with the majority leader in saying, \nGod forbid anything happens in the next 10 days. I hope it doesn't, for \nour sake and for the sake of the Senate and the people of this country. \nWe do need a Secretary of Defense. I would like to think if the tables \nwere turned the other side would not be pillorying us for leaving the \nSecretary of Defense office vacant in these dangerous times. I am \nafraid many on your side would be asking, why didn't you get this done \nwhen you could have? This was a Democratic Senator; why do you need to \nkeep asking questions over and over?\n  But we have reached this point and there is nothing we can do about \nit. Senators have left and we are going to be off next week for the \nPresidents holiday. I just hope, as soon as we return, as quickly as we \nreturn, we can defeat this filibuster on Chuck Hagel--this rare \nfilibuster in Senate history--and we give him his chance to continue to \nserve this Nation as ably as he did in the U.S. Senate and as a soldier \nin combat in Vietnam.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I want to assure the assistant majority leader that we \nstill have a Secretary of Defense. His name is Leon Panetta. And I am \nreferring to an e-mail his press secretary George Little sent out on \nThursday:\n\n       The Secretary plans to stay in office until Senator Hagel \n     is confirmed and sworn in.\n\n  So if anybody is under any misapprehension, I believe the Pentagon \npress secretary has made that clear. We have a Secretary of Defense. He \nhas not resigned, and he will continue to serve until such time as his \nsuccessor is sworn in.\n  I would say again to my friend, the Senator from Illinois, the \nassistant majority leader, we all know what a filibuster is. A \nfilibuster is designed to kill a nomination or to defeat legislation, \nas the Senator from Tennessee said. I would also say this is equivalent \nto what happened back in 2005.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a letter signed by Chris Dodd and Joseph Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. And I will quote from that letter. This is a letter \nsigned by Chris Dodd, our former colleague who served on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and Joe Biden, when he was a ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee back in 2005.\n\n       Dear Democratic Colleague: We write to urge you to oppose \n     the cloture on the Bolton nomination tonight. We want to make \n     clear that this is not a filibuster. It is a vote to protect \n     the Senate's constitutional power to advise and consent to \n     nominations.\n\n  I will skip down, because the letter will be in the Record, to the \nlast paragraph, which says:\n\n       The refusal of the Executive Branch to provide information \n     relevant to the nomination is a threat to the Senate's \n     constitutional power to advise and consent. The only way to \n     protect that power is to continue to demand that the \n     information be provided to the Senate. The only means of \n     forcing the Administration to cooperate is to prevent a final \n     vote on the nomination today.\n\n  And the letter, as I said, was signed by Chris Dodd and Joe Biden.\n  My point is, this is exactly what the Senator from Tennessee said it \nwas--a vote not to end debate but to allow these inquiries to be \nanswered. And the shoe will likely be on another foot some other time \nwith some other nominee, so we ought to, I think at a minimum, respect \nand protect the right of the Senate and of an individual Senator to \nmake reasonable inquiries of a nominee as part of the power of advise \nand consent.\n  This is not a filibuster. If it is, then this was in 2005, contrary \nto the assertions of Joe Biden and Chris Dodd. But I agree with them in \nthis instance, this is merely an effort not to close off debate but to \nallow reasonable inquiries to get information that will advise the \nSenators in their vote when it comes time to vote on this matter after \nthe next break.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 2005.\n       Dear Democratic Colleague: We write to urge you to oppose \n     cloture on the Bolton nomination tonight. We want to make \n     clear that this is not a filibuster. It is a vote to protect \n     the Senate's constitutional power to advise and consent to \n     nominations.\n       For more than a month, we have been requesting two types of \n     information from the Executive Branch. First, materials \n     related to the preparation of congressional testimony on \n     Syria and weapons of mass destruction that Mr. Bolton planned \n     to give in July 2003 and ultimately gave that September. We \n     think this will show Mr. Bolton's continued effort to \n     exaggerate intelligence information. It may also show that he \n     misled the Foreign Relations Committee when he told us that \n     he was not personally involved in the preparation of the \n     testimony. Second, information related to National Security \n     Agency intercepts and the identity of U.S. persons on those \n     intercepts. During the past four years, Mr. Bolton requested \n     the identity of U.S. persons on ten occasions. There may be \n     nothing improper in this; or there may be something highly \n     improper. But we won't know unless we see the very same \n     information shown to Mr. Bolton. So far that has not \n     occurred. The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence were shown the intercepts, but not \n     the identities of the U.S. persons.\n       In refusing to provide the information about the Syria \n     testimony, the State Department has asserted that it does not \n     believe that the request is ``specifically tied to the issues \n     being deliberated by the Committee.'' In other words, the \n     Executive Branch is deciding what it thinks is relevant to \n     the Senate's review. That's unacceptable. In the case of the \n     NSA intercepts, no one in the Executive Branch has even tried \n     to explain why the chairman and ranking member of the \n     Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees are not allowed \n     to see information that was made available to Mr. Bolton and \n     even to his staff. That, too, is unacceptable.\n       The refusal of the Executive Branch to provide information \n     relevant to the nomination is a threat to the Senate's \n     constitutional power to advise and consent. The only way to \n     protect that power is to continue to demand that the \n     information be provided to the Senate. The only means of \n     forcing the Administration to cooperate is to prevent a final \n     vote on the nomination today. We urge to you vote no on \n     cloture.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher J. Dodd.\n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S751-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S751-S753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          SEQUESTER LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are facing a very serious problem \nwith the sequester that will impact our Defense Department and other \ngovernment agencies. It is a very serious matter. It has been out there \nfor well over a year. We have known this is coming, and it is time--\nlong past time--for the Democratic Senate and the President of the \nUnited States to provide some leadership on the issue.\n  I was pleased with Senator McConnell this morning when he raised this \nmatter, suggesting we are in a pattern here of how business is being \ndone in the Senate. It goes something like this, Senator McConnell \nsaid: Phase 1, Republicans identify a challenge and propose a solution; \nphase 2, the liberals sit on their hands until the last minute; phase \n3, they then offer some gimmicky tax hike designed to fail and then \nblame everybody when it does.\n  This is essentially, I am afraid, where we are. We are now at the \ntime where they are about to sweep in with some gimmicky solution that \nwon't be successful. I don't know where they are in that. We have seen \na 1-page outline that suggests there is a plan out there, but we \nhaven't seen legislative language, I don't believe, unless it was \nproduced in the last few hours. So we are 2 weeks away from a sequester \nthat will include cuts that I believe will be too damaging to the U.S. \nmilitary and can be avoided and should be avoided.\n  The sequester, remember, was part of an agreement that was reached in \nAugust a year ago--August 2011--between the President of the United \nStates, the Democratic leadership in the Senate, and the leadership in \nthe House of Representatives. It was designed to raise the debt ceiling \nbecause we had borrowed all the money that could legally be borrowed \nand the administration wanted to spend more and borrow more money. We \nwere borrowing well over 35 cents out of every dollar we spent at that \ntime--and still are--and the President wanted to raise the debt \nceiling. The people holding the credit card--the U.S. Congress--said: \nWait a minute. You have run up too much debt. You have to lay out a \nplan that, at least over 10 years, would equal the amount you want to \nraise the debt ceiling. The Administration could spend that money now--\nand it was spent in 18 months, because we have already hit the debt \nceiling again--and we will raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion.\n  So an agreement was reached to reduce spending over the next 10 years \nby $2.1 trillion. That was the agreement. The President signed that, \nthe Democratic leader in the Senate agreed to that, the Speaker of the \nHouse, the Republican, agreed to that, and that became the law.\n  These are numbers we live with every day. I am the ranking Republican \non the Budget Committee, and it is a constant item in our face out \nthere. We were then spending $3.7 trillion a year. So if you extend \nthat for 10 years, we would spend $37 trillion over 10 years. But the \nbudget was expected to grow. It was expected to grow so that we spent \n$47 trillion over 10 years. At the end of that time we would have \nincreased spending by almost $10 trillion over 10 years. This deal \nwould have said that we wouldn't spend $47 trillion but $45 trillion, \ntherefore reducing the increase by a modest amount.\n  These were the first significant cuts we have had in the Congress in \na long time. It is the first time we have actually made some alteration \nin the growth of spending. And really, it is not a cut in spending; it \nis reduction to the growth of spending. But the President not only \nagreed to the sequester, he actually proposed the sequester as part of \nthe deal.\n  The sequester came about under the theory this would be a stopgap \nemergency measure if the committee of 12 didn't reach some long-term \nfiscal plan to alter the debt course of America, and the committee \ndidn't reach that agreement.\n  The agreement fell apart and the sequester happened. The sequester \nwas put in the bill at the last minute, according to Bob Woodward in \nhis book, at the request of the President and the White House. It was \nput in there, and nobody knew what it meant. That is the reason \nprimarily that I voted against it. I didn't like this situation that \nlooked to me as though it would be a meat-axe cut that would fall \ndisproportionately on the Defense Department. At any rate, good people \ndisagreed, the bill passed, and it became law. So that is how the \nsequester came to be, and it is set up in a way that disrupts the \nDefense Department.\n  If you cut the Defense Department as much as is presently scheduled \nto be done now, it would hurt under any circumstances. But if it is \ndone the way the sequester says, everybody agrees it will be far more \ndamaging than it needs to be because it gives the Defense Department \nvery little control over how to manage their money in a way that has \nthe least adverse circumstances, and that is why we should not let the \nsequester go forward.\n  The sequester needs to be reevaluated for a lot of reasons. One-sixth \nof the federal budget is the Defense Department. One-sixth of the \namount of money we spend is by the Defense Department. One-half of all \nthe cuts in the sequester falls on the Defense Department. It is \ndisproportionate.\n  Some people are under the impression that it is the war costs that \nare being cut. This is not what we are talking about. The war costs are \nfunded in a separate account. All of these cuts fall on the base \ndefense budget of the United States of America.\n  It means too rapid and severe a reduction in our military and \ncivilian personnel, and it endangers the smart management of the war, \nwhile entire portions of our government--almost one-half of our \ngovernment--have no cuts at all. Amazingly, there is no reduction in \nthe growth of the spending of one-half of our government; and defense \nspending increases are less than half of what you see in many of the \nother major spending programs in our government.\n  The base defense budget has not been surging out of control. It has \nbeen increasing at about the rate of inflation in the last several \nyears. But defense has already reduced its budget as part of the first \npart of the Budget Control Act agreement last August. That was $487 \nbillion. So this sequester would be an additional $500 billion, should \nit go through. It would be a cumulative reduction of almost $1 trillion \nover 10 years. That is a big reduction. It alters the ability of the \nmilitary to function in the way they have been functioning, and it \nthreatens the ability for them to carry out the missions they have been \nassigned to carry out today.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dempsey, said this week:\n\n       If sequestration occurs, it will severely limit our ability \n     to implement our defense strategy. It will put the nation at \n     a greater risk of coercion, and it will break faith with the \n     men and women in uniform.\n\n  That is a serious statement and we should respect it. I know right \nnow they are threatening all kinds of draconian cuts, and probably when \nthe dust settles it won't be quite as draconian as they tell us. But \nthe fundamental truth is, this is disproportionate and dangerous to the \nDefense Department, and it is not necessary.\n  Remember how we got here. We saw this coming. The defense \nauthorization bill was not brought up before the election maybe for the \nfirst time in 50 years. Why was it not brought up in July, August, \nSeptember, or October? Why was it not?\n  One of the reasons I think was that everybody knew the sequester was \nout there. It needed to be fixed, and this would have been the \nopportunity to fix it when that bill moved through the Senate. And so \nSenator Reid wouldn't bring up the defense bill. He refused to bring it \nto the floor.\n  Senator McCain came to the floor and said, shame, shame, shame, as \nranking Republican on the committee, pointing out this failure was the \nfirst time I believe in 50 years that the defense bill had not moved. \nNo other appropriations bill had moved, either; not a single one. But \nnot passing the defense authorization bill was historic--again, I think \nin big part because they didn't want to talk about the sequester.\n  In the debate, I believe last October, with Governor Romney, the \nsequester came up. What did President Obama say? It will not happen. \nThe sequester will not happen. And here we are, with no plan to fix it \nfrom the White House, no plan to fix it from the Democratic majority--\nwhich apparently wants to lead this country, wants to be in the \nmajority, wants to justify their leadership position. Senator Reid has \nnot brought forth--unless it is today, until\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\nthis late, late minute--a plan to fix the sequester, an alternative. We \nhave seen the one-page outline, but that is it.\n  I would note, I think I indicated, the House has already twice passed \nlegislation months ago that would fix the sequester and not allow this \nevent to occur in the way that it is. They have done their duty.\n  So what is the Senate going to do? What are we going to have from the \nSenate? Another do nothing, no budget, no fix to the economic threats \nof America? Now no fix to the sequester? The only thing we have to do \nnow is raise taxes?\n  The truth is, the way to fix this and the way to do this is to have \nall the departments and agencies of the government be evaluated, not \njust a small portion of them, and have all of them tighten their belts, \nand we could easily avoid the draconian cuts that are lurking out there \nright now.\n  Over half the government spending was not touched in the 2011 Budget \nControl Act deal. It just wasn't, including some of the fastest growing \nitems such as food stamps, which have gone from $20 billion in 2001 to \n$80 billion last year. It has gone up four times in 10 years and not a \ndime was reduced from it. Medicaid is at 6- to 7-percent-a-year \nincreases. These programs alone add $300 billion to government spending \neach year. They aren't having any review at all.\n  I am disappointed we don't have a legislative plan on the floor that \nwe could actually evaluate to see what it means, and then begin to \ndebate it and discuss it. It should long since have been brought up in \nthis Senate. We should already be aware of it.\n  But there is a game played around here, as Senator McConnell said. \nThere is a game around here to wait until the last minute. And the \nPresident, using the power of the Presidency and his skill as an \norator, feels he can once again dominate the media and be able to \nextract the kind of legislation he wants in the end, and somehow gain \npolitical advantage, I guess.\n  I don't think it is going to work this time. I am worried about it. I \nam afraid we are not going to have an agreement. I am afraid cuts are \ngoing to take place in a way that shouldn't occur, and that they could \nbe done smarter and more effectively with less damage than we have.\n  So we are told that in this Democratic plan, in this outline that is \nfloating around, after we passed just a few weeks ago a $600 billion \ntax increase, that now we want to have another tax increase. I have to \nsay this with clarity: Any plan that attempts to replace the cuts in \nthe Budget Control Act with tax increases will not happen. They cannot \nhappen. It will be a fundamental breach of the commitment we made to \nthe American people in August of 2011. We told them, We have an \nagreement. We will raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion. A lot of \npeople did not want that to happen. A lot of people are fed up with \nborrowing in Washington. A lot of people said, Don't raise the debt \nceiling a dime.\n  We said, OK, we are going to raise the debt ceiling, but we are going \nto promise you, American people, that we will contain the growth of \nspending by $2.1 trillion, so the increase in spending over 10 years \nwill be about $8 trillion instead of $10 trillion. Surely, that is not \ngoing to break America. Surely, that is not going to destroy this \nRepublic. It could be exceedingly damaging if we do as the sequester \nsays, though, and target the Defense Department far more severely than \nany other area of government.\n  But, fundamentally, reducing the growth in spending from $10 trillion \nin expected increases to $8 trillion is not going to damage America. \nAnd it can be done. In fact, it must be done.\n  What we have to understand is that the President of the United States \nand Senator Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, agreed in August \nof 2011 that we would raise the debt ceiling, we would cut spending, \nand we would not increase taxes. We would not increase taxes. It was a \nsimple, small, but significant, noticeable reduction in the growth and \nspending, and that was the agreement. Before the ink was dry on it, we \nhad people wanting to weasel out of it, to change it.\n  What would the American people think of us if less than 2 years after \nthis agreement, this promise to them, we capitulated, we couldn't \nfollow through, and we couldn't maintain those growth reductions we \npromised the American people we would do?\n  The plan I am hearing that is being floated now is a direct \ncontradiction of the promise we made to the American people. I don't \nbelieve it will pass. I don't believe it will pass the House and I \ndon't believe it will pass the Senate.\n  And remember, this is current baseline law now.\n  The Budget Director of the Congressional Budget Office testified \nbefore the Budget Committee this week, and he showed us what the \nprojected deficits will be over the next 10 years. The good news was \nthat deficits would be reduced some--less than half of what they are \ntoday--by 2015. And a big part of that was the sequester, because it is \nin law. The law says: These reductions will occur. He scored them as we \npassed it. And now we are saying, We want to give that back and we \ndon't want to follow through on that.\n  The only way you can not follow through on the reductions that were \nin the Budget Control Act would be to increase spending--to increase \nspending above what we are currently projected to have the government \ngrow over the next 10 years. We would have to increase spending.\n  So make no mistake about it, the plan that is being proposed is to \ntax and spend--to spend more and tax more. That is not where this \ncountry should be going. I reject that as the right approach. \nParticularly, it is contrary to the steps we took in August.\n  One reason the agreement was reached on the fiscal cliff in early \nJanuary of this year was that we had spending cuts last August and they \ngot some tax increases in January, but not more. And those tax \nincreases should have been for the purpose of reducing debt, not \nfunding new spending.\n  So to sum up the matter, in August 2011 Congress and the President \nagreed and passed legislation to reduce by a small amount Federal \nspending from $47 trillion to $45 trillion over 10 years. The spending \nof the United States would increase approximately $8 trillion instead \nof $10 trillion. That would not damage the American Government. We \ncertainly should be able to function as a nation with that kind of \nsubstantial increase in spending, and it is happening every day in \ncities, counties, and States throughout America. They are dealing with \nfar worse reductions than that.\n  There was no tax increase agreed to at all--not one penny of tax \nincreases. Those reductions in spending are in law. They are in the new \nbaseline on which we are now operating. To alter that and give back \nthat spending without finding reductions in spending elsewhere would be \nto increase spending above that agreed to in the Budget Control Act, \nand that is what the Democratic outline we have seen would do. It \nincreases spending and it increases taxes. They say: Don't worry about \nthe increased spending. We have taken care of it. We have raised taxes. \nSo that is the deal. They raised taxes to pay for the increase. That is \nin clear violation of the terms of the agreement and the moral \nagreement we had with the American people. It is in violation of what \nwas told to the American people a little over 18 months ago, and to \nthat extent it is not acceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues not to proceed with this approach.\n  Let's find ways to spread out the spending cuts so that more \ngovernment agencies tighten their belts--and not so disproportionately \non the Defense Department--and we can resolve this matter going \nforward.\n  I am worried because we have had no response from our Democratic \npartners, no response from our President of the United States, who is \nthe Commander in Chief of American forces. To my knowledge they have \nnot laid out a detailed plan yet. We are going to reach that deadline, \nand it looks as though it is going to take place. I hope it can be \navoided. It should be avoided, and I am willing to work to avoid that.\n  I call on my colleagues to not continue to delay. Let's move forward \nto an effective agreement that preserves the legislative intent of the \nBudget Control Act and the promises that we made to the American \npeople.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, today and throughout the coming weeks, \nI hope this body will move closer to comprehensive immigration reform. \nActually, accountable immigration reform would be a more appropriate \nterm to call it--accountable  to the people of the United States who \noverwhelmingly want this dysfunctional, broken system to be mended.\n\n  We are a nation of immigrants, and the people of our Nation know it. \nThey know it not only intellectually and abstractly; they know it in \ntheir gut because they see on the walls of their homes the proud \nphotographs of their parents, their grandparents--people who have come \nto this country as a beacon of economic opportunity and freedom, some \nof them struggling through the most horrific kinds of trials and \ntribulations to reach this great land, the greatest Nation in the \nhistory of the world.\n  I have told my colleagues in the past--and I will state again--one of \nthe most inspiring things I do--and I had done it as attorney general \nfor a long time but now as a Senator--is to visit our courthouses where \nimmigration and naturalization ceremonies take place. Those ceremonies \nare profoundly inspiring because they come--new citizens, people about \nto become citizens--with their families. It is a day of joy and pride \nunmatched and unexcelled in their lives. They come with friends, and \nthey come to celebrate with their friends and families, with tears in \ntheir eyes and their hearts and their throats. There is no time when I \nhave seen one of these ceremonies that I have not been deeply moved and \nuplifted.\n  If you ever have a down day, if you are ever discouraged about this \nNation, see one of these ceremonies. You will know what it means to be \na citizen of the United States of America and how important it is and \nhow important we should regard it.\n  So I approach immigration reform with a profound appreciation of its \nimportance to people who seek liberty and economic opportunity and \njustice in this great land but also how we are enriched as a nation of \nimmigrants by the diversity, the talent, the dedication they bring to \nour factories where they work, to our laboratories where they invent, \nto our military where they serve and sacrifice and give their lives.\n  So I hope we will embark on accountable immigration reform that \nprovides a path to earned citizenship for the 11 million people or more \nnow in this country undocumented. Many times they pay taxes, they live \nhere, and they regard the United States as their home. They have no \ncriminal background. They have done nothing wrong. We need to find a \nway to bring them out of the shadows and provide earned citizenship, \nwith background checks to show they have no criminal records, that they \nwill learn to speak English, if they do not now do so, go through all \nthe other steps that may be set, and then go to the back of the line \nbehind people who have legally sought to come here.\n  That reform should also include much stronger security at the \nborders, a crackdown on employers who hire undocumented immigrants--\npeople in this country who are here illegally but who can be exploited \nby those employers--and, of course, a streamlined immigration process. \nThe elements of this reform are becoming clearer and attracting a \ngrowing consensus. If nothing else, we should make sure we provide an \nexpedited route for people who now come with H-1B visas.\n  Some of the details of these proposals need to be resolved so we give \nthose people who come to this country with extraordinary skills or who \nare educated here and are now forced to leave the country, to the \ndetriment of our tech corporations--and many are in my home State of \nConnecticut. And maybe, first and foremost, we need to make sure we \ngive the DREAMers what this country so richly deserves--one would \nthink, I might say, what they deserve, but truly the country deserves \nwhat they have to contribute and give back to this country.\n  For some time I have come to the floor of the Senate to talk about \nindividual DREAMers. I wish to talk about a young person, Cinthia \nPerez, whose photograph is here in the Chamber and who is one of those \nDREAMers--many of whom are brought to this country as infants or very \nyoung children. They know no other country. They often know no other \nlanguage but the one spoken here. Their lives are rooted in this \ncountry. Their friends are here. They are going through our schools. \nThey are serving in our military. Yet they can be deported at any time.\n  Right now, the President has commendably offered the Deferred Action \nfor Childhood Arrivals--DACA--system for them, but it is only for a \nlimited period of time. It does not provide the certainty and security \nthey need to do what Cinthia Perez wants to do with her life. That is \nwhy the nearly 2 million immigrants nationwide who would benefit from \nthe DREAM Act--between 11,000 and 20,000 in Connecticut--deserve the \nbenefit of a more secure route, an expedited route to citizenship. That \nhas to be part of accountable immigration reform.\n  Cinthia Perez was born in Mexico. She was brought to America at the \nage of 5. She has not left America since. Her family settled in New \nHaven, CT. She went to the New Haven public schools from elementary \nschool through high school.\n  It was in high school that Cinthia came to understand how her \nundocumented status would actually affect her future, because during \nher senior year of high school, Cinthia attended a college preparation \nclass. From the start of that class--supposedly to prepare her for \ncollege--Cinthia could not fully take part in the course because she \nthought she would not be eligible to go to college because of her \nundocumented status.\n  Still, she continued in that class as a way to stay motivated about \nher future and to experience the college application process, as many \nAmericans do. In fact, she eventually applied to four universities--\nsome State and some private. She was accepted by how many? All four.\n  Her excitement and her family's soon faded as she realized the choice \nshe faced. She would not be able to attend any of these schools because \nshe could not afford it, and her dream school looked even further out \nof reach because her parents could not afford to pay full tuition and \nCinthia could not share the financial burden because she was afraid to \nseek work. She is ineligible to work in this country, and she felt \nhopeless because all she wanted to do was attend college, work her way \nthrough, so she could create a better future for herself and make a \ndifference for the country.\n  Around that time, Connecticut passed a State law--and I advocated \nit--to allow undocumented students who have graduated from high school \nin Connecticut to pay instate tuition rates that are available to other \nConnecticut residents. With that financial burden slightly lessened, \nCinthia was able to enroll at Southern Connecticut State University.\n\n  She is now proud to be in her sophomore year at SCSU, and she hopes \nto use her education to pursue a career in community development or \nenvironmental management. Basically, she wants to help improve \neducation and support for children in need--children such as herself \nwho simply want an education so they can give back to this country, \nchildren such as herself who are motivated and inspired to contribute \nto America, and children such as herself who are undocumented and, \ntherefore, hampered and impeded in their aspirations.\n  I have no doubt Cinthia will continue to contribute to Connecticut. \nShe will, unfortunately, face the dangers of deportation from her home \nand may be sent back to a country she has not seen for many years--in \nfact, since she was 5 years old.\n  I hope every DREAMer is given deferred action status under the \nPresident's program. I hope Cinthia's application will be favorably \nreceived. I hope she will be able to pursue her education and work and \ngive back to this Nation and that she will be eligible at some point \nfor financial aid.\n  But the full measure of relief from deportation will not come to her \nor any\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\nof the other DREAMers without the DREAM Act. Therefore, I urge that the \ncomprehensive immigration reform under consideration by a bipartisan \ngroup headed by Senators Schumer and McCain and the solution eventually \nadopted by this body to fix that broken system of immigration law will \ninclude the DREAM Act.\n  I wish to thank and give credit to Senator Durbin, who has championed \nthis measure for a long time, giving a model to many of us at the State \nlevel, where I was attorney general for 20 years and championing our \nequivalent of the DREAM Act there, providing aid, as we did with \nCinthia, so she could fulfill her aspirations to seek education.\n  But at the end of the day, just and effective comprehensive \nimmigration reform must resolve the status of those 11 million people, \nincluding Cinthia's relatives who may be here, including the DREAMers' \nparents who may be here. It has to be comprehensive so as to establish \nan earned pathway to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants \nalready giving back, already here, already contributing members of our \nsociety, and, most especially, the children who were brought here, \nthrough no fault of their own, when they were 5 years old or 6 years \nold or 5 months old, and we reaffirm that America is a land of justice \nand opportunity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in Vermont, you will find any number of \nsuccessful family-run businesses. Today, I want to recognize the \nCochran Family and their Cochran Ski Area. This family, which has spent \n50 years on a hillside in the town of Richmond, VT, has seen 10 of its \nown compete in the Olympic Games and has brought thousands of local \nyouth together to share in Vermont's rich tradition of winter sports.\n  The Cochran Ski Area is truly a remarkable place in Vermont, where \nthe rewards of family togetherness, community support, and shared \nknowledge have been reaped to the fullest for half a century. In the \n1960s, the Cochran slope was a skiing family's dreamland, but Mickey \nCochran, alongside his wife Ginny and family, chose to open their home \nand their hearts to the community. Since then this slope has become a \nsource of skill not only for the Cochran Olympians, but for every \nVermonter who, with their guidance, has been helped to master the art \nof skiing. The Cochrans intensified their skiing talent and dedication \nthrough the application of math and physics, complementing a classroom \neducation with a thrilling hands-on experience unlike any other. This \nVermont family and their legacy are a model of community building and \nachievement. Their charity has enriched Vermont and the Cochran Ski \nArea has been cherished in return as a haven for families to enjoy \nwinter traditions. Today, a new generation of Cochrans preserves their \nrelationship with the land Mickey and Ginny Cochran sought to make \ntheir home years ago, by founding Slopeside Syrup, a maple syrup \nbusiness. Each spring Cochran's taps more than 20,000 maple trees \naround the ski slope and opens its doors of the Slopeside Syrup \nsugarhouse to visitors and neighbors alike.\n  I am proud to share the Cochran family's story with the Senate. I ask \nunanimous consent that a recent article from The New York Times about \nthis incredible family be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 2013]\n\n                      Short Hillside's Long Legacy\n\n                          (By Bill Pennington)\n\n       Richmond, VT.--It was 1960 in northern Vermont and Mickey \n     Cochran had a simple plan with an uncommon stipulation. A \n     former schoolteacher, Cochran would buy a house in the \n     country for his growing family, but only if the new home had \n     a pitched slope behind it where he could install a ski lift.\n       Along with his wife, Ginny, whom he met while skiing, \n     Cochran found the right house and parcel of land for $10,000, \n     and soon there was a rope tow just outside the back door. \n     Educated as a mechanical engineer, Cochran affixed \n     floodlights to adjacent trees and the roof of the two-story \n     home, turning the modest rural hillside into a round-the-\n     clock winter playground.\n       Like a Vermont version of the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' if \n     you build and illuminate a place to ski in snow country, \n     people will come from far and wide.\n       Throughout the 1960s, thousands of local schoolchildren and \n     their parents learned to ski at the Cochran hill, with Mickey \n     and Ginny providing free hands-on instruction. They did not \n     charge to use the 400-foot rope tow either. Everyone was \n     welcome, even in the kitchen of the Cochran home, which \n     served as a warming hut.\n       ``It was a magical place,'' said Bob Cochran, one of Mickey \n     and Ginny's four children. ``Like a big party at your house \n     every night.''\n       The ski hill, moderately expanded in subsequent decades, \n     continues to this day as a nonprofit organization and revered \n     civic resource, a tribute to Mickey Cochran's humble 1960 \n     dream.\n       But that is not the reason Cochran's Ski Area, with its one \n     tiny roadside sign, is known throughout the racing world. It \n     is not why the one-room Cochran lodge, built in 1984, is \n     replete with pictures of international skiing stars who have \n     made the trek to this out-of-the-way little ski area next to \n     the Winooski River.\n       Mickey and Ginny Cochran's children--Marilyn, Barbara Ann, \n     Bob and Lindy--all made the United States ski team and each \n     raced in the Olympics. At the 1972 Games in Sapporo, Japan, \n     Barbara Ann won a gold medal in slalom.\n       The Skiing Cochrans, as they became known in the 1970s, \n     were an American sensation, feted at gala dinners and \n     featured in national magazines, like a sporting version of \n     the Osmonds.\n       But there's more: six of Mickey and Ginny Cochran's \n     grandchildren have made the United States ski team in the \n     last decade, including Ryan Cochran-Siegle, Barbara Ann's 20-\n     year-old son, who won two events at the junior world \n     championships last season. His cousin Robby Kelley, Lindy's \n     son, is the reigning national giant slalom champion, \n     extending the lineage of America's first family of ski racing \n     into a sixth decade.\n       In 2005, four second-generation Cochrans were on the United \n     States ski team, matching the four Cochrans on the team 43 \n     years ago. And the ski area has helped produce more than a \n     dozen United States team members who are not related to the \n     Cochrans, even if they are all embraced as Cochran racers.\n       ``People have asked me if there's something in the water,'' \n     Bob, 61, said with a laugh last month, sitting at a picnic \n     table inside the unassuming Cochran lodge. ``People think we \n     have some secret. But there was no special criteria for \n     coming here except one. My father said you had to have fun.\n       ``And my mother made every kid who showed up here feel like \n     a part of the family.''\n\n\n                       No Discussion of Olympics\n\n       Each of the original skiing Cochrans insisted that making \n     the Olympics was never discussed by their father, who died in \n     1998 at age 74, or by their mother, who was 76 when she died \n     in 2005.\n       ``Even making the national team was never envisioned,'' \n     said Lindy, now 59. ``That was some mystical place and the \n     farthest thing from my father's mind. He did, however, \n     believe that you needed a lot of repetition to get good at \n     something.''\n       So what better way than to grab the rope tow just outside \n     your bedroom window?\n       The usual Cochran winter day would have the children doing \n     their homework after\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\n     school, then awaiting their father, who had left teaching to \n     take an engineering job at a General Electric plant in nearby \n     Burlington.\n       ``He would get home around 6 p.m. and we'd be waiting to \n     get out there,'' said Bob, who became a physician after his \n     amateur and professional ski racing career ended. ``My mom \n     would give my dad something to eat, and then he'd go fire up \n     the old gas-powered engine that ran the rope tow.''\n       Gates would be set on the hill, and if there were not \n     enough gates, saplings cut from the adjacent woods would be \n     used instead.\n       ``It would hurt hitting those saplings,'' said Marilyn, 62. \n     ``But you couldn't get us off that hill. We'd be out there \n     five nights a week, and the only way to get us to go to bed \n     was to flip off the lights.''\n       When Marilyn and Barbara Ann, who was 11 months younger, \n     began winning regional and national-level races, their \n     celebrity spread in the pastoral remote villages of northern \n     New England, but they remained something of a curiosity at \n     the extravagant Alps resorts that hosted the top \n     international ski races. That was true even after they each \n     won a medal at the 1970 world championships.\n       ``I recall the Europeans saying: `Who are these Cochrans? \n     From where?' '' Marilyn said. ``But you know, they started \n     thinking of us as kids to be reckoned with.''\n       Their father was their coach and, they said, an innovator. \n     Relying on his engineering background, he introduced \n     scientific methods to racing tactics, turning a mountain \n     descent into a conversation about vectors and ski path \n     velocity. He taught his children to chart the number of gates \n     in a racecourse and to memorize it using visualization \n     techniques. He was also a master sports psychologist, an \n     underappreciated part of coaching at the time.\n       ``He was a teacher at heart, and he knew how to keep you \n     focused on your performance and not the outcome,'' Bob said. \n     ``He was years ahead of his time.''\n       If there is a shared trait from generation to generation of \n     Cochran Olympians, it is the powerful benefit of basic \n     homework, or time on the snow in ski racing parlance. The \n     emphasis has always been on the value of dedicated, \n     enthusiastic preparation, even in modest circumstances. The \n     Cochran race training course is far from steep and only \n     several hundred feet long. But Cochran racers for multiple \n     decades have completed lap after lap, smiling as they go.\n       ``There was never pressure on us,'' said Ryan Cochran-\n     Siegle, who is now racing at the highest levels of the World \n     Cup circuit, a path his cousins blazed before him. ``I never \n     felt any expectations. I wanted to do well, but winning was \n     never the central goal. We were urged to just get better and \n     better.''\n       Marilyn, who became a World Cup giant slalom champion, \n     recalled that her father always deflected questions about \n     success, even as it became common to the household.\n       ``Acknowledging medals and things like that seemed arrogant \n     to him,'' she said recently, sitting with her sisters and \n     brother. ``Although I know he was proud of us.''\n       Marilyn then explained that her parents could not afford to \n     attend the 1972 Sapporo Olympics, where three of their \n     children competed, but they stayed up late to watch the races \n     from Japan. The living room scene, just feet from the \n     backyard rope tow, was later recreated for her.\n       ``My father cried twice in his life--when his mother died \n     and when this one won the gold medal,'' Marilyn said, tapping \n     the shoulder of Barbara Ann.\n       ``I didn't know that,'' Barbara Ann said, turning with a \n     look of surprise. ``Now I'm going to cry.''\n       Marilyn said, ``Me, too.''\n\n\n                           More Room to Teach\n\n       The Cochran's Ski Area of today has moved about 150 yards \n     from the original home, which has remained in the family. An \n     adjacent 140-acre parcel of land, bought years ago for \n     $4,000, allows more room to teach beginners, which comes in \n     handy with more than 700 students enrolled in after-school \n     programs.\n       Hundreds of local youth and Vermont high school racers also \n     train and compete on the main trail next to a busy T-bar.\n       ``It's just an extension of when the local parent-teacher \n     organization came to my mom and asked if she would teach the \n     kids on our hill,'' said Barbara Ann, who heads the current \n     instruction program. ``Mom always said skiing was the best \n     way to keep parents and their kids together in the \n     backyard.''\n       On a bluff overlooking a dirt and cinder parking lot, the \n     Cochran lodge is festooned with dozens of numbered racing \n     bibs from championship races. The oldest are from New England \n     in the mid-1960s and the newest were proudly spirited home \n     from top international competitions last winter.\n       The skis Barbara Ann used to win her gold medal hang from \n     the ceiling, and photos celebrating the careers of nearly \n     every Cochran are tacked to the walls, which takes up a lot \n     of room given the breadth of the accomplishments. From Bob's \n     1973 win in the famed Hahnenkamm combined in Austria to \n     Lindy's top American finish for a woman in the 1976 Olympic \n     slalom and giant slalom, to N.C.A.A. championships by the \n     grandchildren, the Mickey and Ginny Cochran racing pedigree \n     is long and full. And all of it from a hill that is a \n     miniature of a major ski resort.\n       Simplicity and unpretentiousness have remained hallmarks of \n     the Cochran way. So has affordability. A junior weekend lift \n     ticket is $14. Children pay about $40 for a season of after-\n     school lessons $90 with rentals.\n       ``And we give scholarships if someone can't afford that,'' \n     Lindy said. ``If you really want to learn to ski, you won't \n     be turned away.''\n       The ski area may have registered as a nonprofit \n     organization only after Mickey's death, but as Ginny told her \n     children at the time, ``It was always a nonprofit.''\n\n\n                       Viability and Availability\n\n       The current ski area, with its gaggle of instructors, \n     coaches and lift operators, is overseen by a board that has \n     had to raise money for improvements like top-to-bottom snow-\n     making. The bills are paid, the lodge picnic tables overflow \n     in the winter with excited, red-cheeked children, and warm \n     food is doled out of a tiny kitchen. But donations are \n     continually sought to keep Cochran's Ski Area viable and \n     available to the next generation.\n       On a stormy Friday four days before Christmas, rain pelted \n     the tin roof of the Cochran lodge and gusts knocked out the \n     electrical power. Man-made snow was on the slopes, but the \n     downpour threatened the anticipated opening of the ski area \n     the next day.\n       The four children of Mickey and Ginny Cochran, who live not \n     far from Richmond, happily gathered inside the lodge \n     nonetheless, reminiscing and finishing each other's sentences \n     as if they were at the dining room table in 1960.\n       They discussed the Olympics and world championships like \n     run-of-the-mill high school events. When shown black-and-\n     white pictures of their Olympic media appearances, the \n     Cochrans hardly seemed impressed; they were too busy teasing \n     one another about their 1970s hairdos.\n       One by one, recollections from decades past were summoned \n     with ease and spontaneity, and almost every story began with \n     a Cochran turning and pointing at the ski trails beyond the \n     lodge window and saying:\n       ``We were on the hill. . . .''\n       The weather that day may have been cold and blustery. The \n     Cochran memories are forever warm and genuine.\n       After a few hours, the siblings departed wondering when the \n     ski area--a Vermont cultural landmark--might open for another \n     winter.\n       ``If it stops raining, we've still got a chance tomorrow,'' \n     Lindy said.\n       The next day, the rain had ceased but the snow beneath the \n     T-bar lift was too irregular for Cochran's to open as \n     scheduled.\n       About 25 youngsters from the weekend race program showed up \n     anyway. So did some coaches and the three Cochran sisters. \n     Pulling into the muddy parking lot, they got out of their \n     cars to gaze uphill at the swath of good snow that remained \n     on the central trail.\n       A procession soon began hiking up the hill carrying skis. \n     Gates were set in the snow. Racers skied down.\n       Smiling, they walked back up the hill. Over and over.\n       It snowed soon after. Three days later, Cochran's Ski Area \n     officially opened for another winter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S755-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S755-S756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF JENKINS, KENTUCKY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand before you today to recognize \nand salute the city of Jenkins in Letcher County, KY, as they celebrate \n100 years of rich State history.\n  Jenkins's roots reach back before its official incorporation. Four \nsmaller communities combined to form the city of Jenkins when \nConsolidation Coal Company purchased 100,000 acres of coal lands in \neastern Kentucky. Consolidation Coal's director, George C. Jenkins, \nbecame the city's namesake in 1912 when it was officially founded. The \ncommunities that joined together, Dunham, Burdine, Jenkins, and \nMcRoberts, helped build the new city, which grew quickly. On January 9, \n1912, the Commonwealth of Kentucky recognized Jenkins as a city of the \nsixth class, and by April 20 of the same year, its government was \nestablished.\n  The people of Jenkins had an important role to play in the State--\nmining the ``Cavalier'' coal that earned the reputation as the best \ncoal in Kentucky. The success and importance of their work further \nfacilitated the expansion of the city, and within a few years a bank, \ngrocery store, sawmill, brick plant, hospital, bakery, drug store, post \noffice, jail, hotel, recreation center, and a few churches and schools \nall opened to serve the population of the area.\n  Today, citizens of Jenkins enjoy the incredible Appalachian heritage \nas much as the beautiful mountains and scenery that surround them. The \npicturesque surroundings of the southeastern Kentucky mountains, and \nthe Pine Mountain area, are on display in Breaks Interstate Park, known \nas ``The Grand Canyon of the South,'' and in places like the Raven Rock \nGolf Course. Set in this environment is ``Jenkins Homecoming Days'' and \nthe\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\nZegeer Museum, which celebrates the history and culture of the town. \nThese highlights speak to the hard work and dedication of the citizens \nof Jenkins in the past century, especially their pioneering work in the \ncoal mining and railroad industries, which the Zegeer Museum details \nwonderfully.\n  At this time, I would like to ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to \njoin me in honoring the city of Jenkins as we look back in appreciation \non their storied past, and recognize the diligent work of the residents \nto keep up the traditions and build a bright future.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that an article from the Mountain Eagle \nnoting Jenkins's rich history be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Mountain Eagle, June 13, 2012]\n\n        100 Years of Mining History Displayed at Jenkins Museum\n\n                            (By Marcie Crim)\n\n       With the City of Jenkins celebrating its centennial this \n     year, there is much to learn about the town's history, and \n     the David A. Zegeer Coal-Railroad Museum is a good place to \n     begin.\n       In the fall of 1911, Consolidation Coal Company purchased \n     100,000 acres of coal lands in Pike, Letcher, and Floyd \n     counties from the Northern Coal and Coke Company. A site was \n     selected for a town to be named in honor of George C. \n     Jenkins, one of the leading citizens of Baltimore and a \n     director of Consolidation Coal. By the time Jenkins was \n     incorporated in 1912--containing the communities of Dunham, \n     Burdine, Jenkins, and McRoberts--construction of the town was \n     booming.\n\n       Consolidation Coal built Elkhorn Lake to supply water to \n     run the turbines in a power plant. The company constructed \n     several businesses to serve the new residents of Jenkins--a \n     bank, grocery store, sawmill, brick plant and a hospital that \n     was built in 1915. Also built were a bakery, drug store, post \n     office, jail, hotel, recreation center, churches and schools.\n       Jenkins was a town built to serve one purpose--to mine the \n     ``Cavalier'' coal that was to become known as the best coal \n     in Kentucky--and its history is on display at the Zegeer \n     Museum located on Main Street in the old train depot.\n       The museum is named in honor of a former employee of \n     Consolidation Coal and its successor in Jenkins, Beth-Elkhorn \n     Coal Corp. Zegeer joined Consol in Jenkins in the late 1940s. \n     When the company sold its Letcher County operations to \n     Bethlehem Steel in 1956, Zegeer became division \n     superintendent. He retired as manager of Beth-Elkhorn in \n     1977.\n       In 1983, Zegeer was confirmed as Assistant Secretary of \n     Labor for the U.S. Department of Mine Safety and Health \n     Administration (MSHA) in 1983, until retiring in 1987. \n     According to Lois Greer, the current curator of the museum, \n     Zegeer was ``a company man, but he really cared about the \n     people in this community.''\n       Zegeer also became interested in the history of Jenkins, \n     and in conjunction with another resident of Jenkins--Marshall \n     Prunty, president of Roberts and Schaeffer Co.--compiled a \n     videotape of the history of Jenkins based on 145 photographs \n     taken during the years of 1911 through the early 1930s and \n     various publications and interviews with some of the oldest \n     living residents. The documentary, entitled ``Birth of a \n     Mining Town, Jenkins, Ky.,'' is available for purchase at the \n     museum.\n       Many pieces of Jenkins history can be found at the museum, \n     from photos of the town's construction to various examples of \n     mining equipment--everything from hard hats to breathing \n     devices, dinner buckets, head lamps and more. Also on display \n     is the sword of ``Bad'' John Wright, also known as ``Devil \n     John,'' an infamous former resident of Letcher County. Many \n     of the exhibits in the museum are on loan from current and \n     former residents of Jenkins.\n       Lois Greer is a friendly woman who has called Jenkins home \n     for many years. She loves to talk about the history of the \n     town and tell stories of the people and buildings that once \n     called Jenkins home. She's more than happy to walk visitors \n     through the various rooms at the museum, pointing out \n     photographs that show coal camp houses, community centers \n     that no longer exist, and grand buildings that were later \n     taken by fire. She said attendance has been down at the \n     museum lately, but she expects it will pick back up come \n     August when the celebration begins in earnest.\n       As Jenkins prepares to celebrate its 100th birthday, the \n     museum is the perfect place to dive in and begin exploring \n     the history of coal mining in Letcher County. You can leave \n     with DVDs to watch at home, folk art made from lumps of shiny \n     black coal, and postcards showing photos of the town's \n     construction and subsequent boom years. You'll also walk out \n     with enough knowledge to make you want to start Googling the \n     history of Jenkins to find out more.\n       Jenkins is a proud town with a singular story to tell--a \n     story of building a town from scratch, digging it out of the \n     earth to be settled solely for the purpose of mining coal.\n       To contact the museum, phone 606-832-4676.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S756-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TONY WHITAKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my honor to stand before you \ntoday to recognize an esteemed Kentuckian, Mr. Tony Whitaker, on the \noccasion of his recent retirement from the position of CEO of First \nFederal Bancorp this past December. I speak for the communities that \nMr. Whitaker has served and worked in during his career when I say that \nhis desire to help others, work diligently and contribute to the lives \nof those around him are certainly deserving of our respect and honor.\n  Tony has worked as a banker in Richmond, Louisville, and most \nrecently in Hazard, KY, where he held the position of chief executive \nofficer of First Federal Bancorp. According to Mr. Whitaker, his best \nyears of the four decades spent in banking were spent at First Federal, \nsomething that the people of Hazard would no doubt confirm. His move to \nLouisville is motivated by a desire to be near family, but his \nassurance that he will miss calling Hazard ``home'' is represented by \nhis fond memory of the welcoming community he found upon his arrival in \nthe 1990s.\n  Tony has been an indispensable presence both in Hazard and at First \nFederal, and his strong leadership has prepared the bank to thrive, \nallowing those he has invested in to continue his legacy. He will \ncontinue to stay involved by serving as the chairman of Kentucky First \nFederal Bancorp. He genuinely wants to positively impact others, \noffering to be just a phone call away to anyone who needs his help.\n  At this time, I would like to ask my fellow Senators to join me in \nhonoring Mr. Tony Whitaker. This well-known and well-respected man is a \nmodel citizen, and represents the best of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nWe are grateful for his input and impact on his community, and I ask \nunanimous consent that a newspaper article highlighting his \nachievements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Hazard Herald, December 20, 2012]\n\n              Whitaker Stepping Down as First Federal CEO\n\n                           (By Cris Ritchie)\n\n       Hazard.--In less than two weeks, Tony Whitaker will step \n     down as CEO of First Federal Bancorp, the parent company of \n     First Federal Savings & Loan of Hazard, and during a \n     reception on Thursday he expressed his admiration and \n     appreciation to the city of Hazard, where he has made his \n     home for the past 15 years.\n       Whitaker, who also served several years as president of the \n     local chamber of commerce, will remain chairman of the \n     company's board of directors. Don Jennings, the current CEO \n     of the company's Frankfort location, will take on Whitaker's \n     role as chief executive officer, while Lou Ella Farler will \n     become CEO of the Hazard First Federal bank, a job for which \n     she has been transitioning for the past few months.\n       First Federal in Hazard hosted a reception for Whitaker in \n     the bank's lobby on Thursday, during which he noted that the \n     best of his four decades of experience in the banking \n     business were spent in Perry County.\n       ``My best years have been with this bank here in Hazard, \n     and living in this town the last 15 years or so,'' Whitaker \n     said.\n       Whitaker plans to move to Louisville to be close to his \n     daughter and grandchildren, but will remain active with the \n     company as board chairman. The transition once he steps down \n     in Hazard will be seamless, he added, and for the customer \n     there shouldn't be any difference as the bank will continue \n     to offer the same service and products. And he expects the \n     bank to continue to thrive with Farler serving as its CEO.\n       ``Through the year I've transitioned, and Lou Ella pretty \n     much got hands on and made most of the decisions,'' he said.\n       He added that were his family not living in Louisville he'd \n     likely remain in Hazard, and he expressed his appreciation to \n     the people here for welcoming him into the community when he \n     arrived in the 1990s.\n       ``I appreciate the good town I've had the opportunity to \n     live in, the boards that I've had and the people I've been \n     able to work with,'' he said, ``and most of all our \n     customers.''\n       Whitaker will step down as CEO on December 31.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S756-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S756-S757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the problem of gun \nviolence in America. Every day we lose over 30 men, women and children \nin violent shooting deaths. More than 11,000 Americans are murdered \nwith guns each year. That is more deaths\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\neach year than all the American lives lost in the 9/11 attacks . . . \nand the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war combined. Every day provides \nsome grim reminder of the toll of gun violence in our nation. And today \nmarks yet another sad anniversary.\n  Five years ago today, on February 14, 2008, a gunman entered a \nlecture hall on the campus of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. \nThe gunman opened fire on the students gathered in the hall, taking the \nlives of five students and wounding 17 others. The five Illinoisans we \nlost that day were: Gayle Dubowski, 20 years old, from Carol Stream, \nwho sang in her church choir and enjoyed working as a camp counselor; \nCatalina Garcia, of Cicero, age 20, who had a glowing smile and who \nhoped to be a teacher someday; Juliana Gehant, of Mendota, age 32, a \nveteran of the United States Army and Army Reserve who also dreamed of \nbecoming a teacher; Ryanne Mace, of Carpentersville, only 19 years old, \nwho aspired to work as a counselor so she could help others; and Daniel \nParmenter, 20 years old, from Westchester, a rugby player and a gentle \ngiant who died trying to shield his girlfriend from the shooter.\n  This day was devastating for the families of the victims, for the NIU \ncommunity, and for our nation. We were heartbroken by the senseless \nmurders of these young Americans who had hopes and dreams and bright \nfutures. The Northern Illinois University community came together in \nresponse to the tragedy. They held each other close, and continued to \nmove ``forward, together forward'' in the words of the Huskie fight \nsong. But no family and no community should have to suffer like this. \nAnd those who were scarred by the shooting but survived will never \nforget that day and never fully heal from it.\n  There are things that we can do to move forward together on this \nissue of gun violence. Just the other day I received an email from \nPatrick Korellis, of Gurnee, IL, who was in the NIU lecture hall on \nthat day 5 years ago. He was shot in the head but survived. Patrick \nwrote me because he believes Congress needs to act to prevent and \nreduce gun violence. He wrote in support of the proposals that the \nPresident has put forward and that we will soon consider in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. These proposals will not stop every shooting in \nAmerica. But they will stop many of them. And lives will be saved if we \ncan move forward and put them into effect.\n  We know what we need to do. Earlier this week I chaired a hearing in \nthe Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights to \ndiscuss ways we can protect our communities from gun violence while \nrespecting the Second Amendment. We discussed a number of common sense \nproposals. First, we need to have a system of universal background \nchecks for all gun sales. This idea is a no-brainer. Universal \nbackground checks will ensure that those who are prohibited by law from \nbuying a gun, like felons, fugitives, and the mentally ill, cannot get \none from a private seller at a gun show or over the Internet. Universal \nbackground checks are not controversial. In fact, the idea is supported \nby 74 percent of the members of the NRA, according to a poll conducted \nlast year by Republican pollster Frank Luntz.\n  We should also stop the flood of new military-style assault weapons \nonto our streets. When you talk to hunters, they tell you that these \nkinds of weapons are not needed for hunting. And these weapons are not \ndesigned for self-defense. These are weapons of aggression, designed to \nspray a large number of bullets in a short time with minimal reloading. \nAnd they were used to commit mass slaughter in places like Newtown and \nAurora. Our children and our first responders should not have to face \nthese weapons of aggression. Surely we can agree on reasonable limits \nfor military-style assault weapons.\n  We should also limit the capacity of ammunition magazines--to a level \nthat allows for reasonable self-defense but that reduces the scope of \ncarnage that a mass shooter can cause. This would have saved lives in \nTucson and in other mass shootings.\n  We should crack down on the straw purchasers who buy guns and then \ngive them to criminals and other prohibited purchasers. Straw \npurchasing fuels the criminal gun market, and it costs lives. But right \nnow federal law only allows straw purchasers to be charged with a \npaperwork violation for lying on the gun sale form. At the hearing I \nchaired earlier this week, we learned from U.S. Attorney Timothy Heaphy \nof the Western District of Virginia that these ``paperwork \nprosecutions'' are difficult to prove and usually carry only minor \npenalties. That is not good enough. We need to create a strong \ndeterrent to these unlawful straw purchases so we can stop this supply \nchain of guns to criminals.\n  At the hearing I chaired, we also heard powerful testimony from \nSandra Wortham of the South Side of Chicago. Sandra's brother, Officer \nThomas Wortham the Fourth, was shot and killed by gang members on May \n19, 2010, in front of his parents' home. Thomas was a Chicago Police \nOfficer, a community leader and a combat veteran who had served two \ntours in Iraq. Some say that the answer to gun violence in America is \nsimply to arm more good guys with guns so they can shoot back. But both \nThomas Wortham and his father, a retired Chicago police officer, were \narmed that night, and they shot back at the men who pulled a gun on \nThomas. Even so, those men killed Thomas Wortham with a straw-purchased \nhandgun.\n  These were men who were not allowed to legally buy a handgun, but \nthey got one all too easily on the streets--a gun that was straw \npurchased in Mississippi and trafficked up to Chicago. As Sandra \nWortham said so eloquently in her testimony, ``the fact that my brother \nand father were armed that night did not prevent my brother from being \nkilled. We need to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands in the \nfirst place. I don't think that makes us anti-gun, I think it makes us \npro-decent, law abiding people.''\n  I agree with Sandra. We can take steps, consistent with our \nConstitution and the Second Amendment, to limit access to dangerous \nweapons and keep them out of the hands of those prohibited from using \nthem.\n  I believe the Wortham family deserves a vote here in the United \nStates Senate. They deserve a vote on common sense reforms that would \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands. We owe that to them, and I look \nforward to that vote.\n  Whether it strikes in a college lecture hall in DeKalb or on the \nsidewalks of the South Side of Chicago, gun violence is a tragedy. \nToday we mourn the loss of those taken from us at NIU 5 years ago. And \nwe mourn Thomas Wortham and the tens of thousands of other Americans we \nhave lost in violent shootings since that day. But the time is coming \nsoon when we will be able to vote on measures to save families from the \nsuffering that the Worthams and so many others have experienced. And I \nhope the Senate will make those families proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S757-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S757-S758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE TIME IS NOW\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Since then, we have \nmourned the loss of the 20 wonderful children and 6 extraordinary \nadults who were murdered that day. Their lives were taken by a mentally \nderanged individual who easily obtained a semi-automatic military-style \nassault rifle with a high capacity ammunition magazine.\n  It has been estimated that there are currently 18 million assault \nweapons in circulation around the United States.

These weapons, along with high-capacity ammunition magazines, \ncan easily escalate confrontation into murder, petty crime into \ntragedy, and a killing of one or two people into a massive slaughter.\n  The weight of evidence shows that since Congress allowed the Federal \nassault weapons ban to expire in 2004, the use of military style \nassault weapons in crime has surged around our Nation. For example, a \n2010 study conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum found that \nsince the ban lapsed, 37 percent of police agencies have reported \nincreases in criminals' use of assault\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\nweapons. A separate Washington Post analysis revealed that the ban was \nassociated with a 60 percent decline in the number of guns with high-\ncapacity magazines recovered at Virginia crime scenes between 1998 and \n2004. But since the ban expired in 2004, the number of guns recovered \nwith high-capacity magazines has more than doubled. A Department of \nJustice study of several cities found that high-capacity magazines are \nused in 14 to 26 percent of gun crimes and in 31 to 41 percent of fatal \npolice shootings in the cities analyzed.\n  It is long past time to take concrete action to support our law \nenforcement communities and to prevent more of these massacres. That is \nwhy I am a cosponsor of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013. By preventing \nthe future possession, manufacture, sale and importation of assault \ntype weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, this bill would \nstop the flood of these weapons of war into our communities. It would \nsupport law enforcement officers across our Nation, who should not be \nforced to confront lawbreakers armed with military weapons. And it \nwould protect the rights of hunters by specifically naming thousands of \nfirearms with legitimate sporting, sentimental or other value that \nwould remain legal to possess.\n  Mr. President, we must face reality. We live in a nation trapped in \nan epidemic of gun violence. Where a day at the mall or a trip to the \nmovies can become a nightmare. Where parents send their children to \nschool and have to worry about whether they will come home.\n  Is this the Nation we want, or the Nation we want to leave to our \nchildren? We must not wait for the next madman to easily and legally \npurchase a military-style assault weapon and a high capacity magazine. \nI urge my colleagues to protect the American people by enacting \nmeasures to stem the tide of gun tragedies. It is long past time for \nthis kind of violence to end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S758-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S758-S761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  TANF\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the GAO opinion letter dated September 4, 2012, and the TANF \nInformation Memorandum dated July 12, 2012.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Government\n\n\n                                        Accountability Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2012.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Dave Camp,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives.\n       By letter of July 31, 2012, you asked whether an \n     Information Memorandum issued by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services (HHS) on July 12, 2012 concerning the \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program \n     constitutes a rule for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Review Act (CRA). The CRA is intended to keep Congress \n     informed of the rulemaking activities of federal agencies and \n     provides that before a rule can take effect, the agency must \n     submit the rule to each House of Congress and the Comptroller \n     General. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that \n     the July 12, 2012 Information Memorandum is a rule under the \n     CRA. Therefore, it must be submitted to Congress and the \n     Comptroller General before taking effect.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant, \n     administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services, provides federal funding to states for both \n     traditional welfare cash assistance as well as a variety of \n     other benefits and services to meet the needs of low-income \n     families and children. While states have some flexibility in \n     implementing and administering their state TANF programs, \n     there are numerous federal requirements and guidelines that \n     states must meet. For example, under section 402 of the \n     Social Security Act, in order to be eligible to receive TANF \n     funds, a state must submit to HHS a written plan outlining, \n     among other things, how it will implement various aspects of \n     its TANF program. More specifically, under section \n     402(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Social Security Act, the written \n     plan must outline how the state will ensure that TANF \n     recipients engage in work activities. Under section 407 of \n     the Social Security Act, states must also ensure that a \n     specified percentage of their TANF recipients engage in work \n     activities as defined by federal law.\n       In its July 12 Information Memorandum, HHS notified states \n     of HHS' willingness to exercise its waiver authority under \n     section 1115 of the Social Security Act. Under section 1115, \n     HHS has the authority to waive compliance with the \n     requirements of section 402 in the case of experimental, \n     pilot, or demonstration projects which the Secretary \n     determines are likely to assist in promoting the objectives \n     of TANF. In its Information Memorandum, HHS asserted that it \n     has the authority to waive the requirement in section \n     402(a)(1)(A)(iii) and authorize states to ``test approaches \n     and methods other than those set forth in section 407,'' \n     including definitions of work activities and the calculation \n     of participation rates. HHS informed states that it would use \n     this waiver authority to allow states to test various \n     strategies, policies, and procedures designed to improve \n     employment outcomes for needy families. The Information \n     Memorandum sets forth requirements that must be met for a \n     waiver request to be considered by HHS, including an \n     evaluation plan, a set of performance measures that states \n     will track to monitor ongoing performance and outcomes, and a \n     budget including the costs of program evaluation. In \n     addition, the Information Memorandum provides that states \n     must seek public input on the proposal prior to approval by \n     HHS.\n\n\n                                ANALYSIS\n\n       The definition of ``rule'' in the CRA incorporates by \n     reference the definition of ``rule'' in the Administrative \n     Procedure Act (APA), with some exceptions. Therefore, our \n     analysis of whether the July 12 Information Memorandum is a \n     rule under the CRA involves determining whether it is rule \n     under the APA and whether it falls within any of the \n     exceptions contained in the CRA. The APA defines a rule as \n     follows:\n       ``[T]he whole or a part of an agency statement of general \n     or particular applicability and future effect designed to \n     implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or \n     describing the organization, procedure, or practice \n     requirements of an agency and includes the approval or \n     prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or \n     financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, \n     facilities, appliances, services or allowances therefor or of \n     valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any \n     of the foregoing[.]''\n       This definition of a rule has been said to include ``nearly \n     every statement an agency may make.''\n       The CRA identifies 3 exceptions from its definition of a \n     rule: (1) any rule of particular applicability; (2) any rule \n     relating to agency management or personnel; or (3) any rule \n     of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not \n     substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency \n     parties. 5 U.S.C. 804(3).\n       The definition of a rule under the CRA is very broad. See \n     B-287557, May 14, 2001 (Congress intended that the CRA should \n     be broadly interpreted both as to type and scope of rules \n     covered). The CRA borrows the definition of a rule from 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 551, as opposed to the more narrow definition of \n     legislative rules requiring notice and comment contained in 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 553. As a result, agency pronouncements may be \n     rules within the definition of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551, and the \n     CRA, even if they are not subject to notice and comment \n     rulemaking requirements under section 553. See B-316048, \n     April 17, 2008 (the breadth of the term ``rule'' reaches \n     agency pronouncements beyond those that require notice and \n     comment rulemaking) and B-287557, cited above. In addition to \n     the plain language of the CRA, the legislative history \n     confirms that it is intended to include within its purview \n     almost all rules that an agency issues and not only those \n     rules that must be promulgated according to the notice and \n     comment requirements in section 553 of the APA. In his floor \n     statement during final consideration of the bill, \n     Representative McIntosh, a principal sponsor of the \n     legislation, emphasized this point:\n       ``Although agency interpretive rules, general statements of \n     policy, guideline documents, and agency policy and procedure \n     manuals may not be subject to the notice and comment \n     provisions of section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code, \n     these types of documents are covered under the congressional \n     review provisions of the new chapter 8 of title 5.\n       Under section 801(a), covered rules, with very few \n     exceptions, may not go into effect until the relevant agency \n     submits a copy of the rule and an accompanying report to both \n     Houses of Congress. Interpretive rules, general statements of \n     policy, and analogous agency policy guidelines are covered \n     without qualification because they meet the definition of a \n     `rule' borrowed from section 551 of title 5, and are not \n     excluded from the definition of a rule.''\n       On its face, the July 12 Information Memorandum falls \n     within the definition of a rule under the APA definition \n     incorporated into the CRA. First, consistent with our prior \n     decisions, we look to the scope of the agency's action to \n     determine whether it is a general statement of policy or an \n     interpretation of law of general applicability. That \n     determination does not require a finding that it has general \n     applicability to the population as a whole; instead, all that \n     is required is that it has general applicability within its \n     intended range. See B-287557, cited above (a record of \n     decision affecting the issues of water flow in two rivers was \n     a general statement of policy with general applicability \n     within its intended range). Applying these principles, we \n     have held that a letter released by the Centers for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services to state health officials concerning \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\n     (SCHIP) was of general applicability because it extended to \n     all states that sought to enroll children with family incomes \n     exceeding 250 percent of the federal poverty level in their \n     SCHIP programs, as well as all states that had already \n     enrolled such children. Similarly, the July 12 Information \n     Memorandum is of general, rather than particular, \n     applicability because it extends to all states administering \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs that \n     seek a waiver for a demonstration project.\n       Next we must determine whether the action is prospective in \n     nature, that is, whether it is concerned with policy \n     considerations for the future and not with the evaluation of \n     past conduct. In B-316048, we held that the SCHIP letter was \n     intended to clarify and explain the manner in which CMS \n     applies statutory and regulatory requirements to states that \n     wanted to extend coverage under the SCHIP programs. \n     Similarly, the July 12 Information Memorandum is concerned \n     with authorizing demonstration projects in the future, rather \n     than the evaluation of past or present demonstration \n     projects. Specifically, the Information Memorandum informs \n     states that HHS will use its statutory authority to consider \n     waiver requests, and sets out requirements that waiver \n     requests must meet. Accordingly, it is designed to implement, \n     interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\n       In addition, the Information Memorandum does not fall \n     within any of the three exclusions for a rule under the CRA. \n     As discussed above, the Information Memorandum applies to all \n     states that administer TANF programs, and therefore is of \n     general applicability, rather than particular applicability. \n     The Information Memorandum applies to the states, and does \n     not relate to agency management or personnel. Finally, the \n     Information Memorandum sets out the criteria by which states \n     may apply for waivers from certain requirements of the TANF \n     program. These criteria affect the obligations of the states, \n     which are non-agency parties.\n       GAO has consistently emphasized the broad scope of the \n     definition of ``rule'' in the CRA in determining the \n     applicability of the CRA to an agency document. Other \n     documents deemed to be rules include letters, records of \n     decision, booklets, interim guidance, and memoranda. See, for \n     example, B-316048, April 17, 2008 (a letter released by the \n     Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of HHS concerning a \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program measure, to ensure \n     that coverage under a state plan does not substitute for \n     coverage under group health plans, described by the agency as \n     a general statement of policy, was a rule) and B-287557, May \n     14, 2001 (a ``record of decision'' issued by the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service of the Department of Interior in connection \n     with a federal irrigation project was a rule).\n       Finally, the cases where we have found that an agency \n     pronouncement was not a rule involved facts that are clearly \n     distinguishable from the July 12 Information Memorandum.\n       We requested the views of the General Counsel of HHS on \n     whether the July 12 Information Memorandum is a rule for \n     purposes of the CRA by letter dated August 3, 2012. HHS \n     responded on August 31, 2012, stating that the Information \n     Memorandum was issued as a non-binding guidance document, and \n     that HHS contends that guidance documents do not need to be \n     submitted pursuant to the CRA. Furthermore, HHS notes that it \n     informally notified Congress by providing notice to the \n     Majority and Minority staff members of the House Ways and \n     Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee on the day the \n     Information Memorandum was issued.\n       We cannot agree with HHS's conclusion that guidance \n     documents are not rules for the purposes of the CRA and HHS \n     cites no support for this position. The definition of \n     ``rule'' is expansive and specifically includes documents \n     that implement or interpret law or policy. This is exactly \n     what the HHS Information Memorandum does. It interprets \n     section 402(a) and section 1115 to permit waivers for a \n     demonstration program HHS is initiating. We have held that \n     agency guidance, including guidance characterized as non-\n     binding, constitutes a rule under the CRA. See B-281575, \n     cited above. In addition, the legislative history of the CRA \n     specifically includes guidance documents as an example of an \n     agency pronouncement subject to the CRA. A joint statement \n     for the record by Senators Nickles, Reid, and Stevens, \n     submitted to the Congressional Record upon enactment of the \n     CRA, details four categories of rules covered by the \n     definition in section 551. These categories include formal \n     rulemaking under sections 556 and 557, notice-and-comment \n     rulemaking under section 553, statements of general policy \n     and interpretations of general applicability under section \n     552, and ``a body of materials that fall within the APA \n     definition of a `rule' . . . but that meet none of procedural \n     specifications of the first three classes. These include \n     guidance documents and the like.'' Finally, while HHS may \n     have informally notified the cited Congressional committees \n     of the issuance of the Information Memorandum, informal \n     notification does not meet the reporting requirements of the \n     CRA.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       We find that the July 12 Information Memorandum issued by \n     HHS is a statement of general applicability and future \n     effect, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or \n     policy with regard to TANF. Furthermore, it does not come \n     within any of the exceptions to the definition of rule \n     contained in the CRA. Accordingly, the Information Memorandum \n     is a rule under the Congressional Review Act.\n       We note that this opinion is limited to the issue of \n     whether the Information Memorandum is a rule under the CRA. \n     We are not expressing an opinion on the applicability of any \n     other legal requirements, including, but not limited to, \n     notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the APA, or \n     whether the Information Memorandum would be a valid exercise \n     or interpretation of statutes or regulations.\n       Accordingly, given our conclusions above, and in accordance \n     with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1), the Information \n     Memorandum is subject to the requirement that it be submitted \n     to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before \n     it can take effect.\n       If you have any questions concerning this opinion, please \n     contact Edda Emmanuelli Perez, Managing Associate General \n     Counsel.\n                                                   Lynn H.

[42 \n     U.S.C. 1315]; Section 402 of the Social Security Act. [42 \n     U.S.C. 602]\n       Background: Section 1115 of the Social Security Act \n     provides authority for the Secretary of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) to consider and approve \n     experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects which, in the \n     Secretary's judgment, are likely to assist in promoting the \n     objectives of Title IV-A. Section 1115 allows for waiver of \n     compliance with section 402 of the Social Security Act to the \n     extent and for the period necessary to enable a state to \n     carry out an approved project. The statute also provides \n     authority for costs of such projects which would not \n     otherwise be an allowable use of funds under Part A of Title \n     IV to be regarded as an allowable use of funds, to the extent \n     and for the period approved.\n       As specified in statute, the purpose of Part A is to \n     increase the flexibility of states in operating a program \n     designed to: (1) provide assistance to needy families so that \n     children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes \n     of relatives; (2) end the dependence of needy parents on \n     government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and \n     marriage; (3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-\n     wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for \n     preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; \n     and (4) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent \n     families.\n       Purpose: HHS is encouraging states to consider new, more \n     effective ways to meet the goals of TANF, particularly \n     helping parents successfully prepare for, find, and retain \n     employment. Therefore, HHS is issuing this information \n     memorandum to notify states of the Secretary's willingness to \n     exercise her waiver authority under section 1115 of the \n     Social Security Act to allow states to test alternative and \n     innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are \n     designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.\n       States led the way on welfare reform in the 1990s--testing \n     new approaches and learning what worked and what did not. The \n     Secretary is interested in using her authority to approve \n     waiver demonstrations to challenge states to engage in a new \n     round of innovation that seeks to find more effective \n     mechanisms for helping families succeed in employment. In \n     providing for these demonstrations, HHS will hold states \n     accountable by requiring both a federally-approved evaluation \n     and interim performance targets that ensure an immediate \n     focus on measurable outcomes. States must develop evaluation \n     plans that are sufficient to evaluate the effect of the \n     proposed approach in furthering a TANF purpose as well as \n     interim targets the state commits to achieve. States that \n     fail to meet interim outcome targets will be required to \n     develop an improvement plan and can face termination of the \n     waiver project.\n       The demonstration authority provided by section 1115 and \n     sound evaluation of approved projects will provide valuable \n     knowledge that will help lead to improvements in achieving \n     the purposes of the TANF program.\n       Information: Scope of Authority. Section 1115 authorizes \n     waivers concerning section 402. Accordingly, other provisions \n     of the TANF statute are not waivable. For example, the \n     purposes of TANF are not waivable, because they are contained \n     in section 401. The prohibitions on assistance are not \n     waivable, because they are contained in section 408.\n       While the TANF work participation requirements are \n     contained in section 407, section 402(a)(1)(A)(iii) requires \n     that the state plan ``[e]nsure that parents and caretakers \n     receiving assistance under the program engage in work \n     activities in accordance with section 407.'' Thus, HHS has \n     authority to waive compliance with this 402 requirement and \n     authorize a state to test approaches and\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\n     methods other than those set forth in section 407, including \n     definitions of work activities and engagement, specified \n     limitations, verification procedures, and the calculation of \n     participation rates. As described below, however, HHS will \n     only consider approving waivers relating to the work \n     participation requirements that make changes intended to lead \n     to more effective means of meeting the work goals of TANF.\n       Moreover, HHS is committed to ensuring that any \n     demonstration projects approved under this authority will be \n     focused on improving employment outcomes and contributing to \n     the evidence base for effective programs; therefore, terms \n     and conditions will require a federally-approved evaluation \n     plan designed to build our knowledge base. TANF funds may be \n     used to fund an approved evaluation and state funds spent on \n     an approved evaluation may be considered state maintenance-\n     of-effort (MOE) expenditures. In addition, terms and \n     conditions will require either interim targets for each \n     performance measure or a strategy for establishing baseline \n     performance on a set of performance measures and a framework \n     for how interim goals will be set after the baseline measures \n     are established. The terms and conditions will establish \n     consequences for failing to meet interim performance targets \n     including, but not limited to, the implementation of an \n     improvement plan and, if the failure to meet performance \n     targets continues, termination of the waivers and \n     demonstration project.\n       HHS Priorities. In exercising her broad discretion for \n     waivers, the Secretary is interested in approaches that seek \n     to improve employment outcomes. Accordingly:\n       Waivers will be granted only for provisions related to \n     section 402.\n       The purposes of TANF, the prohibitions contained in section \n     408 (including the time limits on assistance contained in \n     that section), or any other provision of TANF other than \n     those specified in section 402 will not be waived.\n       The Secretary will not approve a waiver for an initiative \n     that appears substantially likely to reduce access to \n     assistance or employment for needy families.\n       The Secretary will not use her authority to allow use of \n     TANF funds to provide assistance to individuals or families \n     subject to the TANF prohibitions on assistance.\n       The Secretary will not waive section 402(a)(5) relating to \n     requirements to provide equitable access to Indians.\n       Waiver demonstration projects may be conducted in limited \n     geographic areas or statewide. The Administration for \n     Children and Families (ACF) is interested in more efficient \n     or effective means to promote employment entry, retention, \n     advancement, or access to jobs that offer opportunities for \n     earnings and advancement that will allow participants to \n     avoid dependence on government benefits. The following are \n     examples of projects that states may want to consider--these \n     are illustrative only:\n       Projects that improve coordination with other components of \n     the workforce investment system, including programs operated \n     under the Workforce Investment Act, or to test an innovative \n     approach to use performance-based contracts and management in \n     order to improve employment outcomes.\n       Projects that demonstrate attainment of superior employment \n     outcomes if a state is held accountable for negotiated \n     employment outcomes in lieu of participation rate \n     requirements.\n       Projects under which a state would count individuals in \n     TANF-subsidized jobs but no longer receiving TANF assistance \n     toward participation rates for a specified period of time in \n     conjunction with an evaluation of the effectiveness of a \n     subsidized jobs strategy.\n       Projects that improve collaboration with the workforce and/\n     or post-secondary education systems to test multi-year career \n     pathways models for TANF recipients that combine learning and \n     work.\n       Projects that demonstrate strategies for more effectively \n     serving individuals with disabilities, along with an \n     alternative approach to measuring participation and outcomes \n     for individuals with disabilities.\n       Projects that test the impact of a comprehensive universal \n     engagement system in lieu of certain participation rate \n     requirements.\n       Projects that test systematically extending the period in \n     which vocational educational training or job search/readiness \n     programs count toward participation rates, either generally \n     or for particular subgroups, such as an extended training \n     period for those pursuing a credential. The purpose of such a \n     waiver would be to determine through evaluation whether a \n     program that allows for longer periods in certain activities \n     improves employment outcomes.\n       Note that this is not a comprehensive list, and HHS will \n     consider other projects consistent with the statute and the \n     guidance provided in this IM. HHS is especially interested in \n     testing approaches that build on existing evidence on \n     successful strategies for improving employment outcomes.\n       Waiver requests must include an evaluation plan. In order \n     to provide the strongest evidence about the effectiveness of \n     the demonstration, the preferred evaluation approach is a \n     random assignment methodology, unless the Secretary \n     determines that an alternative approach is more appropriate \n     in light of the demonstration proposed. All evaluation plans \n     and funds to support them must reflect an adequate level of \n     effort and sound methods to produce credible findings. ACF \n     anticipates actively engaging with states to ensure that \n     evaluation plans are appropriate in light of the nature of \n     the demonstration and that the evaluation findings can \n     reasonably be expected to provide information that will \n     enhance understanding of whether the initiative was \n     successful in furthering HHS priorities. ACF staff members \n     are available to work collaboratively with states to develop \n     further or refine the evaluation plan.\n       Waiver requests must include a set of performance measures \n     that states will track to monitor ongoing performance and \n     outcomes throughout the length of the demonstration project, \n     along with the evaluation. Waiver applications must specify \n     interim targets for each performance measure, including a \n     framework for how often the measures will be reported, or a \n     strategy for establishing baseline performance on a set of \n     performance measures and a framework for how interim goals \n     will be set after the baseline measures are established. \n     Performance measures must be designed to track improvement \n     across the entire set of families targeted as well as \n     appropriate subgroups. In developing the final terms and \n     conditions for an approved waiver, ACF will work with the \n     state to further refine the appropriate performance measures \n     and interim targets as needed. All approved waivers will \n     include a provision that requires timely reporting to HHS on \n     the agreed upon performance measures and progress toward \n     meeting established interim targets. States that fail to meet \n     interim targets will be required to develop improvement \n     plans. Repeated failure to meet performance benchmarks may \n     lead to the termination of the waiver demonstration pilot.\n       The request must specify the proposed length of time for \n     the demonstration project. The final terms and conditions \n     will specify the approved length of the project. Absent \n     special circumstances, the length of an approved project will \n     not exceed five years.\n       A state will need to develop and submit a budget that \n     includes the costs of program evaluation. TANF and state MOE \n     funds can be used for the costs of evaluation, including \n     third party contributions counting toward meeting a state's \n     MOE requirement.\n       HHS recognizes the importance of public input into the \n     process of developing and implementing a waiver demonstration \n     project. Therefore, the state must provide the public with a \n     meaningful opportunity to provide input into the decision-\n     making process prior to the time a proposal is approved by \n     HHS. Further guidance concerning this requirement will be \n     forthcoming.\n       Waivers are subject to HHS and Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) approval and terms and conditions may include \n     additional requirements, such as site visits, before \n     implementation.\n       Terms and conditions will require periodic reporting on how \n     the implementation and operation of the demonstration is \n     progressing, including reporting on the performance measures, \n     in addition to evaluation reports. To support learning and \n     knowledge development, ACF staff may conduct on-site visits \n     to observe demonstration operations and meet with relevant \n     managers and staff.\n       Inquiries: Inquiries and applications for projects \n     involving waiver requests should be directed to the \n     appropriate Regional TANF Program Manager.\n                                                  Earl S. Johnson,\n     Director, Office of Family Assistance.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 12, 2012.\n       Dear State Human Service Official: Today, the \n     Administration for Children and Families' Office of Family \n     Assistance issued an Information Memorandum that informs \n     states that the Department of Health and Human Services will \n     use its statutory authority to consider waiver requests that \n     strengthen the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \n     program. This Information Memorandum reflects the \n     Department's commitment to provide states, tribes, and \n     territories with more flexibility to innovate in the TANF \n     program with the goal of helping more families find jobs and \n     move toward self-sufficiency.\n       On February 28, 2011, President Obama issued a Presidential \n     Memorandum that directed federal agencies ``to work closely \n     with state, local, and tribal governments to identify \n     administrative, regulatory, and legislative barriers in \n     Federally funded programs that currently prevent states, \n     localities, and tribes, from efficiently using tax dollars to \n     achieve the best results for their constituents.''\n       The Administration for Children and Families took this \n     charge seriously and held a series of consultation meetings \n     with states, tribes, and territories on a variety of topics \n     including TANF. During those consultations, many \n     jurisdictions expressed a strong interest in greater \n     flexibility in TANF and indicated that greater flexibility \n     could be used by states to improve program effectiveness. We \n     also heard concerns that some TANF rules stifle innovation \n     and focus attention on paperwork rather than helping parents \n     find jobs. States offered a range of suggestions for ways in \n     which expanded flexibility could lead to more effective \n     employment outcomes for families. Two states--Utah and \n     Nevada--submitted written comments that specifically \n     identified waivers as one mechanism for testing new \n     approaches to promoting employment and self-sufficiency, and \n     a number of others states--including California, Connecticut, \n     and Minnesota--have asked about the potential for waivers.\n       As described in more detail in the Information Memorandum, \n     the Social Security Act provides the Secretary of the \n     Department of\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\n     Health and Human Services with the authority to grant states \n     waivers of certain TANF provisions for the purpose of testing \n     new approaches to meeting the goals of the TANF statute. The \n     Secretary is interested in using her authority to allow \n     states to test alternative and innovative strategies, \n     policies, and procedures that are designed to improve \n     employment outcomes for needy families. The statute does not \n     permit tribes to receive waivers under Section 1115, however \n     we are committed to using the underlying flexibility in \n     federal law to help tribes innovate in their programs.\n       TANF Waiver demonstration projects under Section 1115 must \n     be accompanied by a high quality evaluation plan, which is \n     critical to ensuring that the pilots result in rigorous \n     evidence about what works and what doesn't in order to inform \n     future decisions made by policymakers at the federal, state, \n     tribal, territorial, and local levels. In addition, states \n     that apply for a waiver must identify interim performance \n     targets that will be used to hold states accountable for \n     improving outcomes for families. We will work with states \n     interested in developing waiver demonstration projects to \n     design these performance measures and targets.\n       The Information Memorandum outlines the types of waivers \n     that will and will not be considered. The Secretary is only \n     interested in approving waivers if the state can explain in a \n     compelling fashion why the proposed approach may be a more \n     efficient or effective means to promote employment entry, \n     retention, advancement, or access to jobs that offer \n     opportunities for earnings and advancement that will allow \n     participants to avoid dependence on government benefits.\n       States have shown their ability to innovate in ways that \n     help parents find jobs. In 2009 and 2010, 42 states used the \n     TANF Emergency Fund authorized under the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act to create 260,000 subsidized jobs for \n     jobless parents and disadvantaged youth. Over a short period \n     of time, states exhibited enormous creativity as they \n     developed new subsidized employment initiatives that \n     responded to an urgent need for jobs in communities across \n     the country.\n       It is critical that we work together to develop effective \n     employment strategies that prepare workers for the jobs of \n     the 21st century. We stand ready to work with states \n     interested in developing innovative demonstration projects \n     that test new approaches to helping parents succeed in the \n     labor market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George Sheldon,\n     Acting Assistant Secretary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S761-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S761-S762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.47, the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act. This legislation provides \nmuch needed funding and support for law enforcement in our fight \nagainst domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and \nstalking.\n  This bill has enjoyed wide bipartisan support over the years. Crimes \nagainst women and children will not be tolerated. Tuesday, the Senate \nonce again approved VAWA with a 78-22 overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. I \nwas proud to cosponsor the Violence Against Women Act and I urge my \ncolleagues in the House to stand with America's women and children and \nquickly pass this critical legislation.\n  We have an obligation to do our part and protect women and children \non the streets and in their homes. And this legislation provides the \nresources needed to further this very important effort. Reauthorizing \nthis funding is particularly important for my home State of Louisiana, \nwhich unfortunately ranks among the top five States in incidences of \ndomestic violence homicides in the Nation.\n  Last year, Louisiana received $4.9 million in Violence Against Women \nAct grants. These dollars helped fund critical programs through \norganizations like Wellspring Alliance for Family, which provides \ndomestic violence and sexual assault services in Monroe, LA, and the \nCrescent House program in New Orleans. And these funds don't just \nsupplement established programs. In fact, the vast majority wouldn't be \npossible in the first place without VAWA grants because many service \nproviders count on more than 90 percent of their funding from the \nFederal Government.\n  Last year, Louisiana's 18 shelters provided more than 90,000 shelter \nnights, answered more than 38,000 crisis calls and despite serving \n17,000 clients, the shelters had to turn away almost 2,000 people for \nlack of resources. In one national survey, 60 percent of the shelters \nin Louisiana reported that they lacked funding and 25 percent reported \nthat they lacked shelter beds or housing for victims of domestic \nviolence and their children.\n  These statistics are troubling. And I think they are an important \npart of why VAWA is so critical to women and children in communities \nacross Louisiana and throughout our country. But numbers don't tell the \nwhole story. You have to talk to the people on the ground, to the \npeople who have dedicated their lives and careers to helping women and \nchildren in need, to truly appreciate the impact of this legislation.\n  For example, Beth Meeks, executive director of the Louisiana \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence, visited a program in New Orleans. \nWhile visiting that program, Beth spoke with a young mother with her \nbaby, only to discover that the baby was 6 days old. The young mother \nhad been at the program for a few weeks and had been terribly abused \nwhen she was nearly 9 months pregnant. She and her baby survived but \nher child was born in shelter care. What would have been the outcome if \na shelter had not been available?\n  The program that Beth visited, like every domestic violence program \nin Louisiana, was heavily supported by Violence Against Women Act \ndollars. Additionally, law enforcement officers, advocates, and \nprosecutors are all supported by funds available under the act. \nLouisiana's current budget challenges have serious implications for \nthese vital services. In December 2012, Louisiana cut $1 million from \nthe budget for these programs, jeopardizing their very existence.\n  Louisiana is not alone. Programs all over the Nation have experienced \nreductions in grants and losses in donations during the recent economic \ndownturn. That is why we must reauthorize the Violence Against Women \nAct. We have made significant progress in the last 20 years. We must \ncontinue to provide support to State and local government and the \nnonprofit entities that provide critical services.\n  I congratulate the people who are committed to providing important \nservices to those who need them most. We owe a great deal of gratitude \nto leaders like Beth Meeks of the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence, leaders like Mary Claire Landry of the Family Justice Center \nin New Orleans, and like Valerie Bowman of the Family Justice Center in \nMonroe, and leaders in the law enforcement community like Tommy Clark, \nchair of the Louisiana Chiefs of Police Association Domestic Violence \nCommittee.\n  I am proud that the Senate has taken action on this important piece \nof legislation and I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives \nto do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S765-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S765-S766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BAHRAIN TWO YEARS LATER\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 2 years ago today thousands of Bahrainis \ntook to the streets to call for political reform and an end to ongoing \nhuman rights abuses in their country. The government responded to these \npeaceful demonstrations not by addressing grievances or offering to \nwork with the aggrieved, but by unleashing its state security forces \nupon them. The security forces fired on the protesters with tear gas \nand live ammunition; although many protesters were rounded up, \narrested, and tortured, their spirit would not be broken.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the government of Bahrain continues to \nstall, to stonewall, and to stymie any progress on addressing the root \ncauses of the protesters' grievances. I shared the initial hopes of \nmany Bahrainis, who viewed the establishment of the Bahrain Independent \nCommission of Inquiry, BICI, as a positive step on behalf of the \ngovernment. I was encouraged when the final BICI report detailed the \ngovernment's systemic use of intimidation, violence, abuse, and \ndetention that documenting these abuses would lead to real reform. As \noutlined in the BICI report, over the weeks and months of its initial \ncrackdown, more than 30 protesters were killed, nearly 1,800 were \ntortured, and 4,500 were fired from their jobs. Religious sites were \ndestroyed and doctors who treated injured protesters were arrested, \ntortured, and imprisoned.\n  The Bahraini government has spent considerable time and resources to \nconvince the world that progress has been made, but I am sorry to say \nthat the facts do not bear this out. Banning peaceful protests is not \nprogress. Using tear gas as a weapon is not progress. Shooting \nteenagers is not progress. There is, quite frankly, little to be \noptimistic about if one examines the regime's track record over the \nlast 2 years. According to the Project on Middle East Democracy, POMED, \nthe government of Bahrain has only fully implemented three of 26 \nrecommendations in the BICI report. Even worse, POMED found no \nmeaningful progress whatsoever toward six of the BICI recommendations. \nThe Bahrain Center for Human Rights similarly finds that the government \nof Bahrain has taken only superficial steps ``while continuing to \ncommit the same human rights violations.''\n  Although the Bahraini government offered to engage in a national \ndialogue, my staff and I have read reports that the government may only \nbe planning to moderate a discussion between political parties, rather \nthan act as a full and productive participant in the dialogue. I \nsincerely hope that is not the case, and I call on the government of \nBahrain to live up to its rhetoric, engage in genuine and sustained \ndialogue, and work to see that real progress is made. As a first step \nto restoring some of the trust it has lost, the Bahraini government \nshould immediately implement all 26 BICI report recommendations and \nimmediately release all political prisoners in Bahrain.\n  After 2 years, surely the government of Bahrain is tired of fighting \nits own\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\npeople--people who wish nothing more than to have a greater voice in \ntheir political process. The government may be surprised that this \nfight has lasted 2 years, but I am not. My staff and I have met with \nsome of them and know them to be passionate, devoted to their cause, \nand willing to face continued persecution for what they believe.\n  Sometimes folks ask me why I care so much about such a small island \ncountry or why America should concern itself with Bahrain's internal \npolitics. I explain to them that Bahrain may be small, but that it is a \nkey ally in a troubled and volatile region. I also explain that the \nregime's current strategy of violence and repression is bound for \nfailure, and that Bahrain must reform to remain stable. If America has \nlearned anything in the last few decades it is that continuing to \nsupport governments that use violence, torture and repression to stifle \ndissent is short sighted. Washington must instead use what influence it \nhas to push such countries toward more representative forms of \ngovernment, not just because it is the right thing to do for the \ncitizens of those countries, but because it is the right thing to do \nfor this country. That is why this issue remains so important to me and \nwhy I hope that next year, on this date, I can come to the Senate floor \nand talk about the many new reforms in place instead of the Bahraini \ngovernment's continued repression of its people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S766-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MADISON COUNTY, IDAHO\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Mike Crapo joins me \ntoday in recognizing Madison County's 100-year anniversary.\n  Established on February 18, 1913, by the Idaho legislature and named \nafter our Nation's fourth President, James Madison, Madison County has \ndistinguished itself in its contributions to the success of our State.\n  Five people with connections to Madison County went on to become \nGovernors in the States of Idaho, Michigan, Kansas, and Massachusetts. \nTwo people from the county served in Congress, representing Idaho and \nUtah. And one man went on to serve as Idaho's Lieutenant Governor, my \ngood friend, Mark Ricks, who served with me during my time as Governor.\n  The people of this county distinguished themselves for helping their \nneighbors and strangers when the Teton Dam collapsed on June 5, 1976. \nThe ensuing flood spread throughout the valley, uprooting farms and \nhomes. Due to the resiliency of the residents and people helping one \nanother, they quickly overcame the disaster and carried on with their \nlives.\n  Madison County has a rich agricultural history, with the first \nirrigation system in the State built in this county. It is home to 21 \ndifferent century farms; places that have been continuously farmed by \nthe same family for 100 or more years. The rich, fertile soil and \nabundant water has made the county the eighth largest potato growing \narea in the Nation, along with an abundance of grain, livestock, and \nother commodities.\n  In the county seat of Rexburg, you will find Idaho's second largest \nuniversity, Brigham Young University-Idaho, formerly known as Ricks \nCollege. Citizens of the county, and throughout the region, for that \nmatter, are very proud of this university and the tremendous growth it \nhas experienced. They are also proud of the 95 percent graduation rate \nin their local high schools and at the university.\n  Rexburg and BYU-Idaho is also home to the Idaho International Dance \nFestival. For 27 years, the festival has brought hundreds of dancers \nand musicians from around the world to share their native music, songs, \ndance, and dress. Madison County residents strongly support the \nfestival and are proud of the rich history of this event.\n  Madison County also has an abundance of natural features, including \nthe Caribou-Targhee National Forest, the Cartier Slough and Deer Park \nwildlife management areas, and the twin Menan Buttes.\n  Senator Crapo and I are proud to recognize this landmark anniversary. \nWe congratulate Madison County residents for this centennial and we \nwish them all and their communities many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S766-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY KNOWLES\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, for 40 years, there has been no \ngreater advocate for Southwest Missouri seniors than Dorothy Knowles. \nAs executive director of the Southwest Missouri Office on Aging, \nDorothy's leadership and motivation have inspired a talented and \nspirited staff to help seniors understand issues and offer a variety of \nresources. When Medicare part D arrived, it was Dorothy who voluntarily \nbegan the effort to educate seniors on the options and advantages in \nthe new program. Thanks to her actions, the Southwest Missouri Office \non Aging became and continues to be the premiere source of information \non that program and others for seniors.\n  When Dorothy Knowles began work as a secretary and bookkeeper at the \nSouthwest Missouri Office on Aging, it was brand new. A single mother \nin need of a job, Dorothy saw the new agency as an opportunity. She \nrose through the ranks and learned the agency's needs and programs as \ndirector of social services and as associate director. Her boss during \nthose years was her mentor, Winston Bledsoe. Winston started with a \n$25,000 grant to open the first 9 senior centers in the region, \ncreating a daily meeting place for 40,000 seniors. When Winston retired \nin 1999, his deputy Dorothy took charge, armed with 25 years of \nexperience in providing senior services, advocacy, and a keen \nunderstanding of how to stretch a dollar.\n  Dorothy has never missed an opportunity to expand services and \noutreach and provide seniors with opportunities to improve the quality \nof life for older Americans. During 2012, there were 38 senior centers \nserving more than 370,000 meals to seniors and 700,000 home-delivered \nmeals in 17 counties. Today there are services to support caregivers, \nrespite relief, transportation, housekeeping, legal outreach, and even \nservices to help seniors file income taxes.\n  In 2005, Medicare added prescription drug coverage, creating an on-\nline ordering process and regulations seniors had never experienced. \nDorothy immediately saw the need to educate seniors so they could take \nadvantage of this service to acquire vital medicines. Self taught and \nwithout additional funding, she led the staff at the Southwest Missouri \nOffice on Aging to become the best resource for Medicare part D \ninformation anywhere. Working with my congressional office, Dorothy led \nher new experts on Part D into seminars and signup clinics in every \ncounty of Southwest Missouri. Every year since then, they have remained \nthe premiere source of part D expertise.\n  I have worked with Dorothy Knowles and know the commitment, \ndedication, and joy she takes in serving our senior population. I doubt \nher retirement will be the end of her enthusiastic advocacy for \nSouthwest Missouri seniors. She will still weigh in on elder abuse laws \nand senior wellness funding and will still instill that unrelenting \nzeal she has to champion senior causes in her 150 member staff and \ncolleagues. I wish her, and the agency she helped craft into a bastion \nof senior advocacy, the best in the decades ahead. Southwest Missouri \nis a better place for seniors to live thanks to Dorothy Knowles and her \nfour decades of service at the Southwest Missouri Office on \nAging.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S766-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S766-S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BILL EADINGTON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of a \nworld renowned gaming authority and professor at the University of \nNevada, Reno, UNR, Bill Eadington, whose passing on February 11, 2013, \nhas brought great sadness to the Silver State. After 18 months, Mr. \nEadington lost a courageous battle with cancer. My thoughts and prayers \nare with his family and friends during this difficult time.\n  Bill Eadington joined the faculty at UNR as an economist in 1969. He \nis the author of several books on the social and economic impacts of \ngambling and was a world-renowned authority on gaming issues. Mr. \nEadington founded the Institute for the Study of Gambling and \nCommercial Gaming at UNR and served as its director since 1989. Outside \nof the classroom, he has served as a resource for governments and \nprivate sector organizations worldwide on\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\ngaming laws, casino operations, regulation, and public policy.\n  In 2011, Bill Eadington was given the honor of being inducted into \nthe American Gaming Association Hall of Fame and was honored with a \nSpecial Achievement Award for Gaming Education. Mr. Eadington was a \nboard member on the National Council on Problem Gambling for 30 years, \nand in 2012 the board presented him with the Goldman Lifetime Award for \nAdvocacy.\n  Gaming is a uniquely important industry in Nevada, and Mr. \nEadington's academic contributions and expertise in this field have \nbeen invaluable to the State of Nevada and to UNR. Coupled with the \ntourism industry, it is our economic backbone, supporting hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. I have been proud to support policies to keep \nNevada's gaming industry and economy growing and prosperous and thank \nMr. Eadington for all his work on an issue vitally important to our \nState. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life of \nthis honorable Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S767-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING FABIAN CHAVEZ, JR.\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, on Sunday, January 20, \nmy State lost a great leader and a great friend. It is my privilege to \npay tribute today to Fabian Chavez, Jr. He was blessed with a long \nlife, 88 years old when he passed away. More important though was the \nimpact of his years, the impact of his remarkable life. Fabian Chavez, \nJr., made a difference in the lives of so many people in New Mexico.\n  Fabian was a formidable, and very colorful, figure in the history of \nNew Mexico politics. His story was one of triumph and of defeat, and of \nan unwavering determination to serve. He will be long remembered as an \nadvocate for justice, for the disadvantaged, and for ethical \ngovernment. He was also instrumental in passing legislation to \nestablish the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, which has \ndone so much for improving health care in our State.\n  Fabian Chavez, Jr., was born on August 31, 1924. His father was a \ncarpenter, and moved the family from Wagon Mound to Santa Fe, where \nFabian was born and would live most of his 88 years. Early on, the New \nMexico Capitol would dominate his life. And he would dominate it in \nreturn.\n  His father worked as the building superintendent at the old capitol \nbuilding. As a young boy, trying to earn pocket money during the Great \nDepression, Fabian could be found there shining shoes. He later told \nhis biographer that while other kids were playing marbles, he was \nwatching legislators at work, following their every move. He observed, \n``I had it all memorized years before I was even elected to my first \nterm in the house.''\n  Fabian was an independent spirit. Even as a youngster, he charted his \nown course, sometimes perhaps to his parents' dismay. The story is told \nof his hitchhiking to California at age 12. He joined the Army at age \n16, determined to see battle during World War II. He fought at Normandy \nand the Battle of the Bulge.\n  At the age of 25, Fabian met Coral Jeanne, the love of his life. \nFabian and Coral Jeanne were married in 1954. Of his beloved wife, \nFabian once said, ``I started dancing with Coral Jeanne in 1949, and \nwe've been dancing ever since.'' She would be his unfailing support \nthrough the victories and defeats to come, until she died in his arms \nover a half century later.\n  Most of us, in public life or out, are shaped by our wins and our \nlosses. This was certainly true in Fabian's long career. He first ran \nfor elective office in 1948, at the age of 24, for a seat in the New \nMexico House. He came in second in the primary. He was undeterred, as \nhe would show time and again. He was elected 2 years later. He ran \nunsuccessfully for the New Mexico Senate in 1952, but was elected in \n1956. And within a few years, at age 37, he became the youngest Senate \nmajority leader in the history of our State. In 1968, Fabian was the \nDemocratic candidate for Governor, and lost by less than 3,000 votes. \nHe later served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce under President \nJimmy Carter.\n  The title of David Roybal's biography of Fabian Chavez, Jr., ``Taking \non Giants,'' is telling. Fabian was a reformer, and a tenacious one. He \nfought to change the old justice of the peace system in New Mexico, \nfought to establish a Judicial Standards Commission, fought powerful \ninsurance and liquor industries, fought early on, and courageously, for \ncivil rights. Whatever the opposition, he stayed the course. Elections \nwould come and go. Some he would win. Some he would lose. But he stayed \ntrue to his commitment to the people of New Mexico.\n  My dad once said that there are two stories of our lives. One is the \nperson you wanted to be. The other is the person you are. While none of \nus gets that exactly right, I would suspect that Fabian came pretty \nclose. He held true to his principles. He fought for what he believed \nwas right. He leaves behind a legacy of accomplishment and integrity, a \nlegacy that his family, and our State, can take great pride in.\n  Jill and I extend our sincere condolences to Christine and to all the \nChavez family. Fabian Chavez, Jr., was a true son of New Mexico, and he \ndid all of us proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S767-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S767-S768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH AND ROY PERATROVICH\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there are few names in Alaska's \nhistory that exemplify progress and timeless impact more than Elizabeth \nPeratrovich. She is remembered as one of the greatest civil rights \nactivists and female leaders Alaska has ever seen. Elizabeth and her \nhusband Roy are to the Native peoples of Alaska what Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and Rosa Parks are to African Americans. Everybody knows \nabout Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, but hardly anyone \noutside the State of Alaska knows about Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich. \nToday, I wish to again share the Peratrovich legacy with the Senate \nbecause February 16, 2013, the State of Alaska will observe Elizabeth \nPeratrovich Day for the 24th time. Activities to celebrate the legacy \nof Elizabeth and Roy Peratrovich are taking place in schools and \ncultural centers throughout Alaska this week. The Alaska State Museum \nin Juneau is already honoring this remarkable woman in an exhibit \nentitled ``Alaskan. Native. Woman. Activist,'' which will run until \nMarch 16, 2013.\n  In addition to the annual observance of Elizabeth Peratrovich Day, \nthe State of Alaska has acknowledged Elizabeth's contribution to \nhistory by designating one of the public galleries in the Alaska House \nof Representatives as the Elizabeth Peratrovich Gallery.\n  Elizabeth, a member of the Lukaaxadi clan, in the Raven moiety of the \nTlingit tribe, was born in Petersburg in 1911. After attending college \nshe married Roy Peratrovich, a Tlingit from Klawock, Alaska, and the \ncouple had three beautiful children. In 1941 the young family moved to \nJuneau, excited by the new opportunities the move would present. When \nthe family found the perfect house, they were not allowed to buy it \nbecause they were Native. They could not enter the stores or \nrestaurants they wanted. Outside some of these establishments, there \nwere signs that read ``No Natives Allowed.'' History has also recorded \na sign that read ``No Dogs or Indians allowed.''\n  On December 30, 1941, following the invasion of Pearl Harbor, \nElizabeth and Roy wrote to Alaska's Territorial Governor:\n\n       In the present emergency our Native boys are being called \n     upon to defend our beloved country. There are no distinctions \n     being made there. Yet when we patronized business \n     establishments we are told in most cases that Natives are not \n     allowed.\n       The proprietor of one business, an inn, does not seem to \n     realize that our Native boys are just as willing to lay down \n     their lives to protect the freedom he enjoys. Instead he \n     shows his appreciation by having a ``No Natives Allowed'' \n     sign on his door.\n\n  In that letter Elizabeth and Roy also noted:\n\n       We were shocked when the Jews were discriminated against in \n     Germany. Stories were told of public places having signs ``No \n     Jews Allowed.'' All freedom loving people were horrified at \n     what was being practiced in our own country.\n\n  In 1943, the Alaska Legislature, at the behest of Roy and Elizabeth, \nconsidered an antidiscrimination law. It was defeated, but Roy and \nElizabeth were not. Two years later, in 1945, the antidiscrimination \nmeasure was brought back before the Alaska Territorial Legislature. It \npassed the lower\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nhouse, but was met with stiff opposition in the Territorial Senate.\n  One by one, Senators took to the floor to debate the closely \ncontested legislation. One Senator argued that ``the races should be \nkept further apart.'' This Senator went on to rhetorically question, \n``Who are these people, barely out of savagery, who want to associate \nwith us whites with 5,000 years of recorded civilization behind us?''\n  Elizabeth Peratrovich was observing the debate from the gallery. As a \ncitizen, she asked to be heard and in accordance with the custom of the \nday, was recognized to express her views.\n  In a quiet, dignified and steady voice this ``fighter with velvet \ngloves'' responded, ``I would not have expected that I, who am barely \nout of savagery, would have to remind gentlemen with 5,000 years of \nrecorded history behind them of our Bill of Rights.''\n  She was then asked by a Senator if she thought the proposed bill \nwould eliminate discrimination. Elizabeth queried in rebuttal, ``Do \nyour laws against larceny and even murder prevent these crimes? No law \nwill eliminate crimes but at least you as legislators can assert to the \nworld that you recognize the evil of the present situation and speak \nyour intent to help us overcome discrimination.''\n  When she finished her speech the room burst into thunderous applause. \nThe territorial Senate passed the bill by a vote of 11 to 5. On \nFebruary 16, 1945, before Alaska gained statehood, and before Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and \nspoke of his dream for equality, Alaskans passed an antidiscrimination \nbill that provided for full and equal enjoyment of public \naccommodations for all Alaskans.\n  That night, Roy and Elizabeth celebrated. The two went dancing at the \nBaranof Hotel, one of Juneau's finest. They danced among people they \ndidn't know, in a place where, the day before, they were unwelcome.\n  There is an important lesson to be learned from the battles of \nElizabeth and Roy Peratrovich. Even in defeat, they knew that change \nwould come from their participation in our political system. They were \nnot discouraged by their defeat in 1943. They came back fighting \nstronger than ever and enjoyed the victory 2 years later.\n  Elizabeth would not live to see the United States adopt the same law \nshe brought to Alaska in 1945. She passed away in 1958, at the age of \n47, 6 years before civil rights legislation would pass nationally.\n  Roy Peratrovich saw that event. He passed away in 1989 at age 81. He \ndied 9 days before the first Elizabeth Peratrovich Day was observed in \nthe State of Alaska. But the Peratrovich legacy and family live on. \nThis past summer I had the opportunity to welcome Nathan Peratrovich, \ngreat-grandnephew of Roy and Elizabeth, to Washington DC. I was \nawestruck at the magnitude of his visit. Here was a young man who never \nknew the discrimination his ancestors knew. He was never told he could \nnot enter a store because of his race. He was never denied access to a \nschool because of who his parents were. As we looked down on the Senate \nfloor from the Senate gallery, I encouraged Nathan by stating that one \nday he could represent Alaska in the United States Senate. Nathan grew \nup with all the rights and liberties every young boy should have. All \nof this was possible because of his family. Seeing his face and knowing \nwhat a significant impact his family had on his current wellbeing \nstruck me with a sense of appreciation. It is with that appreciation I \nhonor Elizabeth and Roy Peratrovich today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S768-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S768-S771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I submit to the record these \nessays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Third \nAnnual ``What is the State of the Union?'' Essay contest conducted by \nmy office. These 13 finalists were selected from over 300 entries.\n\n         Riley Forbes, Mt. Abraham Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       The most important issue for the government to solve today \n     is human rights.\n       Everybody deserves equal opportunities in life. The State \n     and Federal Government should help to make sure that everyone \n     is free from torture, has the right to adequate food, \n     clothing and housing, and has the right to health care. The \n     most significant issue for the government to solve today is \n     human rights.\n       Human rights are the basic rights that everyone who is \n     human has. Human rights are important for everyone in the \n     world to have. An important right is the right to have basic \n     items, adequate clothing, food and housing. The United \n     Nations has a right that gives everyone the basic items that \n     they need, (clothing, food and housing). Whereas the United \n     States does not have a right giving everyone basic supplies \n     that is needed to live. ``A man in India without access to \n     clean water dies of a treatable disease'' (Pinheiro). \n     Everyone deserves adequate clothing, food, water and housing, \n     but the problem is that these things are limited. There are \n     homeless shelters and water, but there may not be enough for \n     everyone. The Government should try to help provide people \n     with the basic needs that are needed to survive.\n       The government should act to protect all people from \n     torture. The United Nations and the United States believe \n     that people should have the right to be safe from torture. A \n     guard watches as a man is assaulted by an inmate in a jail \n     Texas (Pinheiro). This man gets assaulted and the guard does \n     nothing. The guard is watching; he should help to protect the \n     people and not let them suffer even though they are in jail. \n     The Government should pay attention and try to help people \n     feel free and safe from torture.\n       In order for everyone to get a long life, people need to \n     have their basic needs. The United Nations and the United \n     States do not have any kind of right that says that everyone \n     should have healthcare or be able to have health care. \n     Obamacare will allow more people health insurance that they \n     can afford (Marston). People who couldn't afford health care \n     before now have a health care that is more affordable. The \n     Government is helping to provide people the access to an \n     affordable health insurance.\n       The Government should help to support the people and their \n     rights.\n       Bibliography: Pinhiero, P.S.

November 2012\n\n          Damon Fulcher, South Royalton High School (Finalist)\n\n       The state of the Union is the most difficult to decipher in \n     years. We, as a nation, are stuck in a time where the war in \n     Afghanistan is dwindling, and we're trying to climb out of an \n     abysmal fiscal pit. In a nation that has made its name for \n     moving forward, controversies over human rights like the \n     right to marry and the right to have an abortion are still as \n     prevalent as ever. However, all is not lost, and this great \n     nation will continue to forge on, despite these setbacks.\n       The land of the free still does not grant rights to every \n     group of people. Gay marriage is one of the most hotly \n     debated subjects in our country right now. Even though our \n     Constitution states that all men are created equal, we as a \n     nation do not always abide by this principle. Half of the \n     American population is brushing a group of people under the \n     rug, just because they have a different sexual orientation \n     than themselves. The most recent example of this is North \n     Carolina amending its state constitution to say that same-sex \n     couples do not have the right to marry. This act takes the \n     issue to a whole new level past legality. However, not all is \n     bad. Several more states have begun adding to the pool where \n     same-sex couples have the right to marry. The United States' \n     highest court is taking on a case concerning a California \n     proposition to ban gay marriage. This case will decide the \n     fate of the issue in the years to come. Unfortunately, the \n     most serious issue our country faces is not even marriage \n     equality.\n       The most pressing issue currently is the economy. The great \n     debate is whose taxes should be cut and whose taxes should be \n     raised. The nation is greatly divided along partisan lines in \n     this respect. These opinions are exemplified by our current \n     President Barack Obama and our Speaker of the House John \n     Boehner. One believes that taxes should be raised on the \n     wealthy and cut on the middle class and the other, vice \n     versa. This is the nation's problem. We simply need to get \n     over which party we are a part of and work toward a common \n     goal. There is guaranteed success if all of Congress works \n     together to move forward.\n       The current state of the Union is complex, containing many \n     positives and negatives. With the idea in mind that working \n     together is necessary for the betterment of this nation, the \n     President and Congress will move forward and fix the dilemmas \n     that this country faces.\n\n            Benjamin Gilbert, Milton High School (Finalist)\n\n       This country faces one of the most important stages of \n     change and development it has ever seen. The decisions we \n     make as a nation in the next few years will shape not only \n     the future of our own lives, but the lives of every citizen \n     of this world. We won't be able to do this unless we come \n     together. We are humans. It is in our nature to disagree. We \n     are a democracy. It is a democracy's nature to disagree. \n     Disagreement is a sign of a thriving democracy. It is also in \n     our nature to solve problems, to be civil, to be fair, and to \n     provide for a better tomorrow.\n       In the coming years, we need more doctors and researchers, \n     to finally find a cure for cancer. We need more books to \n     inspire. We\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\n     need more businesspeople to meet to the new age markets. We \n     need teachers, and lawyers. We need successful young people \n     to inherit this country. However, this will not be possible \n     with the rising costs of higher education. The cost of \n     sending a child to college is the highest it has ever been. \n     If we as a country decide not to act, we cannot hope to make \n     a better tomorrow for ourselves or for our children. In a \n     state of economic turmoil, cuts have to be made. The military \n     has been allowed to spend almost without limit. The funds \n     that will keep Americans safe and soldiers well equipped \n     should not be touched, but the endless spending must stop. \n     Anything that is not absolutely vital and necessary for the \n     safety, protection, and justice of the American people ought \n     to be reevaluated.\n       Since its foundation, America has been the birthplace for \n     equality. From George Washington fighting against the \n     oppression of a monarchy, to Martin Luther King working \n     towards a more civil existence, to Alice Paul screaming for \n     the right to vote. Each step has helped open the door to \n     equality. Each day we are tested, and each day we must answer \n     history's call to change. Gay men and women have been quieted \n     for centuries. But their time is here. No federal ban on love \n     will stop the dawn of equality that is breaking upon this \n     nation. This is not about Republicans or Democrats, \n     religions, or politics, but about American people who love \n     and cherish one another.\n       We have a broken system. Today, it is far too difficult to \n     receive mental healthcare. It is easier to get your hands on \n     an assault weapon than visit a doctor. We have seen in the \n     past decade that this inequality leads to a tragic and \n     horrific reality. Assault weapons are made for the military, \n     and should be reserved exclusively for that purpose. Most \n     importantly, those in need of mental healthcare should have \n     access to it. We must forget about the politics and money, \n     and focus on the lives of Americans who are in danger every \n     day.\n       I have high hopes for the future of this country. We are \n     all different. We are often very divided. However, we are \n     strongest when we stand together.\n\n              Liam Hayes, Vergennes Union High (Finalist)\n\n       Today our country is facing many problems that require the \n     attention of not only the leaders in Washington, but the \n     American people as well. As a teenager I believe the two most \n     important issues are unemployment and our education system. I \n     know that these issues are affecting our country, mainly in \n     its overall growth.\n       First, I feel that our unemployment rate is quite \n     unacceptable. However, in the past year it has been lowering \n     slowly by the month. Although it may seem like a substantial \n     amount, the area of the nation I live in continues to \n     struggle to find jobs for students graduating college and for \n     people retraining to new careers. I believe to continue this \n     progress over the coming years America needs to look at the \n     national picture of what jobs are there, what new jobs could \n     serve a need for products and industry and what skills these \n     new industries will require Americans to have.\n       Lastly, I think that when it comes to education in this \n     great nation, the statistics and rankings don't lie. In math, \n     science, and writing, the US is in the lower half when \n     compared to other nations. If you look at statistics, \n     compared to others, we are a more developed country. I am \n     sure there are many things that we can do as a country to \n     climb higher in the tables. I truly think that if there \n     wasn't a long summer break, and there were one or two week \n     breaks frequently throughout the course of the year to take \n     place of the large summer break. I think this would help \n     because the long summer break leaves ridiculous amounts of \n     time to forget everything you have learned in the school \n     year. I also think that Americans have requirements for a \n     second spoken language and to promote challenging classes \n     throughout our schooling experience. If education is truly \n     the key to our future, it needs to give us not only the \n     basics, but the skills to problem solve, create and be the \n     architects of America's new future.\n\n       Christie Kershaw, South Burlington High School (Finalist)\n\n       I believe our nation has shown much improvement over the \n     past year. Job growth rates have been increasing and \n     businesses have been getting back on their feet after an \n     economic low point. Even with these developments, there are \n     many more aspects that need to be addressed and improved. I \n     believe that as a country, the biggest issues we should be \n     focusing on are improving the state of our environment and \n     making college more affordable for students.\n       In my opinion, our government isn't taking the issue of \n     global climate change as seriously as it should be. We are no \n     longer able to turn our backs on this difficult issue because \n     we are already starting to see signs of its negative impacts \n     on us. With major droughts this summer in the Midwest and \n     powerful storms like Super storm Sandy, it's clear to see \n     that our climate is becoming more unpredictable and deadly, \n     and the root cause of this is from climate change. There \n     haven't been enough major moves put into effect by our \n     government to combat this issue and I believe that both \n     political parties should work closer together to come to an \n     agreement on how do this. There should be tighter regulations \n     on the amount of greenhouse gases factories can emit, higher \n     miles per gallon standards for new cars, and more money put \n     into the development of renewable energy sources.\n       In order to make advancements in the field of green energy \n     to slow down climate change, there must be scientists who are \n     able to do the work. But we may soon be seeing a decrease in \n     the number of these people because increasing costs for post-\n     secondary education make it difficult for those who want to \n     pursue a career in the sciences, or any other field, to do \n     so. In order to ensure that our country will have enough \n     highly educated citizens to help bring our nation closer to \n     solving our energy crisis, we need to make college more \n     affordable for everyone. Universities must lower their \n     tuition costs and have more scholarships and grants for a \n     wide range of students. If our government made loans easier \n     to get with lower interest rates, this would also help remedy \n     this problem. This particular issue is especially important \n     to me because, as I start my college career in less than a \n     year, I will be spending a lot of time worrying about how I \n     will be able to pay for my education. Many other students \n     feel the same way as me and some may have to postpone their \n     plans for higher education. A decrease in college-educated \n     citizens is not what our country needs right now.\n       These two issues of climate change and post-secondary \n     education affordability are to me the most important on the \n     list of many our country is facing. If both political parties \n     work together, they will be able to resolve these issues in \n     the near future.\n\n       Sonia Lowen, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       The United States of America is the most powerful nation in \n     the entire world but it's currently facing severe issues. The \n     financial crash of 2008 resulted in the most disastrous \n     economy since the 1930's Great Recession. Climate change is \n     creating extreme weather disasters and destroying nature. Not \n     to mention that there is more income inequality in present \n     day than ever before. These are only a select few because the \n     list of issues goes on. The good news is that solutions are \n     accessible but the bad news is that as long as corporate \n     lobbyists continue to corrupt legislators, they will never be \n     reached. The United States Congress needs to stop allowing \n     corporate corruption.\n       The American economy is beginning to show signs of recovery \n     but it still has a long way to go. Millions are out of a job \n     and the government has a $16 trillion debt hovering over \n     their heads. The end of this recession is not going to come \n     fast, but there are provisions that will begin to facilitate \n     it, such as raising taxes not only on the rich but on the \n     corporations as well. This will cause more of their money to \n     go towards helping the government rather than manipulating \n     it.\n       America is not the only place being affected by climate \n     change but that does not, in any way, constitute sitting back \n     and hoping someone else will fix it. The United States makes \n     up 2% of the world's population yet they use 25% of the \n     world's resources. The environment's safety is dependent on \n     Congress to create new laws that will further regulate \n     manufacturers to reduce harmful emissions. America's economy \n     and climate would prosper greatly if they invested time and \n     money into green energy. Unfortunately, automobile and other \n     corporate lobbyists refuse to let that happen because they \n     can make more money manufacturing oil-powered products.\n       Corporate lobbying has corrupted what the Constitution \n     deems as the most powerful branch of government. Much of the \n     legislation that is passed is beneficial to industries, \n     whereas much of the legislation that would be beneficial to \n     the general population is rejected. The corporations have \n     gained this unhealthy amount of power by guaranteeing members \n     of Congress a future job in the private sector in exchange \n     for legislation that will favor whichever industry and/or \n     corporation they represent. It is a gross injustice of \n     congressional power.\n       The United States of America is at a fork in the road: they \n     can either choose to take a step in the right direction and \n     work for the interests of the people, or they can take a leap \n     in the wrong direction and work in the interests of \n     corporations. The country's future prosperity will be a \n     result of that decision. It is crucial that the government \n     abolishes corporate lobbying and strives to serve the people \n     this nation was built for. This will not be easy, but it is \n     critical in the process of rebuilding America.\n\n      Alexandra McFarland, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       As we have seen throughout our country over the past few \n     years, climate change is greatly affecting weather patterns. \n     In 2011 Vermont was hit by Hurricane Irene which devastated \n     much of the state and resulted in destroyed roads and \n     homeless families. In 2012 Hurricane Sandy came ashore in New \n     Jersey and New York changing even more of our fellow \n     Americans' lives with massive destruction. Last year snowfall \n     here in the Green Mountains was nearly half of the annual \n     average. This year we have already seen two major snowstorms \n     and snow levels are already approaching and surpassing the \n     total snowfall of last year. We have to be concerned with \n     these extreme weather changes. Weird weather may now be \n     normal weather and scientists predict such patterns only \n     worsening in the future unless we take action.\n       Climate change is a great problem that the United States, \n     although on the surface has\n\n[[Page S770]]\n\n     attempted to tackle, needs to face head on. We need to once \n     again be world leaders. Our first step is to launch a \n     nationwide campaign, as there remains a huge portion of the \n     population who still believe climate change is simply a myth, \n     to help folks understand the complex science. Second, our \n     nation needs to support scientific research and publicize new \n     discoveries that could help to better our understanding of \n     the climate change crisis as well as create and implement new \n     green technologies to combat it. We need to establish a \n     national plan to reduce our energy use.\n       The 350 Initiative, started by environmental activist Bill \n     McKibben, is a great goal for our nation to strive toward. \n     Through awareness and education programs that will lead us to \n     conserve as well as the development of new and innovative \n     green technologies, we will reduce atmospheric carbon levels \n     to a more sustainable level of 350 parts per million by the \n     year 2050. Scientists have shown that 350 is a safe upper \n     limit for the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. The 350 \n     plan puts a solid number that we can strive to achieve on a \n     concept that so often feels much too great to tackle.\n       As one of the largest economies and one of the largest \n     consumers of fossil fuels, we should be a leader in changing \n     the way people around the globe think about our climate. It's \n     not simply here for us to use at will. It's here for us to \n     take care of and preserve for generations to come. These are \n     feats that our country has the resources, the will power and \n     the ingenuity to tackle.\n       We will not sit back and watch as extreme weather washes \n     over our great nation. As we have in the past, we will face \n     our worst problems and we will overcome them.\n\n       Rachel Moore, South Royalton Middle/High School (Finalist)\n\n       My family is like most families in Vermont: middle-class \n     citizens. Both my parents work to pay taxes and to put meals \n     on the table for my two brothers and me. Sometimes barely \n     getting by is all we can do. Life is not what it used to be. \n     When it is time for taxes to be paid for, it is always the \n     hardest, but we skim by. Taxes are killers to lower and \n     middle class citizens. I think the government should address \n     this problem in full detail. It is time to be fair and to put \n     the money back into the economy. In my opinion, when the \n     President gives his State of the Union speech, he should \n     promise to raise taxes for the rich and lower them for the \n     poor.\n       Lower-class citizens pay taxes like everyone else. The \n     difference between them and higher classes is their income. \n     Lower-class citizens do not receive a lot of income. \n     Therefore they have a harder time supporting their families. \n     There is a reason why so many people are losing their homes. \n     And most of those people are lower-class citizens. When the \n     President makes his State of the Union address, he, in my \n     opinion, should promise to raise taxes on the rich and lower \n     them for the poor. It is not fair that lower-class people \n     work twice as hard to keep their home, and to pay for food, \n     when higher-class citizens do not have to work as hard and \n     they do not need to worry. Lower-class citizens are not the \n     only ones who suffer from taxes.\n       Middle-class citizens also suffer from taxes. They have to \n     work harder to support their families than the higher-class. \n     Being a part of the middle-class group, I have experienced \n     the effects taxes have on our lives. Sometimes skimming by is \n     all my family is capable of doing. I have sat at the table \n     watching my mom write out and pay all her bills. I frequently \n     wish that I were rich, so I could support all my family \n     members and to get them to a better state. But wishing has \n     not done much for me, so I gave up. But now I have turned my \n     head to the President and his colleagues. Maybe my plea can \n     be heard by them, to lower taxes on the poor and raise it on \n     the rich. I want to live an American dream, not just dream \n     it. The more you raise taxes on the lower-class, which is the \n     majority of Americans, the less money will go back into the \n     economy. Tax the people who can spare an extra dollar, not \n     the people who depend on that dollar for a meal.\n       In my opinion, taxes should be raised on the rich and \n     lowered for the poor. Lower and middle classes have a hard \n     time supporting their families because of taxes. What about \n     that American dream people talk so much about? How will \n     future generations be able to live that dream if they cannot \n     even buy a house? It is time to do something, so, in my \n     opinion, when the President makes his State of the Union \n     address he should promise to lower taxes on the poor and \n     raise them to the rich.\n\n             Derryk O'Grady, Milton High School (Finalist)\n\n       My fellow Americans, we need to remember the tragic events \n     that occurred in Newtown, Connecticut, change in gun control \n     laws must happen. Unfortunate events like this can separate \n     weak countries and divide them, but we are different. A \n     tragic incident like this makes us more aware and stronger. \n     As we move forward, we will use this as a learning experience \n     to make this country safer by decreasing the ability to own a \n     gun.\n       In addition to gun control, the following are other major \n     topics of concern. First, we are in major national debt. \n     Second, unemployment rates are reaching an unbearable high. \n     Third we need to use more green energy and save more of the \n     world's oil. Lastly, the cost of the education is incredibly \n     high and still increasing. We must find solutions to these \n     issues and I believe I can do it.\n       We need to better our international relationships. We need \n     to stop involving ourselves in wars. Wars are a heavy burden, \n     and over the past twelve years, we spent $3.7 trillion and by \n     the end, possibly $4.4 trillion. This money does not need to \n     be spent. We need to take care of our own business, impose \n     higher taxes on the wealthy, and save money from wars.\n       More jobs need to be created for our country. The national \n     unemployment rate is around 7.7%, and in 2010, we reached \n     9.8%. A steady decline has to continue to happen. The more \n     people in this country working, the more revenue we can \n     bring. This will help chip away at the debt because the more \n     people working making money, the more money they can spend. \n     This series of working, making money, and putting it back \n     into the economy is what we need to create a surplus.\n       America's oil dependency is on a slight decrease since \n     president Obama took office. We have limited the use of other \n     countries oil by depending more on ourselves and this saves \n     money. We need to find more ways of using renewable energy \n     such as wind power, solar power, and hydro power: fossil fuel \n     is not everlasting, while renewable energy is.\n       We tell high school students that they need to go to \n     college to reach success, but then we throw them in debt. The \n     prices for college are astronomically high and continue to \n     increase. The average price for an in-state student is \n     $22,000 a year. How many students can afford to spend \n     $88,000? The answer is easy: not many. We need to find a \n     standard price range for colleges to work with.\n       As we grow as a nation, I promise we will find answers. Our \n     nation can overcome any challenge. Nothing brings this \n     country down. We will keep fighting these battles until we \n     have reached our goals. Thank you, and may God bless you all.\n\n             Saleban Olow, Winooski High School (Finalist)\n\n       Dear President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Fellow \n     Americans, From the birth of America, to America today, the \n     driving force and the heart of America has always been the \n     American success story. The United States of America is a \n     country of opportunity and accomplishment. We believe in our \n     country and our government. We believe that we will \n     eventually succeed, overcoming any obstacles that we face. \n     Our government and the entrepreneurs creating jobs made our \n     country the best among the world, but new issues have \n     appeared from the unemployment rate to the cost of college \n     tuition to gun control. These are what we need to address.\n       Perhaps the biggest problem we face as a nation is the \n     current rate of unemployment. According to the ``Department \n     of Numbers,'' during the November of 2012, the unemployment \n     rate is down to 7.7 percent of people in the United States. \n     This means that over 12 million Americans are jobless, \n     including my mom. Many American families are losing their \n     jobs because companies obtain their jobs. Companies and \n     wealthy people are getting richer and those from the middle \n     class and poverty levels are falling toward and below the \n     poverty line. This is particularly true given the fact that \n     the dollar is not worth what it was in the past. As a result, \n     inflation is boosting up the price of all goods and services. \n     As unemployment has been rising, the cost of education is \n     increasing. Today, American colleges have imposed an \n     extraordinary increase in tuition. Additionally, there are \n     also issues such as gay rights, Social Security, illegal \n     immigration and the War on Terror.\n       In spite of these factors, many students in the United \n     States look for higher education after high school. They want \n     to go to college and have a good career. If the government's \n     influence results in increasing college costs, then students \n     like ``ME'' will not be able to afford college. The average \n     family cannot fully support their child's tuition costs. Our \n     parents' incomes are spent paying for college debt. While \n     many college graduates remain jobless, they still must face \n     debts of more than 90K dollars. For our newly hatching \n     generation, I believe that college tuition should be cheaper \n     for everyone no matter what economic level the family is.\n       Regarding another critical issue, each year thousands of \n     Americans lose their lives through gun related problems. Guns \n     are designed to kill people easily and many lives are lost \n     each year because the United States doesn't have strict gun \n     control laws. The deadly massacre shooting at a Connecticut \n     elementary school was heartbreaking. The outcome of this \n     tragedy resulted in the deaths of 20 children and 6 adults, a \n     painful scenario. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 4 \n     and 9 years were slaughtered. It is my strong opinion that \n     the government should pass a gun law that would reduce gun \n     problems. President Obama and fellow lawmakers, I feel you \n     need to be creative and figure out a better way to ensure \n     young kids' safety. By choosing you, the United States is \n     going in the right direction for a better future.\n       In conclusion, the challenges that we face with \n     unemployment, college tuition and gun control are ones that \n     we must currently address. We must make significant changes \n     in order to progress. The success of our nation must be made \n     by building upon our society. As in the past, we can and \n     always will work hard and make America and the world a better \n     place.\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\n       God bless the United States of America.\n\n          Robert Pennypacker, St. Johnsbury Academy (Finalist)\n\n       This year's Tax Rate for the richest are the lowest this \n     Country has ever seen!\n       Today's tax rate means that person making $379,150 pays the \n     same tax as a person making seven million dollars. Thirty \n     years ago this was different. In 1981 there were 16 tax \n     brackets. Today there are six. The highest tax bracket for \n     today's federal income tax is 35% for a person making \n     $379,150 or more. That means you're taxing a small business \n     owner the same rate as a giant corporation president like \n     General Electric's Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt who has a \n     salary of 3.3 million dollars as of 2011.\n       If and when the tax rate increases for the rich like many \n     Americans want, it will not hurt the economy like the GOP is \n     stating. Last September, the Congressional Research Service \n     published a report countering Republican claims that lowering \n     top tax rates would lead, or had led, to higher economic \n     growth. ``Changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal \n     rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear \n     correlated with economic growth,'' the report concluded. \n     Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell responded by \n     having the report suppressed, but its findings were \n     incontrovertible. This shows that, with the rise in taxes for \n     the upper class, it will not affect the economy like many \n     Republicans are stating.\n       Also, we are at war with the Taliban and yet we still have \n     lower taxes than ever before. How are we paying to support \n     this war? Never before has the United States had lower taxes \n     during a war. In 1943, during WWII, the tax rate for a person \n     making $2,593,984 (adjusted for inflation) was 88%. In that \n     same year a person making $155,000 (adjusted for inflation) \n     was 38%. During the Vietnam War, in 1966, the tax rate for a \n     person making $629,530 (adjusted for inflation) was 70%. \n     Also, in that same year, a person making $83,104 (adjusted \n     for inflation) was 36%. Today's tax rate, as of 2011, for a \n     person making $379,150 is 35%. A person making 1.1 million \n     dollars tax rate pay the same 35%.\n       Should a person making $379,150 pay the same rate as multi-\n     millionaires? No they shouldn't. Why do we have the lowest \n     taxes ever in the United States and yet be in a war? The \n     United States should have taxes similar to years before. The \n     middle class should pay the same rate. The rates for the \n     middle class have stayed within the same percentage for the \n     last 70 years. Meanwhile the upper class has gone from a 90 \n     percent tax rate in the 1940's and 50's to 70 percent from \n     1960's through 1981, and 50 percent in 1982 through 1986. Now \n     they have a 35 percent tax rate which is the same as a middle \n     class citizen. The United States should raise the taxes of \n     the rich.\n\n        Rebecca Potter, Brattleboro Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       Congress is dysfunctional because of priority \n     discrepancies. Some in our government seem to believe that \n     holds, filibusters, and less legal tactics of delay and \n     obstruction serve as necessary means to a greater GOP-\n     dominated end. Others argue that while disagreement is key in \n     a true democracy, so is compromise. Certain members of the \n     Senate, where unanimous consent remains relevant in the \n     scheduling and timing of legislation, stand by ``holding'' \n     the Senate's progress on a bill or committee action. Others \n     point out that this is 2012, where a hold in Senate exists as \n     a euphemism for indefinite or permanent vetoes, often done in \n     secret. In both houses, many forget that the true party \n     holding the majority in Congress is the white, heterosexual, \n     wealthy men.\n       While Congress' dysfunction directly correlates with the \n     partisan gridlock we've been witnessing over the past four \n     years, this has more to do with flaws in the system itself \n     rather than the puppets within it. Sure, people are selfish \n     and want the connections voting a certain way or hiring a \n     specific set of hands will bring--but what ingenious economic \n     system provides the impetus for such action? Capitalism, at \n     the root of it all, enables members of Congress and the \n     wealthy holding the strings above them to exist as money-\n     motivated figures of power. The privatization of education, \n     healthcare, and human services creates the legislative \n     standstill we've got in Congress, which dedicates an absurd \n     amount of time to arguing over non-issues in a partisan lock. \n     This allows legislation that matters often gets nixed in \n     committee or shoved through without necessary debate.\n       Capitalist society has created a dysfunctional Congress, \n     and until we fix the system we will keep getting the same \n     results. The bandage for this infectious situation is \n     compromise in the Senate and House of Representatives--\n     impending compromise, I predict, what with a certain cliff \n     looming over our heads. Antibiotics for a more permanent \n     change would mean a re-evaluation of everything we've grown \n     up being told was ``American'': federalized elections, \n     spending limits on campaigns, socialized care for humans and \n     our unalienable rights (health, education, safety), and \n     public ownership of the land of the free.\n\n         Austin Price, Mt. Anthony Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       My fellow Americans, Our country is evolving and changing \n     in ways it has never before. We can either adjust or get left \n     in the past. America was once the greatest power in the world \n     and I believe we can get back to that, but we must take hold \n     and lead with force. Although we are on the path back, we \n     still need to focus on our military, economy, and civil \n     rights.\n       Our military is the backbone of our success as a nation. \n     With over nine hundred military bases internationally, we \n     need our military to be strong as ever to protect our trading \n     partners as well as us. The necessary changes that must be \n     made are to increase our presence in the countries that are \n     filled with enemies of the state and looking to do harm to \n     the United States and its citizens. We must increase the \n     spending budget for the military so that we will maintain our \n     internationally renowned army. We as a country have the \n     responsibility to not only protect our rights, but to protect \n     the civil rights of others who don't have the ability \n     themselves.\n       Further, we are in one of the greatest recessions since the \n     Great Depression; we face unprecedented challenges as a \n     nation to get back on top. If any country can come out of a \n     depression and be even stronger than before, it is America, \n     the home of the brave. Were the spending in any sector to \n     increase, then there would be a huge influx of jobs that were \n     created by all that new money. A higher tax rate for the \n     wealthiest of Americans will help this nation get out of the \n     greatest debt it has ever been in. It is time for everyone to \n     pay their fair share. Although the taxes do need to be \n     increased, increasing the taxes on small business owners will \n     only hurt our economy because they will hire fewer workers.\n       There is also a great civil rights issue that must be \n     addressed in our country. This is the marriage of \n     homosexuals. I am proud to say that the state I reside in has \n     done what few other states are brave enough to do by creating \n     civil unions. There are a shocking forty-one states that ban \n     same-sex marriage compared to only nine that allow it. I am \n     asking for an immediate legalization of same-sex marriage in \n     all states, similar to that of the desegregation laws of the \n     sixties and seventies.\n       If we as a nation are to be prosperous, we must grow and \n     adapt to the world around us. In order to reach our goals \n     their will have to be sacrifices made by every American. We \n     must make changes to the economy, military, and civil rights \n     in order to reach our lofty goals and reap the benefits of \n     our hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S771-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 267.

A bill to reauthorize 21st century community learning \ncenters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor, S. 326 the Afterschool for America's Children Act, which I \nam introducing today with Senators Murkowski, Murray, Begich, and \nManchin.\n  Across the country, afterschool programs help keep children safe and \nhelp them learn through hands-on academic enrichment activities that \nare disappearing from the regular school day.\n  Numerous studies have shown that quality afterschool programs give \nstudents the academic, social, and professional skills they need to \nsucceed. Students who regularly attend have better grades and behavior \nin school, and lower incidences of drug use, violence, and unintended \npregnancy.\n  Over the past 10 years, the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, \nCCLC, program has helped support afterschool programs for millions of \nchildren from low-income backgrounds, including over 1.6 million \nchildren last year.\n  Unfortunately, the demand for affordable, quality afterschool \nexperiences far exceeds the number of programs available. The 2009 \nreport, America After 3PM, found that while afterschool programs are \nserving more kids than ever, the number of unsupervised children in the \nUnited States has increased. More than 18 million children have parents \nwho would like to enroll their child in an afterschool program but \ncan't find one available.\n  For over 10 years, federally funded afterschool programs have played \nan important role in the lives of so many children and families. The \nAfterschool for America's Children Act, AACA, would strengthen the 21st \nCCLC program, leaving in place what works and\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\nusing what we have learned about what makes afterschool successful to \nimprove the program.\n  The AACA would modernize the 21st CCLC program to improve states' \nability to effectively support quality afterschool programs, run more \neffective grant competitions and improve struggling programs. In \naddition, this legislation helps improve local programs by fostering \nbetter communication between local schools and programs, encouraging \nparental engagement in student learning, and improving the tracking of \nstudent progress.\n  Afterschool programs have such a diverse group of supporters--from \nlaw enforcement to the business community--because these vital programs \nhelp keep the children of working parents safe while enriching their \nlearning experience and preparing them for the real world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Murkowski and Murray in \nsupporting the Afterschool for America's Children Act to ensure that \n21st CCLC dollars are invested most efficiently in successful \nafterschool programs that keep children safe and help them learn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 340. A bill to provide for the settlement of certain claims under \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today for the fourth time to \nintroduce or reintroduce legislation to settle the outstanding land \nclaims of the Tlingit and Haida Native people, the first people of \nSoutheast Alaska. I first introduced this legislation to speed up the \nconveyance of lands to the Sealaska Native Regional Corporation in \n2008. Native residents of Southeast Alaska in 1971 were promised lands \nto settle their aboriginal land claims to all of Southeast Alaska. \nUnder the motto that nothing of worth comes easy, I hope that the \ncompromise bill I introduce today with my colleague from Alaska Senator \nBegich will finally settle those claims early in the 113th Congress, \ncapping nearly six years of congressional negotiation and review on \nthis issue.\n  The newly revised bill establishes where and how Sealaska may select \nthe remaining 70,075 acres of land the Bureau of Land Management now \nsays it is entitled to receive under the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act of 1971, ANCSA. In all, Sealaska, the regional \ncorporation representing some 20,000 Alaska Natives, more than a fifth \nof all Native residents in Alaska, will receive about 68,400 acres of \nland for timber development, about 1,099 acres for other economic \ndevelopment such as hydroelectric generation, marine hydrokinetic \nactivity and future tourism development near Yakutat, Kake and \nHydaburg, and 490 acres that Sealaska can apply for to gain an \nadditional 76 cemetery and historical places.\n  The bill provides a balance of old-growth and second-growth timber, \nallowing Sealaska's timber business to transition to second-growth \nharvesting. To address local concerns, the new bill does not contain \nsome 26,000 acres of selections on northern Prince of Wales Island. \nThis version of the bill also eliminates more lands near Kassa Inlet \nand Mabel Bay near Keete on Prince of Wales Island to meet wildlife \nconcerns, buffer key fisheries and anchorage areas for fishermen, and \nrevises selection areas to address the Forest Service's desire to \nretain more lands that will aid its young-growth timber transition \nstrategy in the Tongass National Forest.\n  Frankly, it has taken years of frustrating talks and negotiations to \nreach this point. This bill contains more than 175 changes since the \n2008 version, all designed to make the bill acceptable to all \nAmericans. While the odds are that it still won't make absolutely \neveryone happy, the bill does address all of the major concerns voiced \nwith the Sealaska bill during nearly a half dozen congressional \nhearings, 22 town hall meetings, and in hundreds of letters and media \ncomments. It gives Sealaska its ANCSA selections, while it provides \nunprecedented public access to the lands Sealaska will be receiving, \nand meets the valid concerns of small communities, fishermen and timber \nworkers and protects their industries while fully protecting the \nenvironment.\n  It is a compromise. Clearly there are provisions in the bill that I \nwish were different, but on balance, it is a fair solution to a most \ndifficult matter that has been dragging on for more than four decades. \nIt is certainly a balanced solution that allows Sealaska to finally \ntake title to the last 70,000 acres it was promised by the land claims \nsettlement--lands largely to be used for economic development in a \nregion where unemployment often hits 25 percent--while at the same time \nprotecting more than twice as many acres for environmental and \nfisheries protection in Southeast Alaska, an area roughly the size of \nSouth Carolina. The bill does the latter by creating 152,000 acres of \nnew conservation habitat areas in the region in eight tracts.\n  The revised bill also requires Sealaska, by a conservation easement, \nto protect three major salmon spawning systems on lands it is gaining \nby imposing a 100-foot no-cut buffer, specifically, along the main stem \nof Trout Creek on Koscuisko Island, along Old Tom Creek at Polk Inlet \nand along Karheen and Tuxekan Creeks on Tuxekan Island. The State \nForest Practices Act and buffer rules will govern the management of all \nother streams on state lands inside the new Sealaska selections.\n  The bill continues and strengthens all public access provisions \ncontained in ANCSA. The bill contains a provision that guarantees \npublic access to Sealaska's economic land selections for recreation, \nhunting and fishing both sport and subsistence, allowing closures only \nto protect public safety, to safeguard cultural properties, to promote \neducational efforts or to protect against environmental damage, while \nallowing the public to legally challenge any such closures. It also \nprotects the rights of existing guides and tour operators to continue \noperations automatically on Sealaska lands for portions of two permit \nterms, or up to 20 years.\n  The revised bill also reduces the size of selection areas on \nKoscuisko and Tuxekan Islands to meet local community concerns, to \nprotect, subsurface, karst formations, to protect old-growth habitat \nareas for sensitive species, and to protect anchorages for fishermen. \nThe revised bill rearranges selection areas at 12 Mile Arm and Polk \nInlet to protect Forest Service planning, facilities and research \nfacilities, and increases the size of selection areas at Calder and the \nCleveland Peninsula to offset the acreage reductions.\n  Sealaska, through this bill, will give up its existing selection \nrights to 327,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest, allowing that \ntimber to return to full Forest Service planning control, and the bill \nwill result in Sealaska selecting about 25,000 fewer acres of old-\ngrowth timber, traditionally the most sought after lands in the forest \nand about 50,000 fewer acres of inventoried road less lands than might \nhave happened should Sealaska have stayed inside their original \nselection boundaries, lands that were designated for selection by the \ncorporation in 1976. The problem with those lands, the reason why this \nbill is so important for the public good, is that if Sealaska had to \nselect from those lands it would have had to select timber lands in the \nSituk River Valley, the home to the nation's foremost steelhead stream. \nIt would have had to select lands in the Craig municipal watershed, key \nfisheries habitat near Hoonah and Hydaburg and some 64,000 acres of \nOld-Growth Habitat Reserves, four times more such land than \nthe corporation is taking by this bill. Those selections would have \nbeen bad for the commercial and sport fishing industries, for tourism, \nand for the environment. Equally important from Sealaska's viewpoint, \n44 percent of the lands it had to select from by the 1976 selection \nareas were located under water bodies, making the selection rights \nworthless.\n\n  Sealaska may use part of its entitlement to select 76 cemetery sites \nand historical places, but to address concerns from some stakeholders, \nthe bill reduces the number and acreage of cemetery sites and \nhistorical places that Sealaska can file to receive. Acreage available \nto Sealaska was reduced more than six fold, from 3,600 acres in the \noriginal 2008 bill to a maximum of 490 acres. The total number of sites \nwas reduced from 206 in the original bill and all parks and wilderness \nlands were placed off limits.\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\n  This bill also confirms that all cemetery sites and historical places \nwill have to pass the existing historical review process before they \ncan be conveyed. The bill, again, prohibits the selection of cemetery \nsites and historical places inside parks and conservation system units. \nSealaska will be required to consult with local tribes before applying \nfor conveyance of any sites, and the bill prohibits the transfer of \nsuch sites to third parties and protects them from loss of Native \nownership in the event of any future financial claims against \nSealaska--the lands reverting to the Federal Government in the event of \nfinancial issues. The bill also requires that Sealaska provide a 25-\nfoot easement to allow anyone to sport fish along any salmon stream \nthat crosses such new sites.\n  The bill allows Sealaska to receive nine small parcels of land that \nSealaska may use to help spur cultural tourism, ecotourism, or, in two \ncases, renewable energy development near the communities of Yakutat, \nKake, and Hydaburg. The number of sites, totaling 1,099 acres, is \nvastly reduced, considering more than 50 sites totaling 5,000 acres had \nbeen considered in earlier versions of the legislation. The small \nparcels all are within or near the so-called 10 selection boxes \nestablished by a 1976 amendment to ANCSA. Five sites are in the Yakutat \narea, where Sealaska currently owns no land on behalf of its tribal \nmember shareholders. The sites in the Yakutat area are at Crab Island, \nNorth Dolgoi Island, Cannon Beach, Chicago Harbor and Redfield Lake. \nTwo sites are in the Kake area: Turnabout Island and East Payne Island. \nThere is a hydro site at Lake Josephine on Prince of Wales I and and a \nfinal site for marine hydrokinetic development, ocean current energy, \non the northern tip of Dall Island at Turn Point-Tlevak Narrows' \nrevised bill removes all sites that drew concern from commercial \nfishermen, small tour operators, environmental groups or local \ncommunities in the Alaska Panhandle.\n  The compromise bill conveys three non-exclusive access easements to \nSealaska to use as traditional Native trade and migration routes in \nSoutheast. The bill, as revised, renames the routes to honor Alaska's \nTlingit and Haida Indians and the history of the region and provides \ngenerally for public access. The Yakutat to Dry Bay trail will be \nrenamed ``Neix naax aan flax'' meaning, The Inside Passage; the Bay of \nPillars to Port Camden trail will be renamed the ``Yakwdeiyl'' trail, \nmeaning the Canoe Road; and the Portage Bay to Duncan Canal trail will \nbe renamed ``Lingit Deiyl,'' meaning the People's Road.\n  The bill requires Sealaska to share use of all forest roads with the \nForest Service and others, meaning that the government retains the \nright to use the roads to access other timber sales, as do the public. \nThe bill maintains all of the access provisions granted by ANCSA and \nincludes provisions to make access rights workable for all.\n  It has taken years of really listening to the requests about this \nbill and working through them one by one to find solutions, with the \npast nearly two years involved in frequent negotiations among the \nForest Service, Democratic and Republican congressional staff, \nSealaska, environmental groups and other interest groups such as \ncommercial fishermen and timber operators. This is truly a compromise \npiece of legislation. But it finally gets Sealaska its lands, protects \nfisheries and wildlife, and helps maintain a timber industry in \nSoutheast Alaska.\n  This compromise, the direct result of years of negotiation, has a \nhost of good points. It will prevent ``high-grading'' of timber' the \npractice where companies cut only the best timber lands, leaving lesser \nquality lands behind. Sealaska's conveyances in the nine commercial \ntracts called for in this bill: Calder, Election Creek, Cleveland \nPeninsula, 12-Mile Arm, Tuexkan Island, Polk and MacKenzie Inlets, \nKoscuisko Island, Keete, and Kuiu Island include only about 20,700 \nacres of large old-growth trees just 3.8 percent of the forest's \n537,451 acres of such trees. Already 437,000 acres of large old-growth \ntrees, 81 percent, are protected in conservation areas within the 19.6-\nmillion-acre national forest.\n  The bill likely will save the government money. In additional to \nmaking Sealaska give up some $2 million of escrowed funds, the bill \nmeans Sealaska, by getting about 25,000 acres of less valuable second-\ngrowth, based on current timber prices, could be foregoing more than \n$10 million of timber value, compared to if it had received all old-\ngrowth trees--old-growth providing the most valuable habitat for \nspecies in the forest like Sitka black-tailed deer, the Queen Charlotte \ngoshawk and wolves.\n  For Alaskans, the bill makes sure that more than 99 percent of the \nlands Sealaska will be receiving are open for public access. That is \nthe opposite of what could happen if this bill does not pass, as then \nSealaska would be free to prevent the public from trespassing across \ntheir new lands, like all other private land owners can post their \nproperties.\n  The changes between this version and previous versions of the measure \nare far too many to list here. But briefly this bill reduces the number \nand acreage of small parcels for economic diversification, once called \n``Future'' sites. It reduces the number of new Native cemetery and \nhistorical places that Sealaska could select, allowing only such sites \noutside national parks or wilderness to be selected. The bill increases \npublic access provisions, prevents Sealaska from gaining potential \nfederal grants for management of the cemetery sites, removes a host of \nquestionable land selections on environmental grounds and revises \ntimber lands to protect subsistence hunting areas and resource \ngathering spots.\n  As I say, I introduce this bill in a bipartisan manner with my Alaska \ncolleague, Senator Mark Begich again as a co-sponsor. It is a \nreasonable bill and I hope it finally can pass both bodies of Congress, \nit passing the House of Representatives in a somewhat different form in \n2012 and become law. Southeast Alaska's Natives, which while the \nlargest group of Natives in Alaska in 1971, received the third smallest \nland entitlement in the claims act 42 years ago. That was mostly \nbecause much of the rest of the forest at the time was already \ndedicated to long-term timber sale contracts. Now that those contracts \nhave been voided, it is only just and equitable that Alaska's first \ninhabitants get a chance to select a little more of the land first \nsettled by their ancestors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 342.

A bill to provide for increased Federal oversight of \nprescription opioid treatment and assistance to States in reducing \nopioid abuse, diversion, and deaths; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that is desperately needed in West Virginia and across the \ncountry--the Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of \n2013. It is an important bill aimed at addressing the rapid increase in \ndeaths and overdoses from methadone and other opioid prescription drugs \nin the United States. These deaths have hit my home State of West \nVirginia particularly hard, but I know that every State is struggling \nwith this serious problem.\n  In the 111th Congress, Senator Corker and I, along with our \ncolleague, the late Senator Kennedy, introduced the Methadone Treatment \nand Protection Act of 2009--a similar piece of legislation that stemmed \nfrom a disturbing rise in deaths due to methadone, a synthetic opioid \nprescription drug that had been increasingly used for pain management. \nBefore 1990, it was used primarily to treat opioid addiction. Because \nof its high efficacy and low cost, methadone is frequently used for \npain management. However, if not used correctly, methadone can be a \npowerful and deadly drug because it works differently than other \npainkillers. Methadone stays in a person's body for a longer period of \ntime than the pain relief lasts so a person who does not know better \nmight take far too much of the drug, possibly leading to respiratory \ndistress, cardiac arrhythmia and even death.\n  Methadone prescriptions for pain management grew from about 531,000 \nin 1998 to about 4.1 million in 2006--nearly eightfold. During that \ntime, poisoning deaths involving methadone increased nearly sevenfold \nfrom almost 790 in 1999 to 5,420 in 2006. Deaths from other opioids \nhave also skyrocketed in the last decade. These deaths may actually be \nunderreported, because there is no comprehensive reporting system for \nopioid-related deaths in the United States.\n  Overdoses from methadone are part of a larger disturbing trend of \noverdoses and deaths from prescription painkillers, or opioid drugs--a \ntrend driven by a knowledge gap about how to treat serious pain in a \nsafe and effective manner, by misperceptions about the safety of \nprescription drugs, and by the diversion of prescription drugs for \nillicit uses. In 2009, there were nearly 4.6 million drug-related \nemergency department, ED, visits of which nearly one half, 45.1 \npercent, or 2.1 million were attributed to prescription drug misuse or \nabuse, according to data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, DAWN. \nEmergency department visits involving misuse or abuse of \npharmaceuticals nearly doubled between 2004 and 2009, to more than 1.2 \nmillion visits.\n  This bill takes multiple steps to address these problems. First, with \nrespect to the knowledge gap about safe pain management, the bill \nincludes a training requirement for health care professionals to be \nlicensed to prescribe these powerful drugs. Currently, the Controlled \nSubstances Act requires that every person who dispenses or who proposes \nto dispense controlled narcotics, including methadone, whether for pain \nmanagement or opioid treatment, obtain a registration from the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, DEA. But, there is no requirement as a \ncondition of receiving the registration that these practitioners \nreceive any education on the use of these controlled narcotics, \nincluding methadone. Physicians struggle every day with determining who \nhas a real need for pain treatment, and who is addicted or at risk. \nThey struggle with our failure to provide adequate treatment facilities \nfor those who are addicted. This bill will help physicians get the \ninformation they need to prescribe safely and better recognize the \nsigns of addiction in their patients.\n  Second, this bill addresses the knowledge gap among consumers--with a \ncompetitive grant program to States to distribute culturally sensitive \neducational materials about proper use of methadone and other opioids, \nand how to prevent opioid abuse, such as through safe disposal of \nprescription drugs. Preference will be given to states with a high \nincidence of overdoses and deaths.\n  Third, this bill creates a Controlled Substances Clinical Standards \nCommission to establish patient education guidelines, appropriate and \nsafe dosing standards for all forms of methadone and other opioids, \nbenchmark guidelines for the reduction of methadone abuse, appropriate \nconversion factors for transitioning patients from one opioid to \nanother, and guidelines for the initiation of methadone and other \nopioids for pain management. A standards commission will provide much-\nneeded evidence-based information to improve guidance for the safe and \neffective use of these powerful and dangerous controlled substances.\n  Fourth, this bill provides crucial support to state prescription drug \nmonitoring programs. As of 2008, 38 states had enacted legislation \nrequiring prescription drug monitoring programs and many states were \nable to fund these initiatives in part from grants available through \nthe Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. A second \nprogram created in 2005 through the National All Schedules Prescription \nElectronic Reporting Act, NASPER, would provide even more assistance, \nand requires interoperability among states to reduce doctor shopping \nacross state lines and diversion. Unfortunately, NASPER has only \nrecently been funded with $2 million in the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus \nlegislation and $2 million in fiscal year 2010.\n  Here is just one example of why NASPER funding matters: recently, the \ngovernor of Florida announced a\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\nbudget that would not fund a planned prescription monitoring program in \nhis State, due to State budget difficulties. This directly affects \nStates in Appalachia because of the rampant drug trafficking between \nthe two regions. In fact, the roads from West Virginia to Florida are \nwell-travelled by drug traffickers and people seeking pain medication. \nIt is crucial to finally give NASPER the funding it needs, and this \nlegislation would do so, with $25 million a year to establish \ninteroperable prescription drug monitoring programs within each state.\n  Fifth, this bill requires that quality standards be developed across \nthe range of providers engaged in the prevention and treatment of \nprescription drug abuse. It is essential as we move ahead that quality \nalways be front and center in our efforts. With lives at risk, this is, \nif anything, only more important in the areas of addiction prevention \nand treatment. Every effort to address this problem must be as \neffective as possible, and the development of quality standards \nrequired by this bill will make sure that each provider, regardless of \nhis or her background or approach, can provide high caliber services to \ntheir patients.\n  Finally, this bill would help solve the data gap when it comes to \nopioid-related deaths. Right now there is no comprehensive national \ndatabase of drug-related deaths in the United States, nor is there a \nstandard form for medical examiners to fill out with regard to opioid-\nrelated deaths. Since there is no comprehensive database of methadone-\nrelated deaths, the number of deaths may actually be underreported. To \ntruly reduce the number of methadone-related deaths, quality data must \nbe collected and made available. This bill would create a National \nOpioid Death Registry to track all opioid-related deaths and related \ninformation, and establish a standard form for medical examiners to \nfill out which would include information for the National Opioid Death \nRegistry.\n  Today we have an opportunity to change the harrowing statistics and \nstem the rising tide of deaths from methadone and other opioids by \nsupporting the Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of \n2013. This legislation provides a multifaceted approach to preventing \ntragic overdoses and deaths from methadone and other opioids. This is \nexactly what we need to improve the coordination of efforts and \nresources at the local, state, and federal levels.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this timely and important piece of \nlegislation. In doing so, we will be on our way to saving lives and \nreducing the needless deaths that otherwise will continue to cause so \nmuch suffering for too many individuals, families, and communities in \nthis country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Murphy):\n  S. 349. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a \nsegment of the Beaver, Chipuxet, Queen, Wood, and Pawcatuck Rivers in \nthe States of Connecticut and Rhode Island for study for potential \naddition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Blumenthal, Whitehouse, and Murphy legislation to \nauthorize the National Park Service to evaluate portions of the Beaver, \nChipuxet, Queen, Wood, and Pawcatuck Rivers located in Rhode Island and \nConnecticut for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System. Our legislation seeks to highlight the need for greater \nresources to protect and restore the health of these rivers by studying \ntheir recreational, natural, and historical qualities and determining \nif they are suitable for designation as Wild and Scenic Rivers.\n  The Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed is a national treasure that holds \nrecreational and scenic value. In the 1980s, the National Park \nService's Rivers and Trails Conservation Assistance Program conducted a \nplanning and conservation study which found, in part, that the waters \nof the Wood and Pawcatuck Rivers corridor ``are the cleanest and purest \nand its recreational opportunities are unparalleled by any other river \nsystem in the state.''\n  The rivers also provide opportunities for recreation and tourism that \ncontribute to the economy of the local communities, while offering ways \nto explore our American heritage throughout the watershed. The \nexperiences one can enjoy range from visiting Native American fishing \ngrounds to seeing Colonial and early industrial mill ruins. The rivers \nare also a prime location for outdoor activities like trout fishing, \ncanoeing, bird watching, and hiking.\n  I have long been a supporter of protecting and restoring Southern New \nEngland's riverways and estuaries, including the Narragansett Bay. The \nstudy proposed in our legislation is an important part of the process \nin determining future opportunities for protection and recreational \nenjoyment of the rivers in the Wood-Pawcatuck watershed. It would also \nhelp Rhode Island and Connecticut continue their stewardship of these \nrivers, and greatly enhance existing state and local efforts to \npreserve and manage this ecosystem.\n  Indeed, partnerships are essential for the successful restoration and \nmanagement of our natural resources, and it is anticipated that this \nstudy would be conducted in close cooperation with the communities, \nstate agencies, local governments, and private organizations that are \nstakeholders in the process. The partnership-based approach also allows \nfor development of a proposed river management plan, which could \naddress issues ranging from fish passage to the restoration of wetlands \nto assist with flood mitigation, as well as balance the preservation of \nthe natural resources with the recreational opportunities that \ncontribute to the local economies.\n  I commend Representatives Langevin, Cicilline, and Courtney for \nintroducing similar legislation in the other body. I look forward to \nworking with them and all of my colleagues to pass this bill to \ninitiate the process that will evaluate the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed \nfor inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 352. A bill to provide for the designation of the Devil's \nStaircase Wilderness Area in the State of Oregon, to designate segments \nof Wasson and Franklin Creeks in the State of Oregon as wild rivers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to re-introduce three bills \nthat will better protect unique and important areas in the beautiful \nstate of Oregon. Two of these passed out of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee the last two Congresses. I am pleased to \nagain be joined on these bills with my colleague from Oregon, Senator \nMerklEy. I look forward to working with Senator Merkley, other \ncolleagues and other supporters of the bills to keep up the fight for \nthese special places in Oregon.\n  The first bill I am introducing--the Oregon Caves Revitalization Act \nof 2013--will enhance the existing Oregon Caves National Monument to \nprotect this majestic site for future generations. The bill expands the \nboundary of the National Park Service land to create the Oregon Caves \nNational Monument and Preserve.\n  A Presidential Proclamation in 1909 established 480 acres of natural \nwonder as the Oregon Caves National Monument in the botanically-rich \nSiskiyou Mountains. At the time, the focus was on the unique subsurface \nresources, and the small, rectangular boundary was thought to be \nadequate to protect the cave. However, scientific research has since \nprovided much greater insight into the cave's ecology and its \nhydrological processes, for which 480 acres is inadequate. The National \nPark Service formally proposed boundary modification numerous times--in \n1939, 1949, and 2000.\n  My bill expands protections in and around the Oregon Caves National \nMonument. The entirety of the Cave Creek Watershed would be included in \nthe park site, transferring management of 4,070 acres of United States \nForest Service land to the National Park Service. Hunters will still \nhave recreational access to this land since it will be designated a \nPreserve.\n  And the expansion of the Monument's boundary would be incomplete\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\nwithout protecting the water that enters the cave so as to preserve the \ncave's resources. My legislation would designate at least 9.6 miles of \nrivers and tributaries as Wild, Scenic, or Recreational, under the \nfederal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act--including the first Wild and Scenic \nsubterranean river, the ``River Styx.'' A perennial stream, the River \nStyx--an underground portion of Cave Creek--flows through part of the \ncave and is one of the dynamic natural forces at work in the National \nMonument. In addition, this bill would authorize the retirement of \nexisting grazing allotments. The current grazing permitee, Phil \nKrouse's family, has had the Big Grayback Grazing Allotment, 19,703 \nacres, since 1937. Mr. Krouse has publicly stated that he would look \nfavorably upon retirement with private compensation for his allotment, \nwhich my legislation will allow to proceed.\n  The Oregon Caves National Monument offers important contributions to \nSouthern Oregon and the nation. The cave ecosystem provides habitat for \none of the highest concentrations of biological diversity anywhere. And \nas the longest marble cave open to the public west of the Continental \nDivide, the Monument receives over 80,000 visitors annually. A larger \nMonument boundary will help showcase more fully the recreational \nopportunities on the above-ground lands within the proposed Monument \nboundary.\n  I want to express my thanks to the conservation and business \ncommunities of southern Oregon, who have worked diligently to protect \nthese lands and waters.\n  My second bill is the Devil's Staircase Wilderness Act of 2013. Under \nthis bill, approximately 30,500 acres of rugged, wild, pristine, and \nremote land surrounding the Wasson Creek area will be designated \nwilderness. In fact the area is so rugged that federal land managers \nhave withdrawn this landslide-prone forest from all timber activity \nnumerous times. At the heart of this coastal rainforest lies Devil's \nStaircase, a crystal clear waterfall that cascades over slab after slab \nof sandstone. The Devil's Staircase proposal typifies what Wilderness \nin Oregon is all about.\n  The proposed Devil's Staircase Wilderness is the finest old-growth \nforest remaining in Oregon's Coast Range, boasting huge Douglas-fir, \ncedar and hemlock. The ecological significance of this treasure is as \nclear as the water running through Devil's Staircase. The land is \nprotected as a Late-Successional Reserve by the Northwest Forest Plan, \nas critical habitat for the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet, \nand as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land \nManagement. Preserving these majestic forests as Wilderness for their \nwildlife and spectacular scenery not only matches the goals of the \nexisting land management plans but also permanently protects this \nnatural gem for future generations. The wilderness designation is \nneeded to protect these areas permanently.\n  My bill would not only protect the forests surrounding Wasson Creek \nbut would also designate approximately 4.5 miles of Franklin Creek and \napproximately 10.1 miles of Wasson Creek as Wild and Scenic Rivers. \nFranklin Creek, a critically important tributary to the Umpqua River, \nis one of the best examples of pristine salmon habitat left in Oregon. \nTogether with Wasson Creek, these two streams in the Devil's Staircase \narea deserve Wild and Scenic River designation by Congress.\n  The third bill I am introducing is the Oregon Treasures Act of 2013. \nThis bill seeks to provide protections for five significant areas in \nOregon. They are the Chetco River, the Molalla River, the Rogue River, \nand Horse Heaven and Cathedral Rock. Each of these parts of the bill \naim to protect natural treasures in Oregon, preserve them for use and \nenjoyment for generations to come, and build upon the economic \nopportunities they provide for their local communities.\n  The Oregon Treasures Act of 2013 includes a provision to protect two \nof Oregon's natural treasures, Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven. This \nwilderness designation has been introduced in the two most recent \nCongresses. The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven wilderness proposal \nwill do more than simply protect these areas. It will also help \nOregon's economy, because visitors from all over the world come to my \nstate to experience firsthand the unique scenic beauty of place like \nthe lands preserved by this bill.\n  This legislation will consolidate what is currently a splintered \nownership of land in this area and protect 17,340 acres of new \nWilderness along the Lower John Day River. The fractured land ownership \nin this area makes it difficult for visitors to fully appreciate these \nareas when they hike, fish or hunt there because of the scattered and \nmisunderstood lines of private and public ownership. This bill will \nsolve that problem and make these lands more inviting to visitors while \ngiving the landowners more contiguous property to call home.\n  The area in question is stunning. The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven \nWilderness proposals encompass dramatic basalt cliffs and rolling hills \nof juniper, sagebrush and native grasses. These new areas build on the \ndesert Spring Basin Wilderness that was established in 2009 as a result \nof legislation I introduced, and are located directly across the John \nDay River from Spring Basin.\n  With 500 miles of undammed waters, the John Day River is the second-\nlongest free-flowing river in the continental United States and is a \nplace that is cherished by Oregonians. The Lower John Day Wild and \nScenic River offers world-class opportunities for outdoor recreation as \nwell as crucial wildlife habitat for elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep and \nnative fish such as salmon and steelhead trout. Through land \nconsolidation between public and private landowners, this legislation \nwill allow for better management and easier public access for this \nimportant natural treasure. With the current fragmentation of public \nand private land ownership in the area, river campsites are limited. \nMany federal lands among them can't be reached by the hikers, campers \nand other outdoors recreationists who could most appreciate them. With \nthe equal-value land exchanges included in this bill, public lands \nwould be consolidated into two new Wilderness areas. This would enhance \npublic safety, improve land management, and increase public access and \nrecreational opportunities. I want to recognize that some have raised \nconcerns about the lack of roaded access to Cathedral Rock. I have \nengaged the private landowners on this issue to seek a solution. \nWhatever the outcome, I do know that the Cathedral Rock and Horse \nHeaven proposal will create an incredible, new heritage for public \nlands recreationists who are an important factor in keeping Oregon's \neconomy healthy and thriving.\n  Rafters of the John Day River can attest to the need for more \ncampsites and public access to the Cathedral Rock area. Backcountry \nhunters will be able to scan the hillsides for elk, deer and game-birds \nwithout having to worry about accidentally trespassing on someone's \nprivate land. Anglers will be able to access nearly 5 miles of the John \nDay River that today are only reachable from privately owned lands. \nLikewise, such a solution ensures that local landowners can manage \ntheir lands effectively without running across unwitting trespassers.\n  One good example of the value of these land swaps is Young Life's \nWashington Family Ranch. This Ranch is home to a Christian youth camp \nthat welcomes over 20,000 kids to the lower John Day area each year. \nThis bill sets out private and public land boundaries that can be \nclearly seen on the ground and these boundaries create a safer area for \ncampers on the Ranch; this serves the children who visit the area well \nand ensures the continued viability of the Ranch, which, in turn, \nprovides big economic dividends to the local community.\n  The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven Wilderness proposal is described \nas ``win-win-win'' by many stakeholders--nearly five miles of new river \naccess for the public and protected land for outdoor enthusiasts; \nbetter management for private landowners and public agencies; and \nimportant habitat protections for sensitive and endangered species. \nThis proposal is an example of the positive solutions that can result \nwhen varied, bipartisan interests in a community come together to craft \nsolutions that will work for everyone. I especially want to thank the \nOregon Natural Desert Association, Young Life, and Matt Smith for their \nrole in developing this collaborative solution\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nthat will benefit all Oregonians. The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven \nWilderness areas will help make sure that this rural area will enjoy \nthe benefits that permanently connecting these disparate pieces of \nnatural landscape will bring for generations to come.\n\n  Additionally the Oregon Treasures Act protects the Chetco River. For \nover a decade, I've advocated for protections for the Chetco and other \nthreatened waterways in Southwest Oregon. Part of the Oregon Treasures \nAct of 2013 would withdraw about three miles of the Chetco River from \nmineral entry, while upgrading the designations for some portions.\n  This river is under persistent threat from out-of-state suction \ndredge miners. In 2010, the group American Rivers listed the Chetco as \nthe seventh most endangered river in the country because of those \nthreats. Withdrawing these portions of the river from future mineral \nentry will prevent future harmful mining claims and make sure that \nthose claims that already exist are valid.\n  The Chetco is also hugely important for salmon habitat and local \nsport fishing. The passage of this legislation would mean protecting \nthat habitat, and promoting the continued success of the fishing \nindustry throughout the West Coast. I am pleased the Obama \nadministration has taken some steps to protect this area, but the \npassage of this legislation is needed to ensure long-term protection \nfor this important river.\n  Next, the Oregon Treasures Act of 2013 would add 60,000 acres of new \nwilderness to the existing Wild Rogue Wilderness. The Wild Rogue \nWilderness expansion would protect habitat for bald eagles, osprey, \nspotted owls, bear, elk, cougar, wild coho, wild Chinook, wild \nsteelhead, green sturgeon, and many others. The Wild Rogue Wilderness \nand the Rogue River that runs through it embody one of the nation's \npremier recreation destinations, famous for the free flowing waters \nwhich provide numerous rafting and fishing opportunities.\n  The headwaters of the Rogue River start in one of Oregon's other \ngreat gems--Crater Lake National Park--and the river ultimately empties \ninto the Pacific Ocean, near Gold Beach on Oregon's southwest coast. \nAlong that stretch, the Rogue River flows through one of the most \nspectacular canyons and diverse natural areas in the United States. The \nRogue River is a world class rafting river, offering everything from \none day trips to week long trips through deep forested canyons. On the \nland, the Rogue River trail is also one of Oregon's most renowned \nbackpacking routes.\n  The legislation would also protect an additional 143 miles of \ntributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold clean water. Of that \nnumber, 93 miles would be designated Wild and Scenic Rivers and an \nadditional 50 miles would be protected from mining. The areas receiving \nprotection include Galice Creek, Little Windy Creek, Jenny Creek, Long \nGulch and 36 other tributaries of the Rogue. The Rogue River is one of \nOregon's most iconic and beloved rivers. It is a river that teems with \nsalmon leaping up rapids to spawn, and finds rafters down those very \nsame rapids at other times of the year.\n  I previously introduced legislation to protect the Rogue River \ntributaries in the last three Congresses. Since it was first \nintroduced, I have worked with the timber industry and conservationists \nto find a compromise that protects one of America's treasures with \nadditional wilderness designations and more targeted protections for \nthe Rogue's tributaries. I am pleased that 95 local businesses--and \nover 120 organizations and business in total--support protecting the \nWild Rogue, and that support grows every day. Many of those businesses \ndirectly benefit from the Wild Rogue and the Rogue River. As I often \nsay, protecting these gems is not just good for the environment, but \nalso good for the economy. These protected landscapes are powerhouses \nof the recreation economy that draws visitors from around the world to \nthis region and the Rogue River is one of Oregon's most important sport \nand commercial fisheries. The Wild Rogue is the second largest salmon \nfishery in Oregon behind the Columbia. The Wild Rogue provides the \nquality of life and recreational opportunities that create an economic \nengine that attracts businesses and brings in tourists from around the \nworld. The Rogue River supports more than 400 local jobs in nearby \ncommunities like Grants Pass.\n  By protecting the Wild Rogue landscape and the tributaries that feed \nthe mighty Rogue River, Congress will ensure that future generations \ncan raft, fish, hike and enjoy the Wild Rogue as it is enjoyed today \nand that the recreational economy of this region remains strong.\n  Lastly, there is another provision in the bill to designate segments \nof Oregon's Molalla River as Wild and Scenic. An approximately 15.1-\nmile segment of the Molalla River and an approximately 6.2-mile segment \nof Table Rock Fork Molalla River would be designated as a recreational \nriver under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n  Including these river segments would protect a popular Oregon \ndestination that provides abundant recreational activities that help \nfuel the recreation economy that is so important to the communities \nalong the river. The scenic beauty of the Molalla River provides a \nbackdrop for hiking, mountain biking, camping, and horseback riding, \nwhile the waters of the river are a popular destination for fishing, \nkayaking, and whitewater rafting enthusiasts. This legislation would \nnot only preserve this area as a recreation destination, but would also \nprotect the river habitat of the Chinook salmon and Steelhead trout, \nalong with the wildlife habitat surrounding the river, home to the \nnorthern spotted owl, the pileated woodpecker, golden and bald eagles, \ndeer, elk, the pacific giant salamander, and many others. The Molalla \nRiver is also the source of clean drinking water for the towns of \nMolalla and Canby, Oregon. Protecting the approximately 21.3 miles of \nthe Molalla River will provide the residents of these Oregon towns with \nthe assurance that they will continue to receive clean drinking water.\n  I would like to reiterate my continued appreciation for the Molalla \nRiver Alliance--a coalition of more than 48 member-organizations that \nrecognize that this river is a jewel and have set out to protect it. \nThis Alliance made sure that irrigators, city councilors, the mayor, \nbusinesses and environmentalists all came together on this.\n  Oregon's wildlands play an increasingly important role in the \neconomic development of our state, especially in traditionally rural \nareas east of the Cascades. Visitors come from thousands of miles away \nto hike, fish, raft and hunt in Oregon's desert Wilderness. Beyond \ntourism, the rich quality of life and the diverse natural amenities \nthat we enjoy as Oregonians are key to attracting new businesses to \nOregon. And with all these bills, I express my gratitude for the many \ngroups and individuals who have worked diligently to protect these \nspecial places. I look forward to working with Senator Merkley, \nRepresentative DeFazio, Representative Schrader and other colleagues \nand the bill's other supporters to keep up the fight for these unique \nplaces in Oregon and get these pieces of legislation to the President's \ndesk for his signature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Klobuchar, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Heitkamp, and \n        Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 357. A bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Blue Alert plans \nthroughout the United States in order to disseminate information when a \nlaw enforcement officer is seriously injured or killed in the line of \nduty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nBlue Alert Act of 2013.\n  Every day, more than 900,000 Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. \nUnfortunately these officers can become targets for criminals and those \nseeking to evade our justice system, and we must make sure our officers \nhave all the tools they need to protect themselves and each other.\n  Each year thousands of law enforcement officers are assaulted while \nperforming their duties and dozens lose their lives. According to the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, 72 law enforcement officers were \nfeloniously killed in the line of duty in 2011. This\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\nis an unacceptable level of violence against our law enforcement \nofficers, and we must act now to better protect them.\n  This is why I am introducing the National Blue Alert Act of 2013 \ntoday, and thank Senators Graham, Leahy, Klobuchar, Boxer, Blumenthal, \nWhitehouse, Heitkamp, and Durbin for joining me as co-sponsors of this \nimportant legislation.\n  The Blue Alert system provides for rapid dissemination of information \nabout criminal suspects who have injured or killed law enforcement \nofficers. The Blue Alert system would only be used in the case of the \ndeath or serious injury of a law enforcement officer, where the suspect \nhas not been apprehended, and where there is sufficient descriptive \ninformation of the suspect and any vehicles involved. This information \ncan be used by local law enforcement, the public and the media to help \nfacilitate capture of such offenders and ultimately reduce the risk \nthey pose to our communities and law enforcement officers.\n  A National Blue Alert will encourage, enhance and integrate blue \nalert plans throughout the United States in order to effectively \ndisseminate information notifying law enforcement, media and the public \nthat a suspect is wanted in connection with an attack on a law \nenforcement officer.\n  Currently there is no national alert system that provides immediate \ninformation to other law enforcement agencies, the media or the public \nat large. Many states have created a state blue alert system in an \neffort to better inform their local communities. The State of Maryland, \nunder the leadership of Governor Martin O'Malley, created their Blue \nAlert system in 2008 after the murder of Maryland State Trooper Wesley \nBrown. Blue Alert programs have been created in 18 states so far \nincluding: Washington, California, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, \nOhio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South \nCarolina, Florida, Virginia, Maryland, Montana, and Delaware.\n  The National Blue Alert Act will provide police officers and other \nemergency units with the ability to react quickly to apprehend violent \noffenders and will complement the work being done by Attorney General \nHolder in his Law Enforcement Officer Safety Initiative.\n  The purpose of our National Blue Alert legislation is to keep our law \nenforcement officers and our communities safe. And based on the success \nof the AMBER Alert and the SILVER Alert, I believe this BLUE Alert will \nbe equally successful in helping to apprehend criminal suspects who \nhave seriously injured or killed our law enforcement officers.\n  I am also pleased to say this legislation has the endorsement of the \nFraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \nConcerns of Police Survivors, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association \nof the New York City Police Department. Passing this legislation can \nhelp us live up to our commitment to help better protect those who \nserve us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Paul, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. \n        Merkley):\n  S. 359. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to exclude \nindustrial hemp from the definition of marihuana, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Paul, \nMcConnell, and Merkley in introducing the Industrial Hemp Farming Act \nof 2013.\n  As some folks will recall, I introduced a similar bill as an \namendment to the Senate Farm Bill last year in an attempt to empower \nAmerican farmers and increase domestic economic activity. \nUnfortunately, this amendment didn't receive a vote. Doubly unfortunate \nis the fact that a senseless regulation that flunks the common-sense \ntest is still on our nation's books.\n  Members of Congress hear a lot about how dumb regulations are hurting \neconomic growth and job creation. The current ban on growing industrial \nhemp makes no sense at all, and what is worse, this regulation is \nhurting job creation in rural America and increasing our trade deficit.\n  If my colleagues take the time to learn about this outrageous \nrestriction on free enterprise, I am sure most senators would say that \nwhat I am talking about is the poster child for dumb regulation.\n  The only thing standing in the way of taking advantage of this \nprofitable crop is a lingering misunderstanding about its use. The bill \nmy colleagues and I have filed will end this ridiculous regulation.\n  Right now, the United States is importing over $10 million in hemp \nproducts to use in textiles, foods, paper products, and construction \nmaterials. We are importing a crop that U.S. farmers could be \nprofitably growing right here at home, if not for government rules \nprohibiting it.\n  Our neighbors to the north certainly see the potential for this \nproduct. In 2010, the Canadian government injected over $700,000 into \ntheir blossoming hemp industry to increase the size of their hemp crop \nand fortify the inroads they have made into U.S. markets. It was a good \nbet. U.S. imports have consistently grown over the past decade, \nincreasing by 300 percent in 10 years, and from 2009 to 2010 they grew \n35 percent. The number of acres in Canada devoted to growing hemp \nnearly doubled from 2011 to 2012. So it should come as no surprise that \nthe United States imports around 90 percent of its hemp from Canada.\n  Now, I know it is tough for some members of Congress to talk about \nhemp and not connect it to marijuana. I want to point out that even \nthough they come from the same species of plant, there are major \ndifferences between them.\n  You know, the Chihuahua and St. Bernard come from the same species, \ntoo, Canis lupus familiaris, but no one is going to confuse them. Also, \nthe domestic dog is a subspecies of the gray wolf, Canis lupus, and no \none is going to confuse those two either. So let's recognize the real \ndifferences between hemp and marijuana, and focus on the benefits from \nproducing domestically the hemp we already use.\n  Under our bill, the production of industrial hemp would still be \nregulated, but it would be done by States, not the Federal Government.\n  Pro-hemp legislation has been introduced in eight states, and several \nothers have already removed barriers to industrial hemp production. \nUnder our bill, industrial hemp is defined as having extremely low THC \nlevels: it has to be 0.3 percent or less. The lowest commercial grade \nmarijuana typically has 5% THC content. The bottom line is that no one \nis going to get high on industrial hemp. To guarantee that won't be the \ncase, our legislation allows the U.S. Attorney General to take action \nif a state law allows commercial hemp to exceed the maximum 0.3 percent \nTHC level.\n  Hemp has been a profitable commodity in many other countries. In \naddition to Canada, Australia also permits hemp production and the \ngrowth in that sector helped their agricultural base survive when the \ntobacco industry dried up. Over 30 countries in Europe, Asia, and North \nand South America currently permit farmers to grow hemp, and China is \nthe world's largest producer.\n  In fact, the U.S. is the only industrialized nation that prohibits \nfarmers from growing hemp. This seems silly considering that we are the \nworld's leading consumer of hemp products, with total sales of food, \nhealth and beauty products exceeding $52 million in 2012, with 16.5 \npercent growth over 2011.\n  My home State of Oregon is home to some major manufacturers of hemp \nproducts, including Living Harvest, one of the largest hemp foods \nproducers in the country. Business has been so brisk there that the \nPortland Business Journal recently rated them as one of the fastest-\ngrowing local companies.\n  There are similar success stories in many states. One company in \nNorth Carolina has begun incorporating hemp into building materials, \nreportedly making them both stronger and more environmentally friendly. \nAnother company in California produces hemp-based fiberboard.\n  No country is better than the U.S. at developing, perfecting, and \nexpanding markets for its products. As that market grows, it should be \ndomestically-produced hemp that supplies its growth.\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\n  I would like to share with colleagues an editorial by one of the \nleading newspapers in my state, the Bend Bulletin. Here's what they had \nto say about legalizing industrial hemp: ``producers of hemp products \nin the United States are forced to import it. That denies American \nfarmers the opportunity to compete in the market. It is like \nsurrendering the competitive edge to China and Canada, where it can be \ngrown legally.''\n  The Bend Bulletin's editorial went on to say: ``Legalizing industrial \nhemp does not have to be a slippery slope toward legalizing marijuana. \nIt can be a start toward removing regulatory burdens limiting Oregon \nfarmers from competing in the world market.''\n  The opportunities for American farmers and businesses are obvious \nhere. Let's boost revenues for farmers and reduce the costs for \nbusinesses around the country that use this product. Let's put more \npeople to work growing and processing an environmentally-friendly crop, \nwith a ready market in the United States. For all the reasons I just \ndescribed, I urge my colleagues to join Senators Paul, McConnell, and \nMerkley and me by cosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Industrial Hemp Farming Act \n     of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP FROM DEFINITION OF \n                   MARIHUANA.\n\n       Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     802) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (16)--\n       (A) by striking ``(16) The'' and inserting ``(16)(A) The''; \n     and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) The term `marihuana' does not include industrial \n     hemp.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(57) The term `industrial hemp' means the plant Cannabis \n     sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, \n     with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more \n     than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. INDUSTRIAL HEMP DETERMINATION BY STATES.\n\n       Section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     811) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Industrial Hemp Determination.--If a person grows or \n     processes Cannabis sativa L. for purposes of making \n     industrial hemp in accordance with State law, the Cannabis \n     sativa L. shall be deemed to meet the concentration \n     limitation under section 102(57), unless the Attorney General \n     determines that the State law is not reasonably calculated to \n     comply with section 102(57).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Begich, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Risch, and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 363. A bill to expand geothermal production, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Geothermal \nExpansion Production Act of 2013. This legislation is the same as a \nbill reported favorably by voice vote by the Senate Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources during the 112th Congress. This bill has bi-\npartisan support, with Senators Murkowski, Begich, Crapo, Risch, and \nMerkley, joining me as original cosponsors. The legislation will help \nto encourage the production of geothermal energy from public lands.\n  With limited exceptions, current law requires that all Federal lands \nto be leased for the development of geothermal resources be offered on \na competitive basis. BLM must hold a competitive lease sale every 2 \nyears. If bids are not received for the lands offered, BLM must offer \nthe lands on a noncompetitive basis for 2 years.\n  This legislation extends the authority for noncompetitive leasing in \ncases where a geothermal developer wants to gain access to Federal land \nimmediately adjacent to land on which that developer has proven that \nthere is a geothermal resource that will be developed. This will allow \na geothermal project to expand onto adjacent land, if necessary, to \nincrease the amount of geothermal energy it can develop. It will also \nadd to the royalties and rents that the project pays to the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  The reason for this legislation is to allow the rapid expansion of \nalready identified geothermal resources without the additional delays \nof competitive leasing and without opening up those adjacent properties \nto speculative bidders who have no interest in actually developing the \nresource, only in extracting as much money as they can from the \nexisting geothermal developer.\n  The bill is not a give away at taxpayer expense. The bill limits the \namount of adjacent Federal land that can be leased to 640 acres. This \nlease on Federal land must be acquired at fair-market value. The bill \nalso requires the lease holder to pay the higher annual rental rate \nassociated with competitive leases even though this new parcel is not \nbeing competitively leased. Again, the purpose of this higher rental \nrate is to ensure that taxpayers will get the revenue due to them from \nthe use of their public lands.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Production \n     Expansion Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NONCOMPETITIVE LEASING OF ADJOINING AREAS FOR \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES.\n\n       Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. \n     1003(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Adjoining land.--\n       ``(A) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       ``(i) Fair market value per acre.--The term `fair market \n     value per acre' means a dollar amount per acre that--\n\n       ``(I) except as provided in this clause, shall be equal to \n     the market value per acre (taking into account the \n     determination under subparagraph (B)(iii) regarding a valid \n     discovery on the adjoining land) as determined by the \n     Secretary under regulations issued under this paragraph;\n       ``(II) shall be determined by the Secretary with respect to \n     a lease under this paragraph, by not later than the end of \n     the 180-day period beginning on the date the Secretary \n     receives an application for the lease;

A bill to amend the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \nto require the Bureau of Land Management to provide a claimant of a \nsmall miner waiver from claim maintenance fees with a period of 60 days \nafter written receipt of 1 or more defects is provided to the claimant \nby registered mail to cure the 1 or more defects or pay the claim \nmaintenance fee, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nto clarify Federal mining law and remedy a problem that has arisen from \nthe extension process for ``small'' miner mineral claims.\n  Under revisions to the Federal Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. 28(f), \nholders of unpatented mineral claims must pay a claim maintenance fee \noriginally set at $100 per claim by a deadline, set by regulation, of \nSeptember 1st each year. Since 2004 that fee has risen. But Congress \nalso has provided a claim maintenance fee waiver for ``small'' miners, \nthose who hold 10 or fewer claims, that they do not have to submit the \nfee, but that they must file to renew their claims and submit an \naffidavit of annual labor, work conducted on the claim, each year, \ncertifying that they had performed more than $100 of work on the claim \nin the preceding year, 30 U.S.C. 28f(d)(1). The waiver provision \nfurther states: ``If a small miner waiver application is determined to \nbe defective for any reason, the claimant shall have a period of 60 \ndays after receipt of written notification of the defect or defects by \nthe Bureau of Land Management to: cure such defect or defects or pay \nthe $100 claim maintenance fee due for such a period.''\n  Since past revisions of the law, there have been a series of \nincidents where miners have argued that they submitted their \napplications and affidavits of annual labor in a timely manner, but due \nto clerical error by BLM staff, mailing delays or for unexplained \nreasons, the applications or documents were not recorded as having been \nreceived in a timely fashion. In that case BLM has terminated the \nclaims, deeming them null and void. While mining claim holders have \nargued that the law provides them time to cure claim defects, BLM has \nargued that the cure only applies when applications or fees have been \nreceived in a timely manner. Thus, there is no administrative remedy \nfor miners who believe that clerical errors by BLM or mail issues \nresulted in loss or the late recording of claim extension applications \nand paperwork.\n  There have been a number of cases where Congress has been asked to \noverride BLM determinations and reinstate mining claims simply because \nof the disputes over whether the claims had been filed in a timely \nmanner. Congress in 2003 reinstated such claims in a previous Alaska \ncase. Claims in two other incidents were reinstated following a U.S. \nDistrict Court case in the 10th Circuit first in 2009 in the case of \nMiller v. United States and secondly earlier this year in a second \nAlaska case. Legislation to correct the provision to prevent this \nproblem in the future actually cleared the Senate in 2007, but did not \nultimately become law.\n  In the past two Congresses I have introduced legislation intended to \nshort circuit continued litigation and pleas for claim reinstatement by \nclarifying the intent of Congress that miners do have to be informed \nthat their claims are in jeopardy of being voided and given 60 days \nnotice to cure defects, including giving them time to submit their \napplications and to submit affidavits of annual labor, should their \nsubmittals not be received and processed by BLM officials on time. If \nall defects are not cured within 60 days, the obvious intent of \nCongress in passing the original act, then claims still are subject to \nvoidance. But this administration has opposed the legislation arguing \nthat it would be too expensive to notify all small miners who fail to \nfile their small miner waiver documents on time and giving them time to \nsolve the defect prior to the loss of their claims. It has even been \nsuggested that giving small miners simple due process would just \nencourage miners to ignore the deadline for filing for their fee \nwaivers.\n  I find the cost complaint unpersuasive. Many Federal departments and \nagencies, the Federal Communication Commission, as one example, \nroutinely sends out notices on permit and license applications. The FCC \nsends out hundreds of thousands of such notices to Americans who have \nsmall radio licenses expiring yearly, warning them that they need to \nfile applications for license renewal. The Bureau of Land Management \ncertainly should be able to afford a few hundred 50-cent stamps to \nperform a similar service. Given the value of claims placed at risk and \nthe bother, inconvenience and fear of loss of claims, it is highly \nunlikely that miners would avoid filing their waiver paperwork on time \njust because a notification process was clearly in place before claims \ncould be terminated.\n  So today I reintroduce legislation to solve the notification issue \nand include language to remedy an injustice to one of my constituents \nwho has lost his rights to nine mineral claims on the Kenai Peninsula, \nnear Hope, Alaska. The transition language would reinstate claims for \nMr. John Trautner, who has lost title to claims that he had held from \n1982 to 2004. Mr. Trautner suffered this loss even though he had a \nconsistent record of having paid the annual labor assessment fee for \nthe previous 22 years. The local BLM office did have a time-date-\nstamped record that the maintenance fee waiver certification form had \nbeen filed weeks before the deadline but just not a record that the \naffidavit of annual labor had arrived when he dropped it office in the \nAnchorage office at the same time.\n  This legislation, supported in the past by the Alaska Miners \nAssociation, will clarify that small miners do have a right to simple \ndue process to be able to have a chance to file their small miner \nwaiver applications in the event of mistakes in processing, rather than \nimmediately lose their rights to patented mining claims without \neffective appeal or recourse. I appreciate that the Justice Department \nand BLM Jan. 22, 2013 reinstated claims owned by Alaskans Don and Judy \nMullikins of Nome, finally reversing a decision that they should lose \ntheir claims following a 2009 application filing incident. But the \nlegal expense, bother and uncertainty that the Mullikins went through \nin getting their claims reinstated are clear reasons why Congress \nshould clarify past changes to the small miner waiver provision and \npermit claims to be retained in the event of clerical errors or honest \nmistakes by claim holders in missing the deadline for filings. Such a \nchange would simply provide justice for small miners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Paul, Mr. \n        Risch, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Burr, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. \n        Boozman, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Corker, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Coburn, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \n        Moran, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cruz, and Mr. Cornyn):\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\n  S. 369. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ntaking minors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the \ninvolvement of parents in abortion decisions; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to stand with my friend from \nFlorida, Senator Rubio, as he introduces an important piece of \nlegislation, the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act. This bill, \nwhich is being introduced in the House by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of \nFlorida, is based on the belief that children should not make profound \nlife-changing decisions by themselves and that parents are generally in \nthe best and most responsible position to help them.\n  One of the many disturbing ironies in the abortion debate is that \nparental consent is needed for such things as tattoos or school \nfieldtrips but not always for abortions that will end one life and \nchange another forever. Abortion advocates say that abortion should be \ntreated as any other surgical procedure many of them oppose doing so \nwhen it comes to parental consent.\n  What is worse, there are individuals and organizations out there who \nappear to care more about money than about kids. They are willing to \nhelp young girls get abortions by any means necessary, including taking \nthem to other States without the knowledge or consent of their parents. \nMind you, those same parents will be responsible for the aftermath, for \nthe physical, emotional, and spiritual consequences of the abortion. If \nparents are to be responsible at the end, they have the right to be \nthere at the beginning.\n  If it were possible, just for a moment, to take the abortion politics \nout of the picture, every parent knows that kids have to develop over \ntime the judgment and maturity to make decisions. No one is more \ncommitted to them, no one has more love for them, no one has more \nresponsibility for them than their parents.\n  This bill has two parts. First, it prohibits taking a minor across \nstate lines for an abortion if doing so evades the parental involvement \nlaw in her home State. In the 109th Congress, this portion of our bill \npassed the Senate with 65 bipartisan votes. More than 80 percent of our \nfellow Americans support it. Second, this bill requires abortionists to \nnotify parents of an out-of-state minor before performing an abortion. \nWithout this common sense requirement, abortion providers and advocates \nactually advertise how minors in states that require parental \ninvolvement can get abortions elsewhere. This perverse practice \nundermines parents and puts young girls at greater risk. Fifty-seven \nSenators of both parties, including 23 still serving in this body \ntoday, voted for cloture on this combined bill in 2006.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the bill. It does not apply when an \nabortion is necessary to save a girl's life or if the girl is a victim \nof abuse or neglect. Again, please read the bill. It is carefully \ndrafted with the appropriate exceptions and safeguards in order to \nfocus on what unites the vast majority of Americans, that parents \nshould be involved before their child has an abortion. The majority of \nstates have laws requiring parental involvement and, with its \ninterstate component, this bill is a legitimate and constitutional way \nfor Congress to help protect children and support parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 370. A bill to improve and expand geographic literacy among \nkindergarten through grade 12 students in the United States by \nimproving professional development programs for kindergarten through \ngrade 12 teachers offered through institutions of higher education; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act. I am pleased to be joined by my friend \nfrom Maryland, Ms. Mikulski. The purpose of this bill is to improve \ngeographic literacy among K-12 students in the United States by \nsupporting professional development programs administered by \ninstitutions of higher education for K-12 teachers. The bill also \nassists states in measuring the impact of geography education.\n  Ensuring geographic literacy prepares students to be good citizens of \nboth our nation and the world. John Fahey, Chairman and CEO of the \nNational Geographic Society, once stated that, ``Geographic illiteracy \nimpacts our economic well-being, our relationships with other nations \nand the environment, and isolates us from the world.'' When students \nunderstand their own environment, they can better understand the \ndifferences in other places and the people who live in them. Knowledge \nof the diverse cultures, environments, and distances between states and \ncountries helps our students to understand national and international \npolicies, economies, societies and political structures on a global \nscale.\n  To expect that Americans will be able to work successfully with other \npeople around the world, we need to be able to communicate and \nunderstand each other. It is a fact that we have a global marketplace, \nand we need to be preparing our younger generation for competition in \nthe international economy. A strong base of geographic knowledge \nimproves these opportunities.\n  In a report prepared for leading Internet company, Google, the study \nestimated that geography service industries generate up to $270 billion \nevery year. Geographic knowledge is increasingly needed for U.S. \nbusinesses in electronic mapping, satellite imagery, and location-based \nnavigation to understand such factors as physical distance, time zones, \nlanguage differences and cultural diversity among project teams.\n  Additionally, geospatial technology is an emerging career field \navailable to people with an extensive background in geography \neducation. Professionals in geospatial technology are employed in \nfederal government agencies, the private sector and the non-profit \nsector and focus on areas such as agriculture, archeology, ecology, \nland appraisal and urban planning and development. It is important to \nimprove and expand geography education so that students in the United \nStates can attain the necessary expertise to fill and retain the \nestimated 70,000 new skilled jobs that are becoming available each year \nin the geospatial technology industry.\n  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell once said, ``To solve most of \nthe major problems facing our country today--from wiping out terrorism, \nto minimizing global environmental problems, to eliminating the scourge \nof AIDS--will require every young person to learn more about other \nregions, cultures, and languages.'' We need to do more to ensure that \nthe teachers responsible for the education of our students, from \nkindergarten through high school graduation, are trained and prepared \nto teach the critical skills necessary to solve these problems.\n  Over the last 15 years, the National Geographic Society has awarded \nmore than $100 million in grants to educators, universities, geography \nalliances, and others for the purposes of advancing and improving the \nteaching of geography. Their models are successful, and research shows \nthat students who have benefited from this teaching outperform other \nstudents. State geography alliances exist in 26 States and the District \nof Columbia, endowed by grants from the Society. But, their efforts \nalone are not enough.\n  In my home State of Mississippi, teachers and university professors \nare making progress to increase geography education in schools through \nadditional professional training. Based at the University of \nMississippi, hundreds of geography teachers are members of the \nMississippi Geography Alliance. The Mississippi Geography Alliance \nconducts regular workshops for graduate and undergraduate students who \nare preparing to be certified to teach elementary through high school-\nlevel geography in our State. These workshops have provided \nopportunities for model teaching sessions and discussion of best \npractices in the classroom.\n  The bill I am introducing establishes a Federal commitment to enhance \nthe education of our teachers, focuses on geography education research, \nand develops reliable, advanced technology based classroom materials. I \nhope the Senate will consider the seriousness of the need to invest in \ngeography, and I invite other Senators to cosponsor the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act.\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Warren, and Mr. \n        Cowan):\n  S. 371. A bill to establish the Blackstone River Valley National \nHistorical Park, to dedicate the Park to John H. Chafee, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation with my \ncolleagues Senators Whitehouse, Warren, and Cowan that would create the \nBlackstone River Valley National Historical Park. Our legislation seeks \nto preserve the industrial, natural, and cultural heritage of the \nBlackstone Valley, assist local communities by providing economic \ndevelopment opportunities, and build upon the foundation of the John H. \nChafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor.\n  In 1793, Samuel Slater began the American Industrial Revolution in \nRhode Island when he built his historic mill along the Blackstone \nRiver. Today, the mills and villages found throughout the John H. \nChafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor in Rhode \nIsland and Massachusetts stand as witnesses to this important era of \nAmerican history.\n  Not only is the Blackstone Valley a window to our nation's past but \nit is also includes thousands of acres of pristine, undeveloped land \nand waterways that are home to a diverse ecosystem.\n  The combined efforts of the National Park Service and Federal, State, \nand local officials in our or two states, along with dedicated \nvolunteers, have rejuvenated the communities within the Corridor and \nrenewed interest in the rich history of the Blackstone River and \nvalley. This kind of economic and environmental revitalization is \nindicative of the tradition of the valley in its successful reinvention \nover the past two centuries.\n  For example, the Ashton Mill in Cumberland is an excellent \nillustration of local redevelopment. With the designation of the \nNational Heritage Corridor, the cleanup of the river, the creation of \nthe state park, and the construction of the Blackstone River Bikeway, \nthe property was restored for adaptive reuse as rental apartments. Once \nagain, the mill and its village are a vital part of the greater \nBlackstone valley community.\n  I have been pleased over the years to help support the preservation \nand renewed development of the Blackstone River Valley.\n  In 2005, I cosponsored legislation with former Senator Lincoln \nChafee, now our State's governor, requiring the completion of a Special \nResource Study to determine which areas within the Corridor were of \nnational significance and possibly suitable for inclusion in the \nNational Park System. After extensive input from local stakeholders and \nhistorians, in 2011 the completed study recommended the creation of a \nnew unit of the National Park System.\n  The legislation I am reintroducing today with my colleagues from \nRhode Island and Massachusetts seeks to establish the two-state \npartnership park described in the study, with sites including the \nBlackstone River and its tributaries, the Blackstone Canal, the \nhistoric district of Old Slater Mill in Pawtucket, the villages of \nSlatersville and Ashton in Rhode Island, the villages of Whitinsville \nand Hopedale in Massachusetts, and the Blackstone River State Park. The \nNational Park Service would partner with the local coordinating entity \nof the surrounding Heritage Corridor, the Blackstone River Valley \nNational Heritage Corridor, Inc. That non-profit would then lead \nefforts with other regional and local groups to preserve the \nsurrounding rural and agriculture landscape within the greater \nBlackstone River Valley.\n  Creating a national historic park will enable us to safeguard our \ncultural heritage for future generations; improve the use and enjoyment \nof the area's resources, including outdoor education for young people; \nenhance opportunities for economic development; and increase protection \nof the most important and nationally significant cultural and natural \nresources of the Blackstone River Valley.\n  I am proud that this park would be dedicated to my late colleague \nJohn H. Chafee, who worked tirelessly for many years, along with others \nin Rhode Island and Massachusetts, to protect and preserve the \nBlackstone River Valley.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation \nto establish the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/14/senate-section/article/S787-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 35--CONGRATULATING THE BALTIMORE RAVENS FOR WINNING \n                            SUPER BOWL XLVII\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 35, which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 35) congratulating the Baltimore \n     Ravens for winning Super Bowl XLVII.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we take this time in order to acknowledge \nthe extraordinary accomplishments of the Baltimore Ravens and their \nvictory in Super Bowl XLVII as well as to honor the players, coaches, \nstaff, and loyal fans who helped to secure the Ravens' second Lombardi \ntrophy in the last 12 years as the best team in the National Football \nLeague.\n  I have been a Baltimore football fan for as long as I can remember, \nfrom the days of the Baltimore Colts and Johnny Unitas, Alan Ameche, \nand Lenny Moore. I am so proud of this team. This team has guts. No one \npredicted them to win the Super Bowl--no one. At one point no one \nexpected them to even get into the playoffs. They not only made the \nplayoffs but they won in spectacular fashion. They looked after each \nother, and they worked hard.\n  Coach Harbaugh brought the team together. Ray Lewis, in his last \nseason, motivated the team. We had players who were injured during the \ncourse of the season who came back to play in the playoffs. The team \nrepresented Baltimore so well and I think represented the best in \nfootball. They not only gave our city and our football fans the \nopportunity to come together, I was very much impressed how Baltimore \nchanged during Super Bowl week. Our city was so proud of our team and \nso proud of the manner in which they conducted themselves on and off \nthe field. They gave back to the community in so many different ways. \nThey helped young people. They helped develop healthy lifestyles. They \nhave been role models.\n  This Super Bowl will be remembered for a long time to come. I think \nin the first half we thought it was going to be a runaway game, but the \nBaltimore Ravens have a way to make sure they keep TV ratings high. It \ngot a little more suspenseful, particularly when we had the blackout in \nthe third-quarter, but in the end the Baltimore Ravens prevailed and \nBaltimore is the championship city.\n  We are so proud of the accomplishments of our team. Whether we are \ntalking about the comeback of Ray Lewis or Terrell Suggs from a \ndevastating injury or Ray Rice's fourth and 29 scramble to keep our \nplayoff hopes alive, it is clear that the Ravens were the most \ndetermined team in the National Football League.\n  Unflappable Joe Flacco has established himself as a leader and one of \nthe preeminent quarterbacks in the league. His Most Valuable Player \nperformance in the Super Bowl was a fitting capstone on an MVP season \nand should prove once and for all ``Joe Cool'' has what it takes.\n  It has been thrilling to watch the Ravens this year, to say the \nleast. In a season during which the team clawed and ``cawed'' its way \nto some close victories, the Super Bowl was a fitting end. The Ravens \ncame into New Orleans as the underdogs against incredible odds, and \nthey prevailed as the world champions.\n  I applaud the team, the coaches, the managers, the owner, and all who \nwere involved for giving not just Baltimore but for giving football a \nteam everyone can admire.\n  I also want to acknowledge the gracious way in which our colleagues \nfrom California have handled the results of the Super Bowl. The 49ers \nare a great team. They played a great game and had a great season. \nBaltimore and San Francisco share a lot. We share great football and we \nshare a bay. We call our bay the Chesapeake Bay and they call theirs \nthe San Francisco Bay. We share great seafood, and we share a love for \nthe sport of football.\n  I thank them for their graciousness, and I thank all involved for a \ngreat season for the Baltimore Ravens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I join with Senator Cardin as a fellow \njock to support the resolution commending the Baltimore Ravens. What a \ngreat season we have had. It was thrilling; it was exciting. I have \nbeen a Ravens fan since they came to Baltimore, and I was originally a \nColts fan.\n  I was a little girl when the National Football League came to \nBaltimore. It was the Baltimore Colts. They even had a telethon to buy \ntickets. Just imagine, we could buy season tickets to the Baltimore \nColts for $15. One of the first things I did when I graduated from \ncollege and had my own money was to go in with my Uncle Fred to be able \nto have tickets to go to the Colts games at Memorial Stadium.\n  I remember watching TV when we had that famous game with New York and \nJohnny Unitas tossed that winning touchdown to Lenny Moore and won 10 \nseconds before the game was over. I didn't think football could ever be \nthat exciting again. But then came this Ravens season just roaring to \nthe finish. There they were playing the Broncos in Denver, the mile-\nhigh city. Senator Udall really razzed and did some pretty uppity trash \ntalk. But we, with our usual pride and gentility, weathered the storm.\n  I could not believe it. I thought the game was over. I was ready to \nkick back and call my sister when, oh, wow, there goes Flacco with that \n70-yard toss, and it was a touchdown. Even though I am short and \nchunky, I was ready to do cartwheels around my condo that evening.\n  The team went on to deal with the New England Patriots and then all \nthe way to the Super Bowl. We were out there winning again when all of \na sudden the lights went out in New Orleans. Even though they went out \nfor 38 minutes in New Orleans, the lights were on all over Baltimore \nand we were purple. We were purple with pride and purple with joy. We \nwere so pleased that they brought us victory not only on the playing \nfields of the National Football League, but do you know what else they \ndid? They created a sense of community and a sense of energy.\n  If you came with me to one of our great major league institutions, \nsuch\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\nas Johns-Hopkins or the University of Maryland, you would see that we \nare shoulder to shoulder with Nobel prize winners who are working in \nour institutions. The facility managers, nurses, and even the patients \nhad on their purple ties or purple shirts. We were united. It was a \nsense of community, and it was a sense of pride.\n  What is it that we liked? Because we did our best. We were the \nunderdog team. Some of the national sports writers would often look \ndown their nose at the football players. We don't carry a chip on our \nshoulder, we carry the football across the goal line. That is the way \nBaltimore is. We are gritty, we are strong, and we will fight and take \nit all the way to the end.\n  So I want to congratulate the Ravens for creating a sense of energy, \ncreating a sense of community, and, yes, winning the Super Bowl. They \nwere champs, but really what they created was not only champions of the \nSuper Bowl, they were champions on their way to victory to create this \nsense of community.\n  Also, a special acknowledgment to Ray Lewis. Ray Lewis has had a \ntough life. It has been hard-scrapple and hard-tackle for him. He has \nfaced some life challenges and has had some dark moments. Out of that, \nhe has reclaimed his life, and in the process of reclaiming his life \nand giving essentially all honor to God, he has then gone on to work \nwith other football players and people in our community about how you \nget your life together, how you hold your life together, and how you \nare a winner both on and off the field.\n  So I wish to congratulate the Ravens. We are really proud of them. We \nare glad they won the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in 11 years.\n  I have a purple coat that I bought for the first Super Bowl.
